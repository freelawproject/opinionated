ELDRIDGE (Retired, Specially Assigned), J.</author>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">This is an action under the judicial review section of the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to review a reprimand and fine, imposed on a licensed physician by the Maryland State Board of Physicians, based upon the Board\u2019s conclusion that the physician had failed to cooperate with a lawful investigation conducted by the Board.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The basis for the Board\u2019s conclusion was the failure by the physician, respondent Dr. Harold I. Eist, to obey, timely, a subpoena for the production of certain patients\u2019 medical records in his possession. The Circuit Court for Montgomery County reversed the Board\u2019s decision, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. The intermediate appellate court held that the Board was not entitled to the records and that, therefore, Dr. Eist did not fail to cooperate with a lawful investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>We shall hold that, because neither Dr. Eist nor the patients took any appropriate action to challenge the subpoena, such as filing in the Circuit Court a motion to quash or a motion for a protective order, as required by the applicable statutes, and because Dr. Eist clearly failed to comply with the subpoena in a timely manner, the Board\u2019s decision was legally correct. Consequently, we shall reverse the judgments of both courts below and direct that the Board\u2019s decision be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In a letter dated February 19, 2001, the petitioner, the Maryland State Board of Physicians, received a complaint from the estranged husband of a patient of Dr. Harold I. Eist. Dr. Eist, a psychiatrist licensed to practice medicine in Maryland, had practiced for thirty-seven years at the time the complaint was filed. The complaint alleged that Dr. Eist had \u201cover-medicated my wife and my sons\u201d and detailed an incident in which Dr. Eist had \u201cstarted calling [the complainant] a liar and yelling at [the complainant].\u201d The letter further alleged that Dr. Eist had \u201clost any ability to practice medicine in a truly objective and professional manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">On March 15, 2001, Harold Rose, a \u201cCompliance Analyst\u201d for the Board, wrote to Dr. Eist, notifying him that a complaint had been filed against him and attaching a copy of the complaint. The Board requested a written response within 21 days, and asked Dr. Eist to indicate whether his response could be released to the complainant. Along with the letter, the Board issued a subpoena duces tecum which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMW\">\u201cPursuant to Sections 14-206(a) and 14-401(g) of the Health Occupation^] Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, YOU ARE HEREBY SUMMONED and COMMANDED by the BOARD OF PHYSICIAN QUALITY ASSURANCE OF MARYLAND to deliver IMMEDIATELY UPON SERVICE OF PROCESS a copy of all medical records of patients [names the wife and two sons of the complainant] treated at your facility; which materials are in your custody, possession or control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>\u201cAnd by virtue of <em>the </em>authority of the said BOARD OF PHYSICIAN QUALITY ASSURANCE, such information is thereby made returnable within 10(ten) days----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">\u201cFOR FAILURE TO OBEY this summons on petition of the Board a court of competent jurisdiction may punish the person as for contempt of court, pursuant to the provisions of the Health Occupations Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland Section 14-206(b).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The letter to Dr. Eist from the Board and the subpoena were dated March 15, 2001, but they were delivered to the wrong address. The same letter and subpoena were dispatched again by the Board on April 18, 2001, and were received by Dr. Eist on April 19, 2001. The Board agreed that the subpoenaed records were due ten days from April 19, 2001, the date when Dr. Eist actually received the subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Dr. Eist responded to the Board on April 20, 2001. His letter informed the Board that the complainant was not one of his patients, and that Dr. Eist had treated only the complainant\u2019s \u201cestranged wife and, at times, three of their children.\u201d Dr. Eist reasoned that the complaint might have been motivated by the complainant\u2019s \u201cbitterly contested\u201d divorce litigation with Dr. Eist\u2019s patient, in which Dr. Eist had been called as a witness \u201cconcerning the children of the marriage.\u201d Dr. Eist stated to the Board as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">\u201cI am not certain what I will be asked to respond to in the course of your investigation, nor what information received in confidence from [my patients] might come into the record. It is my belief that they are required to be notified of this matter and any request for information which you might make of me concerning their treatment and their confidential communications to me. I will be pleased to cooperate fully with any investigator with the consent of the patients (including any guardian necessary to waive the children\u2019s privilege), or, if the patients object and take steps to protect their communications with any appropriate decision overruling their objections and requiring that I furnish the information. At this point, they have not filed a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>plaint nor in any other way consented to release of information to BPQA so far as I know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">On May 1, 2001, Dr. Eist forwarded a copy of the subpoena to his patient, the wife of the complainant, and requested that she inform him \u201cas soon as you can, whether you, or your attorney, are taking any action to oppose my compliance with this subpoena.\u201d Dr. Eist concluded his letter by stating that, if he had not heard from her \u201cwithin one week, I will forward the records to the Board.\u201d Dr. Eist sent a copy of this letter to Mr. Rose of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">On May 4, 2001, Dr. Eist received a copy of a report filed by the children\u2019s court-appointed attorney. The report, filed with the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, stated that the court-appointed attorney refused to waive the \u201cprivilege\u201d that existed between the children of the complainant and Dr. Eist, or \u201cany mental health professional.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Eist sent this report to the Board, along with a letter in which he set forth a transcription of a telephone message which he had received from his patient, the wife of the complainant. In her message, his patient stated: \u201cI refuse to allow you to release my medical record to the medical board.\u201d Additionally, his patient\u2019s attorney sent a letter, dated May 14, 2001, to Mr. Rose of the Board, noting that the patient \u201cdoes not waive her privilege with Dr. Eist and has asked that he not release her records in response to the request.\u201d The letter went on to state that the patient wanted the Board to know that \u201cshe has absolutely no complaints about Dr. Eist\u201d and that \u201che has always conducted himself in a professional manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The Board responded to Dr. Eist in a letter dated June 27, 2001, from Frank Bubczyk, another \u201cCompliance Analyst\u201d with the Board. The letter informed Dr. Eist that, based on the complaint received, the Board had opened an investigation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The letter also included another request for the medical records covered by the subpoena. Moreover, the letter informed Dr. Eist that, \u201c[f]or your information, receipt of those medical records is not contingent on the consent of the patient/s.\u201d The letter cautioned Dr. Eist that failure to produce the requested records \u201cmay be grounds for disciplinary action pursuant to Md.Code Ann. Health Oce. \u00a7 14-404(a)(33) for fail[ure] to cooperate with a lawful investigation conducted by the Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">On July 11, 2001, Dr. Eist\u2019s attorney sent to the Board a letter stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">\u201cDr. Eist is under the impression that he does not have his patients\u2019 permission to reveal their confidences, and that no court has weighed the necessity for violating their confidences based upon the unsupported allegations of someone with a clear conflict of interest, and a desire to violate those confidences.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The letter reiterated that \u201cDr. Eist does not dispute the authority of the [Board] to examine these matters,\u201d and if a court agreed that the records could be examined, \u201cDr. Eist certainly will comply.\u201d The letter also discussed the patients\u2019 privacy interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">In a subsequent letter to the Board dated July 16, 2001, Dr. Eist detailed his relationship with the complainant, informed the Board that the complainant \u201chas never been my patient,\u201d and stated that the complainant \u201cis either confused or outright dishonest in his assertions.\u201d Dr. Eist also submitted to the Board supplemental documents concerning his relationship with the complainant and a letter from the complainant\u2019s wife praising the care that she and her children had received from Dr. Eist.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">During the entire process, neither Dr. Eist nor his patients instituted any judicial proceedings to quash the subpoena issued by the Board or to obtain a protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">On December 19, 2001, the Board voted to charge Dr. Eist with a violation under Maryland Code (1981, 2009 Repl.Vol.), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>\u00a7 14-404(a)(33) of the Health Occupations Article. That provision authorizes the Board to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-4\">\u201creprimand any licensee, place any licensee on probation, or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee: * * * (33) Fails to cooperate with a lawful investigation conducted by the Board . ...\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">The charge was officially issued by the Board on February 4, 2002. The February 4, 2002, document stated that a \u201cresolution conference\u201d had been scheduled for April 3, 2002, at the Board\u2019s Office, and a \u201cprehearing conference in this matter\u201d had been scheduled for June 6, 2002, in the Office of Administrative Hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">After the Board had formally instituted charges against Dr. Eist, he again wrote to his patient\u2019s attorney informing the attorney that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">\u201cto try and bring this matter to a close, we are hereby giving you and your client notice that unless we hear from you within one week that (1) as a result of your efforts, the Board has ceased to ask for these documents; (2) you have obtained a court order enjoining Dr. Eist from sending the documents to the [Board]; or (3) an action has been filed seeking such an injunction, but notwithstanding good faith efforts, it has not been completed, Dr. Eist intends to make your client\u2019s entire file available to the [Board].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">A similar message was given to the representative of the children. None of the parties responded to these requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">Dr. Eist turned over the patients\u2019 records to the Board on March 20, 2002. Dr. Eist\u2019s attorney wrote to both the Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the \u201cCompliance Analyst\u201d for the Board, stating that, in turning over the records, \u201cwe do not concede <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>that Dr. Eist in any way refused in the past to cooperate with an \u2018investigation.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">On October 31, 2002, the Board forwarded the files, including the original complaint and the patient records produced by Dr. Eist, to the Maryland Psychiatric Society\u2019s Peer Review Committee. Dr. Eist appeared before the Peer Review Committee on August 26, 2003. The report of the Maryland Psychiatric Society Peer Review Committee, dated November 30, 2003, ultimately determined that Dr. Eist had \u201cprescribed medications appropriately\u201d and that there was \u201cno evidence that he over prescribed any medication or induced psychotic symptoms.\u201d The Committee also found that Dr. Eist \u201cbehaved in a professional manner\u201d when interacting with the complainant and that there had been \u201cno breach in any applicable standard of care in his treatment or conduct with the patients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">On December 1, 2003, the Board received the report of the Peer Review Committee, and, on February 5, 2004, the Board decided not to charge Dr. Eist based on the complaint of the patient\u2019s estranged husband. The husband\u2019s complaint was dismissed. Nevertheless, the Board pointed out that the matter \u201cof failing to cooperate with a lawful investigation conducted by the Board ... remains open.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">While the above-reviewed events were taking place, the Board\u2019s charge, that Dr. Eist failed to cooperate with a lawful investigation by the Board, was being processed by the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings. Numerous motions, memoranda and exhibits were filed -with that Office, by both sides, between February 4, 2002, and July 15, 2002. A hearing took place before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) of the Office of Administrative Hearings on July 15, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Both sides agreed that there were no disputes as to the material facts, and both sides filed motions for summary decision pursuant to COMAR 28.02.01.12D.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On August 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>2002, the ALJ issued a recommended decision in favor of Dr. Eist. The ALJ initially held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">\u201cthe Board\u2019s right to obtain the mental health records of patients or confidential information regarding the treatment of a mental health patient is not absolute where the patient objects to the disclosure of that information. Any request for a subpoena for mental health records where an objection has been raised by the holder of that privilege should be subject to the scrutiny of an independent factfinder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The ALJ indicated that the \u201cindependent factfinder\u201d with regard to the patient\u2019s assertion of privilege should be a judge, that the Board had the obligation of seeking judicial enforcement of the subpoena, and that \u201cthe Board\u2019s failure to seek enforcement of the subpoena does not place the onus of seeking judicial intervention on the Respondent [Dr. Eist].\u201d The ALJ concluded \u201cthat the Respondent followed the only ethical course of action available to him under the circumstances\u201d and that the \u201cRespondent did not fail to cooperate; rather he attempted to cooperate while preserving the integrity of the confidential relationship with his patients.\u201d The ALJ granted the Respondent\u2019s Motion for Summary Decision, denied the Board\u2019s Motion for Summary Decision, and recommended that the charges be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>The \u201cAdministrative Prosecutor\u201d filed with the Board exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s recommended decision. After a hearing before the Board, the Board on January 28, 2003, rejected the ALJ\u2019s recommended decision and found that Dr. Eist had failed to cooperate with a lawful investigation. In a fourteen page opinion, the Board reviewed the undisputed facts as well as the applicable law. The Board pointed out that the plain wording of the applicable statute requires a health care provider, in accordance with a subpoena, to disclose to the Board a particular patient\u2019s medical records, regardless of the patient\u2019s consent, for purpose of an investigation into the alleged improper practice of a health professional. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (2000, 2009 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 4-306 and 4-307(k)(l)(v)(l) of the Health-General Article. The Board recognized the role of a court, in ruling upon a motion to quash or a motion for a protective order, to weigh a patient\u2019s constitutional privacy interests in the records against the Board\u2019s need for the records. The Board, however, disagreed with the ALJ\u2019s view that \u201cthe Board must petition a court in each and every instance\u201d a subpoena is issued. According to the Board, the \u201cparty who wishes to present a constitutional claim has the burden of presenting it to a court.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Board issued a final order reprimanding Dr. Eist and imposing a $5,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Dr. Eist filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County an action for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision reprimanding him and imposing a $5,000 fine.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>arguments from the parties, the Circuit Court issued an oral ruling in which the court determined that, although the Board was entitled to sanction Dr. Eist, the Board had made an error of law. The Circuit Court stated that it agreed with the Board that, \u201c[w]hen dealing with a party, [the statute] does not require the Board to seek intervention of the court before the subpoena can be enforced\u201d and that \u201cthe party fails to respond to the subpoena at its own risk if they fail to file a motion to quash and/or a motion for a protective order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Au0\">The Circuit Court went on to point out that \u201ca patient\u2019s right to privacy\u201d may be \u201coutweighed by a board\u2019s need for information when conducting a lawful investigation under its statutory authority.\u201d The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-4\">\u201cThe doctor has the right under the statute ... to file a motion to quash or a motion for a protective order, as does the party. Further, the doctor ... would have the right to do neither, but then the doctor accepts the risk that if it is later determined that the subpoena was lawful ... of perhaps being sanctioned for his failure to turn over those records.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Turning to the applicable statute,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Circuit Court acknowledged that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>\u201cthe statute imposes the burden of asserting that [privacy] right on the doctor or the patient. The statute does not require the Board, even when faced with an objection, to go to the court and seek intervention of the court to enforce the subpoena. Rather, the statute requires that the party who seeks to assert the right of privacy apply to the court and seek the intervention of the court. And that the statute is not constitutionally infirm by virtue of placing that obligation on the party asserting the right, and because the statute nevertheless ensures to the party with the privacy interest an ability to seek the intervention of the court to protect that right, that the statute is not constitutionally infirm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Nevertheless, the Circuit Court found that an \u201cerror of law\u201d was committed in the administrative proceedings. The court found that, because the ALJ had decided the case on cross motions for summary decisions, the record had not been sufficiently developed to decide whether there would be a violation of the statute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">\u201cif a doctor fails to cooperate because of ... a good faith and reasonable belief that [he] had the right to withhold the documents, particularly upon the advice of counsel, as it appears that the doctor acted in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The court remanded the case to the Board for the Board to decide whether Dr. Eist acted \u201creasonably and in good faith.\u201d The Circuit Court also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">\u201cIf, upon an analysis by the administrative law judge, they found in this particular instance that * * * the Board\u2019s interest did not outweigh the privacy interests of the individual patients * * * [then,] in this instance, those subpoenas were not lawful.... In which case, then [Dr. Eist] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>would not have been in violation of [the statute] because he didn\u2019t fail to respond to a lawful subpoena.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">On remand, the Board again referred the case to an ALJ for an evidentiary hearing on the issues set forth in the Circuit Court\u2019s remand order. After hearing from several witnesses and developing an extensive record, the ALJ again decided the matter in Dr. Eist\u2019s favor. The ALJ determined that the subpoena was not lawfully issued because the Board had failed to correctly weigh the patients\u2019 privacy rights against the Board\u2019s interest in obtaining their records. The ALJ also found that Dr. Eist had acted in good faith because he relied upon the advice of counsel. Based on these determinations, the ALJ concluded that Dr. Eist had not violated \u00a7 14-404(a)(33) of the Health Occupations Article. The ALJ\u2019s Proposed Decision recommended that the charges against Dr. Eist be dismissed. The Administrative Prosecutor again filed exceptions to the Proposed Decision of the ALJ. After a hearing, the Board declined to adopt the Proposed Decision and instead issued a Final Decision sanctioning Dr. Eist with a reprimand and a fine of $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The present action for judicial review was then filed in the Circuit Court. The court, in a brief order, reversed the Board\u2019s decision and ordered the Board to dismiss the charges against Dr. Eist. The Board appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and that court, in an extensive opinion, affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>Board of Physicians v. Eist, </em>176 Md.App. 82, 932 A.2d 783 (2007). The Court of Special Appeals, like the ALJ but contrary to the first circuit court decision, held that \u201cthe burden [was] on the Board to obtain a ruling from a court on the [patients\u2019] privacy issue\u201d with respect to the subpoenaed records. <em>Board of Physicians v. Eist, supra, </em>176 Md.App. at 135, 932 A.2d at 814. The intermediate appellate court further held that, until the Board does obtain a judicial ruling (176 Md.App. at 134, 932 A.2d at 814),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">\u201cso long as a doctor is acting in good faith in withholding the subpoenaed records until the patient withdraws his privacy right objection or a governmental interest/privacy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>interest weighing assessment is made by a court, the physician is not failing to cooperate with a lawful investigation of the Board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">At other places in its opinion, however, the Court of Special Appeals seemed to view the \u201cgovernmental interest/privaey interest\u201d issue as one which could properly be resolved in this judicial review action, and the intermediate appellate court held (176 Md.App. at 120, 932 A.2d at 805-806):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">\u201c[T]he agency record leads us to conclude that, when the Subpoena was issued, and until the patients\u2019 withdrew their privacy right assertion, the Board\u2019s governmental interest in obtaining Dr. Eist\u2019s psychiatric records of [the] Patients ... was not a compelling interest that outweighed the patients\u2019 privacy interests in those records.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In the final paragraph of its opinion, the Court of Special Appeals concluded as follows (176 Md.App. at 135, 932 A.2d at 814-815):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">\u201cOn the facts found by the Board, as supported by substantial evidence in the agency record, the Board\u2019s interest in obtaining the patients\u2019 psychiatric records to investigate the standard of care allegation leveled by Mr. S against Dr. Eist did not outweigh the patients\u2019 privacy interests in those highly personal records. Had either the Board, Dr. Eist, or the patients sought court intervention in the period of time soon after the Subpoena was issued, the proper ruling by the court would have been that the Board was not entitled to the records in question because disclosing them would violate the patients\u2019 constitutional rights. Accordingly, Dr. Eist did not, as a matter of law, fail to cooperate with a lawful investigation of the Board by not furnishing the patients\u2019 psychiatric records to the Board, in response to the Subpoena, until the patients withdrew their privacy objection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The Board filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari which was granted. <em>Board of Physicians v. Eist, </em>402 Md. 355, 936 A.2d 852 (2007). Dr. Eist did not file a cross-petition for a writ of certiorari. The Board\u2019s petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>presented the following two questions (citations to the Maryland Code omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-4\">\u201c1. Where, as part of its investigation of a complaint alleging that a physician\u2019s psychiatric treatment was endangering patients, a professional licensing and disciplinary board issued a subpoena to the physician for patients\u2019 mental health treatment records and neither the physician nor the patients moved to quash the subpoena or to obtain a protective order on constitutional or other grounds, did the physician\u2019s refusal to disclose the subpoenaed records constitute a failure to cooperate with a lawful investigation conducted by the Board under the terms of the Medical Practice Act....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">\u201c2. Did the Court of Special Appeals commit reversible error by reversing an administrative agency decision supported by substantial evidence, failing to defer to the agency\u2019s authority as fact finder to draw inferences from the evidence, substituting its judgment for the agency\u2019s expertise, and imposing upon the agency novel legal burdens as obstacles to the exercise of its statutory authority to investigate and discipline physicians?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">We shall answer the first question in the affirmative. Therefore, we need not, and shall not, reach the second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">A major premise underlying the recommended decisions of the ALJ and the decision of the Court of Special Appeals is that the Board bears the burden of instituting a judicial proceeding to enforce the subpoena. At such proceeding, a court would weigh the patients\u2019 privacy interests in the subpoenaed records against the Board\u2019s need for those records. The Court of Special Appeals held that, in the absence of a judicial proceeding to enforce the subpoena, Dr. Eist, acting in good faith, could not be guilty of failing to cooperate with the Board\u2019s investigation. The intermediate appellate court also seemed to hold that the issue of weighing the Board\u2019s need for the records against the patients\u2019 privacy rights could properly be reached in the present administrative/judicial review action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>and that, on this record, the patients\u2019 privacy rights outweighed the Board\u2019s need. Consequently, according to the Court of Special Appeals, Dr. Eist did not fail to cooperate by refusing to turn over the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The premise, that the Board had the burden of instituting a judicial action to enforce the subpoena, is inconsistent with the applicable statutes and is not supported by the Maryland cases relied on by the ALJ and the Court of Special Appeals. Moreover, the issue of weighing the patients\u2019 privacy rights against the Board\u2019s need for the records should have been resolved in an action by the patients or Dr. Eist to quash the subpoena or for a protective order. It was not an appropriate issue in the present administrative/judicial review action. In this action, the undisputed evidence showing Dr. Eist\u2019s deliberate refusal to comply with the subpoena in a timely manner clearly supported the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Turning first to the applicable statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 14-401 <em>et seq. </em>of the Health Occupations Article of the Code comprehensively authorize the Board to take disciplinary action against health care providers, to investigate allegations of conduct warranting disciplinary action, to hold hearings, etc. Section 14\u2014401(i) provides that the \u201cBoard may issue subpoenas ... in connection with any investigation.... \u201d Section 14-206(a) of the Health Occupations Article reiterates that \u201cthe Board may issue subpoenas ... in connection with any investigation under this title----\u201d As earlier noted, <em>supra </em>n. 4, \u00a7 14-404(a)(33) of the Health Occupations Article authorizes the Board to \u201creprimand any licensee, place any licensee on probation, or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee: * * * (33) Fails to cooperate with a lawful investigation conducted by the Board.\u201d Section 14-405.1 of the Health Occupations Article provides that, if the Board finds grounds to suspend or revoke a physician\u2019s license, or to reprimand a physician, the Board may also impose a fine upon the physician.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>The pertinent statutory provisions governing the confidentiality and disclosure by health care providers of medical records, including mental health medical records, are set forth in Maryland Code (2000, 2009 Repl.Vol.), Title 4, Subtitle 3, \u00a7\u00a7 4-301 through 4-309 of the Health-General Article. The basic section dealing with investigations and the disclosures of medical records \u201cwithout [the] authorization of [the] person in interest\u201d is \u00a7 4-306. That section provides in relevant part as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\">\u201c(b) ... A health care provider <em>shall disclose </em>a medical record <em>without the authorization of a person in interest.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">\u201c(2) Subject to the additional limitations for a medical record developed primarily in connection with the provision of mental health services in \u00a7 4-307 of this subtitle, <em>to health professional licensing and disciplinary boards, in accordance with a subpoena for medical records </em>for the sole purpose of an <em>investigation </em>regarding:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">(i) Licensure, certification, or discipline of a health professional; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">(ii) <em>The improper practice of a health </em>profession....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Section 4-307, concerning mental health medical records, reiterates that, in connection with a Board investigation, records must be provided to the Board regardless of a patient\u2019s authorization, and that the appropriate procedure for weighing a patient\u2019s privacy interests against the Board\u2019s need for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>records is for the patient or the health care provider to file a court action to quash the subpoena or for a protective order. Section 4-307(k)(l)(v)(l) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-4\">\u201c(1) A health care provider shall disclose a medical record without the authorization of a person in interest:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">\u201c(v) In accordance with a subpoena for medical records on specific recipients:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">1. To health professional licensing and disciplinary boards for the sole purpose of an investigation regarding licensure, certification, or discipline of a health professional or the improper practice of a health profession.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AA5\">With respect to a health care provider\u2019s or patient\u2019s remedy, \u00a7 4-307(k)(6) states (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">\u201c(6) This subsection may not preclude a health care provider, a recipient, or person in interest from asserting <em>in a motion to quash or a motion for a protective order </em>any constitutional right or other legal authority in opposition to disclosure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Thus the statute grants standing to the health care provider, as well as others opposed to disclosure, to raise the patient\u2019s constitutional rights or other grounds for nondisclosure, by filing in court a motion to quash or a motion for a protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Consequently, the above-reviewed statutory provisions make it clear that, when the Board is investigating a complaint against a health care provider and subpoenas certain medical records in his or her possession, the health care provider is required to provide the medical records to the Board regardless of the patient\u2019s authorization. Contrary to a criticism expressed by the ALJ and the Court of Special Appeals, however, neither the statutes nor the Board treat the health care provider\u2019s obligation to provide the records as an \u201cabsolute\u201d one. If the patient and/or the health care provider believe that there are grounds for not producing the records, the patient or the health care provider must file a motion to quash the subpoena or a motion for a protective order pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>ant to Maryland Rules 2-403 or 2-510. This is the route chosen by the General Assembly for the resolution of constitutional or other objections to the subpoena. The General Assembly did not provide for an action by the Board to enforce the subpoena.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Furthermore, the General Assembly did not provide that the health care provider could refuse to comply with the subpoena, fail to file a motion to quash or a motion for a protective order, and later, in a disciplinary action, defend on the ground that the patient\u2019s privacy rights were infringed by the subpoena.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The Court of Special Appeals and the ALJ, in weighing the patients\u2019 privacy rights against the Board\u2019s need for the medical records in Dr. Eist\u2019s possession, extensively relied upon this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Doe v. Maryland Board of Social </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number><em>Work Examiners, </em>384 Md. 161, 862 A.2d 996 (2004), and upon the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 earlier opinion in <em>Dr. K. v. State Board of Physician Quality Assurance, </em>98 Md.App. 103, 632 A.2d 453 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>334 Md. 18, 637 A.2d 1191, <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 817, 115 S.Ct. 75, 130 L.Ed.2d 29 (1994). The <em>Doe </em>case involved a subpoena for records of a social worker concerning two of the social worker\u2019s clients. <em>Dr. K, </em>like the present case, involved a subpoena for a psychiatrist\u2019s medical records relating to one of the psychiatrist\u2019s patients. In both of these cases, the appellate courts, <em>inter alia, </em>weighed the agencies\u2019 need for the subpoenaed records against the clients\u2019 and patient\u2019s privacy rights in the records. The Court of Appeals in <em>Doe </em>and the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Dr. K. </em>held that the agencies\u2019 need for the records outweighed the privacy interests of the clients in <em>Doe </em>and the patient in <em>Dr. K. </em>What is significant for purposes of the present case, and what was overlooked by the ALJ and the Court of Special Appeals in the present case, is that both <em>Doe </em>and <em>Dr. K. </em>were judicial actions to quash the subpoenas issued by the administrative agencies during the agencies\u2019 investigations. In both cases, the trial courts denied motions to quash the subpoenas, and these decisions were affirmed on appeal. <em>Doe </em>and <em>Dr. K. </em>were not, like the present case, actions for judicial review of final adjudicatory decisions by the administrative agencies.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Other cases in this Court illustrate that a motion to quash, or a motion for a protective order, or a motion for enforcement of the subpoena if provided for by statute, are the appropriate routes for raising challenges to administrative subpoenas. <em>See, e.g., Unnamed Attorney v.

When the General Assembly intends that a state agency issuing the subpoena should bring a court action to enforce the subpoena when there is a failure to comply, the General Assembly knows how to provide for such a procedure. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1984, 2009 Repl.

It is noteworthy that the General Assembly provided for alternative proceedings to discipline a health care provider who failed to comply with a subpoena issued by the Board. In addition to the present administrative/judicial review proceeding under \u00a7 I4-404(a)(33) of the Health Occupations Article, \u00a7 14-206(b) of the Health Occupations Article provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that if \"a person disobeys a subpoena from the Board,\u201d a court \"may punish the person as for contempt of court.\u201d <em>See also </em>\u00a7 4-309 of the Health-General Article, relating to a health care provider\u2019s refusal to disclose records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b596-6\">.

Further, there are statutory provisions protecting patient A's records from being used for any purpose other than this investigation of Dr. K. Patient A may be entitled to sue for civil damages for any unauthorized disclosure of her medical records.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b597-4\">. Even if \u00a7 4-307 of the Health-General Article had not provided that Dr. Eist\u2019s remedy was to file in the Circuit Court a motion to quash the subpoena or a motion for a protective order, the result would be the same. It is a settled principle of Maryland law that, when a tribunal having jurisdiction issues to a person an order, that person may not refuse to obey the order on the theory that it is unlawful or unwarranted and, in a later collateral proceeding such as a contempt action or other disciplinary action like the present one, defend by attacking the earlier order. Instead, that person is required to challenge the order directly, in a proceeding available for such challenges, such as a motion to quash, an appeal, etc. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Griev. Comm. v. Garland, </em>345 Md. 383, 398-399, 692 A.2d 465, 472-473 (1997); <em>Harford Co. Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Board, </em>281 Md. 574, 585-588, 380 A.2d 1041, 1048-1050 (1977); <em>Shapiro v.

There is no reason why the same principle should not be applicable to an administrative agency such as the Board, where the Legislature authorized the agency to issue a subpoena and authorized a court to punish a person, \"as for contempt of court,\u201d who disobeyed the subpoena. <em>See </em>\u00a7 14-206(b) of the Health Occupations Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">It should be pointed out that the above-discussed principle would not apply in cases involving subpoenas issued by federal grand juries or federal agencies. The reason for this is that denial of a motion to quash by a federal trial court is not appealable even though the denial of the motion terminates the proceeding in the trial court. <em>See United States v. Ryan, </em>402 U.S. 530, 91 S.Ct. 1580, 29 L.Ed.2d 85 (1971); <em>Cobbledick v. United States, </em>309 U.S. 323, 60 S.Ct. 540, 84 L.Ed. 783 (1940); <em>Alexander v. United States, </em>201 U.S. 117, 26 S.Ct. 356, 50 L.Ed. 686 (1906). If the recipient of a federal subpoena desires to continue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>challenging it after the trial court denies a motion to quash, the recipient must disobey the subpoena and challenge it in a collateral proceeding such as a contempt action. This Court, however, has consistently refused to follow the non-appealability rule adopted by the Supreme Court in <em>Alexander, Cobbledick, </em>and <em>Ryan. </em>When a Maryland trial court denies a motion to quash or a motion for a protective order, and that action terminates the proceedings in the court, the trial court's denial is appealable even though administrative proceedings, or investigative proceedings, or separate court proceedings where the recipient of the subpoena was not a party, are ongoing. <em>See, e.g., Unnamed Attorney v. Attorney Grievance Commission, </em>409 Md. 509, 513-514 n. 2, 976 A.2d 267, 270 n. 2 (2009); <em>St. Joseph Medical Center, Inc. v.

Earlier, in August of 2005, the same court ruled, from the bench, that the Board had committed an error of law when it determined, <em>inter alia, </em>that a doctor who fails to produce records in response to a Board-issued subpoena necessarily violates Maryland Code (1981, 2009 RepLVol.) \u00a7 14-404(a)(33) of the Health Occupations Article, even if he acted in good faith and in reliance upon the advice of counsel. The court then remanded the matter to the Board for a full contested case hearing before the ALJ. I would affirm the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on the grounds that Dr. Eist, in relying upon the advice of his counsel, did not fail to cooperate with a lawful investigation conducted by the Board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Dr. Eist was represented on this issue by a highly respected and competent attorney, Armin U. Kuder. It is clear from the facts that Mr. Kuder was advising Dr. Eist throughout these proceedings. Under the circumstances presented herein, and whether a doctor must file a motion to quash a subpoena or simply may decline to provide the medical records, it seems to me that a physician should be able to rely upon and follow the advice of his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">I gleaned the following facts related to this representation from the opinion of the Court of Special Appeals, which noted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">\u201cDr. Eist then called Armin U. Kuder, Esquire, for advice. Mr. Kuder told him that [the Board] was wrong and that it was essential to obtain the patients\u2019 permission before disclosing their mental health records....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">Dr. Eist did not receive [the Board\u2019s second] letter until July 7, 2001. He contacted Mr. Kuder, who on July 11 responded to [the Board] in writing. Mr. Kuder gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>background information about the Domestic Case for context, and said that Dr. Eist was preparing, and shortly would send, a written response to Mr. S\u2019s unprofessional conduct allegation. Mr. Kuder went on to say that, to the extent the Board was considering the \u2018allegations\u2019 against Dr. Eist to include Mr. S\u2019s complaint about the propriety of the treatment being rendered to Patients A, B, and C (i <em>e., </em>the standard of care allegation), \u2018Dr. Eist is under the impression that he does not have his patients\u2019 permission to reveal their confidences, and that no court has weighed the necessity for violating their confidences based upon the unsupported allegations of someone with a clear conflict of interest, and a desire to violate those confidences.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><em>Board of Physicians v. Eist, </em>176 Md.App. 82,104-06, 932 A.2d 783, 796-97 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, albeit on different grounds than that court held. I would hold that Dr. Eist relied in good faith upon the advice of his counsel and that he did not fail to cooperate with an investigation of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">I am authorized to state that Chief Judge ROBERT M. BELL and Judge DALE CATHELL join in the views expressed in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-9\">. Because the Court of Special Appeals decided the case on other grounds, i.e., that the Board was not entitled to the records, the court did not consider whether Dr. Eist acted in good faith and/or upon the advice of counsel in refusing to furnish the records in response to the subpoena.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
