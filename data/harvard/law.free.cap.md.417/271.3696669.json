Pritts, </em>291 Md. 1, 432 A.2d 1319 (1981), and running to, most recently, <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County v. Loyola College in Maryland, </em>406 Md. 54, 956 A.2d 166 (2008). We shall revisit these cases, not to reaffirm, reverse, or modify their holdings, but rather to consider the extent to which a local legislative body, in enacting amendments to its zoning ordinance, may craft those amendments so as to establish a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>different analytical template for special exception applications than was considered and discussed in those cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Montgomery County, Maryland (\u201cthe County\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Cora Weeks (\u201cWeeks\u201d) (a neighbor of the subject property that is the subject of the pertinent special exception application) (collectively \u201cAppellants\u201d) appeal from the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, which reversed the Montgomery County Board of Appeals\u2019s (\u201cthe Board\u201d) denial of Melody Butler\u2019s, d/b/a Butler Landscape Design (\u201cButler\u201d or \u201cAppellee\u201d), application for a special exception, the grant of which was necessary for Butler to validate the otherwise illegal operation of a landscape contractor\u2019s business that she established on her property without benefit of a special exception. In arguing that the Circuit Court\u2019s reversal of the Board\u2019s denial of the application was erroneous, Appellants posit that substantial evidence exists in the record to support the Board\u2019s denial, pursuant to the criteria of the relevant and prevailing zoning ordinance provisions. More specifically, Appellants argue that, considering the definition of \u201cnon-inherent adverse effects\u201d stated in \u00a7 59-G-1.2.1 of the Montgomery County Code (\u201cthe County Code\u201d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\u2014\u201cphysical and operational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>characteristics not necessarily associated with a particular use, or adverse effects created by unusual characteristics of the site\u201d\u2014the Board concluded correctly that the configuration of Butler\u2019s property and the layout of the operation of the landscaping business on the property would create unacceptable non-inherent adverse effects (essentially noise from trucks) on neighboring properties sufficient to deny the application. In response, Butler argues that, the County Code provisions notwithstanding, the proper analysis of the evidence should be confined to what the <em>Schultz </em>line of cases states about the respective roles of inherent versus non-inherent adverse effects of the proposed use and how each relates to consideration of special exception applications. In effect, Butler argues that \u00a7 59-G-1.2.1 of the County Code \u201cmust be read in context and harmony with the holding in <em>Schultz </em>... and its progeny from which it was derived,\u201d resulting in an affirmance of the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment. Truck noise, she claims, is an inherent adverse effect from a landscape contractor\u2019s business whenever proposed and, therefore, such noise does not undercut the presumption of compatibility enjoyed by a proposed special exception use by virtue of its inclusion in the comprehensive zoning plan, <em>ie., </em>the zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">We hold, as explained <em>infra, </em>that, to the extent there is any inconsistency between the special exception standards in the prevailing County Code and the reasoning and holdings of <em>Schultz </em>and its progeny, the County (\u201cDistrict Council\u201d) was free to legislate as it did here; that is, we disagree with the notion that a local zoning ordinance\u2019s treatment of special exceptions always must \u201cbe read in context and harmony with the holding in <em>Schultz,\u201d </em>and we refuse to give such ordinances this \u201cjudicial gloss\u201d when the local legislature has spoken unambiguously to the contrary. Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County and remand to that court with instructions to affirm the decision of the Board denying Butler\u2019s special exception application, which was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Melody Butler operates a landscape contracting business, under the name Butler Landscape Design, at 21020 Peach Tree Road, in Dickerson, Montgomery County, Maryland. The real property on which the business operates, which Butler owns, is a 2.68-acre lot improved with a single-family residence. The lot is in an area zoned in the \u201cRural Density Transfer\u201d zone.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Pursuant to the County Code, landscape contracting is not permitted as of right in the RDT zone, but may be allowed with the grant of a special exception. <em>See </em>Montgomery County Code, \u00a7 59-C-9.3(c) (2009). Butler established her business without obtaining the requisite special exception first. On 27 April 2006, the County\u2019s Department of Permitting Services issued Butler a Notice of Violation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Thereafter, on 30 July 2007, Butler, in an effort to correct the violation and validate her business, filed an application for a special exception to operate a landscape contractor\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">The subject property is rectangular in shape, measuring 170 feet along its sole street frontage, Peach Tree Road, as well as the rear of the lot; 682 feet along its northern side; and, 695 feet on the southern side.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The abutting lots on either side of Butler\u2019s property (the northern of which is owned by Cora Weeks), also having Peach Tree Road as their sole street access, are approximately of similar size and shape to Butler\u2019s lot, and each lot contains an occupied residence. Peach Tree Road borders the three properties to the east (along the front of the properties), and a farm borders all three lots to the west (to the rear of the properties). The neighborhood is predominantly rural in development character, and all of the lots are zoned as RDT.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">A gravel driveway on Butler\u2019s property extends from Peach Tree Road, forms a loop in front of the residence, and then runs along the northern side of the lot, forming a second loop behind the house, where Butler stores and loads contracting equipment and supplies. The edge of the driveway is approximately twenty-two feet from the northern property line, and lies about forty-two feet from Weeks\u2019s residence. Separating Butler\u2019s lot from Weeks\u2019s lot is a row of white pine trees, although many of the trees lost their lower branches by the time of the special exception hearing before the County hearing examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Butler\u2019s business provides landscape services, including: mulching, planting, weeding, mowing, and tree and snow removal for both residential and commercial properties, most of which are in Montgomery County. While all of these services are conducted off-site, equipment and materials necessary to carry out these services are stored on the subject property. Stored materials, all located on the rear of the subject property, include: nursery stock, trees, plants, mulch, firewood, flagstones, and landscaping equipment. The company operates year round, with the busiest periods from March through May and October through December. During these busy seasons, the company employs seven people, working six days a week and arriving on those days at approximately 7 a.m. When employees arrive for work, they load the trucks with the stock and equipment stored on-site and then drive to the location of the work to be performed, after which departure there is little activity on-site until the end of the day. The employees return the trucks to the lot by approximately 6:00-6:30 p.m. The employees are supposed to depart the site within a half hour, but Butler admitted that this schedule is not followed uniformly. No customers visit the property, and all office-bound work is done off-site.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">In her special exception application, Butler proposed to limit mulch deliveries to the site to no more than three times per week during the period of Mareh-June, and no more than two times per week for the remainder of the year. Additionally, Butler anticipated that plant stock would be delivered no more than two times per season. An on-site dumpster will be emptied once per week during the busy season and less frequently during slower periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Butler\u2019s truck fleet consists of five trucks and two off-road utility vehicles (Bobcats). All of the vehicles are kept on the subject property and are picked up and returned each day. In her special exception application, Butler stated that she plans to erect a prefabricated shed behind the residence in which to store the vehicles, tools, and other equipment. Butler hoped to pave the existing gravel driveway in its present location. She also planned to install additional screening for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>noise-reduction purposes, including a six-foot tall, wood-on-wood fence along the northern property line (the shared line with Weeks\u2019s lot), and white pine trees along the southern property line.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Neighbors, through letters to and testimony before the Board and examiner, complained about the noise created by the trucks associated with Butler\u2019s activities, including that of hydraulic lifts and the safety alert sounds when they were driven in reverse gear. One neighbor complained of an \u201coffensive odor\u201d perceived on the neighbor\u2019s adjacent property emanating from trash and delivery trucks on Butler\u2019s property. Finally, neighbors opined that the use of the Butler property for contracting purposes had \u201cseverely diminished\u201d the value of their homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The local planning agency came to conflicting recommendations on what action should be taken on Butler\u2019s special exception application. The Montgomery County Planning Board of the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (\u201cMNCPPC\u201d) unanimously recommended that the application be denied. On the other hand, contrary to the recommendation from its Community-Based Planning Division, the report compiled by the Technical Staff of the MNCPPC recommended approval, with conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Following an 8 February 2008 public hearing, the County zoning hearing examiner, on 24 June 2008, issued a 60-page findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendation in which he recommended that the application \u201crequesting a special exception to conduct business as a landscape contractor in an RDT zone at 21020 Peach Tree Road be DENIED.\u201d The hearing examiner reasoned ultimately that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>the use contemplated will have serious adverse consequences on Weeks\u2019s property because of the commercial traffic engendered along Butler\u2019s driveway 42 feet from Weeks\u2019s residence and a mere 22 feet from her property line. The noise generated by trucks and Bobcats backing up to load and unload on Butler\u2019s property will also seriously disturb both adjacent neighbors. Because of the narrowness of Butler\u2019s lot, the configuration of the commercial use that Butler has included in her site plan, and the closeness of the commercial use to neighboring properties, I do not believe that conditions can be devised that will attenuate these adverse effects adequately.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">By a vote of 3-1, the Board of Appeals \u201cconcur[red] with the Hearing Examiner\u2019s finding that the special exception as proposed and in this particular location presents non-inherent adverse effects sufficient to warrant denial of this special exception.\u201d Specifically, the Board highlighted the hearing examiner\u2019s findings that: (1) due to the proximity to Weeks\u2019s property, the commercial traffic traveling on the driveway would have serious adverse consequences on that property; (2) the noise generated by the trucks and the Bobcats, when operated in reverse, would have serious adverse consequences on both adjoining neighbors; and (3) the configuration of the lots and of the proposed use would produce traffic and noise on the property having immediate adverse effects on the adjoining neighbors.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Butler sought judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The County and Weeks intervened successfully. The Circuit Court reversed the Board\u2019s decision, holding that \u201c[t]he Board erred as a matter of law in concluding that the inherent effects of a landscaping company operation on the Property rise to the level of non-inherent effects.\u201d The Circuit Court reasoned that all of the proffered adverse effects \u201cremain inherent to the operation of the landscaping business....\u201d In rejecting the Board\u2019s determination that the proximity of Butler\u2019s driveway to Weeks\u2019s lot was a sufficient non-inherent adverse effect upon which to deny the application, the Circuit Court noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>that \u201c[virtually all of the inherent adverse effects ... will take place at the rear of the Property, over three hundred feet from the neighboring property and home,\u201d and concluded that the Board \u201cerroneously concluded that the inherent adverse effects in this unique factual circumstance [rise] to the level of non-inherent and erred as a matter of law in denying Petitioner\u2019s application for Special Exception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The County and Weeks appealed timely to the Court of Special Appeals. On our initiative, we issued a writ of certiorari, <em>Montgomery County v. Butler, </em>414 Md. 330, 995 A.2d 296 (2010), before the intermediate appellate court decided the appeal. We consider here Appellants\u2019 question of whether the \u201ctrial court err[ed] in its determination that [the] Board of Appeals had erred in its determination that inherent adverse effects of a landscaping business would become non-inherent adverse effects due to shape and configuration of the subject property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Afm\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Judicial review of the final zoning action of a local administrative body, such as the denial of Butler\u2019s special exception application by the Board of Appeals, \u201cis narrow; it is limited [usually] to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determining] if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Marzullo v. Kahl, </em>366 Md. 158, 171, 783 A.2d 169, 177 (2001) (quoting <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 67-68, 729 A.2d 376, 380 (1999)) (quotation marks and citations omitted). When reviewing a final decision of the Board, we look \u201cthrough the circuit court\u2019s ... decision[ ], although applying the same standards of review, and evaluate[ ] the decision of the agency.\u201d <em>Loyola College, </em>406 Md. at 66, 956 A.2d at 173 (quoting <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County v. Surina, </em>400 Md. 662, 681, 929 A.2d 899, 910 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Further, \u201c[i]n judicial review of zoning matters, including special exceptions ... \u2018the correct test to be applied is whether the issue before the administrative body is \u201cfairly debatable,\u201d that is, whether its determination is based upon evidence from which reasonable persons could come to different conclusions.\u2019 \u201d <em>White v. North, </em>356 Md. 31, 44, 736 A.2d 1072, 1079-80 (1999) (quoting <em>Sembly v. County Bd. of Appeals of Baltimore County, </em>269 Md. 177, 182, 304 A.2d 814, 818 (1973)). Thus, in examining the record made below, \u201cwe do not engage in an \u2018independent analysis of the evidence,\u2019 \u201d <em>Armstrong v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>410 Md. 426, 444, 979 A.2d 98, 109 (2009) (quoting <em>Bereano v. State Ethics Comm\u2019n, </em>403 Md. 716, 731, 944 A.2d 538, 547 (2008)), and we proceed from the premise that an agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid, <em>Marzullo, </em>366 Md. at 172, 783 A.2d at 177 (quoting <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 68, 729 A.2d at 381), if reached in accordance with the applicable and valid regulatory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The issue before us involves ultimately our review of the Board\u2019s determination that non-inherent adverse effects persisted on Butler\u2019s property from her on-going use (which would not change meaningfully as proposed in her special exception application) sufficient to deny the application. As discussed more fully <em>infra, </em>the County Code defines \u201cinherent adverse effects\u201d and \u201cnon-inherent adverse effects.\u201d <em>See </em>Montgomery County Code \u00a7 59-G-1.2.1 (2009). Neither party contests the meaning of these terms nor do they ask this Court to construe these terms. Thus, we are faced with a \u201cmixed question of law and fact.\u201d <em>See generally </em>Arnold Rochvarg, <em>Maryland Administrative Law </em>\u00a7 4.47 at 154-57 (2d ed.2007). A court is faced with a mixed question of law and fact \u201cwhen a party challenges <em>how </em>an agency applied, as opposed to interpreted, a statute.... \u201d <em>Bayly Crossing, LLC v. Consumer Protec. Div. Office of the Attorney Gen., </em>417 Md. 128, 138, 9 A.3d 4 (2010); <em>see Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co., Inc. v. Comptroller, </em>302 Md. 825, 837, 490 A.2d 1296, 1302 (1985) (\u201cThe difference between the [parties\u2019] position[s] ... [are] based essentially on differing views\u2014not as to the law governing the case\u2014but rather as to its proper application to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>established evidence of record----\u201d). Accordingly, in answering the question of whether (as the Board found) there were non-inherent adverse effects associated with Butler\u2019s landscape contracting business, we do so by applying the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test. <em>See </em>Rochvarg, \u00a7 4.47 at 154 (\u201cThe standard of review of mixed questions of law and fact is well accepted as substantial evidence review.\u201d). In applying the substantial evidence test, we do not substitute our judgment for that of the fact finder (in this case, the Board), even if we, exercising independent judgment, may have reached a different result on the same record. <em>See Young v. Anne Arundel County, </em>146 Md.App. 526, 567, 807 A.2d 651, 675-76 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">II. Local Regulatory Standards Governing Consideration of Special Exception Applications in Montgomery County Generally and Landscape Contractors in the RDT Zone Specifically</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Montgomery County is a \u201ccharter county.\u201d <em>See </em>Md. Const, art. XI-A; <em>Montgomery County v. Anchor Inn Seafood Rest, </em>374 Md. 327, 331, 822 A.2d 429, 431 (2003) (\u201cArticle XIA of the Maryland Constitution authorizes counties to adopt home rule charters which, as we have often pointed out, function as \u2018constitutions\u2019 for the counties adopting them.\u201d). Although the Express Powers Act, Maryland Code (1957, 2005 Repl.Vol.), Article 25A, \u00a7 5, enumerates express powers granted to and conferred upon any county or counties which form a charter under Article XI-A of the Maryland Constitution, \u201cMontgomery County\u2019s zoning power ... derives exclusively from the Regional District Act [Art. 28, \u00a7\u00a7 8-101 <em>et seq.].\u201d Pan Am.

Moreover, \u00a7 59-G-1.2.1 defines \u201cinherent adverse effects\u201d as those involving \u201cthe physical and operational characteristics necessarily associated with the particular use, regardless of its physical size or scale of operations,\u201d and defines \u201cnon-inherent adverse effects\u201d as those involving \u201cphysical and operational characteristics not necessarily associated with the particular use, or adverse effects created by unusual characteristics of the site.\u201d Our cases heretofore have not sought to define these terms, except as noted <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The County Code goes on to explain that, while \u201c[ijnherent adverse effects alone are not a sufficient basis for denial of a special exception,\u201d \u201cnon-inherent adverse effects, alone or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>conjunction with inherent adverse effects, are a sufficient basis to deny a special exception.\u201d Montgomery County Code \u00a7 59-G-1.2.1 (2009).

Rather, \u00a7 59-G-1.21(2) states that \u201c[t]he fact that a proposed use complies with all specific standards and requirements to grant a special exception does not create a presumption that the use is compatible with nearby properties.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>\u00a7 59-G-1.21(a) (\u201cA special exception <em>may </em>be granted when the Board ... finds from a preponderance of the evidence ... that ....\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">A. The County Zoning Ordinance\u2019s Treatment of the Presumption of Compatibility and Inherent and Non-Inherent Adverse Effects Associated with Special Exceptions Versus <em>Schultz </em>and Its Progeny</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">This case involves the interplay between Maryland caselaw dealing with special exceptions,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and Montgomery County\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>seemingly unique approach, as reflected in the County Code. To appreciate fully the apparent novelty of Montgomery County\u2019s zoning ordinance in this regard, we restate the history of special exceptions as a land use tool and the origin and purpose of the \u201cpresumption of compatibility\u201d said to accompany them.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">One treatise detailed aptly the origins of the special exception as a land use regulatory device:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">The creators of zoning designed a simple system. In principle, they believed that one ought to be able to look at a map and determine from that map exactly what could be done on a particular piece of property. For many types of uses ... that system worked well; the zoning map created separate districts for each of those. Some uses do not fit so neatly into a map, however. These are uses that are generally compatible with the uses permitted as of right in a given district, but certain aspects of their implementation require scrutiny by the planning commission or other pertinent board before they are permitted. Certain uses may tend to generate excessive traffic, or attract a large number of people to the area, thereby creating noise or other pollutants. Similarly, the proposed special use exception may have a detrimental effect on the value of other properties in the area or may create a higher potential for accidents or other adverse effects on the public health or safety.... With traditional zoning, there were only two ways to address putting these uses into residential areas-either designating [them] as permitted uses in all residential zones OR granting \u201cspot\u201d zones for such uses at appropriate locations in residential neighborhoods. Clearly allowing such uses on every lot in a residential area was never an attractive alternative, and the early drafters of zoning legislation sought a simpler and more elegant solution....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Nyal D. Deems et al, A Practical Guide to Winning Land Use Approvals and Permits, Ch. 2, \u00a7 2.05[3][a] (2010). In <em>Loyola College, </em>we reiterated the place of a special exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>as a device or tool in a comprehensive zoning regulatory scheme:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">The special exception adds flexibility to a comprehensive legislative zoning scheme by serving as a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d between permitted uses and prohibited uses in a particular zone. Permitted and prohibited uses serve as binary, polar opposites in a zoning scheme. A permitted use in a given zone is permitted as of right within the zone, without regard to any potential or actual adverse effect that the use will have on neighboring properties. A special exception, by contrast, is merely deemed <em>prima facie </em>compatible in a given zone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-6\"><em>Loyola College, </em>406 Md. at 71, 956 A.2d at 176. A special exception use \u201cin a zoning ordinance recognizes that the legislative body of a representative government has made a policy decision for all of the inhabitants of the particular governmental jurisdiction, and that the exception or use is desirable and necessary in its zoning planning.... \u201d <em>Mossburg v. Montgomery County, </em>107 Md.App. 1, 7-8, 666 A.2d 1253 (1995).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The notion that a special exception is in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>certain context <em>\u201cprima facie </em>compatible,\u201d or, stated differently, that the use for which a special exception may be allowed by a zoning regulatory scheme is \u201cpresumptively compatible\u201d generally with other uses permitted as of right in the same zone, is not a wholly contemporary notion. <em>See, e.g., Creswell v. Baltimore Aviation Serv., Inc., </em>257 Md. 712, 719, 264 A.2d 838, 842 (1970) (\u201cA special exception is a use which has been legislatively predetermined to be conditionally compatible with the uses permitted as of right in a particular zone.... \u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Tracing the origin of and the underlying rationale for a \u201cpresumption of compatibility\u201d concept/rationale, however, proves a formidable task. The first Maryland case we could find that appeared to discuss such a presumption is <em>Montgomery County v. Merlands Club, Inc., </em>202 Md. 279, 96 A.2d 261 (1953). In <em>Merlands Club, </em>we considered the refusal by the Board of Appeals of Montgomery County to grant a special exception for a private recreational club. <em>Merlands Club, </em>202 Md. at 282, 96 A.2d at 262. In discussing the special exception provisions then found in the County Code, the Court stated that the purpose of the provisions were \u201cto delegate to the Zoning Board a limited authority to permit enumerated uses which the legislative body finds in effect <em>prima facie </em>properly residential, absent any fact or circumstance in a particular case which would change this <em>presumptive </em>finding.\u201d <em>Merlands Club, </em>202 Md. at 287, 96 A.2d at 264 (second emphasis added). Similar early cases from this Court appearing to discuss the presumption are to like effect. <em>See Gilmor v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number><em>Mayor of Baltimore, </em>205 Md. 557, 109 A.2d 739 (1954) and <em>Oursler v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals of Baltimore County, </em>204 Md. 397, 104 A.2d 568 (1954). The seminal <em>Schultz v. Pritts </em>and the more-recent <em>Loyola College, </em>cited <em>supra, </em>are no more illuminating on the origins of the presumption. The only kernel of guidance we could find in Maryland caselaw regarding the origins or rationale for the presumption comes from our intermediate appellate court, which concluded that \u201c[t]he presumption in favor of a [special exception] derives from the legislative policy determination that such a use is permissible.... \u201d <em>E. Outdoor Adver. Co. v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>146 Md.App. 283, 308, 807 A.2d 49, 63 (2002). Yet, even assuming the presumption derives from the local legislative policy decision to provide in its original zoning regulatory scheme (or by amendment to its text) for the potential of such a use with the grant of a special exception, the use remains only permissible conditionally and each applicant must prove actually, to the satisfaction of the administrative decision-maker (subject to the narrow standards for judicial review and applicable constitutional principles), that his/her/its application will be compatible with the uses on (or future permitted use of) other properties in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">Perhaps the presumption of compatibility stems from a judicially-created inference assigned to the legislative body\u2019s decision to allow, in its zoning regulations, certain uses in certain zones by grant of a special exception. For instance, Professor Daniel R. Mandelker\u2019s treatise, \u201cLand Use Law,\u201d looks to the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Archdiocese of Portland v. County of Washington, </em>254 Or. 77, 458 P.2d 682, 685-86 (1969), for the presumption\u2019s rationale: \u201c[T]he ordinance itself reveals the legislative plan.... The suspicion which is cast upon the approval of a change involving an incompatible use ... is not warranted where the change <em>has been anticipated by the governing body.\u201d </em>(emphasis added); <em>see </em>Daniel R. Mandelker, Land Use Law \u00a7 6.56 (5th ed.2003). That is, inherent in the essence of a special exception is a legislative determination that certain uses will be permissible (albeit with the grant of a special exception), notwithstanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>the likelihood of adverse effects naturally associated with such uses. <em>See </em>Arden H. Rathkopf, The Law of Zoning and Planning \u00a7 61:8 (2010) (\u201cThe technique of the conditional use presupposes that some sort of legislative determination has been made as to which uses of property are allowable.... \u201d). <em>But see Wells v. Pierpont, </em>253 Md. 554, 559, 253 A.2d 749, 752 (1969) (\u201c[T]he very fact of the granting of the special exception ... presumes a determination by zoning authorities that the requested use would not be \u2018detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare.... \u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Such thinking is consistent with most local zoning ordinances. For example, consider the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations (\u201cBCZR\u201d) with which the <em>Loyola College </em>Court was faced. The BCZR provided a list of requirements that must be satisfied before any special exception may be granted (not to mention additional conditions for each special exception use). These generally-applicable requirements include, but are not limited to, a finding that the requested use will not \u201c[b]e detrimental to the health, safety or general welfare of the locality involved; ... [tjend to create congestion in roads, streets or alleys therein; ... [or c]reate a potential hazard from fire, panic or other danger____\u201d <em>See Loyola College, </em>406 Md. at 68, 956 A.2d at 174. Thus, the ordinance, on its face, states that if the applicant satisfies the final administrative decision-maker that it has met these standards, the special exception ought to be granted. <em>See </em>John J. Delaney et al., Handling the Land Use Case; Land Use Law, Practice &amp; Forms \u00a7 30:2 (3d ed. 2008) (\u201cThe distinguishing characteristic of the special-[exception] technique is that <em>if the administrative body ... finds compliance </em>with the standards set forth in the regulation, the applicant has a right to the exception.\u201d) (emphasis added); 4 Southwestern Legal Foundation, Institute on Planning and Zoning 98 (1960) (\u201cMany ordinances state that a use is subject to a conditional use permit[,] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>period.\u201d); <em>Ogden Fire Co. No. 1 v. Upper Chichester Twp., </em>504 F.3d 370, 382 (3d Cir.2007) (noting that a \u201cspecial exception is not really an exception at all\u201d). Stated differently, after meeting the criteria set forth in the ordinance, ordinarily it may be said that there is a presumption that this land use is compatible generally with permitted uses in the underlying zone. It is the caselaw that coins the presumption as such, as well as provides for the consideration of potential non-inherent adverse effects to rebut the now-shifted burden of production. <em>See Loyola College, </em>406 Md. at 68-69, 956 A.2d 166, 175 (\u201cWithin each individual factor [of the Baltimore County Zoning Ordinance] lurks another test, the <em>Schultz v. Pritts </em>standard.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Another presumption\u2014possibly working in tandem with the presumption discussed above\u2014is the more general presumption \u201cthat zoning regulations reasonable in substance and reasonably applied do, or are presumed to, promote the public safety, health, morals, welfare and prosperity----\u201d <em>Rockville Fuel &amp; Feed Co. v. Bd. of Appeals of the City of Gaithersburg, </em>257 Md. 183, 187, 262 A.2d 499, 502 (1970). The uses for which a special exception is required are conceptualized generally as having some deleterious effects on surrounding uses or undeveloped land in the neighborhood\u2014or, stated differently, may be said potentially not to promote the public safety, health, morals, welfare, and prosperity and, therefore, are not appropriate to be allowed as uses of right. <em>See </em>John J. Delaney et al., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 30:1 (\u201cMost [uses for which a special exception is required] are regarded as potentially troublesome because of noise, traffic, congestion, or other associated problems.\u201d). The local legislature, however, determines that this potential may not be so tangible in every case as to warrant prohibition of the use in the zone or zones; rather, an applicant should be given the opportunity to satisfy an administrative decision-maker that in his/her/its case, such potential does not rise to the level of so likely or actual incompatibility as to rebut the presumption. Because the allowance of a special exception use is part of a comprehensive zoning regulatory scheme that is itself accompanied by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>presumption that it promotes public safety, health, and morals, it stands to reason that this broader presumption accompanying the zoning ordinance itself generates the specific presumption of compatibility associated with the inclusion in the ordinance of those uses that may be allowed through the grant of special exceptions. After all, a \u201cpresumption of compatibility\u201d is nothing more than a rebuttable presumption that the intended use is in the interests of public safety, health, and welfare. <em>See Anderson v. Sawyer, </em>23 Md.App. 612, 624-25, 329 A.2d 716, 724 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>274 Md. 725 (1975) (referring to the presumption of compatibility as the \u201cpresumption <em>that the general welfare is promoted </em>by allowing funeral homes in a residential use district, notwithstanding their inherent depressing effects ____\u201d) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Merely concluding that the abstract presumption of compatibility accompanying the inclusion in a zoning ordinance of special exception uses\u2014or the grant of a particular application for a special exception\u2014derives from the general presumption that all parts of a comprehensive zoning scheme advance the general welfare, however, does not end our inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Following the 1926 Supreme Court progenitor case of <em>Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., </em>272 U.S. 365, 47 S.Ct. 114, 71 L.Ed. 303 (1926), it became well settled in Maryland (and elsewhere) that enacting zoning ordinances and regulations was a legitimate exercise of the police power. <em>See, e.g., Wakefield v. Kraft, </em>202 Md. 136, 141, 96 A.2d 27, 29 (1953) (\u201cSuch a[zoning ordinance], an exercise of the police power, enjoys a presumption in favor of its validity.\u201d); <em>Hoffman v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>197 Md. 294, 306, 79 A.2d 367, 372 (1951) (\u201cA zoning statute, ordinance or administrative order, like other action in the exercise of the police power, is presumed to be valid.... \u201d). Numerous courts hold that valid exercises of police power are accompanied by a presumption that such exercises are in the constituents\u2019 general welfare. <em>See Stringfellow\u2019s of N.Y. v. New York, </em>91 N.Y.2d 382, 671 N.Y.S.2d 406, 694 N.E.2d 407, 414 (1998) (\u201c[L]and use regulations generally enjoy a strong presumption of constitutionality as valid exercises of the State\u2019s police power to <em>advance the public health, safety and </em>welfare.... \u201d); <em>Corp. of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Ckrist of Latter-Day Saints v. City of Porterville, </em>90 Cal.App.2d 656, 203 P.2d 823, 826 (1949) (\u201cIt is presumed that the enactment [of zoning ordinances] as a whole is justified under the police power and adapted to promote the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare.\u201d). Thus, it is reasonable to infer that the presumption of compatibility accompanying the local legislative decision to allow in its zoning ordinance the potential for certain uses in certain zones only through the grant of a special exception, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>being a part of the general presumption that zoning ordinances are presumed to be in the general welfare, has roots sunk in the police power. Therefore, a presumption of compatibility is attributable to (1) the local legislative body\u2019s adoption of a comprehensive zoning scheme, <em>ie., </em>the zoning ordinance and zoning map; (2) the local legislative body\u2019s decision to allow in its ordinance for a certain use in a certain zone only with the grant of a special exception; and (3) the grant of a special exception application in a given case.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">It is well settled that the General Assembly, and even local legislative bodies, may legislate \u201caround\u201d or even abrogate non-constitutional holdings of this Court regarding the interpretation of their legislative enactments, provided vested rights are not impaired and relevant and proper procedures are observed and, in the case of a local legislature, it has been delegated the authority to act in the particular legislative arena. <em>See State Admin. Bd. of Election Laws v. Calvert, </em>272 Md. 659, 668, 327 A.2d 290, 295 (1974) (\u201c[T]he General Assembly is the branch of government vested with legislative power, and that ... body at its periodic meetings by appropriate legislation can take steps to alter a decision of ours with which it may disagree.... \u201d).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Because the police power serves as the basis for a presumption that a special exception, being part of a comprehensive zoning scheme, is in the general welfare, it is this same police power generally, and Md.Code, Art. 28 with regard to zoning and planning in Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s Counties, that allows local legislatures generally to craft their zoning ordinances as they deem appropriate (subject, of course, to the enabling statutes, due process, and other constitutional requirements, none of which are implicated in the present litigation). Less important to the present case than determining what <em>is </em>the origin and/or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>rationale underlying a relevant presumption of compatibility is determining what is <em>not </em>the origin and/or rationale underlying the presumption. Absent from the caselaw and treatises discussing presumptions of compatibility in the context of special exceptions is the notion that it\u2014either explicitly or implicitly\u2014is a creature of the Maryland General Assembly. Were it otherwise, a local legislature\u2019s efforts to blaze a different path than the General Assembly charted would be in doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">While this case is the Court\u2019s first opportunity to consider squarely the extent to which a local government, in enacting its zoning ordinance, is permitted to legislate standards for consideration of special exception applications different than discussed in <em>Schultz </em>and its progeny, our conclusion that it may do so is consistent with other opinions of both this Court and the Court of Special Appeals. In <em>Gotach Center for Health v. Board, of County Commissioners of Frederick County, </em>60 Md.App. 477, 483 A.2d 786 (1984), an applicant for a special exception argued that the Frederick County Zoning Board applied improperly the standard for evaluating the adverse impacts of the proposed use as set forth in <em>Schultz </em>when the zoning ordinance directed the Board to apply the standard in <em>Gowl v. Atlantic Richfield Co., </em>27 Md.App. 410, 341 A.2d 832 (1975) (which <em>Schultz </em>overruled expressly).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> While holding ultimately that the Frederick County ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>did not direct the board to apply a Gowl-type standard, Judge Alan M. Wilner, author of the <em>Gotach </em>opinion, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">All that <em>Schultz </em>seems to say is that, <em>absent some clear legislative direction to the contrary, </em>if a particular kind of impact is required to be taken into account in considering a special exception, the impact is to be measured by the test enunciated in <em>Schultz </em>and not by that stated in <em>Gowl. We see no reason, however, why a county legislative body cannot adopt a Gowl-type standard in the ordinance itself, if it chooses to do so.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-6\"><em>Gotach, </em>60 Md.App. at 485, 483 A.2d at 790 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We hold today that the role played by the presumption of compatibility associated with a local legislature\u2019s election to provide in its zoning ordinance for allowing a use only through the grant of a special exception (or grant a particular special exception application), as discussed in the reported cases, applies in the absence of clear legislative intent to the contrary.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>See Mossburg, </em>107 Md.App. at 21, 666 A.2d at 1263 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>(\u201cIn the absence of a provision in a zoning statute clearly requiring a stricter standard than <em>Schultz, Schultz v. Pritts </em>applies.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">In addition to qualifying the application of the presumption of compatibility in a given special exception application, the County Code supplies definitions for \u201cinherent adverse effects\u201d and \u201cnon-inherent adverse effects,\u201d subjects upon which the caselaw is generally silent.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> That is, it is well settled that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">the appropriate standard to be used in determining whether a requested special exception use would have an adverse effect and, therefore, should be denied, is whether there are facts and circumstances that show that the particular use proposed at the particular location proposed would have any adverse effects above and beyond those inherently associated with such a special exception use.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-6\"><em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 15, 432 A.2d at 1327. Nowhere in <em>Schultz, </em>however, or in any other Maryland reported case for that matter, is there express delineation of criteria for determining what adverse effects are \u201cinherent,\u201d versus those that are not, with regard to a particular special exception use. If, as we hold, the County was free to enact a zoning ordinance within its delegated zoning and planning powers from the General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Assembly and consistent with constitutional inhibitions, <em>a fortiori </em>it should be able to enact amendments to its zoning ordinance to deal with issues on which this Court has been largely silent.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">In arguing that \u201c[t]he Board of Appeals erred ... in construing and misapplying the \u2018inherent\u2019 adverse effects vs. the \u2018non-inherent\u2019 adverse effects standards in ... the Zoning Ordinance in light of <em>Schultz[,] </em>\u201d Butler implies that the County Code\u2019s definitions of inherent and non-inherent adverse effects are, in some way, inconsistent with <em>Schultz </em>and its progeny. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the County Code\u2019s definition of \u201cnon-inherent adverse effects\u201d\u2014those involving \u201cphysical and operational characteristics not necessarily associated with the particular use, or adverse effects created by unusual characteristics of the site\u201d\u2014is inconsistent with what this Court has said previously while examining a different regulatory scheme than is before us now, we hold that the County Code\u2019s definition is an appropriate exercise of local legislative authority and discretion. We do not agree, however, with Butler\u2019s proposition that the County Code\u2019s definition\u2014upon which the Board relied in denying Butler\u2019s application for a special exception\u2014is inconsistent with what this Court said regarding non-inherent adverse effects. Rather, the County Code, in allowing the board to consider any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>\u201cadverse effects created by the unusual characteristics of the site\u201d is entirely consistent with <em>Schultz </em>and its progeny. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">In <em>Schultz, </em>the Court wrote that an applicant for a special exception \u201cdoes not have the burden of establishing affirmatively that his proposed use would be a benefit to the community. If he shows to the satisfaction of the Board that the proposed use would be conducted <em>without real detriment to the neighborhood </em>... he has met his burden.\u201d <em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 11, 432 A.2d at 1325. The phrase \u201cdetriment to the neighborhood\u201d implies necessarily that the Board\u2019s task is to determine if there is or likely will be a detriment to the surrounding properties. The Court did not mean that the Board, hypothetically, must measure and assess what the adverse effects of a proposed use would be on an idealized or even <em>average </em>neighborhood or property in the zone. Rather, as Judge Rita Davidson explained for the Court, it is for the zoning board to ascertain in each case the adverse effects that the proposed use would have on the <em>specific, actual </em>surrounding area.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>(\u201cThe extent of any harm or disturbance to the neighboring area and uses is, of course, material.\u201d); <em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 15, 432 A.2d at 1327 (\u201c[T]he appropriate standard to be used in determining whether a special exception ... should be denied is whether there are facts and circumstances that show that the particular use proposed <em>at the particular location </em>proposed would have any adverse effects above and beyond those inherently associated with such a special exception use ....\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Loyola College, </em>406 Md. at 95, 956 A.2d at 191 (stating that the Court in <em>Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs for Cecil County v.

In a report relied on by the County Council, sitting as the District Council, in approving Zoning Text Amendment 99004, the County Attorney noted that \u201cthe courts have often failed to recognize the distinct differences between the enabling authority of a particular zoning ordinance and the individual use of specific zoning tolls by different zoning ordinances.\u201d Memorandum from Charles W. Thompson, Jr., County Attorney, to William E. Hanna, Jr., Chair of the County Planning, Housing, and Economic Development (29 September 2008). We agree with that observation. In reviewing a decision of a zoning board approving or denying an application for a special exception, the emphasis must be first and foremost on identifying the relevant and prevailing zoning ordinance. Only then, after determining whether the zoning ordinance is silent on the matters to which <em>Schultz </em>and its progeny speak, may the <em>Schultz </em>line of cases become pertinent and controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>B. Applying the Prevailing Zoning Ordinance to the Evidence of Record in the Present Case</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">With this considerable prologue in mind, the narrow question now before us is whether there was substantial evidence in the record before the Board to support its conclusion that there were sufficient non-inherent adverse effects (as defined in the County Code) upon which to base the denial of Butler\u2019s application for a special exception.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In applying the substantial evidence test, \u201c[t]he test is reasonableness, not rightness.\u201d <em>Layton v. Howard County Bd. of Appeals, </em>399 Md. 36, 49, 922 A.2d 576, 583 (2007) (quoting <em>Annapolis v. Annapolis Waterfront Co., </em>284 Md. 383, 399, 396 A.2d 1080, 1089 (1979)). We conclude that there was substantial evidence from which the Board could determine reasonably that Butler\u2019s actual and proposed use would produce non-inherent adverse effects sufficient to warrant denial of the application for the special exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Before the hearing examiner (whose findings the Board relied on in rendering its decision denying the application), evidence was received regarding the relative narrowness of both Butler\u2019s lot and the surrounding lots in the neighborhood, including Weeks\u2019s lot. Because of this narrowness, the northern edge of Butler\u2019s property comes within twenty-two feet of Weeks\u2019s property line and forty-two feet of her residence. Further, the configuration of the uses on Butler\u2019s lot and the location of the driveway was such that trucks would need to backup as much as 130 feet from the driveway loop to the open storage area (accompanied by their beeping sound when operated in reverse). Many trees in the row of white pine trees bordering the property had lost lower branches, compromising their effectiveness for noise attenuation purposes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Butler\u2019s lot is not forested otherwise.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Thus, the Board was within reason to conclude that Butler\u2019s proposed use\u2014deemed a \u201cvery intense and industrial commercial establishment\u201d\u2014 would have unique, non-inherent adverse effects on adjoining properties in the immediate vicinity, within the meaning of \u00a7 59-G-1.2.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">To be sure, considering that the County Code plainly allows landscape contractors to locate in residential areas in the RDT zone by special exception, such a special exception application cannot be denied simply because the lot upon which the proposed use will be located is adjacent to residences. The denial of the application, however, was supported by substantial evidence that the narrowness of Butler\u2019s lot, the configuration of the commercial enterprise activities and installations on the lot, and the proximity of the commercial activities to adjacent properties were sufficient non-inherent adverse effects to persuade the Board to deny the application. As this Court said in <em>Alviani v. Dixon, </em>365 Md. 95, 113, 775 A.2d 1234, 1244 (2001): \u201c[i]f the evidence makes the question of harm or disturbance or the question of the disruption of the harmony of the comprehensive plan of zoning fairly debatable, the matter is one for the Board to decide.\u201d If the issue of non-inherent adverse effects is at least fairly debatable, a reviewing court must defer to the judgment of the Board. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, and remand this case to that Court with direction to enter a judgment affirming the Board\u2019s decision denying Butler\u2019s application for a special exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED.

Even then, we doubt that any such explicit consideration goes so far as to delve into issues of degree, intensity, or scope of the inherent adverse effects. It is more doubtful whether records of legislative history exist from which a reviewing court may say with any degree of certainty exactly which discrete adverse effects the local legislature deemed inherent, and which may have been deemed non-inherent, at the time the ordinance or amendment was enacted. We think that, rather than leaving courts to guess or assume what effects were deemed by the local legislature inherent in, say, landscape contracting, what Montgomery County has done, defining \u201cinherent adverse effects\u201d and \"non-inherent adverse effects,\u201d is a reasoned approach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b335-6\">. Such a conclusion is consistent with the lesson of <em>Loyola College, </em>namely, that <em>\"Schultz </em>speaks pointedly to an individual case analysis focused on the particular locality involved around the proposed site.\u201d <em>Loyola College, </em>406 Md. at 102, 956 A.2d at 195.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b337-6\">. At oral argument before us, Butler conceded that \"there may, indeed, be a configuration of the property, perhaps, [that] would rise to the level of non-inherent\u201d adverse effects, but argued that plateau had not been achieved on this record. In effect, Butler asks us to step in the shoes of the Board, the body best able to determine whether the configuration was such that the proposed use would have unique, non-inherent, adverse effects; we decline that invitation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b338-6\">. Additional tree plantings or fencing proposed by Butler, alone, did not sway the hearing examiner who concluded that, because of Butler\u2019s pattern of ignoring governing regulatory requirements, there was \"substantial doubt that conditions [e.g. tree plantings, fencing, etc.] included in special exception approval can, even if otherwise protective of neighboring properties, be effectively enforced....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
