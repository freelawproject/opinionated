Specifically, Menefee alleged that two employees of the Montgomery County DHHS and/or Child Protective Services (\u201cCPS\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> negligently failed to investigate Menefee\u2019s claims regarding abuse suffered by his son and the boy\u2019s mother, Sheila Menefee (divorced from Menefee), who was murdered ultimately in the presence of John Damien, by her boyfriend. It was this failure, the Menefees claim, that was the proximate and actual cause of John Damien\u2019s Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSD),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which developed assertedly as a result of direct child abuse by the boyfriend and witnessing his mother\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">We hold, for reasons to be explained more fully <em>infra, </em>that the State is a proper party to the present litigation, because: (1) pursuant to the State Government Article of the Maryland Code, in considering the Montgomery County DHHS as a \u201cstate unit,\u201d and its employees as \u201cstate personnel,\u201d the Legislature intended for the State to waive sovereign and governmental immunity, and assume liability for negligence arising from the administration of social service programming under Title 3, Subtitle 4 of the Human Services Article, <em>see </em>Maryland Code (1984, 2009 Repl.Vol.), State Government Article, \u00a7 12-101(a)(7), (b);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (2) the State funds and main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>tains a degree of oversight and control over the Montgomery County DHHS for providing state services to Montgomery County residents. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2007), Human Services Art., \u00a7\u00a7 3-403, 3-405. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County and remand to that court to consider the remaining, unaddressed arguments advanced by the State in its motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">FACTS<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">As a result of earlier divorce proceedings, Menefee and Sheila Menefee (Sheila) shared joint legal and physical custody of their only child, John Damien. On 13 March 2004, Menefee met Sheila to exchange custody of John Damien and, while changing the boy\u2019s diaper, noticed bruises on the child\u2019s back and buttocks. He flagged down a police officer, who instructed him to take John Damien to Holy Cross Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">Thereafter, CPS and/or DHHS were called. The agency determined that the bruising was several days old and, therefore, had been caused some time before Menefee picked up John Damien from Sheila. The case was referred ultimately to W. Don Thorne and LaVoyce Reed, a social worker, both employed by CPS.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Apparently, Thorne and Reed concluded that no determination could be made as to the source of the abuse or what would be the most appropriate way to protect John Damien prospectively. Thorne allegedly directed Mene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>fee and Sheila to participate in a parenting program and decided to leave the investigation open, in order to interview additional witnesses. Menefee contends that Thorne and Reed conducted no further investigation, in fact, and the case was deemed closed sometime between mid-March and mid-May 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">According to Menefee, he became aware at some point of the violent nature of Sheila\u2019s boyfriend, Ruben Diaz. Menefee apparently reported to CPS and/or DHHS on several occasions that he suspected Diaz to be the source of the physical and mental abuse suffered not only by John Damien, but Sheila as well, even telling CPS that Sheila told him that Diaz had cut her arm with a knife. Menefee reports that none of these claims were investigated or reported to other relevant authorities by CPS or DHHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">On 6 September 2004, following an altercation which resulted in the grant of a temporary restraining order in favor of Sheila against Diaz, Diaz broke into Sheila\u2019s home and stabbed her to death. When the police arrived, they found John Damien\u2014then two years of age\u2014in the room with Diaz and his now-deceased mother. On 23 October 2007, the boy was diagnosed with PTSD,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> at the age of five.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Pursuant to State Government \u00a7 12-106, Menefee and John Damien, through counsel, submitted, on 25 August 2008, a written claim to Nancy K. Kopp, Maryland State Treasurer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>On 22 September 2008, a claims adjuster from Treasurer Kopp\u2019s office notified the Menefees\u2019 counsel that, \u201c[s]ince your claim was not filed within the 1 year period, the claim may not be considered.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thereafter, on 4 March 2009, Menefee filed a four-count complaint against the State of Maryland in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, alleging negligence, negligence per se, gross negligence, and negligent infliction of emotional distress.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Generally, Menefee claimed that the State, through Thorne, Reed, and CPS/DHHS; failed to perform a reasonable investigation of the first incident of suspected abuse (the bruising of John Damien); failed to find that the abuse occurred while in the physical custody of Sheila; and failed to investigate and/or report each of Menefee\u2019s complaints subsequent to the initial investigation; and, that such failures were the proximate and actual cause of John Damien\u2019s PTSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">On 20 April 2009, the State filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss or for Summary Judgment,\u201d claiming, among other things, that (1) \u201cthe State of Maryland is not a proper party to this action.\u201d In its motion, the State relied first on language from Md.Code (2007), Human Servs. Art., \u00a7 3-402(a), which provides that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>\u201c[i]n Montgomery County, the Montgomery County Government shall administer State social service ... programs that in other counties are administered by a local department....\u201d Further, the State relied on State Government \u00a7 12-103.2(b), which provides that \u201ca tort claim[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] shall be considered, defended, settled, and paid in the same manner as any other claim covered by the Montgomery County Self-Insurance Fund.\u201d In response, Menefee argued that the State was a proper party to the litigation, considering that the Maryland Tort Claims Act (\u201cMTCA\u201d) includes expressly an \u201cemployee of a county who is assigned to a local department of social services, including a Montgomery County employee\u201d in the definition of \u201cstate personnel.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 12-101(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">After hearing oral arguments, the Circuit Court granted the State\u2019s motion, explaining that \u201cI think clearly the intent of the legislature was that in this particular instance, with this set of facts, that the proper party in this case would be Montgomery County, not the State of Maryland.\u201d Menefee noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. On our initiative, we issued a writ of certiorari, <em>Menefee v. Montgomery County, </em>415 Md. 38, 997 A.2d 789 (2010), before the intermediate appellate court decided the appeal. We consider here Appellants\u2019 question\u2014which we have rephrased\u2014whether the State of Maryland is a proper party to a suit alleging negligence and negligence per se stemming from the alleged acts (or lack thereof) of Montgomery County DHHS employees in administering social service programming under Title 3, Subtitle 4 of the Human Services Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">In reviewing the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss, \u201cour task is confined to determining whether the trial court was legally correct in its decision to dismiss.\u201d <em>Washing</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number><em>ton Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v.

What is Meant by a \u201cProper Party\u201d Defendant?</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">It is well settled that \u201c[t]he duty of this [C]ourt, as of every other judicial tribunal, is to decide actual controversies____\u201d <em>Thom v. Cook, </em>113 Md. 85, 88, 77 A. 120, 120 (1910) (quoting <em>Mills v. Green, </em>159 U.S. 651, 653, 16 S.Ct. 132, 133, 40 L.Ed. 293, 293 (1895)). Further, \u201c[a] general principle of law is that for a court to have jurisdiction it must have before it a justiciable issue.\u201d <em>Harford County v. Schultz, </em>280 Md. 77, 80, 371 A.2d 428, 429 (1977). In Maryland, a case is justiciable \u201cwhen there are <em>interested parties </em>asserting adverse claims upon a state of facts which must have accrued wherein a legal decision is sought or demanded.\u201d <em>Reyes v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>281 Md. 279, 288, 380 A.2d 12, 17 (1977) (quoting 1 W. Anderson, <em>Actions for Declaratory Judgments </em>67 (2d ed.1951)) (emphasis added). It stands to reason, then, that a court is not presented with an \u201cactual controversy,\u201d and does not decide a \u201cjusticiable issue\u201d when the named defendant is not a proper party in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">In other contexts, this Court has defined a \u201cparty\u201d as \u201call persons who have a direct interest in the subject matter of the suit....\u201d <em>Ugast v. LaFontaine, </em>189 Md. 227, 232, 55 A.2d 705, 708 (1947). Further, in a tort action such as this, we think \u201c[t]he defendant should be he ... who, by reason of the relation between him and the actual perpetrator has a liability in law cast upon him for the acts or omissions of the actual perpetrator.\u201d Harry M. Sachs, Jr., Poe\u2019s Pleading and Prac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>tice \u00a7 467 (6th ed.1970). Thus, the issue in the present case is whether the State has a \u201cdirect interest\u201d in the litigation or whether it has assumed potentially \u201cliability in law\u201d for the asserted damage to John Damien.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">II. The Relationship Between the State of Maryland and the Montgomery County DHHS: Way Beyond \u201cJust Dating\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Former Maryland Code (1957, 1995 Repl.Vol.), Article 88A \u00a7 13 provided for the creation of a local department of social services in each county and Baltimore City.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>(\u201cThe State Department shall create or continue in each county and Baltimore City a local department of social services to be known as such with the name of the county ... prefixed thereto.\u201d). Accordingly, before 1996, \u201c[t]he Montgomery County Department of Social Services staff [were] State employees and [were] paid by the Department of Human Resources.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> H.B. 669 (1996), Fiscal Note. The County, however, \u201c[anticipating federal changes and wanting to improve the cost effective delivery of health and human services,\u201d sought to transfer administration of social-service programming from the State Department of Human Resources to the County government. H.B. 669 (1996), Fact Sheet;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>see Id. </em>(stating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>that H.B. 669 \u201cprovides for the <em>administration </em>of Social Services ... programs by grant agreement between the Department of Human Resources (DHR) and Montgomery County Government----\u201d) (emphasis added); Letter from Donald Klausmeyer, Administrator\u2014Montgomery County Department of Social Services, to House Appropriations Committee (21 March 1996) (stating that \u201c[e]mployees of MCDSS view themselves as part of the County workforce. Many connections with the State are seen as artificial, redundant, or unnecessary,\u201d and that \u201cemployees find it difficult and time consuming to work under two sets of personnel regulations: two timesheets, conflicting holiday schedules, overlapping health insurance coverage, differing rates for sick leave, etc.\u201d); Letter from United Way of the National Capital Area to House Appropriations Committee (21 March 1996) (\u2018We have frequently pointed out the repetitive, time consuming, costly and unnecessary trips that applicants are required to endure to establish eligibility for service.\u201d). House Bill 669 of the 1996 Legislative Session, which (among other things) \u201ctransferred] the duties of the ... local department of social services in Montgomery County to the Montgomery County government,\u201d Chapter 476 of the Acts of 1996, was the \u201cresult of extensive negotiations between the Montgomery County Government and the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.\u201d Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Position Letter, H.B. 669 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The House Committee on Appropriations\u2019s Floor Report regarding H.B. 669 (1996) explains further the impetus for the legislation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-7\">The request for a transfer of the administration of social services from the State to a county government is unprecedented.[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] Montgomery County is in the process of reorga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>nizing the administration and delivery of its health and human services. The reorganization is in response to anticipated federal changes along with the implementation of block grants. The County is combining four separate departments into a County Department of Health and Human Services. To make the consolidation work, Montgomery County has requested that House Bill 669 be passed to allow the Transfer of the ... Local Department of Social Services to county government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">One of the primary consequences of House Bill 669, then, was to effectuate the goal of: \u201cState social service and public assistance programs administered by a local department shall be administered by the Montgomery County Government.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol.), Art. 88A \u00a7 13A(b)(l). In transferring administration of social service programs to the County, however, the Legislature made a number of changes\u2014especially relevant to the present case\u2014to the MTCA, currently codified at Maryland Code (1984, 2009 Repl. Vol.), State Government Article, \u00a7\u00a7 12-101 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Section 12-104(a)(l)\u2014part of the MTCA\u2014provides, in pertinent part, that, subject to the Act\u2019s other provisions, \u201cthe immunity of the State and <em>of its units </em>is waived as to a tort action....\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Despite this limited waiver of sovereign and governmental immunity, the Act explains that <em>\u201cState personnel </em>shall have the immunity from liability,\u201d \u00a7 12-105, for suits \u201cin courts of the State and from liability in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>tort for a tortious act or omission that is within the scope of the public duties of the State personnel and is made without malice or gross negligence, and for which the State or its units have waived immunity under Title 12, Subtitle 1 of the State Government Article____\u201d Md.Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Art. \u00a7 5-522(b) (emphasis added); <em>see Barbre v. Pope, </em>402 Md. 157, 175, 935 A.2d 699, 710 (2007) (\u201c[T]he State does not waive its sovereign immunity for any tortious acts outside the scope of employment or when a \u2018state personnel\u2019 acts with malice or gross negligence.\u201d). Where \u201cstate personnel\u201d are negligent, \u201cthe statute generally waives sovereign or governmental immunity and substitutes the liability of the State for the liability of the state employee committing the tort.\u201d <em>Lee v. Cline, </em>384 Md. 245, 262, 863 A.2d 297, 307 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Of greater significance\u2014at least for our purposes\u2014is House Bill 669\u2019s effect on \u00a7 12-101, the definitional section of the MTCA. Specifically, \u00a7 12-101(a) includes in the definition of \u201cstate personnel\u201d (for purposes of the MTCA), \u201can employee of a county who is assigned to a local department of social services, including a Montgomery County employee who carries out State programs administered under Title 3, Subtitle 4 of the Human Services Article.\u201d \u00a7 12-101(a)(7).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Further, \u00a7 12-101(b) provides that \u201ca unit of the State government includes the Montgomery County government to the extent that Montgomery County administers a State program under Title 3, Subtitle 4 of the Human Services Article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">On the other hand, while the State, in the definitional sections of the MTCA, seems to embrace its relationship with the Montgomery County DHHS, it seems to divorce itself by <em>talaq</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>from the County DHHS in another section of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>MTCA. That is, \u00a7 12-103.2\u2014added to the MTCA by House Bill 669\u2014provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a] tort claim shall be considered, defended, settled, and paid in the same manner as any other claim covered by the Montgomery County Self-Insurance Fund,\u201d and that \u201c[f]or tort claims, the duties, responsibilities, and liabilities of the [State] Treasurer ... shall be assumed by the Montgomery County Self-Insurance Fund.\u201d \u00a7 12-103.2(b), (d)(2). It is these \u201cmixed signals\u201d that serve as the basis for the legal dispute in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">While the State was transitioning away from a state-affiliated local Department of Social Services, it did not relinquish complete control over provision of state services in the County. For one, as stated in the Fiscal Note to H.B. 669, \u201c[t]he administration of State programs by Montgomery County Government will continue to be governed by State regulations.\u201d <em>See </em>COMAR 07.02.07 <em>et seq. </em>(2010). Section 3-401(1) of Maryland Code (2007), Human Services Article\u2014added to what was then Article 88A by House Bill 669\u2014provides that \u201cthe purpose of this subtitle is to provide better integrated, more efficient, and accountable human services delivery in Montgomery County <em>by the State </em>and county.... \u201d (Emphasis added.) Regarding funding of the programming now to be administered by the County, \u00a7 3-403 of Maryland Code (2007), Human Services Article\u2014also added to the MTCA by House Bill 669\u2014provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-6\">the Secretary shall enter into a grant agreement with the Montgomery County government for the administration in Montgomery County of programs administered in other counties by local departments .... [that shall] ... provide for payment to Montgomery County for the costs of administering State programs ... [,including] salaries, overhead, general liability coverage, workers\u2019 compensation, and employee benefits....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-7\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3-403(a), (b)(l)(i). Finally, the State maintains a degree of oversight over the Montgomery County DHHS in its administration of the formerly state-run programs. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3-405 (\u201cThe Secretary and the County Executive of Montgomery County shall consult with each other at least every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>other year to ensure that the objectives of the social service and public assistance programs ... are consistent with the objectives of the State social service and public assistance programs.\u201d). With this considerable prologue in mind, we turn to the contentions in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">III. The Present Case</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">It is important first to restate the parties\u2019 contentions. Menefee argues primarily that the State is a proper party to the present litigation, considering that \u00a7 12-101 of the MTCA includes expressly (1) Montgomery County employees (who carry out State programs administered under Title 3, Subtitle 4 of the Human Services Article) within the definition of \u201cstate personnel\u201d; and (2) Montgomery County (as an entity) within the definition of \u201cstate unit\u201d (also subject to the aforementioned caveat). Thus, Menefee perceives that because the State, in the MTCA, waives its sovereign and governmental immunity and assumes liability when Montgomery County or its employees (carrying out State programs administered under Title 3, Subtitle 4 of the Human Services Article) are negligent, the State must be a proper party to the present litigation. This conclusion, he argues, is bolstered by the fact that the State funds, to an extent, and maintains oversight over the provision of state services transferred from the State to the County government. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2007), Human Servs. Art., \u00a7\u00a7 3-403, 3-405.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>The State relies primarily on \u00a7 12-103.2, which provides that any tort claims arising from Montgomery County\u2019s administration of those social services programs \u201cshall be considered, defended, settled, and paid in the same manner as any other claim covered by the Montgomery County Self-Insurance Fund,\u201d and that \u201cthe duties, responsibilities, and liabilities of the [State] Treasurer under this subtitle shall be assumed by the Montgomery County Self-Insurance Fund.\u201d \u00a7 12-103.2(b), (d)(2). The State argues, then, that because \u00a7 12-103.2 \u201cwas enacted as part of a comprehensive shifting of responsibility from the State to the County,\u201d that the State \u201chas no legal responsibility for these claims\u201d is a compelled conclusion. In responding to the Menefees\u2019 argument vis \u00e1 vis \u00a7 12-101, the State contends that Montgomery County and its employees are considered a \u201cstate unit\u201d and \u201cstate personnel,\u201d respectively, so that, as part of the \u201cshifting of responsibility for certain human services programs to Montgomery County, liability falls on the County on the terms set forth in the MTCA.\u201d Further, the State points out that even in \u00a7 12-101(a)(7)\u2014the provision including Montgomery County personnel carrying out State programs administered under Title 3, Subtitle 4 of the Human Services Article as \u201cstate personnel\u201d\u2014that such County employees, while being \u201cstate personnel\u201d for purposes of the MTCA, remain \u201cMontgomery County employees in fact,\u201d considering \u00a7 12-101(a)(7) states that \u201c \u2018state personnel\u2019 means ... an <em>employee of a county </em>who is assigned to a local department of social services, including a <em>Montgomery County employee </em>.... \u201d (Emphasis added). In effect, then, both the Menefees and the State hang their respective hats on different statutory hooks of the MTCA\u2014 \u00a7 12-101 for Menefee; \u00a7 12-103.2 for the State\u2014and attempt to discredit the opposition\u2019s understanding of its respective hook.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>We subscribe to Menefee\u2019s understanding of the complex relationship between the State of Maryland and the Montgomery County DHHS. We are not as persuaded by the fact that Montgomery County or its employees carrying out State programs administered under Title 3, Subtitle 4 of the Human Service Article are considered a \u201cstate unit\u201d or \u201cstate personnel,\u201d as we are by the effects of such being included in the definitions. That is, the State waives immunity and assumes liability for the County and/or its employees (as they are a \u201cstate unit\u201d and \u201cstate personnel,\u201d respectively) acting negligently when administering social-service programming under Title 3, Subtitle 4 of the Human Service Article. Keeping in mind that the important principle of statutory interpretation is to construe statutes in a manner that is not \u201cabsurd, illogical, or incompatible with common sense,\u201d <em>Lockshin v. Semsker, </em>412 Md. 257, 276, 987 A.2d 18, 29 (2010); <em>see Taylor v. Mandel, </em>402 Md. 109, 128-29, 935 A.2d 671, 682 (2007) (\u201c[Wlhenever possible, an interpretation should be given to the statutory provisions which does not lead to absurd consequences.\u201d), we think construing the MTCA\u2014a statutory scheme in which the State waives sovereign and governmental immunity and assumes liability for Montgomery County\u2014such as to leave the State immune from suit <em>(i.e. </em>not a proper party) for the negligent acts of the County is \u201cabsurd, illogical, [and] incompatible with common sense.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Lockshin, </em>412 Md. at 276, 987 A.2d at 29. We think it would be inconsistent to say, on one hand, that the State has assumed liability for certain County employees, yet say, on the other hand, that it has no \u201cdirect interest\u201d in the litigation. <em>See Ugast, </em>189 Md. at 232, 55 A.2d at 708. This conclusion, as Menefee argues, is bolstered by the fact that the State funds to an extent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>maintains oversight over the services transferred from the State to the County government. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2007), Human Servs. Art., \u00a7 3-403(a), (b)(l)(i) (\u201c[T]he Secretary shall enter into a grant agreement with the Montgomery County government for the administration in Montgomery County of programs administered in other counties by local departments .... [that shall] ... provide for payment to Montgomery County for the costs of administering State programs ... [,including] salaries, overhead, general liability coverage, workers\u2019 compensation, and employee benefits.... \u201d); <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3-405 (\u201cThe Secretary and the County Executive of Montgomery County shall consult with each other at least every other year to ensure that the objectives of the social service ... programs administered by the Montgomery county government are consistent with the objectives of the State social service ... programs.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">To be sure, \u00a7 12-103.2(b) does provide that claims relating to Montgomery County\u2019s administration of a State program under Title 3, Subtitle 4 of the Human Services Article are to \u201cbe considered, defended, settled, and paid in the same manner as any other claim covered by the Montgomery County Self-Insurance Fund.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Nowhere in the statute, however, does it state that Montgomery County alone is the proper named party in a suit under these circumstances; or, stated differently, nowhere in the statute does it state that the State of Maryland is not a proper party to such a suit.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus, \u00a7 12-103.2 does not save the day for the State. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>we disagree with the State\u2019s contention that \u201cthe State has no <em>legal </em>responsibility for these claims.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is this potential \u201clegal responsibility\u201d or \u201cliability in law\u201d for these claims that requires the conclusion that the State is a proper party defendant to the present litigation.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">We conclude that the General Assembly\u2014in waiving sovereign and governmental immunity and assuming liability for certain acts of Montgomery County and its employees when administering social-service programming under Title 3, Subtitle 4 of the Human Service Article\u2014did not intend to preclude the State from being a proper party to a lawsuit stemming from those services now performed by the Montgomery County DHHS. \u201cIf the General Assembly did not so intend, it can amend or repeal the statute.\u201d <em>Ali v.

As explained <em>supra </em>at note 9, before the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, the State also argued in its motion to dismiss that Menefee had not met \u00a7 12-106\u2019s requirement that a complaining party submit a written notice of claim to the State Treasurer within one year.

The State\u2019s motion to dismiss in the present litigation also alleged that Menefees' claim was barred by \u00a7 12-106\u2019s requirement that a complaining party submit a written claim to the State Treasurer within one year. In the State\u2019s view, the harm occurred on 6 September 2004 (the date Sheila was killed in her son\u2019s presence), and, thus, a claim submitted to the Treasurer in August of 2008 was not timely. In response, the Menefees argue that the harm did not occur until 23 October 2007, when John Damien was diagnosed with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. Because the issue relating to the limitations period for submitting a claim to the Treasurer was not briefed by either party, it is not, at present, before this Court. <em>See Navarro-Monzo </em>v. <em>Washington Adventist Hosp., </em>380 Md. 195, 200 n. 3, 844 A.2d 406, 409 n. 3 (2004) (\"Because that issue was not raised or briefed by the parties, we shall address the issue that <em>was </em>raised and reserve the [other] question for another time.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b776-8\">.

Menefee argues also that (according to his understanding) the necessary consequence of the State's argument\u2014that \u201cin order to be compensated for tortious acts of HHS personnel, Mr. Menefee was not permitted to take advantage of the MTCA\u2019s voluntary waiver of immunity, but was instead required to abide by the Local Government Tort Claims Act, and name Montgomery County as the defendant in the matter''\u2014is \"arbitrary and capricious and denies John Menefee\u2019s right to equal protection under the law as it requires John Menefee to comply with two notice provisions <em>only </em>because he lives in Montgomery County, as opposed to any other county in the State of Maryland.\u201d The State, in its brief, takes issue with the premise that Menefee would be forced to comply with two notice provisions, stating that \"[w]ithout the amendments to the definitional provisions of the MTCA, the County department and its employees would fall under the Local Government Tort Claims Act [alone].\u201d Because we dispose of this case on non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>constitutional grounds, we do not reach this claim, invoking the principle that \"we will not reach a constitutional issue when a case can properly be disposed of on a non-constitutional ground.\" <em>Parker v.

Despite arguing that it is not a proper party to the present litigation, the State conceded, at oral argument before this Court, that, under the circumstances plead here, the State Treasurer is the proper official to whom the required written notice of claim under the MTCA should be sent, when suing Montgomery County or its employees. Requiring a claimant to submit a written notice of claim to the State when it could not sue the State ultimately is another absurd result that our construction will avoid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b787-6\">. The Montgomery County Self-Insurance Fund was created to \u201ccompensate for injury to persons or damage to property resulting from negligence or other wrongful acts of the county's public officials.

While it may seem, at first blush, peculiar that the State is a proper party to a suit for which it has no obligation to defend or pay directly any judgment flowing therefrom, such a scenario is not unprecedented. The County, in the present scenario, is akin to an insurance company under a comprehensive liability policy, which has the contractual duty to defend its insured and pay any judgments entered against the insured (that relate to its contractual relationship). The proper party to such lawsuits is usually the insured, not the insurance company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b788-6\">. Menefee, in his brief, argued also:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-7\">Even on its face the statute relied upon by Maryland is irrelevant. [Section] 12-103.2 defines \"tort claim\u201d as a \"tort claim in State court against the Montgomery County Government.\u201d \u00a7 12.103.2(a). This is not a \"tort claim filed in State court against the Montgomery County government.\u201d Instead, it is a tort claim filed in State court against the State of Maryland. This statute is inapplicable to the instant case. [Section] 12-103.2 simply states that <em>if </em>Montgomery Counly is a party, then this section applies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">As the State explained at oral argument before the Circuit Court, \"the argument is here, you can get around 12-103.2 simply by not naming Montgomery County as the defendant\u201d and that one \"can just not name Montgomery County, and then I get out from under 12-103.2.\u201d We agree with the State on this point and refuse to give \u00a7 12-103.2 a reading that allows a plaintiff to circumvent its provisions by simply naming a party other than the County. If this were the case, and if we were to conclude that \u00a7 12-103.2 is irrelevant wholly to the present case merely because Menefee named the State as a party, it would necessitate a conclusion that Montgomery County would not be liable financially for any negligence, as \u00a7 12-103.2 provides. It is abundantly clear from House Bill 669 and its accompanying legislative history that the Legislature intended the County, through its Self-Insurance Fund, to be liable financially for any judgment flowing from the acts of the County or its employees administering social-service programming under Title 3, Subtitle 4 of the Human Services Article. Whether, and how, the County and State account for the County\u2019s costs for supplying a defense against Menefee's claims and satisfying any judgment (or settlement) that results, is more obviously a matter of negotiation for the grant application and funding process contemplated between the two tiers of government.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
