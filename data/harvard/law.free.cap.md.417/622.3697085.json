According to Mark Bohlman, M.D. (who is participating as an Appellee \u201cIndividually and as President on behalf of The Maryland Radiological Society, Inc.\u201d), the proper question is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\">Whether or not the Board Erred in Ruling that a Referral by an Orthopaedic Physician for an MRI to be Performed on or by an MRI Machine Owned or Leased by the Orthopaedic Practice is an Illegal Self-Referral within the Meaning of the Maryland Self referral Law and was not Exempt under the Exemptions set out in \u00a7 l-302(d)(2), (3) or (4) of the Health Occupations Article of the Maryland Annotated Code[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">According to the Board, the proper question is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">Do the three exceptions in HO \u00a7 1\u2014302(d)(2), (3) and (4) to the general statutory prohibition against physician self-referrals apply to a physician\u2019s referral of a patient for MRI imaging on a machine in which that physician\u2019s practice has a beneficial financial interest?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>For the reasons that follow, we hold that the Board\u2019s Declaratory Ruling was correct, and therefore affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">The Board\u2019s Declaratory Ruling included the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">INTRODUCTION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">This Declaratory Ruling arises out of two formal petitions, separately filed by CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield and The Injured Workers\u2019 Insurance Fund. These petitions ask the Board for a ruling on the propriety under the Maryland Self Referral Law of referrals made by physicians for MRI scans when that physician has a financial interest in the performance of that scan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">BACKGROUND</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-9\">[T]he cases reviewed by the Board ... indicate that a common factual scenario exists among some Maryland orthopaedic practice groups with respect to referrals for MRI services. The common factual scenario is set out below. Additionally, the Board has found several relevant variations to the general fact pattern that occur frequently in Maryland. The Board will rule on those as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-10\">General Fact Pattern</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-11\">A patient is seen by an orthopaedic physician who has a beneficial financial interest in the orthopaedic practice. The patient may have been referred to the orthopedist by another physician, or the patient may have come directly to the orthopaedic physician. The orthopaedic physician makes a referral for an MRI scan. The patient receives the MRI a few days or weeks later on an MRI machine that is owned and operated by, or leased by, the orthopaedic physician\u2019s practice. The MRI image may be read in-house or may be sent to an off-site radiologist to read. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>An off-site radiologist may state his or her findings in a radiology report and forward the report back to the orthopaedic physician. The referring orthopaedic physician\u2019s practice submits a bill for the MRI as the provider of the MRI scan (though not necessarily as the provider of the interpretation of the scan).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-4\">Additionally, the Board found the following variations to this fact pattern. The following are modified fact patterns which may also occur in significant numbers in this State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">VARIATION 1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">Same as the general fact pattern, but the orthopaedic physician obtains a signed Maryland Uniform Consultation Referral Form from the patient\u2019s primary care physician after the orthopedic physician determined that the MRI was necessary, but before the MRI was actually conducted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-7\">The primary care physician does not, between the time that the orthopaedic physician determines that the MRI is necessary and the time that the MRI was accomplished, see the patient for the purpose of determining if the MRI is necessary, nor does he or she exercise independent medical judgment as to whether the MRI is appropriate or necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-8\">VARIATION 2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">Same as the general fact pattern, but the orthopaedic physician names the primary care physician as the \u201creferring physician\u201d in the Health Insurance Claim Form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-10\">The primary care physician does not, between the time that the orthopaedic physician determines that the MRI is necessary and the time that the MRI was accomplished, see the patient for the purpose of determining if the MRI is necessary, nor does he or she exercise independent medical judgment as to whether the MRI is appropriate or necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>VARIATION 3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-4\">Same as the general fact pattern, but a physician who is an employee of the medical practice that provides the MRI scan evaluates the patient and orders the MRI to be done by that practice. The physician-employee does not have any beneficial interest in the medical practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">ANALYSIS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">. The Purpose of the Self-Referral Law</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-7\">The Maryland Self-Referral Law was enacted during the 1993 legislative session as House Bill 1280 (HB 1280). The Legislative history shows that HB 1280 was part of a statutory scheme designed to address two problems plaguing health care in Maryland: \u201caccess to health insurance and escalating health care costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-8\">There seems to be little question that the legislature intended by this bill to substantially restrict the practice of self-referring, especially self-referrals of MRI scans, CAT scans and radiation therapy services. The Self-Referral Law thus created a broad and pervasive prohibition against self-referrals not only by physicians (as did the federal law) but also all by all other health care providers. In addition, and again unlike the federal law, the Maryland prohibition covered every type of health care service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-9\">The Maryland-Self Referral Law first flatly bans any self-referral and any arrangement or scheme which has a principal purpose of accomplishing self-referrals:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-10\">(a) <em>Prohibited </em>referrals.\u2014Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, a health care practitioner may not refer a patient, or direct an employee of or a person under contract with the health care practitioner, to refer a patient to a health care entity:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>(1) [I]n which the health care practitioner or the practitioner in combination with the practitioner\u2019s immediate family owns a beneficial interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-4\">(2) In which the practitioner\u2019s immediate family owns a beneficial interest of 3 percent or greater; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">(3) With which the health care practitioner, the practitioner\u2019s immediate family, or the practitioner in combination with the practitioner\u2019s immediate family has a compensation arrangement....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">(b) <em>Payment </em>prohibited.\u2014A health care entity or a referring health care practitioner may not present or cause to be presented to any individual, third party payor, or other person a claim, bill or other demand for payment for health care services provided as a result of a referral prohibited by this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">(c) <em>Applicability of </em>svbsection(a).-\u2014Subsection (a) of this section applies to any arrangement or scheme, including a cross-referral arrangement, which the health care practitioner knows or should know has a principal purpose of assuring indirect referrals that would have [been] in violation of subsection (a) of this section if made indirectly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">Md. Health Occ.Code Ann. \u00a7 1-302 (cited hereafter by section \u201c\u00a7\u201d only.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">Because the general rule is so broad and sweeping, numerous exceptions had to be made to accommodate situations in which there is no significant threat of overutilization. Each of the three exceptions at issue in this case generally permits referrals where there is little incentive for a physician to self-refer for financial gain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-10\">This Declaratory Ruling will deal with the three exceptions contained in \u00a7 l-302(d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4), as they apply to the fact patterns developed in this case. In interpreting these exceptions, the Board has complied with the following statutory construction rules. The statute should be interpreted \u201cwith reference to the purpose to be accomplished.\u201d <em>State v. Fabritz, </em>276 Md. 416, 421[, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>348 A.2d 275, 278] (1975). The statute must be considered \u201cin its entirety, in the context of the purpose underlying its enactment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The interpretation must seek to harmonize the statute as a whole. <em>In re Steven [Stephen </em>] <em>K, </em>289 Md. 294, 298[, 424 A.2d 153, 155] (1975[1981]). Language of an individual part of a statute must be interpreted \u201cin relation to all its provisions,\u201d and the interpretation must \u201charmonize individual selections as parts of a whole.\u201d <em>Burghout [Barghout </em>] <em>v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>325 Md. 311, 317[, 600 A.2d 841, 844] (1992). The statute must be interpreted \u201cas a whole[ ] so that no word, clause[, sentence,] or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u201d <em>Lawson v. State, </em>389 Md. 570, 583[, 886 A.2d 876, 883] (2005).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-4\">Although, as the parties argue, the statute is \u201cextraordinarily complex,\u201d this does not in the Board\u2019s opinion relieve the Board of its responsibility to interpret it. The statute should be interpreted consistently with its overall purpose, taking into account all parts of the statute and without rendering any particular part of the statute meaningless or superfluous. <em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">1. Exception \u00a7 l-302(d)(2)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\">(d) The provisions of this section do not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">(2) A health care practitioner who refers a patient to another health care practitioner in the same group practice as the referring health care practitioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-9\">\u00a7 l-301(d)(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-10\">The Board finds that the exception contained in (d)(2) was intended to create an exception for referrals that transfer <em>a patient, </em>permanently or temporarily, from one health care practitioner in a group practice to another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-11\">If this exception did not exist, the Self Referral Law would prohibit a physician from referring a patient to another member of the group practice in any situation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>even when a physician is simply going out of town and refers a patient temporarily to his or her partner....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-4\">____The Board concludes that exception (d)(2) simply allows the transfer of the professional responsibility for the patient\u2019s continued care, including professional decision-making about the course of that care, to another physician within the same group practice. Exception (d)(2) thus does not exempt referrals for specific \u201cservices or tests\u201d already chosen by the referring physician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">Some of the parties have argued that, because the term \u201creferral\u201d is defined broadly in \u00a7 1-301(1), the term \u201crefers a patient\u201d in (d)(2) must also be defined that broadly. The Board disagrees.... Since the words \u201cservices or tests\u201d are not used in (d)(2), the Board concludes that (d)(2) was not intended to apply to services or tests that the referring physician has already determined are necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">.... The only way to read (d)(2) and (d)(4)(i)(2) together so that they both have meaning is to read (d)(2) to apply to the referral to a physician in the same group practice of a <em>patient, </em>but not for \u201cservices\u201d or \u201ctests\u201d already determined necessary by the referring physician. This interpretation thus harmonizes these exceptions and at the same time is in accordance with the overall purpose of the Self referral Law to prevent self-referrals in situations where the opportunity for financial gain from referrals brings about a risk of overutilization.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-8\">.... A referral for MRI scan is a referral for a service or test, not a referral of a \u201cpatient\u201d within the meaning of (d)(2). MRI scans are thus not covered at all by exception (d)(2), because that exception deals with referrals of a patient and not with referrals for \u201cservices or tests.\u201d The referrals for MRI scans made by the physicians in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>this case, to the extent that they result in an MRI scan in which the referring physician has a beneficial interest, are not exempted from the Maryland Self Referral Law by exception (d)(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-4\">2. Exception \u00a7 l-302(d)(3)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">(d) The provisions of this section do not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">(3) A health care practitioner with a beneficial interest in a health care entity who refers a patient to that health care entity for health care services or tests, if the services or tests are personally performed by or under the direct supervision of the referring health care practitioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">\u00a7 l-302(d)(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-8\">The Board finds that the exception contained in \u00a7 1-302(d)(3) was intended to create an exemption for referrals of a patient for services or tests to a health care entity that is outside of the referring physician\u2019s practice, even if the referring physician holds a beneficial interest in the outside entity, so long as the physician is personally present within the treatment area when the service is performed and either personally providing the service or directly supervising that service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-9\">Exception (d)(3) appears to parallel the AMA policy that the legislature intended to implement. First, the AMA policy applies only where the physician has an investment interest; likewise (d)(3) only applies where the physician has a beneficial interest. Second, the AMA policy requires the physician to \u201cdirectly render services\u201d at the outside entity; likewise, (d)(3) requires the physician to personally perform or directly supervise the service or test while present at the entity.\u201d Exception (d)(3) was intended to parallel the AMA policy; it therefore creates an exception that permits a physician in certain circumstances to refer patients to an outside entity in which he or she holds a beneficial interest. Exception (d)(3) does not, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>permit a physician to refer to his or her own in-office practice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-4\">MRIs are \u201cservice or tests.\u201d Exception (d)(3), however, applies only to referrals for services or tests to outside entities and not to in-office referrals within the group practice of the referring practitioner. Exception (d)(3) thus does not apply to in-office referrals by physicians for MRI scans to be provided by their own practices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">3. Exception (d)(4)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">(d) The provisions of this section do not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">(4) A health care practitioner who refers in-office ancillary services or tests that are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">(i) Personally furnished by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\">(1) The referring health care practitioner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-10\">(2) A health care practitioner in the same group practice as the referring health care practitioner; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-11\">(3) An individual who is employed and personally supervised by the qualified referring health care practitioner or a health care practitioner in the same group practice as the referring health care practitioner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-12\">(ii) Provided in the same building where the referring health care practitioner or a health care practitioner in the same group practice as the referring health care practitioner furnishes services; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-13\">(iii) Billed by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-14\">(1) The health care practitioner performing or supervising the services; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-15\">(2) A group practice of which the health care practitioner performing or supervising the services is a member.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-16\">\u00a7 l-302(d)(4).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-17\">(1) \u201cIn-office ancillary services\u201d means those basic health care services and tests routinely performed in the office of one or more health care practitioners. (2) Except for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>radiologist group practice or an office consisting solely of one or more radiologists, \u201cin-office ancillary services does not include: (i) Magnetic resonance imaging services; (ii) Radiation therapy services; or (iii) Computer tomography scan services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\">H.O. \u00a7 l-301(k)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">Significantly for this case, exception (d)(4) by definition does not include MRI, CAT scan, or radiation therapy services. Thus, no detailed analysis of (d)(4) is needed except possibly to shed light on the meaning of all three of the exceptions when read together. The first and most obvious consideration is that the legislature\u2019s clear language excluding self-referred MRIs from being exempted under (d)(4) makes it highly improbable that the legislature simultaneously intended to permit the same self-referred MRIs under (d)(2) or (d)(3). In this statutory context, an overly broad reading of (d)(2) or (d)(3) so as to make them overrule (d)(4) would make no common sense. The second consideration is that (d)(4) appears to round out the legislature\u2019s scheme of three discrete but meaningful exceptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">Unlike (d)(2), which does not deal with \u201cservices or tests\u201d at all, and (d)(3), which deals with \u201cservices or tests\u201d referred to outside entities, the exception in (d)(4) was intended to create an exception for referrals for \u201cservices or tests\u201d within the referring practitioner\u2019s practice. The Board finds that \u201cin-office\u201d means within the practice. Exception (d)(4) is thus the only exception for referrals for \u201cservices or tests\u201d within the referring physician\u2019s practice. If a referral is for a \u201cservice\u201d or \u201ctest\u201d and is made in-office, it must meet the requirements of (d)(4). This result follows logically from the discussion above, in which the Board analyzed exceptions (d)(2) and (d)(3) and found that neither of them dealt with \u201cservices\u201d or \u201ctests\u201d performed in-office. The three provisions apply to discrete situations and provide limited but meaningful exceptions without contradicting each other or violating the legislative intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Exceptions (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-4\">Summary of Findings</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">The Board concludes that \u00a7 l-302(d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) were intended to apply in separate and distinct factual scenarios. Exception (d)(2) was intended to cover referrals \u201cof a patient\u201d within a group practice. Exception (d)(3) was intended to cover referrals for \u201cservices or tests\u201d to an entity that is outside of the referring physician\u2019s practice. Exception (d)(4) was intended to cover referrals made for \u201cservices and tests\u201d that are basic, \u201croutine\u201d and rendered within the referring physician\u2019s practice, but not including MRIs. Read together, these exceptions are narrow and meaningful, do not overlap or contradict each other, and are consistent with the legislature\u2019s intent of permitting exceptions only when the danger of overutilization is small. This conclusion is the same as that reached by the Attorney General. <em>See </em>89 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 10 (2004) (referrals for MRIs to be performed on machines owned or leased by the referring practitioner\u2019s practice violate the Self Referral Law) and 91. Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 49 (2006) (exception (d)(3) does not apply to in-office referrals).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-6\"><em>Injured Workers\u2019 Insurance Fund, et al. v.

Appellants also argue that the Board erred in concluding that the \u201cdirect supervision\u201d exemption is only applicable when the referring physician has (1) referred the patient to an \u201coutside\u201d health care entity, and (2) \u201cis personally present within the treatment area when the service is performed and either personally providing the service or directly supervising that service.\u201d These arguments require that we yet again \u201cgo hunting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>ghost of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Franklin Square Hospital v. Laubach, </em>818 Md. 615, 619, 569 A.2d 693, 695 (1990). As we do so, we are aided by two Opinions of the Attorney General, as well as by an extensive legislative history, which includes significant \u201clegislative inaction\u201d by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">In <em>Chesek v. Jones, </em>406 Md. 446, 959 A.2d 795 (2008), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">We have said that courts are not bound by an Attorney General\u2019s Opinion, but that \u201cwhen the meaning of legislative language is not entirely clear, such legal interpretation should be given great consideration in determining the legislative intention.\u201d <em>State v. Crescent Cities Jaycees, </em>330 Md. 460, 470, 624 A.2d 955, 960 (1993); <em>see also Drug &amp; Chem. Co. v. Claypoole, </em>165 Md. 250, 257, 166 A. 742, 745 (1933). The Legislature is presumed to be aware of the Attorney General\u2019s statutory interpretation and, in the absence of enacting any change to the statutory language, to acquiesce in the Attorney General\u2019s construction. <em>See Claypoole, supra, </em>165 Md. at 257-58, 166 A. at 742.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 463, 959 A.2d at 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The Attorney General has concluded that there is no merit in either of Appellants\u2019 arguments. In 2004, while opining that \u201cthe [Maryland Self-Referral Law] bars a physician in the orthopedic practice from referring patients for tests on an MRI machine or CT scanner owned by that practice, regardless of whether the services are performed by a radiologist employee or member of the practice or by an independent radiology group,\u201d the Attorney General stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">\u201cNor would [an orthopedic surgeon\u2019s referral of his or her patient to another physician in the practice for an MRI or CT scan] fall within the exception in \u00a7 l-302(d)(2) for referrals within a group practice. Such an interpretation would render meaningless the precise limitations that the Legislature created in \u00a7 l-302(d)(4), which would encompass certain referrals within a group practice, and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>would offend elementary principles of statutory construction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">89 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 10,17 n. 8 (Jan. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Two years later, in 91 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 49 (Jan. 2006), while reaffirming the 2004 Opinion, the Attorney General stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-6\">The [2004] opinion concluded that the referral could not fall within the exception for referral for in-office ancillary services where the definition of that term specifically excludes MRI and CT scan services.... The [2004] opinion further concluded that the referral could not fall within the exception for referrals within the same group practice, as such a construction would \u201crender meaningless the precise limitations that the Legislature created in \u00a7 l-302(d)(4), which encompasses certain referrals within group practices, and this would offend elementary principles of statutory construction\u201d 89 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General </em>10, 17, n. 8 (2004).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-7\">It is a well-established rule of statutory construction that a statute should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory.... Moreover, statutes are to be interpreted in accord with logic and common sense.... If the intention of Health Occupations \u00a7 l-302(d)(3) were to permit referral to an MRI or CT scanner, or any other service performed within the office or group practice of the referring practitioner, the careful definition of \u201cgroup practice\u201d in \u00a7 l-301(f), which limits the extent of the \u00a7 l-302(d)(2) exception for referrals within a group practice, and the \u201cprecise limitations\u201d on the ability to refer for in-office ancillary services in \u00a7 l-302(d)(4) would be rendered meaningless. The specific language removing MRI machines and CT scanners from the scope of in-office ancillary services would have no effect so long as the physician directly supervised the provisions of the services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-8\">Rather than read the statute in such a way as to render \u00a7 l-302(d)(2) and (4) virtually meaningless, it is my view that \u00a7 l-302(d)(3) must be limited to instances where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>referral is to an entity outside the practice of the referring practitioner. Support for this reading is found not only in the AMA Policy Statement discussed above, but also in the fact that the exception applies only where the practitioner has a beneficial interest in the health care entity, and not where there is a compensation arrangement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 50-53 (citations and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The legislative history of H.B. 1280 includes (1) the House Environmental Matters Committee Floor Report, and (2) the testimony presented by Del. Ronald A. Guns, Sponsor of H.B. 1280, to the Senate Economic &amp; Environmental Affairs Committee. It is clear from that history that the General Assembly intended to exclude MRI and CT scans from the \u201cin-office ancillary services\u201d exemption. HO \u00a7 1-301 (k)(2) expressly provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-6\">Except for a radiologist group practice or an office consisting solely of one or more radiologists, \u201cin-office ancillary services\u201d does not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-7\">(i) Magnetic resonance imaging services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-8\">(ii) Radiation therapy services; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">(iii) Computer tomography scan services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-10\"> From our review of the record, we hold that the Board was correct in ruling that (1) the \u201cgroup practice\u201d exemption does not permit an orthopedic surgeon to refer his or her patient for a MRI or CT scan to be performed by another member of the orthopedic surgeon\u2019s practice group, and (2) the \u201cdirect supervision\u201d exemption, which is limited to referrals to \u201coutside\u201d entities, requires that the referring physician be \u201cpersonally present within the treatment area when the service is performed and either personally providing the service or directly supervising that service.\u201d As the Board and the Attorney General have pointed out, a contrary conclusion would offend several well established principles of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">Our conclusion is confirmed by the fact that, in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010, the General Assembly \u201crejected efforts to achieve legislatively that which we [are being] asked to grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>judicially.\u201d <em>Boblitz v.
