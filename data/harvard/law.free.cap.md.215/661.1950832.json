He \u25a0contends that the indictment was faulty and that he acted in self-defense. These matters are not open to review on <em>habeas corpus. </em>His chief complaint seems to be that he was paroled June 4, 1953, but returned for violating parole on June 12, 1956. The Board allowed him one-half the time spent on parole. He argues that the disallowance of the other time illegally extends his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-12\">The Board\u2019s action was within its discretion, and not illegal. <em>Creager v. Warden, </em>211 Md. 649; <em>Clark v. Warden, </em>213 Md. 641; Code (1957 Supp.), Art. 41, sec. 91H.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-13\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
