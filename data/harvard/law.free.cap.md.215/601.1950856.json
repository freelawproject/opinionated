Petitioner was represented by counsel, but complains that perjured testimony was used against him, and the evidence was legally insufficient. We have repeatedly stated that a claim of perjured testimony cannot be considered on <em>habeas </em>corpus, where there is no allegation of knowledge or collusion on the part of the State. <em>Lucas v. Warden, </em>211 Md. 626. Sufficiency of the evidence, or alleged irregularities in the trial, such as failure to list two witnesses called by the State, cannot be raised on <em>habeas corpus. </em>The final complaint, that the court did not ask petitioner if he had anything to say before sentence, is without merit. Even on direct appeal, it has been held that this would not constitute a reversible error. See <em>Dutton v. State, </em>123 Md. 373; <em>Duker v. State, </em>162 Md. 546; <em>Farrell v. State, </em>213 Md. 348; Note, 113 A. L. R. 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
