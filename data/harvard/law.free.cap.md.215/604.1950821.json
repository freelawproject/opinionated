He complains that the trial court would not appoint a lawyer for him and that he was denied the opportunity to contact certain witnesses in his behalf, and that these two denials combined to render his trial unfair and a violation of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">Thompson does not allege any facts which show that for want of counsel an ingredient of unfairness operated actively in the process which resulted in his confinement. <em>Bergen v. Warden, </em>201 Md. 641, 642; <em>Selby v. Warden, </em>201 Md. 653, 654. The denial of the opportunity to obtain some witnesses, although a proper ground on appeal, relates to the regularity rather than to the validity of the proceedings and likewise cannot be raised on <em>habeas corpus. Gayles v. Warden, </em>212 Md. 641, 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-17\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
