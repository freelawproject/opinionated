In his petition below he charged irregularities in the trial, including lack of eyewitnesses, failure to summon his witnesses, threats by officers to induce a confession, illegality of his arrest, failure to advise him of his rights, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>failure to grant a new trial. As we have repeatedly held, some of these matters might be reviewed on appeal, but none of them can be reviewed on <em>habeas corpus. </em>In his brief filed in this court petitioner now alleges that he was denied a right to appeal, and that the evidence of State\u2019s witnesses was perjured. Since neither of these contentions was made in the lengthy petition filed below, we cannot consider them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
