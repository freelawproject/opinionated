He contends that a confession was improperly obtained, and that the evidence was insufficient, or insufficiently corroborated. We have repeatedly held that such questions cannot be raised on <em>habeas corpus. </em>He also complains of the ineptness of his court-appointed lawyer, but does not allege that he complained to the court at the time of trial, or allege any facts that would amount to a denial of due process. A motion for new trial was heard and denied by the Supreme Bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
