He complains that the attorney he employed did not properly represent him, and that Judge Carter appointed the same attorney to represent his co-de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>fendant. Petitioner does not allege collusion or fraud, or that he made any objection in the trial court. <em>Hicks v. Warden, </em>213 Md. 625. The mere fact that the same attorney represented co-defendants is not a ground for relief. Nor is there any showing of prejudice. Cf. <em>Plater v. Warden, </em>211 Md. 629, 631. A complaint that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the conviction cannot be raised on <em>habeas corpus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
