He sought a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>from Judge Michaelson, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, on September 23, 1957, contending that the sentence for attempted burglary was illegal, in that it charged a \u201cnonexistent\u201d crime. Judge Michaelson held that the sentence was legal, since an attempt was indictable at common law, citing 1 <em>Wharton, Criminal Law </em>(12th Ed.), \u00a7 212. Cf. <em>Whitley v. Warden, </em>209 Md. 629 <em>(cert. </em>denied and appeal dism., 351 U. S. 929). Whether the question is open on <em>habeas corpus </em>may be doubted, since in essence the attack is upon the validity of the indictment and not upon the juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>diction of the court. Cf. <em>Superintendent v. Calman, </em>203 Md. 414, 420, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">While urging that the decision was correct, the Attorney General contends that the case is moot because the petitioner was released on parole on November 18, 1957. In <em>Jett v. Superintendent, </em>209 Md. 633, 636, we pointed out that it is generally held that a parolee is not entitled to the writ, citing the annotation in 148 A. L. R. 1243, although the case was disposed of on another ground. See also <em>Hendershott v. Young, </em>209 Md. 257, 261, where we cited many cases holding that a person on bail is not entitled to the writ. With the exception of Florida, the state courts seem to have uniformly held that a parolee is not entitled to the writ. See <em>Ex parte Herrera, </em>137 P. 2d 82 (Cal. App.) ; and <em>Commonwealth v. Burke, </em>90 A. 2d 849 (Pa. Super.). This has also been the rule in the federal courts. See <em>Van Meter v. Sanford, 99 </em>F. 2d 511 (C.C.A. 5th) ; <em>United States v. Cummings, </em>233 F. 2d 187 (C.A. 2d); <em>Wales v. Whitney, </em>114 U. S. 564, 569; <em>Weber v. Squier, </em>315 U. S. 810. A more recent Supreme Court decision casts some doubt upon the proposition, for in <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>346 U. S. 502, the court intimated that the federal statute should receive a broader interpretation to embrace applications in the nature of the writ of <em>coram nobis. </em>Cf. <em>Shelton v. United States, </em>242 F. 2d 101 (C.A. 5th). But whatever the scope of the federal statute may be, we think the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>is not available in Maryland under the circumstances of the instant case, and that the case is moot. As we pointed out in <em>Roberts v. Warden, 206 </em>Md. 246, 255, there are other means available to raise questions as to the legality of a sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
