As we have repeatedly held, the sufficiency of evidence cannot be raised on <em>habeas corpus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-16\">In his brief in this Court, the petitioner further complains of the alleged incompetency of his court-appointed counsel. We cannot consider questions not raised in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-17\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
