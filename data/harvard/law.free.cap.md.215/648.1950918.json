He was sentenced to a term of ten years. He contends that he did not know the car was stolen, and he was tried without his witnesses. It appears that he was represented by counsel. We have repeatedly held that questions of guilt or innocence cannot be retried on <em>habeas corpus, </em>and a bald allegation as to absence of witnesses is not sufficient to entitle petitioner to release.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">We cannot consider the other questions raised in the brief filed in this Court, as they were not raised below.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-16\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
