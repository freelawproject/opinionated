The affidavit of defense alleged that plaintiff: was in default. We. notice that the docket entries show that a plea of non-assumpsit was entered; that plea was abolished by section 3 of the Practice Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">May 20, 1927, a statutory demurrer under section 20 was filed, asserting that June 26, 1918 \u201can agreement of compromise [this contract will be found in the reporter\u2019s statement of the case] was entered into between the parties ...... and filed of record to the above stated number and term, a copy of which is hereto attached......\u201d and that the agreement \u2018 \u2018 constitutes a novation and is a bar to recovery .......\u201d While it was of course bad as a speaking demurrer, it does not appear to have been set down for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">At the trial the court held that the contract of 1916 declared on had been discharged by novation, \u2014 by the substitution of the contract of 1918, supra; \u2014 a non-suit was therefore entered; the refusal to take it off is the only error assigned. Was there such substitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">Plaintiff offered evidence to show that when suit was brought defendants had defaulted in delivery\u2014 that 581 tons were undelivered \u2014 and that plaintiff\u2019s damage resulting from supplying that deficiency by purchase in the market at higher prices was $1,545. The only witness called by plaintiff was shown the contract dated June 26, 1918 during cross-examination, and was asked by defendant\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-12\">\u201cQ. What contract was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>A. That was a conditional payment of the original contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-3\">Q. Isn\u2019t it true, Mr. Hett, that the contract with the Kelley Brothers Coal Co. and Gordon Brothers, Incorporated, under date of June 26, 1918, was a contract under which you undertook to settle all your differences with reference to this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-4\">A. Why, not by any means. They simply agreed at that time to enter into this contract for the privilege of supplying us with coal instead of paying us in cash. It was an accommodation arrangement for their payment of their indebtedness to us in coal instead of cash, and in no wise affected their other dealings with us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">It will be observed that the second agreement begins Avith the title to this suit Gordon Brothers, Inc. v. Kelley Brothers Coal Company, with a reference to the court, term and number, and proceeds \u201c...... that in settlement of th\u00a7 above stated claim......\u201d cash Avill be paid and 420.62 tons of coal delivered, the \u201csame as furnished to [plaintiff], as under a former contract between these parties, dated May 1, 1936, the quality of the coal to be judged solely by said [plaintiff].\u201d It is significant that it was \u201cagreed that on completion of the above stated agreement, and payment of record costs, that Gordon Brothers, Inc., the above named plaintiff, Avill discontinue and satisfy the above stated suit.\u201d The $200 cash payment was made and was credited to defendant on the claim for damages. Two ears of coal Avere shipped and were rejected by plaintiff because it \u201chad the appearance of being half earth and half coal;\u201d it \u201c......looked like just so much earth Avith a little coal mixed along with it.\u201d As the contract provided that \u201cthe quality of the coal to be judged solely by\u201d plaintiff, the rejection was final in the absence of bad faith. No further shipments Avere made.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>\"What effect had the second contract on the first? Appellant contends both remained effective together, and to support that view, points to the provision that when the second is performed, plaintiff \u201cwill discontinue and satisfy the above stated suit.\u201d Appellees contend that \u201cthe new contract . ______ constitutes a novation.\u201d If there was novation the first contract disappeared, became displaced and extinct (Wright v. Hanna, 210 Pa. 349, 353), there was substituted for the first, the second which thereafter became the only existing contract of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">We then inquire what intention, if any, have the parties expressed on the subject? Have they indicated whether they substituted one for the other, or whether the second was supplementary or collateral to the first? The answer seems clear in the quotation made; the parties agreed that when the second contract has been performed plaintiff \u201cwill discontinue and satisfy the above suit.\u201d Why keep the suit alive? It was founded on the original contract; if that contract was discharged by the second contract, the foundation of the action went with it, the purpose of the suit was accomplished and it would have been discontinued forthAAdth, if the intention had been as appellees contend. The suit was brought and had existed since 1917, to force defendants to perform their obligation to deliver the coal or to pay instead; as long as it existed it was plaintiff\u2019s declaration that the cause of action existed. \u201cLord Coke defined \u2018action\u2019 to be \u2018a legal demand of one\u2019s right,\u2019 and cause of action comprises every fact a plaintiff is obliged to prove in order to obtain judgment; or, conversely, every fact the defendant would have the right to traverse......\u201d Bradford v. Southern Rwy. Co., 195 U. S. 243, 248. And defendants must be taken so to have recognized it; for the second contract preseiwed in existence this cause of action, the breach of which was the foundation of the suit, by pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>viding for its displacement and extinction only after performance of the second contract. It was only then and in that contingency that the suit should be discontinued and satisfied, i. e. that the obligation of the first contract should be discharged of record. Certainly, if the suit was not discontinued, plaintiff could try it; if plaintiff could try it, the contract, the breach of which was the cause of action, must not be discharged and the intention of the parties must have been to keep it alive. Novation must clearly appear; it is not presumed; McCartney v. Kipp, 171 Pa. 644; here there is nothing to support the inference that it was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">As there was no conflict in facts, the parties having written their intention, the interpretation of the paper was for the court: Meaker Galvanizing Co. v. McInnes, 272 Pa. 561; the original contract was not discharged, it remained in force, modified of course by part performance accepted under the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Accord and satisfaction \u201cis distinguished from novation in that novation is a mode of extinguishing one obligation by another, that is, the acceptance of a new promise in satisfaction of a previously existing claim, while in the case of an accord and satisfaction it is not the new promise itself but the performance of the new promise that is accepted as a satisfaction,\u201d 1 R. C. L. 178; see too Foye v. Lilley Coal &amp; Coke Co., 251 Pa. 409, 416; Hosler v. Hursh, 151 Pa. 415, 422; Hearn v. Kiehl, 38 Pa. 147, 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Their writing shows that the parties dealt in accord and satisfaction and not in novation, and while they expressed an accord, that accord has not been executed: \u201c......the legal notion of accord is a new agreement on a new consideration to discharge the debtor. And it is not enough that there be a clear agreement or accord, and a sufficient consideration, but the accord must be executed. The plea must allege that the matter was accepted in satisfaction. Mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>readiness to perform the accord, or a tender of performance, or even a part performance and readiness to perform the rest, will not do.\u201d Hearn v. Kiehl supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\">Judgment reversed and new trial awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
