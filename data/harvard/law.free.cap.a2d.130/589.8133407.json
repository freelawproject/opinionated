The case was tried by the court and it found for both defendants. The appeal is from the judgment entered on this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-26\">A number of errors are assigned. In our opinion the situation presents a case wherein there was a conflict of testimony: the appellant\u2019s evidence tended to show the indebtedness; the evidence of the appellee Bessie Grajek a denial of such indebtedness by either appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-27\">We have recently reiterated a longstanding rule, namely, that \u201con factual issues our review is limited to determining whether the evidence furnished substantial support for the trial court\u2019s finding.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-28\">In an earlier case we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-29\"><em>\u201c* </em>* * We cannot weigh the evidence. Our review of the evidence is limited to determining whether it furnished substantial support for the trial court\u2019s finding. Here the parties squarely differed as to the terms of their agreement and as to many things that occurred thereafter. The issue was strictly factual. * * *\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-30\">The court, as it had the right to do, accepted the appellees\u2019 version of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>transactions; there was ample evidence to support its finding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">We think it unnecessary to discuss the other points raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-31\">.
