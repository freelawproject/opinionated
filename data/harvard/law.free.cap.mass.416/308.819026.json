Luongo (attorney). An order of temporary suspension of the attorney was entered by agreement on January 27, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-14\">The facts, to' which the attorney and bar counsel stipulated, show that the attorney mingled a client\u2019s funds with his own and that he intentionally deprived his client of the use of her funds, although only temporarily. Moreover, the attorney failed promptly to turn funds over to his client and to maintain appropriate records of his receipt, maintenance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>and disposition of that client\u2019s funds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In its decision, by a 9 - 1 vote, explaining why it recommended an indefinite suspension and rejected the three-year suspension recommended jointly by the attorney and bar counsel, the Board correctly stated that \u201c[t]he presumptive sanction for an attorney who intentionally uses client funds with intent to deprive (temporarily or permanently), or with actual deprivation, is disbarment or indefinite suspension. <em>Matter of Discipline of an Attorney, </em>392 Mass. 827, 836-837 (1984) (hereinafter cited as <em>Three </em>Attorneys); <em>Matter of Dawkins, </em>412 Mass. 90, 93 (1992). The Court placed a \u2018heavy burden\u2019 on the attorney to demonstrate that a lesser sanction than disbarment or indefinite suspension is warranted. <em>Dawkins, supra, </em>412 Mass, at 93, citing <em>Three Attorneys, supra. </em>The Court has routinely imposed indefinite suspension when a lawyer knowingly deprived his client of funds even temporarily.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We shall return to the question whether the attorney has met his \u201cheavy burden\u201d to demonstrate that a sanction less than an indefinite suspension should be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The Board next considered the fact that from March, 1990, until the spring of 1991, the attorney associated in the practice of law with one James Ryan, who falsely held himself out as admitted to practice in the Commonwealth. Ryan had been convicted of larceny of client funds and in 1985 had resigned from the Connecticut bar. The attorney learned of Ryan\u2019s status in November, 1990, but continued to associ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>ate with him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Funds that Ryan received were deposited to the firm\u2019s account and were used to pay the firm\u2019s expenses and to compensate the attorney. Moreover, the Board noted that because the attorney failed to supervise Ryan, Ryan was able to defraud clients and convert their funds. At the same time, the attorney neglected clients\u2019 cases.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Board concluded that an indefinite suspension was warranted for the attorney\u2019s association with Ryan.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The Board also relied on the attorney\u2019s failure to cooperate with bar counsel. The attorney agreed that he had failed to respond to bar counsel\u2019s inquiries, a factor that should be considered in the selection of the appropriate sanction. See <em>Matter of Garabedian, ante </em>20, 24-25 (1993). Finally, the Board noted that the attorney had been subject to prior discipline, a private reprimand in 1986, for taking an excessive fee and for neglecting to pursue a divorce complaint. See 5 Mass. Att\u2019y Discipline Rep. 447 (1986). Prior discipline is a relevant factor in selecting the appropriate disciplinary sanction. <em>Matter of Dawkins, supra </em>at 96-97, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>The facts that the attorney had improperly associated with a nonlawyer in the practice of law in the circumstances, that he had neglected the cases of various clients, that he had failed to cooperate with bar counsel, and that he had been subject to prior discipline, of course, do nothing to help the attorney meet his burden of showing that an indefinite suspension is not warranted because of his misuse of clients\u2019 funds. These facts, of course, all point in the other direction. See <em>Matter of Saab, </em>406 Mass. 315, 326-327 (1989) (consideration of cumulative effect of violations proper). Indeed, standing alone, the attorney\u2019s knowing participation in the practice of law with Ryan warrants at least a suspension from the practice of law, where the attorney obtained financial gain from the association and clients were defrauded. See ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions \u00a7\u00a7 7.1 &amp; 7.2 (1992) (ABA Standards).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In mitigation, the attorney points to assistance that he gave to the client from whom he temporarily deprived funds and to the fact that he eventually paid her $4,846 more than he owed her.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He also points to the fact that in November, 1989, he entered a treatment facility for people with substance abuse problems. There is no basis in the record, however, from which one could conclude that the attorney\u2019s alcoholism was a cause of any of his disciplinary violations. The attorney argues further that an indefinite suspension at his age is tantamount to a \u201clife sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We have never rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>ognized the asserted advanced age of an attorney as a substantial mitigating factor. Cf. <em>Matter of Bryan, </em>411 Mass. 288, 291 (1991) (attorney\u2019s youth and inexperience asserted as mitigating factor). We see no logical reason for making the advanced age of an attorney a significant factor in selecting the appropriate level of discipline. An older, experienced attorney should understand ethical obligations to a greater d\u00e9gree than a neophyte. See ABA Standards \u00a7 9.22 (i), listing \u201csubstantial experience in the practice of law\u201d as an aggravating factor. Compare ABA Standards \u00a7 9.32 (f), listing \u201cinexperience in the practice of law\u201d as a mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">An indefinite suspension is the appropriate discipline to impose. The attorney\u2019s multiple violations of his professional obligations, two of which standing alone call for a suspension, make our conclusion unavoidable. The facts asserted in mitigation do not come close to overcoming the presumptively appropriate sanction. We agree with the Board that a three-year suspension would be markedly disparate from the sanctions imposed in similar cases of (a) the intentional misuse of clients\u2019 funds with deprivation and (b) association with a nonlawyer to conduct legal business. However one may compare the facts of the attorney\u2019s deprivation of client funds in this case with the facts in other cases involving the misuse of client funds, in deciding the appropriate sanction the circumstances of the attorney\u2019s association with James Ryan in the unauthorized practice of law make the results of any comparison of sanctions unimportant.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">We consider one additional matter that has no influence on our reasoning, and the attorney does not argue that it should. As we mentioned at the outset of this opinion, the attorney and bar counsel agreed to the relevant facts and jointly recommended that the Board suspend the attorney from the practice of law for three years. The attorney, represented by counsel, acknowledged \u201cthat the Board of Bar Overseers is not bound by the parties\u2019 recommendation for discipline\u201d and that he was \u201cbound by the stipulation of facts regardless of the discipline recommended by the Board of Bar Overseers or imposed by the Supreme Judicial Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Our object is to impose the appropriate discipline. Neither this court nor the Board should give special force to recommendations of bar counsel as to the level of discipline because they are presented in conjunction with a joint stipulation of facts. The discretionary authority of this court and the Board cannot properly be restricted by the circumstances of the stipulation. It may be that the failure of the Board to follow such joint recommendations will cause attorneys to decline to take the risk of entering into stipulations in the future. But the attorney agreed to the arrangement that is presented to us. He obtained from bar counsel a recommendation more favorable to him than the Board or we could accept. Considering the seriousness of the attorney\u2019s disciplinary missteps, almost all of which appear to be demonstrable by objective facts, the attorney\u2019s ability to obtain bar counsel\u2019s support for the imposition of less than the presumptively appropriate sanction suggests that the stipulation may well have been a tactically sound move by the attorney and his counsel. The stipulation presents no basis, however, for imposing a sanction different from that which would be imposed where the facts were found by a hearing committee of the Board and thereupon bar counsel recommended to the Board a suspension from the practice of law for three years. The attorney does not argue otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Judgment shall be entered in the usual form suspending the attorney indefinitely from the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The attorney agreed that his conduct had violated S.J.C.
