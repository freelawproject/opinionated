The two provisions at issue are G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28, which provides for double compensation in cases of \u201cserious and wilful misconduct of an employer,\u201d and G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34B, which provides for a cost of living adjustment to compensation. There is no dispute that the employee, David T. Armstrong (claimant), is entitled to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>his basic compensation both doubled and supplemented by a cost of living adjustment. The question is whether he is entitled also to benefits produced by combining those two factors, that is, whether he is entitled to a doubling of the cost of living supplement. The board determined that he is not, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">We summarize the facts which are undisputed. On March 10, 1971, the claimant suffered a severe head injury. His employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer, Royal Globe Insurance Company (insurer), voluntarily paid, from the date of the claimant\u2019s injury, workers\u2019 compensation benefits under applicable provisions of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 34 &amp; 34A (providing compensation for, respectively, total incapacity and permanent and total incapacity). On May 11, 1977, the claimant filed a claim for doubled compensation under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28. The board determined that the claimant was entitled to doubled compensation, and that decision is not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">This case was initiated on February 2, 1987, when the claimant filed a claim for a cost of living adjustment to his compensation. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34B, as inserted by St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 43A. The claimant\u2019s claim for a cost of living adjustment was heard in a conference before an administrative judge. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A. The administrative judge decided that the claimant was entitled under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34B, to receive a cost of living adjustment to his compensation, but the judge denied \u201cthe claimant\u2019s claim for a [cost of living] supplement to his benefits under [G. L. c. 152,] \u00a7 28.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The claimant appealed pursuant to G. L. c. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>152, \u00a7 10A (3), and his claim was heard by the same administrative judge under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11. In the hearing, the judge determined that, under \u00a7\u00a7 28 and 34B, the claimant was entitled to receive a doubled cost of living adjustment. The insurer appealed this decision to the reviewing board pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11C.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The reviewing board reversed the decision of the administrative judge. Based on its decision in <em>Lumi\u2019s Case </em>(No. 37742-75), filed the same day,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the board decided that a cost of living adjustment under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34B, is not subject to doubling under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28. The claimant appealed the board\u2019s decision to a single justice of the Appeals Court pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12 (2), who reported the case to a panel of Justices of that court. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. Our review of the board\u2019s decision is governed by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. See <em>Lettich\u2019s Case, </em>403 Mass. 389, 395 (1988). In the context of the issue in dispute, we should disturb the board\u2019s decision only if it is \u201c[bjased upon an error of law.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) (c). Moreover, we are directed to \u201cgive due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">We begin with the language of the statutes at issue. General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 28, provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-7\">\u201cIf the employee is injured by reason of the serious and wilful misconduct of an employer or of any person regularly intrusted with and exercising the powers of superintendence, the amounts of compensation hereinafter provided shall be doubled. In case the employer is insured, he shall repay to the insurer the extra compensation paid to the employee. If a claim is made under this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>section, and the employer is insured, the employer may appear and defend against such claim only.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 34B (as amended through St. 1986, c. 662, \u00a7 30), provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-5\">\u201cAny person receiving or entitled to receive the benefits under the provisions of [G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31 or 34A] whose benefits are based on a date of personal injury at least twenty-four months prior to the review date shall be paid, without application, a supplement to weekly compensation to the extent such supplement shall not reduce any benefits such person is receiving pursuant to federal social security law.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">' The claimant\u2019s claim depends on an interpretation of \u00a7 28 under which that statute\u2019s reference to the doubling of \u201cthe amounts of compensation hereinafter provided\u201d includes the cost of living supplement provided under \u00a7 34B.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The cost of living adjustment was, at the times relevant to this case, defined in \u00a7 34B not as compensation, but as \u201ca supplement to weekly compensation.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus \u00e1 literal reading of the language of the two sections suggests that the cost of living adjustment is not to be treated as compensation in itself. This interpretation is supported by the only other case of which we are aware that considers whether cost of living adjustments are \u201ccompensation\u201d in the workers\u2019 compensation context.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number><footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Virginia Dep\u2019t of Highways &amp; Transp. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>1 Va. App. 349 (1986), the Court of Appeals of Virginia determined that cost of living supplements were not compensation within the meaning of a Virginia workers\u2019 compensation rule. <em>Id. </em>at 355-356. Although that case arose in the specific context of the Virginia rule, its treatment of the Virginia cost of living provision is instructive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">There is further reason to treat the cost of living adjustment differently from other workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The cost of living adjustment under \u00a7 34B is paid not by the insurer, but by a statutorily-created trust fund funded by all employers subject to the act. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 34B (c), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>65 (2).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This distinguishes it from compensation under other sections, which are generally paid by the insurer, or by the employer, if it is self-insured. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26 (employee \u201cshall be paid compensation by the insurer or self-insurer\u201d). Section 28, in fact, appears to contemplate that the compensation to which it will apply is that paid by insurers (or self-insurers) in its provision that \u201c[if] the employer is insured, he shall repay to the insurer the extra compensation paid to the employee.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because benefits under \u00a7\u00a7 31 and 34A are paid by the employer or its insurer, but cost of living adjustments to those benefits under \u00a7 34B are paid by the trust fund, we think that different treatment of the two classes of benefits is justified.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Thayer\u2019s Case, </em>345 Mass. 36, 42-44 (1962) (distinguishing compensation under \u00a7 28, which is paid by employer, from compensation under \u00a7 26, which is paid by insurer); <em>Kincaid </em>v. <em>Detroit Mut. Ins. Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>431 Mich. 426, 440 (1988) (\u201cthe term \u2018weekly compensation\u2019 and slight variations thereof are used ... to refer to that compensation which is the obligation of the employer,\u201d including, presumably, employer\u2019s insurer).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The source of funding specifically distinguishes the cost of living adjustment from medical benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 30, which we have decided are subject to the doubling provision of \u00a7 28. See <em>Boardman\u2019s Case, </em>365 Mass. 185 (1974). The claimant argues that it follows from that decision that cost of living adjustments should be doubled as well. We relied in <em>Boardman\u2019s Case, </em>however, on the similarities in the treatment of medical expenses and other workers\u2019 compensation payments. See <em>id. </em>at 193, noting that under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, recoveries from third parties are applied first to reimburse the insurer for payments made for medical expenses as well as other compensation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Those similarities do not exist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>in the present context of cost of living adjustments. As a result, <em>Boardman\u2019s Case </em>is of little force here.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">We recognize that not allowing doubled compensation under \u00a7 28 to include the same cost of living increase that is applied to disability compensation will not mitigate the deterioration in value of the claimant\u2019s benefits due to economic conditions. The purposes of both \u00a7 28 and \u00a7 34B may be served less well when the payments required thereunder are paid with constant dollars that have become less valuable, both to the employer and the claimant, as the cost of living has risen. The Legislature, however, has not spoken clearly or, perhaps, definitively, on the subject, and we are required to interpret the act as it is written. We conclude that doubled workers\u2019 compensation benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28, do not include benefits awarded as cost of living adjustments under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34B. The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-7\">As described in note 4, <em>infra, </em>the language of the act does not support an award of a cost of living adjustment to doubled compensation. That is not, however, the claimant\u2019s claim. Instead, he argues for an interpretation that has a similar, but not identical, effect, namely, a doubling of all of the claimant\u2019s compensation, only a part of which is the cost of living adjustment. The distinction is significant for those benefits that are subject to doubling under \u00a7 28 but are not included in \u00a7 34B\u2019s provision for cost of living adjustments. For example, compensation for medical benefits is doubled under \u00a7 28, see <em>Boardman\u2019s Case, </em>365 Mass. 185 (1974), but it is not included among the benefits that receive cost of living adjustments. The claimant\u2019s claim does not, as we understand it, seek cost of living <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>adjustments, single or double, for those benefits not explicitly listed in \u00a7 34B.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b820-9\">That case, like the present one, was appealed to the Appeals Court. <em>Lumi\u2019s Case </em>(Massachusetts Appeals Court No. 92-J-188). It was stayed by that court on March 26, 1992, pending the decision in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b821-7\">The \u201creview date\u201d is October 1 of each year, at which time the claimant\u2019s cost of living adjustment is calculated through a detailed scheme set forth in the statute. This scheme is not at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b821-8\">This is so because \u00a7 34B cannot be interpreted to .provide a cost of living supplement to doubled compensation. Under \u00a7 34B, the base benefit on which the cost of living adjustment is to be calculated is defined as \u201c[t]he death benefit under section thirty-one or the permanent and total disability benefit under section thirty-four A that was being paid prior to any adjustments.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34B (\u00a3&gt;)\u2022 There is thus no provision for a cost of living supplement to benefits awarded under \u00a7 28.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b821-9\">Section 34B was amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 61. The amendment was made substantive, St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 106, so it is the statute prior to amendment that is under consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b822-6\">Other decisions brought to our attention by the insurer, or referred to in the board\u2019s decision, concerning the issue of cost of living adjustments as compensation are not directly relevant to the problem we are considering because the decisions deal with the problem in different contexts. We see no need to discuss these decisions. See generally <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Bates Fabrics, Inc., </em>422 A.2d 1014 (Me. 1980); <em>Bernard </em>v. <em>Cives Corp., </em>395 A.2d 1141 (Me. 1978); <em>Kincaid </em>v. <em>Detroit Mut. Ins. Co., </em>431 Mich. 426 (1988); <em>Atchison </em>v. <em>May Dep\u2019t Stores Co., </em>225 Va. 525 (1983); <em>Clinchfield Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>222 Va. 62 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b822-7\">The Virginia court considered the nature of that State\u2019s cost of living adjustments in the context of Virginia Industrial Commission Rule 13 (B), which disallowed payments of compensation for periods more than fifty days prior to an employee\u2019s application. The court made the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-8\">\u201cThe Industrial Commission has consistently ruled that cost-of-living benefits are not compensation within the meaning of Rule 13(B). In <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Conoco, 62 </em>O.I.C. 201, 202 (1983), the Commission stated that cost-of-living supplements \u2018are not compensation but rather are supplemental payments to which the claimant is entitled in addition to compensation due under other provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u2019 This interpretation reflects the wording of [Virginia] Code \u00a7 65.1-99.1 which states that \u2018cost of living supplements shall be payable, in addition to the other benefits payable under this Act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Virginia Dep\u2019t of Highways </em>&amp; <em>Transp. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>1 Va. App. 349, 356 (1986).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-9\">The statutory language in the Virginia and Massachusetts Compensation Acts is similar: the Virginia statute describes the cost of living adjustments as payable \u201cin addition to\u201d other benefits, and G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34B, describes the adjustments as \u201ca supplement to weekly compensation.\u201d The similarity makes it appropriate that we, like the Virginia court, treat the cost of living adjustments as distinct from compensation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Sections 34B and 65 were both amended by St. 1991, c. 398. However, the changes to \u00a7 65 were made procedural, see St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 107, and the changes to \u00a7 34B are not relevant to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b823-6\">This conclusion is strengthened by consideration of the place of \u00a7 28 in the act. Section 28 is one of a series of sections in the act that set out general provisions governing benefits under the act. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26 (right to workers\u2019 compensation); \u00a7 26A (effect of suicide on dependents\u2019 entitlement to compensation); \u00a7 26B (joint and several liability of insurers); \u00a7 27 (effect of wilful misconduct of employee); \u00a7 28 (effect of wilful misconduct of employer). Section 26, the basic section establishing the claimant\u2019s right to compensation, provides that an injured claimant \u201cshall be paid compensation by the insurer or self-insurer.\u201d We think it probable, therefore, that the reference to compensation in \u00a7 28 also contemplates benefits paid by the insurer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b823-7\">The insurer makes a related argument that a doubling of the cost of living adjustment would impose punitive costs on all employers, including those who are innocent of \u201cserious and wilful misconduct,\u201d by requiring payment from the trust fund to which all employers contribute. Our point here is more limited, noting only that the provision in \u00a7 65 for a distinct payment scheme for cost of living adjustments indicates that those adjustments are not necessarily to be treated as the same as basic compensation. The insurer\u2019s argument does, however, point out an anomaly in the statutory scheme. The issue could perhaps be resolved by reference to the provision of \u00a7 28 that doubled compensation payments be reimbursed to the insurer by the employer, but it is not clear whether that provision could also be read to require reimbursement to the trust fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">The claimant has suggested that this anomaly was eliminated by St. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>1991, c. 398, \u00a7 85, which amended G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65 (2), to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-7\">\u201cThere is hereby established a trust fund in the state treasury, known as the Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust Fund, the proceeds of which shall be used to pay or reimburse the following compensation: (a) reimbursement of adjustments to weekly compensation pursuant to [\u00a7 34B]; ...(e) payment of benefits resulting from approved claims against employers subject to the personal jurisdiction of the commonwealth who are uninsured in violation of this chapter; provided, however, that (i) the claimant is not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits in any other jurisdiction; (ii) <em>no benefits pursuant to [\u00a7 28] </em>and no interest pursuant to [\u00a7 50] <em>shall be payable out of the trust </em>fund\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">It appears to us, however, that the problem remains, in that the amendment\u2019s elimination of trust fund payments for benefits under \u00a7 28 seems to be limited in its applicability only to \u00a7 65 (2) (e), providing for payments for uninsured employers. If the exclusion had been intended to apply to \u00a7 65 (2) <em>(a), </em>the subsection that provides for cost of living adjustments, it would presumably not have been inserted only after subsection (2) (e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b824-9\">We also relied in <em>Boardman\u2019s Case </em>on prior holdings that medical benefits \u201care a part of the compensation to which the workman is entitled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192-193, quoting <em>Panasuk\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 589, 592 (1914).
