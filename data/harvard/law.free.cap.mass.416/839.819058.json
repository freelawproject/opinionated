Affiliated brought this action seeking a declaration that the defendant, Constitution Reinsurance Corporation, was required, under its facultative reinsurance certificate (FRC), to reimburse Affiliated for its legal expenses in defending itself against a declaratory judgment action brought by its insured, Campbell Soup Company. A Superior Court judge ruled that the terms of the facultative certificate were unambiguous, and that Affiliated\u2019s legal expenses were not covered under the certificate. We allowed Affiliated\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\"><em>Facts. </em>The material facts are not in dispute. Affiliated insured Campbell under three consecutive one-year excess liability umbrella insurance policies from August 1, 1976, through August 1, 1979. For each of the policy years, Constitution, pursuant to three facultative certificates, reinsured a portion of Affiliated\u2019s risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">Constitution drafted each of the three certificates. Under the FRC in question, Constitution agreed to indemnify Affiliated for fifteen percent of the risk insured under Campbell\u2019s policy with Affiliated. In exchange, Affiliated paid Constitution fifteen percent of the $40,000 premium it received from Campbell ($6,000), less a twenty-two and one-half percent commission ($1,350). The FRC did not alter or affect Affiliated\u2019s obligations to Campbell in any way, nor did it confer any contractual rights on Campbell. Constitution never has had any direct relationship with or obligation to Campbell.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">In 1987, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) charged Campbell with discriminating, on the basis of race and gender, in the hiring and promotion of employees at its Texas facility. Campbell brought suit against Affiliated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>in a New Jersey Superior Court seeking a declaration that Affiliated had a duty to pay for Campbell\u2019s defense in the EEOC action and a duty to pay any damages that might be assessed against Campbell by EEOC. Affiliated denied any obligation to defend or indemnify Campbell in the EEOC action, and retained counsel to defend it in the declaratory judgment action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1991, the Supreme Court of New Jersey affirmed a lower court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of Affiliated. <em>Campbell Soup Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>239 N.J. Super. 403 (1990). Affiliated thereby was relieved of any duty to defend or to indemnify Campbell in the EEOC action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Affiliated thus billed Constitution for $17,879.58, fifteen percent of the legal expenses it incurred in defending the declaratory judgment action filed by Campbell.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Constitution refused to make payment on the basis that it had no obligation to contribute to the cost of defense of Campbell\u2019s action. Constitution asserted that the expenses were not risks covered under the FRC.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number><em>Discussion. </em>The central issue is whether \u201cexpenses [other than office expenses and payments to any salaried employee] incurred by the Company in the investigation and settlement of claims or suits\u201d includes legal expenses incurred in defending a declaratory judgment action brought by the insured. We must look to the language of the FRC to resolve this issue. Construing the language of an insurance contract is a question of law for the reviewing court. See <em>Cody </em>v. <em>Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>387 Mass. 142, 146 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">It is unclear whether the parties intended the contract to include litigation expenses for declaratory relief brought by an insured against its insurer to determine coverage. \u201cWhen the written agreement, as applied to the subject matter, is in any respect uncertain or equivocal in meaning, all the circumstances of the parties leading to its execution may be shown for the purpose of elucidating, but not of contradicting or changing its terms.\u201d <em>Keating </em>v. <em>Stadium Management Corp., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 249 (1987),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> quoting <em>Robert Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Spence, </em>362 Mass. 751, 753-754 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Affiliated contends that the commentators have spoken with one voice on this question and uniformly have concluded that the reinsurer <em>is </em>contractually obliged to bear its proportionate share of the legal costs associated with investigating, and, where appropriate, resisting demands for coverage. There is support for Affiliated\u2019s position among the insurance treatises.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The treatises are not dispositive of the issue before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>the court. They do, however, state general principles drawn from the older cases. Constitution has not cited any commentators which support its position on the precise issue before us.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Nor have we found any case law addressing this issue directly.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Bellefonte Reinsurance Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., </em>903 F.2d 910 (2d Cir. 1990), relied on by the Superior Court judge, addressed a different question: whether a reinsured was entitled to payment for defense costs in excess of the stated liability limit of the policy. The amount sought by Affiliated in this case is well within the policy limit. <em>Bellefonte </em>did not deal with the issue of litigation expenses incurred during the process of coverage determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>In <em>Bellefonte, </em>the court concluded that in spite of language which provided for expenses \u201cin addition thereto,\u201d all defense costs were \u201csubject to\u201d the express cap on liability set forth in the certificate. <em>Bellefonte, supra </em>at 914. Relying on this reasoning, Constitution argues that clause D which obligates Constitution to pay its proportion of expenses is limited by the \u201csubject to\u201d language in clause A. Clause A states that the liability of Constitution \u201cshall be subject in all respects to all the terms, conditions, and limits of the Company\u2019s policy except when otherwise specifically provided herein . . . .\u201d Constitution asserts that Affiliated\u2019s legal expenses are not within the terms and conditions of the Campbell policy, nor are they expenses specified in clause D. Clause D provides that \u201cin addition\u201d to loss payments, Constitution shall pay \u201cexpenses . . . incurred .'. .in the investigation and settlement of claims or suits.\u201d Constitution\u2019s reading of the interaction of clauses A and D leaves unresolved the question of what is included by the term \u201cexpenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">The Superior Court judge interpreted the language of the certificate to limit \u201cexpenses\u201d. to those expenses that would be covered under the terms and conditions of the Affiliated-Campbell policy; for example, expenses incurred in defending Campbell from liability. The dissent agrees with the Superior Court that the meaning of the word \u201cexpenses\u201d is clear, and cannot reasonably be interpreted to include expenses incurred in coverage litigation, <em>post </em>846.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">\u201c \u2018Expenses\u2019 is a word of broad import. It has no fixed definition. It is of varying signification and is dependent for its precise meaning upon its connection and the purpose to be accomplished by its use. It is comprehensive enough to include a wide range of disbursements. Standing alone, it is ambiguous.\u201d <em>Pittsfield &amp; N. Adams R.R. </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany R.R., </em>260 Mass. 391, 397 (1927). Read in the context of the entire certificate, the two clauses, taken together, do not clarify the meaning of \u201cexpenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Affiliated contends that, if there is doubt concerning the scope of expenses, the doubt should be resolved against Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>stitution, the drafter of the certificate. Although there is a rule of construction that certain writings are to be construed against the author of the doubtful language, <em>(Merrimack Valley Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>372 Mass. 721, 724 [1977], citing <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>351 Mass. 666, 673 [1967]), that rule must give way to the primary objective that a contract is to be construed to reflect the intention of the parties. <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Bay State Gas Co., </em>383 Mass. 218, 225 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Where, as here, the contract language is ambiguous, evidence of trade usage is admissible to determine the meaning of the agreement. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 222 comment b (1981).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cThe argument that a contract may not be \u2018varied\u2019 by evidence of pertinent custom and usage misconceives the role played by such evidence. \u2018Valid usages known to contracting parties, respecting the subject matter of an agreement, are by implication incorporated therein, unless expressly or impliedly excluded by its terms, and are admissible to aid in its interpretation, not as tending in any respect to contradict or vary a contract, but upon the theory that the usage forms a part of the contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hardware Specialties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mishara Constr. Co., </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 277, 280 (1974), quoting <em>Baccari </em>v. <em>B. Perini &amp; Sons, </em>293 Mass. 297, 303 (1936). See <em>A.J.

At the hearing, although the parties submitted extrinsic evidence of Constitution\u2019s practice, neither party offered evidence of the pertinent custom and usage.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Where, as here, the contract language is ambiguous, evidence of custom and trade practice may be admitted to arrive at an interpretation \u201cwhich appears to be in accord with justice and common sense and the probable intention of the parties.\u201d <em>Keating </em>v. <em>Stadium Management Corp., </em>24 Mass.

In the present case, Affiliated did not initiate the declaratory judgment action, but was instead defending an action brought by Campbell, its insured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b865-13\"> Affiliated relies on several Nineteenth Century cases to support its argument.

As the Superior Court judge pointed out in his order allowing summary judgment: \u201cIn the above cases, however, the specific contract language relied on by the courts, if any, is not recited or discussed in any meaningful way.

The court states that \u201c[wjhere, as here, the contract language is ambiguous, evidence of trade usage is admissible to determine the meaning of the agreement.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 845. I agree that there is a rule that \u201c[w]hen the written agreement, as applied to the subject matter, is in any respect un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>certain or equivocal in meaning, all the circumstances of the parties leading to its execution [including known trade custom and usage] may be shown for the purpose of elucidating, but not of contradicting or changing its terms.\u201d <em>Keating </em>v. <em>Stadium Management Corp., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 246, 249 (1987), quoting <em>Robert Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Spence, </em>362 Mass. 751, 753-754 (1973). However, since the facultative reinsurance certificate at issue in this case, as applied to the subject matter, is not in any respect uncertain or equivocal in meaning, resort to evidence of trade usage is inappropriate. I would affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">\u201c[T]he purpose of ascertaining the expressed intent of the parties is to be accomplished by examining the contract or policy as a whole. The intent of the parties is to be ascertained from the language of the entire policy considered as a whole in connection with the risk or subject matter. The context of the policy, at least such parts as are contractual, may always be looked\" to for a proper construction of what was in the minds of the parties at the time they entered into the contract. All its words, parts, and provisions must be construed together as one entire contract. All of the terms and conditions of each part should be read and interpreted together in the light of all the other parts. The intent of the contracting parties is to be ascertained, not by a process of dissection in which words or phrases are isolated from their context, but rather from a process of synthesis in which the words and phrases are given a meaning in accordance with the obvious purpose of the insurance contract as a whole. It is not permissible to lift one sentence from a policy and try to attach a meaning to that sentence standing alone.\u201d 2 G. Couch, Insurance, \u00a7 15.29 (2d ed. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">The preamble of the certificate states that \u201c[i]n consideration of the payment of the premium, and subject to the terms, conditions and limits of liability set forth herein . . . the Reinsurer [Constitution] does hereby reinsure the ceding company [Affiliated, the original insurer] ... in respect of the Company\u2019s [Affiliated] policy (les). . . .\u201d Clause A of the certificate provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he liability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>the Reinsurer . . . shall follow that of the Company, subject in all respects to all of the terms, conditions and limits of the Company\u2019s policy except when otherwise specifically provided herein . . . .\u201d Read together, the preamble and clause A specify that the certificate is a contract of reinsurance and that the reinsurer is only assuming those risks specifically provided for in the reassured\u2019s policy with its insured. In effect, the two sections spell out clearly in the certificate the essence of reinsurance described by this court in <em>Friend Bros. </em>v. <em>Seaboard Sur. Co., </em>316 Mass. 639 (1944): Reinsurance is \u201can agreement to indemnify the assured, partially or altogether, against a risk assumed by . . . [it] in a policy issued to a third party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 642, quoting <em>Royal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Vanderbilt Ins. Co., </em>102 Tenn. 264, 267 (1899).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Thus, the meaning of the words in clause D of the certificate, \u201c[i]n addition thereto, the Reinsurer shall pay its proportion of expenses . . . incurred by the Company [Affiliated] in the investigation and settlement of claims or suits,\u201d is clear. Those words unambiguously refer to expenses incurred by Affiliated in the investigation and settlement of Campbell\u2019s risks that Affiliated insured and Constitution re-insured. The expenses referred to are Affiliated\u2019s expenses incurred in the discharge of obligations it undertook in its policy issued to Campbell. To say, as the court appears to say, that the \u201cin addition to\u201d provision in clause D may require Constitution to pay Affiliated\u2019s legal expenses<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> incurred in successfully maintaining its position that, as to the EEOC claim against Campbell, Affiliated\u2019s original policy issued to Campbell did not impose any obligations or risks on Affiliated, is to isolate that single provision from its reinsurance context. As to the EEOC claim, Affiliated\u2019s position, sustained by the New Jersey Supreme Court, was that it was not an insurer. Therefore, as to that claim, Constitution was not a reinsurer and it is abundantly clear from a reading of the entire facultative reinsurance certificate that Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>tion\u2019s obligations did not extend beyond reinsurance. \u201cIt is not permissible to lift one sentence from a policy and try to attach a meaning to that sentence standing alone.\u201d Couch, Insurance, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 15.29.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Since, as the Superior Court judge reasoned, the policy provision at issue is not uncertain or equivocal as applied to the subject matter,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> no extrinsic evidence is appropriate. The judgment therefore should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">The Superior Court judge rightly concluded that the Nineteenth Century cases relied on by Affiliated do not support its contention that its legal expenses in connection with resisting Campbell\u2019s coverage claim are covered by the reinsurance certificate. The court seems to agree, <em>ante </em>at 843 n.8, but says that \u201c[tjhere is support for Affiliated\u2019s position among the insurance treatises,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 842, and purports to set forth that support in the margin. <em>Ante </em>at 842 n.6. The named treatises do not support Affiliated\u2019s position. Indeed, they do not appear to address the issues presented by this case. In addition, they suffer from the same defect as do the cases relied on by Affiliated and rejected by the Superior Court judge; \u201cthe specific contract language relied on by the courts, if any, is not recited or discussed in any meaningful way.\u201d See <em>ante </em>at 843 n.8. Furthermore, the treatises appear to rely in substantial measure on the very cases that the judge, and seemingly the court, have found wanting.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">The Superior Court judge\u2019s analysis and ruling were right. I would affirm the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Expenses incurred in litigation concerning coverage cannot reasonably be considered to be expenses incurred in \u201cinvestigation and settlement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b871-8\">As the court points out, <em>ante </em>at 846, \u201cAt the hearing, although the parties submitted extrinsic evidence of Constitution\u2019s practice, neither party offered evidence of the pertinent custom and usage.\u201d It also appears that Affiliated has not argued on appeal that the Superior Court judge should have considered such evidence, and Affiliated does not ask this court to remand the case for such consideration to be given.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
