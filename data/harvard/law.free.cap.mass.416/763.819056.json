In her amended complaint, the plaintiff alleged that, while attending a conference at the hotel, she was injured when she slipped and fell in the bathtub in her room. She further alleged that the defendant was responsible for her injuries because it had violated a duty to provide her with a safe bathtub.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant moved to dismiss the action on the grounds that personal jurisdiction was lacking and service of process was insufficient. Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (2), (5), 365 Mass. 755 (1974). A judge in the Superior Court allowed discovery \u201climited to the essential facts relevant to the issue of personal jurisdiction.\u201d Based on the discovery, the plaintiff contended that there was personal jurisdiction over the defendant for two reasons. First, she claimed that her action was one \u201carising from the [defendant\u2019s transaction of] business in this [Commonwealth,\u201d so that jurisdiction was proper under G. L. c. 223A, \u00a7 3 <em>(a) </em>(1992 ed.), the Massachusetts long-arm statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>argued that jurisdiction existed because she had properly effected service on the defendant in accordance with the requirements of G. L. c. 223, \u00a7 38 (1992 ed.).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge rejected both contentions, and granted the defendant\u2019s motion after treating it (based on the discovery materials and affidavits that had been filed) as one for summary judgment. Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 '(b), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). The plaintiff appealed, and we granted her application for direct appellate review. We reverse the judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">The following are the facts relevant to the jurisdictional issue viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Alioto </em>v. <em>Marnell, </em>402 Mass. 36, 37 (1988). The hotel is located very close to Disneyland. It regularly solicits conference business from all over the country as a means of marketing its hotel rooms and other facilities. The plaintiff was a member of the American Council of Hypnotist Examiners (council). The council had held a successful conference at the hotel in 1987, which was attended by two Massachusetts residents. Following that conference, the hotel made contact with the council\u2019s president to inquire whether the council would also hold its conference there the following year. The hotel then wrote to the president proposing a contract for the 1988 conference. The contract indicated that all conference facilities would be offered gratis in exchange for the organization\u2019s commitment to a block of hotel rooms, and \u201c[djirect billing [would be] available pending an approved credit application.\u201d The president accepted the proposed contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">The council sent two mailings to its members informing them of the 1988 conference, its date and location, and that council members would receive a special nightly rate at the hotel. Those who registered for the conference in response to the first mailing were sent a preprinted hotel registration card provided to the council by the hotel. The cards were to be returned directly to the hotel by council members to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>serve rooms for the conference. The second mailing indicated that a hotel accommodations form would be included with confirmation of conference registration for those responding to the mailing, but that late registrants should make their reservations directly with the hotel by telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The plaintiff registered late for the 1988 conference and reserved a room at the hotel by telephone, providing a hotel employee with her name, address, telephone, and credit card number. She stayed at the hotel during the conference, and, during her stay, she allegedly was injured when she fell in the bathtub in her room. The plaintiff brought her action against the defendant in 1990 in the Superior Court. Service was made in hand on an employee of the hotel in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">During 1987, 1988, and 1989, the defendant had no place of business or any agents in Massachusetts. It did not advertise in Massachusetts. It did, however, have a number of contacts with Massachusetts residents in addition to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It had direct billing arrangements with several Massachusetts corporations, including Cullinet Software, Inc., New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc., and Software Partners/32, Inc., all of which used the hotel for conventions or meetings during that period. These arrangements allowed employees and representatives of these companies to use facilities and amenities of the hotel and to have their companies billed in Massachusetts for payments. In addition, the defendant hosted events for at least seven other Massachusetts businesses. The hotel also had solicited business from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>number of national organizations in addition to the council, such as the National Rifle Association, the American Lung Association, and the American Association of Orthodontists.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">General Laws c. 223A, \u00a7 3, sets out a list of specific instances in which a Massachusetts court may acquire personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant. Jurisdiction is conferred only \u201cwhen some basis for jurisdiction enumerated in the statute has been established.\u201d <em>Good Hope Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ryder Scott Co., </em>378 Mass. 1, 6 (1979). <em>Carlson Corp. </em>v. <em>University of Vt., </em>380 Mass. 102, 105 (1980). If the literal requirements of the statute are satisfied, it also must be established that \u201cthe exercise of jurisdiction under State law [is] consistent with basic due process requirements mandated by the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Good Hope Indus., supra </em>at 5-6. A plaintiff has the burden of establishing facts to show that the ground relied on under \u00a7 3 is present. <em>Droukas </em>v. <em>Divers Training Academy, Inc., </em>375 Mass. 149, 151 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">As has been mentioned, the plaintiff refers to \u00a7 3 <em>(a) </em>of G. L. c. 223A, which grants jurisdiction \u201cover a person . . . as to a cause of action in law or equity arising from the person\u2019s . . . transacting any business in this commonwealth.\u201d For jurisdiction to exist under \u00a7 3 (a), the facts must satisfy two requirements \u2014 the defendant must have transacted business in Massachusetts, and the plaintiff\u2019s claim must have arisen from the transaction of business by the defendant. See <em>Good Hope Indus., supra </em>at 10 n.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">The \u201c \u2018transacting any business\u2019 clause [in \u00a7 3] has been construed broadly.\u201d <em>Heins </em>v. <em>Wilhelm Loh Wetzlar Optical Mach. GmbH &amp; Co. KG., </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 14, 17 (1988), relying on <em>Good Hope Indus., supra. </em>See <em>Kleinerman </em>v. <em>Morse, 26 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 819, 824 (1989). Although an isolated (and minor) transaction with a Massachusetts resident may be insufficient, generally the purposeful and successful solicitation of business from residents of the Commonwealth, by a defendant or its agent, will suffice to satisfy this requirement. See <em>Good Hope Indus., supra </em>at 8 n.13. See also <em>Gunner </em>v. <em>Elmwood Dodge, Inc., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 96, 99-100 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>(1987). It is obvious that the defendant, which solicited and obtained meeting and convention business from at least ten Massachusetts businesses, and maintained telephone and mail contact with them, transacted business in the Commonwealth during the relevant period.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">We also think that the defendant\u2019s acceptance of the plaintiffs room reservation formed part of the defendant\u2019s overall purposeful solicitation of hotel business from residents of Massachusetts. Particularly where a contract between the parties is associated with other forum-related activities, a defendant\u2019s relatively minor contacts with a Massachusetts plaintiff have been held sufficient to satisfy the transacting business requirement set out in \u00a7 3 (a). In <em>Carlson Corp. </em>v. <em>University of Vt., supra </em>at 105, the signing of a contract in Massachusetts, for services to be performed entirely in Vermont, was found to constitute the transaction of business in Massachusetts. In <em>Hahn </em>v. <em>Vermont Law Sch., </em>698 F.2d 48, 50-52 (1st Cir. 1983), where there was evidence that the defendant made purposeful efforts to reach and serve the market for legal education in Massachusetts, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit observed that the question of personal jurisdiction with respect to a transaction with a particular Massachusetts plaintiff should not turn \u201con the intricacies of the law of contract formation,\u201d on the defendant\u2019s physical presence in Massachusetts, or on whether the Massachusetts plaintiff initiated the contact leading to the formation of the contract. The court concluded that the defendant\u2019s communications with the plaintiff in Massachusetts amounted to the transaction of business here, regardless of whether the contract between the parties had actually been concluded in the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">This case is similar to <em>Hahn </em>v. <em>Vermont Law Sch., supra. </em>The defendant actively solicited the conference business of the council and provided registration materials to the council, knowing those materials would be mailed to, among others, Massachusetts residents. The hotel then entered into a contract with a Massachusetts resident, by means of a telephone contact with the plaintiff while she was in Massachusetts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>The defendant\u2019s contact with the plaintiff was part of a larger systematic effort on its part to obtain business from Massachusetts businesses and residents which included (as it did in the case of the council to which the plaintiff belonged) the offer of reduced hotel rates, simplified reservation procedures, and convenient direct billing arrangements. As was the case in <em>Hahn, </em>the contacts with the plaintiff, although not themselves extensive, were not random or isolated events. Cf. <em>Droukas </em>v. <em>Divers Training Academy, Inc., supra </em>at 153 (defendant which agreed to sell marine engines to plaintiff did not transact business in Massachusetts where, among other factors, there was no evidence of contacts other than minimal contacts with plaintiff-purchaser). We conclude that the defendant\u2019s reservation contract with the plaintiff was one part of a broader range of activities that, literally, amounted to the transaction of business in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">The plaintiff further contends that her injury \u201carises from\u201d the defendant\u2019s transaction of business in Massachusetts because, \u201cbut for [the hotel\u2019s] solicitation of her business and subsequent contract with her for the hotel room in which she was injured, [her] injuries would not have occurred.\u201d We have not had occasion to consider whether the \u201carising from\u201d element of G. L. c. 223A, \u00a7 3 <em>{a), </em>is satisfied on facts like those present here. Other courts that have considered the question have differed on the meaning that should be ascribed to the term \u201carising from.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">In <em>Marino </em>v. <em>Hyatt Corp., </em>793 F.2d 427, 428-430 (1st Cir. 1986), interpreting G. L. c. 223A, \u00a7 3 (a), the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit concluded that a plaintiff\u2019s personal injury claim (also premised on her fall in the bathtub of a hotel located in another State) did not \u201carise from\u201d the hotel reservation contract which the parties entered into while the plaintiff was in Massachusetts. In <em>Ma-rino, </em>the court rejected the premise that the reservation of a hotel room created a covenant pertaining to the safety of the premises that might later arise after registration at the hotel and actual occupancy of the room. The court stated that any implied covenant pertaining to the safety of the occupied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>premises came into effect when the plaintiff actually registered at the hotel. The court noted that the \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 advance reservation agreement with Hyatt would hardly be an important, or perhaps even a material, element of proof in their slip and fall case,\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe plaintiffs\u2019 personal injury claim against Hyatt can [not] be said to \u2018aris[e] from\u2019 that contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430. In <em>Pizarro </em>v. <em>Hoteles Concorde Int\u2019l, C.A., </em>907 F.2d 1256 (1st Cir. 1990), the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit construed a provision of the long-arm statute of Puerto Rico, which is similar to G. L. c. 223A, \u00a7 3 <em>(a), </em>and observed: \u201cWhether certain events \u2018arise out of a nonresident defendant\u2019s actions ... is comparable or analogous to whether certain actions can \"be said to be the legal, or proximate cause of injuries suffered by a plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1259. Courts in some other jurisdictions have adopted a similar approach. See <em>Pearrow </em>v. <em>National Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>703 F.2d 1067, 1068-1069 (8th Cir. 1983); <em>Gelfland </em>v. <em>Tanner Motor Tours, Ltd., </em>339 F.2d 317, 321-322 (2d Cir. 1964); <em>Dirks </em>v. <em>Carnival Cruise Lines, </em>642 F. Supp. 971, 974-975 (D. Kan. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Other United States Courts of Appeals have differed with the <em>Marino </em>decision and have concluded that terms such as \u201carising from\u201d occurring in State long-arm statutes, similar to G. L. c. 223A, \u00a7 3 <em>(a), </em>should be interpreted as creating a \u201cbut for\u201d test. This test permits jurisdiction in a case like this because the plaintiffs reservation of a room is considered the first step in a train of events that results in the personal injury. In <em>Prejean </em>v. <em>Sonatrach, Inc., </em>652 F.2d 1260 (5th Cir. 1981), interpreting the Texas long-arm statute, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit observed: \u201cLogically, there is no reason why a tort cannot grow out of a contractual contact. In a case like this, the contractual contact is a \u2018but for\u2019 causative factor for the tort since it brought the parties within tortious \u2018striking distance\u2019 of each other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1270 n.21. In <em>Lanier </em>v. <em>American Bd. of Endodontics, </em>843 F.2d 901 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 926 (1988), interpreting the Michigan long-arm statute, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that a claim arises from a defendant\u2019s transaction of business in the forum State if the claim was made possible by, or lies in the wake of, the transaction of business in the forum State. <em>Id. </em>at 909. See <em>Shute </em>v. <em>Carnival Cruise Lines, </em>897 F.2d 377, 383-386 (9th Cir. 1990) (adopting \u201cbut for\u201d test, and concluding that tort claim can arise from contract between parties), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 499 U.S. 585 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The latter approach is more consistent with the language of our statute and with decisions of this court interpreting it. There is no readily apparent basis in the statutory language (\u201carising from\u201d) for the restrictive proximate cause approach adopted by the First Circuit. See <em>Shute </em>v. <em>Carnival Cruise Lines, supra </em>at 385 (approach in <em>Marino </em>\u201cunnecessarily limits the ordinary meaning of the \u2018arising out of language\u201d). As has been noted, we have read the \u201ctransacting any business\u201d requirement of G. L. c. 223A, \u00a7 3 <em>(a), </em>broadly, in keeping with our view that the Massachusetts long-arm statute \u201cfunctions as \u2018an assertion of jurisdiction over the person to the limits allowed by the Constitution of the United States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Good Hope Indus., supra </em>at 6, quoting <em>\u201cAuto</em>matic\u201d <em>Sprinkler Corp. of Am. </em>v. <em>Seneca Foods Corp., </em>361 Mass. 441, 443 (1972). There is no reason to depart from this principle with respect to the \u201carising from\u201d language, which occurs in the same section of the statute. We doubt that the Legislature intended to foreclose a resident of Massachusetts, injured in another State, from seeking relief in the courts of the Commonwealth when the literal requirements of the long-arm statute have been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Applying the approach articulated in the <em>Shute, Lanier, </em>and <em>Prejean </em>decisions, <em>supra, </em>to the facts of this case, it is apparent that the plaintiff\u2019s claim \u201carose from\u201d the defendant\u2019s transaction of business in the Commonwealth. But for the defendant\u2019s solicitation of business in Massachusetts, and its agreement to provide the plaintiff with hotel accommodations in Anaheim, California, the plaintiff would not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>been injured in a room of the hotel. We conclude that the requirements of G. L. c. 223A, \u00a7 3 <em>(a), </em>have been satisfied.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">We also conclude that the assertion of jurisdiction over the defendant comports with the restraints imposed by the due process clause of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In its most recent case on the subject, the Supreme Court of the United States has summarized its pronouncements in this area as follows. \u201c \u2018[T]he constitutional touchstone\u2019 of the determination whether an exercise of personal jurisdiction comports with due process \u2018remains whether the defendant purposefully established \u201cminimum contacts\u201d in the forum state.\u2019 <em>Burger King Corp. </em>v. <em>Rudzewicz, </em>471 U.S. 462, 474 (1985), quoting <em>International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>326 U.S. [310, 316 (1945)]. . . . [Mjinimum contacts must have a basis in \u2018some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u2019 <em>Burger King, </em>471 U.S., at 475.\u201d <em>Asahi Metal Indus. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>480 U.S. 102, 108-109 (1987). The plaintiff\u2019s claim must arise out of, or relate to, the defendant\u2019s forum contacts. See <em>Burger King Corp. </em>v. <em>Rudzewicz, supra </em>at 472; <em>United Elec., Radio &amp; Mach. Workers </em>v. <em>163 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number><em>Pleasant St. Corp., </em>960 F.2d 1080, 1088-1089 (1st Cir. 1992), appeal after remand, 987 F.2d 39 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">In addition, the assertion of jurisdiction over the defendant must not offend \u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d <em>International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington, supra </em>at 316, quoting <em>Milliken </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>311 U.S. 457, 463 (1940). <em>Asahi Metal Indus. Co., supra </em>at 113. In practical terms, this means that an assertion of jurisdiction must be tested for its reasonableness, taking into account such factors as the .burden on the defendant of litigating in the plaintiff\u2019s chosen forum, the forum State\u2019s interest in adjudicating the dispute, and the plaintiff\u2019s interest in obtaining relief. <em>Id. </em>See <em>United Elec. Radio &amp; Mach. Workers </em>v. <em>163 Pleasant St. Corp., </em>987 F.2d 39, 46-47 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">In view of the hotel\u2019s quite extensive solicitation of business in Massachusetts (from which the plaintiff\u2019s claim arose), it is reasonable to conclude that the hotel has \u201cinvoked the benefits and protections\u201d of Massachusetts laws. See <em>Hahn </em>v. <em>Vermont Law Sch., supra </em>at 51. It is not unreasonable to require a hotel that deliberately draws its customers (and hence its income) from many, if not all, of the States, including Massachusetts, and that has the resources of a large business, including a legal department, to defend itself in Massachusetts. The plaintiff manifestly lacks such resources. Requiring her to bring suit in California might pose an insuperable barrier to judicial consideration of her claim. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that \u201c[a] State generally has a \u2018manifest interest\u2019 in providing its residents with a convenient forum for redressing injuries inflicted by out-of-state actors.\u201d <em>Burger King Corp. </em>v. <em>Rud-zewicz, supra </em>at 473, citing <em>McGee </em>v. <em>International Life Ins. Co., </em>355 U.S. 220, 223 (1957). California\u2019s long-arm statute permits its courts to assert jurisdiction over an out-of-State defendant to the extent permitted by the due process clause of the United States Constitution. Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7 410.10 (West 1973). Thus, a California plaintiff in the plaintiff\u2019s situation would be able to bring suit in California against a Massachusetts hotel. In these circumstances, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>significant social policy is compromised by our assertion of jurisdiction over a California corporation in a simple slip and fall case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">We conclude that the requirements of G. L. c. 223A, \u00a7 3 (a), are satisfied, and that there is a sufficient nexus between the claim, the litigation, and the forum to warrant the assertion of jurisdiction in Massachusetts over the defendant. The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b786-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint states her cause of action in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-8\">\u201c9.

The Defendant breached its duty to Plaintiff by providing her with a room and bath that included a bathtub which was equipped with neither hand rails nor other safety devices adequate to protect bathers from slipping and falling while in the course of bathing.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b786-10\">General Laws c. 223A, \u00a7 3 (1992 ed.), provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">\u201cA [Massachusetts] court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person, who acts directly or by an agent, as to a cause of action in law or equity arising from the person\u2019s \u201c(a) transacting any business in this commonwealth . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Because we conclude that the assertion of jurisdiction over the defendant comports with the requirements of G.

The objection came at the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s attorney\u2019s argument to the judge, who responded, \u201call right.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s attorney then began her argument. In his memorandum of decision and order, the judge referred to documents that were the subject of the defendant\u2019s objection. Viewed in this context, it is obvious that the judge\u2019s remark, \u201call right,\u201d merely acknowledged that the defendant\u2019s attorney had concluded her argument. The judge\u2019s reliance on the documents in question indicates that he did not grant the defendant\u2019s motion to strike those documents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b794-6\">In <em>Rye </em>v. <em>Atlas Hotels, Inc., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 904 (1991), the defendant, a California hotel, advertised its room rates in a publication devoted to contract bridge. The plaintiff made a telephone call to the toll free number appearing in the advertisement and reserved a room in the hotel. While there, she slipped and fractured her wrist. The Appeals Court affirmed dismissal of the negligence count, concluding that the defendant had not transacted business in Massachusetts. The court also adopted the reasoning of the <em>Marino </em>case with respect to the question whether a personal injury suffered by a Massachusetts resident in the room of a hotel in a foreign jurisdiction could \u201carise from\u201d the hotel\u2019s agreement to provide the Massachusetts plaintiff with accommodations.

We observe again, as we did in <em>Carlson, </em>that, if a party disputing personal jurisdiction also intends to argue that a Massachusetts forum is not convenient for resolution of the parties\u2019 dispute, both grounds for dismissal should be raised at the same time to avoid unnecessarily prolonged litigation, piecemeal appeals, and a waste of judicial resources.'</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
