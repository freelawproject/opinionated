L. c. 152, \u00a7 34 (1992 ed.), to Ann Marie Robinson (employee). We transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion and affirm the decision of the reviewing board.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">We briefly summarize the facts found by the administrative judge and adopted by the reviewing board. From 1976 until March 11, 1987, the employee was employed as an occupational health nurse at Data General Corporation (employer). Beginning in October, 1985, there was a general reduction in the employer\u2019s staff. As a result of the reductions, the employee assisted many coworkers in dealing with their personal and emotional problems arising from the loss of their jobs. The employee was overwhelmed by the increased demands placed on her and the constant exposure to the emotional problems of coworkers. As a result, she lost fifty pounds, became tense, and developed tension-related physical illnesses. The parties stipulated that the employee suffers from depression and anxiety. The administrative judge determined that the employee was totally disabled from performing gainful employment and found that the employee\u2019s emotional disability was \u201cprimarily caused by a series of events occurring within her employment,\u201d such as her steadily increasing job responsibilities, work load, and increasing demands from superiors.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">I. <em>Standard of Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The standard of review for appeals from decisions of a reviewing board is defined in the workers\u2019 compensation statute. General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 12 (2), as appearing in St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 26, provided: \u201cAny appeal from a decision by a reviewing board shall be taken pursuant to section fourteen of chapter thirty A, except that such appeal shall be filed with the appeals court of the commonwealth.\u201d General Laws c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1992 ed.), limits the instances where a court may set aside or modify an agency\u2019s decision. See <em>Lettich\u2019s Case, </em>403 Mass. 389, 395 (1988). Section 12 (2) was amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 32A, and now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>\u201cAny appeal from a decision by a reviewing board shall be taken pursuant to section fourteen of chapter thirty A, except that such appeal shall be filed with the appeals court of the commonwealth and provided further that clause (e) of paragraph seven of section fourteen of chapter thirty A shall not apply to such appeals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">General Laws c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) (e), provides that a court may set aside or modify an agency\u2019s decision if it determines the decision is \u201c[unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d General Laws c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6) (1992 ed.), defines \u201c[substantial evidence\u201d as \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d Under the substantial evidence standard, courts were required to scrutinize the whole record to determine whether the standard had been met. <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., </em>374 Mass. 37, 54 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">We first decide whether the former or the present provision of \u00a7 12 (2) applies. General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 2A (1992 ed.), provides a mechanism to determine when an amendment to G. L. c. 152 will apply retroactively or prospectively. Section 2A provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">\u201cEvery act, in amendment of this chapter, in effect on the effective date of this section or thereafter becoming effective which increases or decreases the amount or amounts of compensation payable to an injured employee or his dependents including amounts deducted for legal fees shall, for the purposes of this chapter, be deemed to be substantive in character and shall apply only to personal injuries occurring on and after the effective date of such act, unless otherwise expressly provided. Every act, in amendment of this chapter, in effect on the effective date of this section or thereafter becoming effective which is not deemed to be substantive in character within the meaning of this section shall be deemed to be procedural or remedial only, in character, and shall have application to personal injuries irrespec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>tive of the date of their occurrence, unless otherwise expressly provided.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Thus, all amendments not increasing or decreasing the amount of compensation are considered procedural or remedial and apply retroactively. Statute 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 107, provides that the amendment to \u00a7 12 (2), eliminating from appellate scrutiny consideration whether the decision is \u201c[unsupported by substantial evidence,\u201d is procedural and thus applies retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">We are constrained to set aside or modify the decision of the reviewing board only if the decision is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\"><em>\u201c(a) </em>In violation of constitutional provisions; or <em>\u201c(b) </em>In excess, of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency; or \u201c(c) Based on an error of law; or <em>\u201c(d) </em>Made upon unlawful procedure; or <em>\u201c(f) </em>Unwarranted by facts found by the court on the record as submitted or as amplified ... in those instances where the court is constitutionally required to make independent findings of fact; or \u201c(g) Arbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). We note, as other courts have, that these varying standards may overlap with the substantial evidence standard. As the employee correctly points out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">\u201cWithout some factual support for a decision, an agency decision would ordinarily be viewed arbitrary. If supported by substantial evidence, it is likely to be viewed by a court, reluctant to substitute its own judgment, as reasonable. Although we hesitate to say the test would yield the same results in all situations, what both standards require of an agency action is reasoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>decision making within the particular statutory guidelines.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-5\"><em>Howe </em>v. <em>Health Facilities Appeals Bd., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 531, 537 n.6 (1985), and authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">II. <em>Substantive Issues.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">With this standard in mind we next turn to the substantive issue raised by the insurer; first, that the employee failed to meet her burden of proof under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (7A). General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 1 (7A), as amended through St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 11, and St. 1986, c. 662, \u00a7 2,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defines \u201c[p]ersonal injuries\u201d within the meaning of c. 152, and provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">\u201cPersonal injuries shall include mental or emotional disabilities only where a significant contributing cause of such disability is an event or series of events occurring within the employment. No mental or emotional disability arising principally out of a bona fide, personnel action including a transfer, promotion, demotion, or termination except such action which is the intentional infliction of emotional harm shall be deemed to be a personal injury within the meaning of this chapter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">The insurer posits that the Legislature has signalled its desire that employees be put to a higher standard of proof in workers\u2019 compensation cases involving mental or emotional disability and that the employee has failed to meet that heightened standard. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">Although the amendments to \u00a7 1 (7A) would mandate a different result than in <em>Kelly\u2019s Case, </em>394 Mass. 684 (1985), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>that does not mean that all of the court\u2019s reasoning has been supplanted. In <em>Kelly\u2019s Case, </em>the court indicated that none of the earlier precedents, on which the insurer now relies, \u201csuggest [s] that entitlement to workers\u2019 compensation for emotional disability requires proof of facts in addition to those required when the disability is only physical, and we discern no basis in G. L. c. 152 for such a requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686. Additionally, the court rejected \u201cany contention that- [the employee] is not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation unless her emotional disability resulted from an unusual and objectively stressful or traumatic event.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687. The court noted that it was for the Legislature \u201cto determine, as a matter of public policy, whether one of the costs of doing business in this Commonwealth shall be the compensation of those few employees who do suffer emotional disability as a result of being laid off or transferred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689. The 1985 and 1986 amendments, apparently, were the Legislature\u2019s response to the court\u2019s suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 1 (7A), as amended, still provides that mental or emotional disability arising out of a bona fide personal action shall not, with an exception not here material, be compensable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, \u00a7 1 (7A), as then amended, provided that, to recover for mental or emotional disability, the employee must demonstrate that a significant contributing cause of the disability was an event or events occurring within the employment. The insurer interprets the amendments to \u00a7 1 (7A) as requiring the employee to prove by clear and objective evidence that she was subjected to specific, identifiable, and significant events resulting in her mental disability. We do not read the statute in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">What is now required is that the employee establish that a work-related event was a \u201csignificant\u201d as opposed to a minor cause of the employee\u2019s emotional distress. Here, the admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>istrative judge accurately applied this standard by finding that the employee\u2019s \u201cemotional disability was principally caused by a series of events occurring within her employment.\u201d Additionally, she found that the employee\u2019s \u201cdepression and resultant disability is directly and causally related to a series of stress related events which occurred at work.\u201d Although she did not use the word \u201csignificant,\u201d her conclusion is a proper application of the standard that an event of employment must be a significant contributing cause to an employee\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Next, the insurer argues that, even if the administrative judge used the correct standard, the evidence was insufficient to prove that specific and identifiable events occurring within the employment were a significant contributing cause of her disability. To be compensable, an event must be \u201cattributable to the \u2018nature, conditions, obligations or incidents of employment; in other words, [to] employment looked at in any of its aspects.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zerofski\u2019s </em>Case, 385 Mass. 590, 592 (1982), quoting <em>Caswell\u2019s Case, </em>305 Mass. 500, 502 (1940). The administrative judge found, based on the employee\u2019s testimony, \u201cthat the stress placed on her from her steadily increasing job responsibilities and her constant exposure to the emotional problems of her co-workers resulted in a breakdown of her ability to cope with the demands of her job.\u201d There is no basis for us to set aside or to modify these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Furthermore, there is nothing in the statute to suggest that emotional disability is compensable only if it resulted from \u201can unusual and objectively stressful or traumatic event.\u201d <em>Kelly\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 687. The finding that the employee\u2019s disability was causally related to a series of events at work is sufficient as long as those events were significant factors in bringing about the employee\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The decision of the reviewing board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-10\">This provision was amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 16. Pursuant to St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 107, this amendment is deemed to be procedural.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b480-11\">Section 14 of St. 1991, c. 398, substituted the words \u201cthe predominant\u201d for \u201ca significant,\u201d and inserted a sentence providing: \u201cIf a compensable injury or disease combines with a preexisting condition, which resulted from an injury or disease not compensable under this chapter, to cause or prolong disability or a need for treatment, the resultant condition shall be compensable only to the extent such compensable injury or disease remains a major but not necessarily predominant cause of disability or need for treatment.\u201d Under St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 106, the amendment is substantive, thus it applies prospectively only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The administrative judge found that the events causing the employee\u2019s injuries did not arise out of a bona fide personnel action. This finding was within the scope of the judge\u2019s competence. She could have believed that the employee\u2019s emotional injuries arose from the stress of having to deal with the effect of bona fide personnel actions on other employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
