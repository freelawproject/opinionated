Robinson, III, appeals from a judgment dismissing his amended complaint on the motion of the defendant, the Department of Public Utilities (DPU). The DPU based its motion, in part, on Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (1), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). Robinson asserts that it was error to dismiss his amended complaint on jurisdictional grounds. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (1). For the reasons stated herein, we conclude that the DPU did not err in denying Robinson full party status in D.P.U. 89-300. Because Robinson was not a full party to D.P.U. 89-300, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>does not qualify as an aggrieved party in interest with regard to that proceeding. Under G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5 (1992 ed.), only an aggrieved party may appeal from a DPU decision. Consequently, a single justice correctly dismissed Robinson\u2019s appeal of the DPU\u2019s decision in D.P.U. 89-300 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. See Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>On December 20, 1989, Robinson filed a petition, which he later revised, to intervene in the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company\u2019s (NET\u2019s) rate proceeding docketed as D.P.U. 89-300. After reviewing Robinson\u2019s revised petition, a DPU hearing officer ruled that Robinson could participate in D.P.U. 89-300 as a \u201climited participant,\u201d but that Robinson was \u201cnot so sufficiently or specifically interested in th[e] matter as to warrant full participation as an intervener in the[ ] proceedings, given the complex and extensive nature of the proceedings and the limited time available to the Department to conclude hearings in th[e] matter.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a limited participant, Robinson was permitted to receive all documents filed by the parties, to conduct written discovery, to examine witnesses by means of written questions submitted to the hearing officer or to the Attorney General, to file written briefs or memoranda, and to testify at public hearings. The DPU granted a number of other parties full intervener status.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Robinson appealed the hearing officer\u2019s ruling to a DPU commissioner. In a written decision, D.P.U. 89-300, the commissioner held that the hearing officer properly balanced Robinson\u2019s interests as an individual ratepayer against the DPU\u2019s need to conduct the proceeding in a complete, efficient, and orderly fashion. The commissioner rejected Robinson\u2019s claim that he was entitled to be a party because he would be the only effective advocate for his position on \u201cmetropolitan service.\u201d The commissioner noted that \u201cthe Attorney General, who is authorized by [G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11E (1992 ed.),] to represent utility customers, ha[d] indicated that he would participate extensively in th[e] case.\u201d The commissioner also rejected Robinson\u2019s claim that, with respect to Robinson, the hearing officer arbitrarily tightened the requirements for intervention in the DPU proceedings. The commissioner concluded that the hearing officer\u2019s decision to deny Robinson\u2019s petition to intervene as a full party and his decision to grant Robinson limited participant status were reasonable, not an abuse of discretion, and consistent with the applicable standards concerning intervention in DPU proceedings. See 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.03 (1986). See also note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Robinson participated in the rate proceedings which followed to the extent authorized by the DPU. In June, 1990, the DPU issued its decision on the merits of NET\u2019S proposed rate system. Only Robinson sought judicial review of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, Robinson filed an appeal with the single justice of this court. Thereafter, Robinson amended his claim of appeal. Robinson\u2019s amended complaint sought review of (1) the DPU\u2019s refusal to grant him full party status in D.P.U. 89-300 and (2) the rate decision itself. The DPU moved to dismiss the amended complaint pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>suant, in part, to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (1). The single justice allowed the DPU\u2019s motion. Robinson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">2. <em>Motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. </em>The DPU asserts that it correctly denied Robinson\u2019s petition to intervene as a full party in D.P.U. 89-300 and that, as a limited participant in D.P.U. 89-300, Robinson does not qualify as an aggrieved party in interest with regard to this proceeding and, therefore, cannot appeal the rate decision on the merits under G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The DPU argues that because Robinson lacked standing to appeal the rate decision, his appeal should be dismissed pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In order to assess the correctness of this claim, we must determine whether the DPU\u2019s decision to limit Robinson\u2019s participation was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Robinson asserts that in denying his petition to intervene while granting similar requests from other parties, the DPU acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner. He concludes that the DPU erred in denying him full participation. We do not agree. In its decision limiting Robinson\u2019s participation, the DPU explained that \u201cthose persons accorded full intervener status in this case represent large groups of ratepayers, have a major financial stake as large customers of NET\u2019s, and/or provide telecommunications services to the public using NET services.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While Robinson claims to represent 381,870 metropolitan service customers and 117,043 Bay State East metropolitan service customers, Robinson does not have the right to speak for any NET ratepayer other than himself. In deciding to grant full party status to individuals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>who represent either a large NET customer or a large number of NET ratepayers, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>while denying such status to Robinson who does not, it cannot be said that the DPU acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Robinson next argues that, even if the DPU\u2019s decision to deny his petition to intervene fully in this proceeding were sound and within the bounds of its discretion, it cannot be upheld because in denying his petition for full party status in this case, the DPU failed to demonstrate \u201creasoned consistency.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">In <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>367 Mass. 92 (1975), we said, \u201cA party to a proceeding before a regulatory agency such as the [DPU] has a right to expect and obtain reasoned consistency in the agency\u2019s decisions. This does not mean that every decision of the [DPU] in a particular proceeding becomes irreversible in the manner of judicial decisions constituting res judicata, but neither does it mean that the same issue arising as to the same party is subject to decision according to the whim or caprice of the [DPU] every time it is presented. ... In view of the [DPU\u2019s] prior pattern of treatment of this item, an unexplained deviation from that pattern cannot be permitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104-105.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Robinson asserts that the DPU violated the \u201creasoned consistency\u201d mandate by denying his petition to fully intervene in D.P.U. 89-300 after granting his petition to so intervene in DPU consolidated cases 699/1041, which also concerned NET\u2019s metropolitan service rate service. Specifically, Robin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>son contends that the DPU could not legally deviate from the pattern it established in D.P.U. 699/1041 with respect to his intervention status in rate-setting proceedings concerning metropolitan service without explaining its reasons for doing so. Contrary to Robinson\u2019s assertions, D.P.U. 89-300, although concerned with metropolitan service tariff rates, was not just a continuation of D.P.U. 699/1041 but was concerned with different aspects of metropolitan service. In addition, the record does not establish any sort of \u201cpattern\u201d with respect to Robinson and his intervention status by allowing him full party status in D.P.U. 699/1041. By allowing Robinson to fully intervene in one earlier proceeding concerning metropolitan telephone service rates, the DPU did not establish a \u201cpattern\u201d of conduct which requires it to allow Robinson full party status in all metropolitan rate cases.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, the requirement of \u201creasoned consistency\u201d in <em>Boston Gas Co., supra, </em>means that any change from an established pattern of conduct must be explained. <em>Id. </em>at 105. It does not mean that the DPU may never deviate from its original position. The commissioner noted that there was a short statutory deadline and a large number of representative persons to be heard and that Robinson could adequately raise his issues as a limited participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Robinson also claims that the DPU should have permitted him to fully intervene in D.P.U. 89-300 based on his contention that the Attorney General might not focus on his particular issues of concern. However, the possibility that the Attorney General may not pursue all of a residential customer\u2019s concerns in a rate proceeding does not require the DPU to give that customer full party status. \u201c[A] residential customer alleging no peculiar damage to himself . . . [has] no constitutional or statutory right to participate fully in the proceeding.\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>390 Mass. 208, 217 (1983). See <em>Save the Bay, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>366 Mass. 667, 673-674 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>The record does not reflect any peculiar damage to Robinson. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Robinson further contends that the standards for participation were made \u201cmore \u25a0 stringent\u201d for him. The commissioner noted that the persons accorded full intervener status represent \u201clarge groups of ratepayers, have a major financial stake as large customers of NET\u2019s, and/or provide telecommunications services to the parties using NET services.\u201d Robinson, as a single ratepayer, had to show \u201cpeculiar damage to himself.\u201d That standard was established prior to these proceedings and was not \u201carbitrarily tightened\u201d in an effort to exclude Robinson as a full party. See <em>Save the Bay, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., supra </em>at 673-674. The record does not support Robinson\u2019s claim that the DPU arbitrarily applied a higher, \u201cstiffer\u201d standard to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The record before the single justice was, sufficient to determine that the DPU did not err in limiting Robinson\u2019s participation. Because there was no error in limiting Robinson\u2019s participation, there was no error in the dismissal of the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
