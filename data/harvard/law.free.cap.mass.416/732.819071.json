Mass. R. Crim. P. 34, 378 Mass. 905 (1979). We transferred the matter here on our own motion. We conclude that the defendant had abandoned his right to court-appointed counsel. From the judge\u2019s report we learn the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-15\">The defendant is charged in a five-count indictment charging him with mayhem, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (knife), assault with intent to rob while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>armed with a dangerous weapon, breaking and entering in the daytime with intent to commit a felony, and larceny in excess of $250. At arraignment on August 19, 1992, Mr. Alan Rubin, who was in charge of the Hampshire and Franklin district office of the Committee for Public Counsel Services (CPCS), filed his appearance for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">For the next several months, Rubin engaged in a pretri\u00e1l conference with the prosecutor, joined in the filing of a pretrial conference report, presented a number of pretrial discovery motions, and pressed a motion to suppress evidence allegedly seized during a warrantless search. This motion was heard and denied by another judge in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">On February 16, 1993, the defendant filed, pro se, a \u201cmotion to allow withdrawal of counsel.\u201d In this motion he claimed an \u201cirreconcilable\u201d breakdown between himself and Rubin. He accused Rubin of failing to prepare the case prop-. erly. At the hearing on this motion on March 4, 1993, Rubin asserted that he was prepared and ready to defend the defendant. Some of the defendant\u2019s accusations were blatantly false. Rubin was a veteran trial lawyer who had tried many serious cases before the reporting judge who found him \u201cable, competent, honorable and conscientious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">The reporting judge told the defendant that he had a right to defend himself but he \u201cstrongly advised that he not do so.\u201d The defendant said that he had no desire to defend himself and accordingly the judge treated the pro se motion as a motion for the appointment of new counsel and denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">One week later the defendant refiled the same motion and the judge denied it again without a hearing. On the same day, the defendant filed another \u201cmotion to allow withdrawal of counsel\u201d in which he charged that Rubin had not called two available witnesses in support of his motion to suppress evidence, that Rubin had told him that he believed that the defendant was guilty and that he was lying, and that Rubin had \u201cintentionally sabotaged\u201d his defense. This motion was neither supported by an affidavit nor was it otherwise verified. The judge denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Rubin, on March 16, 1993, filed his own motion asking to be relieved of his appointment as defense counsel. In this motion, Rubin asserted that the defendant had refused to cooperate or communicate with him or to assist in the preparation of his defense, and that during their last interview, the defendant had physically assaulted him. The judge conducted a hearing on this motion at which Rubin and the defendant were present. The judge advised the defendant of his right to testify and also of his privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Rubin was sworn and testified. The defendant declined to testify or to cross-examine Rubin. Based on Rubin\u2019s testimony, the judge found that Rubin, during the previous week, had gone to the Hampshire County jail to speak with the defendant. They were admitted to a small interview room. The defendant refused to discuss the case, expressed his ill feelings toward Rubin, and after fifteen or twenty minutes when Rubin got up to leave, the defendant shoved the table against Rubin, knocking him against the wall. The defendant then struck Rubin, bruising his cheek, and knocking off his glasses. The correctional officers came to Rubin\u2019s rescue.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">The judge found the defendant to be \u201can intelligent and articulate young man who is quite familiar with the criminal justice system. At the time of his arrest last August he was on parole from the State of Alaska under supervision of Massachusetts parole authorities. He had been convicted in Alaska of four counts of burglary and three counts of escape and had been sentenced to an aggregate term of [twenty-two] years.\u201d He also has a long criminal record in Massachusetts extending back to 1976 when he was a juvenile.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The judge concluded that the defendant was \u201cengaging in a tactic that is becoming all too frequent in the trial court . . . attempting to forestall his trial and disrupt the prosecution by forcing a last minute change of his court-appointed counsel [and] if he were allowed to succeed in obtaining a court-appointed replacement for Mr. Rubin, he would be attempting to force a withdrawal by that attorney before his case could be brought to trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>It is beyond debate that an indigent defendant is entitled to court-appointed counsel for trial of a serious crime. This right is protected by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution (see <em>Argersinger </em>v. <em>Hamlin, </em>407 U.S. 25 [1972]), by art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution, and by S.J.C. Rule 3:10, as amended, 399 Mass. 1207 (1987). However, this right to appointed counsel is not absolute. It may be waived in writing (see S.J.C. Rule 3:10, \u00a7 2, as appearing in 397 Mass. 1217 [1986]). The indigent\u2019s right to appointed counsel does not include the right to dictate who shall be appointed (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drolet, </em>337 Mass. 396, 400-401 [1958]). The defendant refused without good cause to proceed with Rubin and this constitutes abandonment, a term perhaps more consistent with the defendant\u2019s conduct than the judge\u2019s choice of the word \u201cforfeiture.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>389 Mass. 359, 366-367, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 941 (1983). The record lends abundant support to the judge\u2019s findings that the defendant\u2019s complaints about Rubin were unwarranted and in some instances false.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">For these reasons, we affirm the judge\u2019s allowance of Rubin\u2019s motion to withdraw and his refusal to appoint new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
