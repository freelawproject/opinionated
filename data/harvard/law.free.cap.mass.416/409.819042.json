The judge sentenced the defendant to life in prison, and the defendant appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant makes the following arguments: (1) \u201cSince the evidence required the jury to speculate as to when the fatal blow was delivered and as to who delivered it, [the defendant] is entitled to an acquittal\u201d; (2) \u201cThe admission [in evidence] of Dr. [Robert] Korn\u2019s opinion that [the defendant] killed Shawn, based on groundless \u2018profile\u2019 evidence, created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice\u201d; (3) \u201cThe trial judge erred in permitting the Commonwealth to introduce evidence that [the defendant] wanted Laura Courtney [Shawn\u2019s mother] to have an abortion as probative of [the defendant\u2019s] \u2018attitude toward the child\u2019 \u201d; (4) \u201cThe prosecutor improperly elicited previously stricken hearsay opinion evidence and prejudicial vouching evidence\u201d; (5) \u201cThe trial judge erred in failing to give any instruction on consciousness of guilt and in giving harmful, erroneous instructions on malice\u201d; (6) \u201cThe cumulative effect of the above errors requires reversal\u201d; and (7) \u201cThe evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>verdict of murder committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty; and, even if minimally sufficient, the thrust of the evidence calls for [a new trial or] reduction to second degree murder.\u201d We conclude that there was no reversible error and we are not persuaded that justice requires a verdict of less than murder in the first degree. Therefore, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The defendant\u2019s first argument raises the question whether the evidence was sufficient as a matter of law to warrant a finding that the defendant, not someone else, caused the injuries that resulted in Shawn\u2019s death. We must determine whether, if the jury believed the evidence most favorable to the prosecution bearing on that question, they would have been warranted in inferring beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant caused the fatal injuries. <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>393 Mass. 793, 795-796 (1985). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979). The record contains the following trial evidence. Laura Courtney became involved in an affair with the defendant in July, 1988. Both were married but separated from their spouses. After Courtney became pregnant, the defendant told her he wanted her to abort the baby, explaining, among other things, that his divorce was not yet final and he was already paying support for his son. Courtney did not have an abortion, and for the remainder of her pregnancy saw little of the defendant. The baby, Shawn, was born April 11, 1989. Several weeks later, following Courtney\u2019s request, the defendant went to Courtney\u2019s house to see Shawn. A few weeks later the defendant again visited Shawn and then visited him \u201ca couple times a month\u201d during the next several months. The defendant babysat for Shawn three or four times. After one such occasion, Shawn had \u201ca little mark on the side of his eye.\u201d The defendant explained that Shawn had rolled off the couch.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Shawn\u2019s pediatrician testified that, during three routine office visits, the child\u2019s physical examinations were normal, with proper growth and development. The doctor never detected any injuries or bruises on the child. In addition to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>routine visits, the doctor also consulted once by telephone with Courtney in late August, when he prescribed over-the-counter medication for an upper respiratory infection.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Shawn was pronounced dead at the hospital October 6, 1989, at 7:23 a.m. Shawn had spent much of the previous day, October 5, with Courtney and her neighbor, Lori Cote at Cote\u2019s apartment. Shawn appeared to be a happy baby that day. \u201cHe smiled, laughed.\u201d He was getting over a cold. Beginning at 4:30 p.m., Cote\u2019s brother and his girlfriend, Amie Fontaine, babysat Shawn while Courtney and Cote purchased beer at a package store. After their return, Courtney fed Shawn at 6:30 p.m., and then Courtney' and Cote went to visit Courtney\u2019s cousin, Paul, while Fontaine babysat for Shawn as he slept. While at Paul\u2019s house, Courtney telephoned the defendant and, as a result, the defendant came to Paul\u2019s house. Shortly thereafter, Courtney and the defendant returned to Courtney\u2019s apartment, which Courtney then left to go to Cote\u2019s apartment to retrieve Shawn. It was then about 9 p.m. Shawn was sleeping at Cote\u2019s apartment and Courtney woke him up. She did not have \u201cany problems\u201d waking him up and he smiled at her. Fontaine testified that she did not \u201cdo anything to [Shawn] that night,\u201d and she did not see anyone strike or injure him in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Courtney returned to her apartment with Shawn. The defendant offered to babysit while Courtney and Cote went to a local bar. As Courtney was getting ready to leave, the defendant\u2019s friend, Tracey Payne, came to visit the defendant. Payne testified that he was at Courtney\u2019s apartment for about one-half hour with the defendant and Shawn and that Courtney was there part of the time. Payne remembered Shawn being put to bed before Courtney left, but he did not remember who did that. He was sure that Shawn was not on the couch when Courtney left. Payne did not touch Shawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">At 11:30 p.m., October 5, Courtney called the defendant to check on Shawn. The defendant told her that Shawn \u201cfell off the couch, but he\u2019s all right\u201d and he \u201cput him to bed.\u201d When Courtney returned home at 12:30 a.m., October 6, the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>fendant was asleep on the couch. She checked on the baby from the doorway of his room and woke up the defendant. After she and the defendant went to bed together, she wanted to discuss their relationship. As the defendant did not want to have this discussion, he fell asleep. She then got out of bed and went to the kitchen, where she wrote him a love note.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">The alarm awoke them at 5:30 a.m. and the defendant arose, without speaking, ten or fifteen minutes later. Fifteen minutes after the defendant arose, Courtney heard him say to Shawn, \u201cI have to change your diaper, and you have to go to the doctor\u2019s.\u201d She then heard Shawn make a \u201cweird noise,\u201d as if gasping for air. The apartment was quiet for the next fifteen minutes or so. According to Courtney, the defendant left for work at approximately 6:45 a.m. When the defendant left, Courtney got out of bed and observed the defendant leaving the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">She then went to check on Shawn, who appeared to be sleeping. After he did not respond to his name, she touched his hands, which were cold. When she picked him up, Shawn was limp, had half-closed eyes, and appeared not to be breathing. She brought him into the living room, set him on the couch, dialed 911, and attempted to resuscitate him. When the rescue team arrived, Courtney was hysterical. The emergency medical technician noted that Shawn had a pulse but appeared in respiratory distress. While being transported to the hospital, Shawn stopped breathing, and then his heart stopped. The hospital\u2019s efforts at resuscitation were unsuccessful, and Shawn was pronounced dead at 7:23 a.m. Dr. Korn, the emergency room physician who first examined Shawn, found a bulging fontanel (the soft spot on a baby\u2019s head) and several bruises on the face and hands. He also observed retinal hemorrhages in back of Shawn\u2019s eyes that were bright red, implying that the injury to the head was \u201crelatively new.\u201d His initial diagnosis was \u201cchild abuse and death due to head trauma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Dr. John C. DuVally performed an autopsy and concluded that the cause of Shawn\u2019s death was a \u201c[mjassive skull frac-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>turc with bleeding due to head trauma.\u201d Dr. DuVally explained that death likely occurred when the injured brain expanded and pushed down on the brain stem. His examination of Shawn further revealed several faint superficial bruises on his head, chest, and back; a ruptured frenulum (the web of skin between the upper lip and the upper gum); three fractured ribs; and blood in the pleural and abdominal cavities. He was unable to form an opinion as to the amount or nature of the force necessary to cause the fracture, but he concluded that the injuries were consistent with \u201c[sjome sort of force being applied to the back of the head.\u201d He further concluded that the injuries were not consistent with \u201cshaken baby syndrome\u201d or a fall from a two or three foot couch.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Of critical importance to our conclusion that the evidence warranted a finding that the defendant inflicted the injuries that resulted in Shawn\u2019s death is Dr. DuVally\u2019s testimony concerning the period within which, in his opinion, the injuries occurred. He testified that, as part of the autopsy procedure, \u201csections are taken of a number of the bruises that [he had] described; also, what amounts to routine sections. They\u2019re called the heart, lung, spleen, kidneys, adrenal, and so forth. The sections of the bruises were very recent. There was hemorrhage into the fat. [He could not] date them or time them exactly, but [he] would say certainly less than twelve hours.\u201d Dr. DuVally also characterized various other hemorrhages as \u201cvery recent\u201d and when asked whether he could \u201cgive an outside time as to the length of the process\u201d by which the massive skull fracture would have resulted in Shawn\u2019s death, he answered, \u201cI\u2019d say less than twelve hours is the best I could do; and, again, these are estimates.\u201d In response to the question, \u201cWould that be twelve hours from the injury to the time of death,\u201d Dr. DuVally said, \u201cYes. Anywhere within . . . twelve hours. It could be much shorter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Finally, the following questions addressed to Courtney, and her answers, are important:</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number><em>Q.: </em>\u201cNow, at any time during . . . that night or early that morning, October 5, October 6, did you strike your baby, Shawn?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><em>A.: </em>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\"><em>Q:. </em>\u201cDid you hit the baby at all?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\"><em>A.: </em>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\"><em>Q.: </em>\u201cDuring the time that you were with the baby the previous day or that morning, did you see the baby fall in any way?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\"><em>A.: </em>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">Based on the evidence recited above, the jury could have believed that the injuries leading to Shawn\u2019s death were inflicted within a period of twelve hours before 7:23 a.m. on October 6, 1989, a period during which only Fontaine, Payne, Courtney, and the defendant had access to Shawn. They also could have believed Fontaine, Payne, and Courtney\u2019s testimony that they did not hit or \u201cdo anything\u201d to Shawn. From those facts based on direct evidence, the jury would have been warranted in inferring beyond a reasonable doubt that the fatal injuries were inflicted by the defendant when he was alone with Shawn, that is, between 10 p.m. on October 5, and 12:30 a.m. on October 6 or thereafter when he, Courtney and Shawn were together. Although nothing further is needed to reach the threshold of sufficient evidence, we make the observation that that inference finds support both in the testimony, which we shall discuss later in this opinion, concerning the defendant\u2019s expressed wish that the child be aborted, followed by the defendant\u2019s minimal support of Courtney and Shawn following Shawn\u2019s birth, and in the testimony of Shawn\u2019s pediatrician that, in routine office visits, the examinations disclosed no bruises, injuries, or abnormalities, suggesting that Courtney was paying attention, to the child\u2019s needs and was not disposed to harm him.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">We turn to the defendant\u2019s argument that the judge erred by admitting in evidence testimony of Dr. Robert Korn, which the defendant characterizes as Dr. Korn\u2019s opinion that the defendant killed Shawn. Dr. Korn, a board-certified physician in emergency medicine and pediatrics, had been a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>practicing physician for twelve years at the time of the trial. He was on duty when Shawn was brought to the hospital and was part of the team that tried to resuscitate him. Dr. Korn testified without objection that, after a child died, it was his routine practice, and he did it in this case, to ask the parents to view the child after death because it helps them psychologically. The doctor recalled and made a note that the father of Shawn viewed the child. He did not recall whether the mother did and he made no note of it. He testified that he would not make a note if the parent grieved appropriately, but he would note unusual behavior. Dr. Korn noted that \u201c[w]hen the father came to view the child, it seemed that he was very concerned about the physical findings on the child.\u201d The doctor testified that the defendant \u201ccame in and specifically paid attention to bruising on the child\u2019s body. He looked several times at the face and chest, turning the head from side to side, and looked at these bruises, and that was unusual behavior for a parent in that situation, in my opinion.\u201d Dr. Korn also testified that his record showed that the defendant had told him that he had changed Shawn\u2019s diaper that morning, October 6, at 6:30 a.m., that Shawn did not wake up, and that he seemed to be having trouble breathing. The record indicated that the defendant then placed the child back in the crib. The doctor testified, \u201cMost parents, if their child is having trouble breathing, they dial 911. I can\u2019t tell you how many children cough and their child is immediately brought to the emergency room by ambulance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Later, again without objection, Shawn\u2019s medical records for October 6 were introduced in evidence, including a child abuse report completed by Dr. Korn pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51 A. The report form contains the following printed request: \u201cPlease give other information which you think might be helpful in establishing the cause of the injury and/or the person responsible for it. If known, please provide the name(s) of the alleged perpetrator(s).\u201d Dr. Korn responded in writing: \u201cFather examined child after death, looking at skin of face and chest multiple times. He also stated, when asked, that patient fell off couch several days ago but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>was \u2018fine.\u2019 \u201d The defendant argues that \u201c[t]he prosecutor made no effort to qualify Dr. Korn as competent to testify about the normal or abnormal psychology of grief. . . . Dr. Korn . . . was presumptively unqualified. . . . [T]o the extent that the silent record implies a judicial finding that Dr. Korn was qualified to give an opinion . . . the finding was wrong.\u201d The defendant also contends that \u201c[a] 11 the scientific literature on the psychology of grief negates the reliability of his opinions. Based on this literature, there can be no question that Dr. Korn\u2019s \u2018opinion\u2019 was based on no cognizable scientific principle or theory. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fatalo, </em>346 Mass. 266 (1963) [.] <em>Frye </em>v. <em>United States, </em>293 F. 1013, 1014 (D.C. Cir. 1923).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">There having been no objection to Dr. Korn\u2019s testimony, the question on appeal is whether its admission was error resulting in a \u201csubstantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, ante </em>27, 30 (1993). Although we do not agree with the defendant that Dr. Korn\u2019s testimony and child abuse report stating that the defendant\u2019s grief response at the hospital was unusual demonstrated his belief that the defendant had killed Shawn, we do agree that that testimony and report revealed Dr. Korn\u2019s opinion that the defendant\u2019s conduct at the hospital may have been some indication that the defendant was responsible for Shawn\u2019s death. However, the defendant has not demonstrated that, had he objected to the testimony, the judge would have excluded it. A judge has wide discretion in qualifying a witness to offer expert opinion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Devlin, </em>365 Mass. 149, 152 (1974). \u201c[E]xpert testimony on matters within the witness\u2019s field of expertise is admissible whenever it will aid the jury in reaching a decision, even if the expert\u2019s opinion touches on the ultimate issues that the jury must decide.\u201d <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 105 (1982). A judge should consider \u201cwhether the witness possesses sufficient skill, knowledge or experience in the field of his testimony that the jury may receive appreciable assistance from it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>367 Mass. 169, 182 (1975). We cannot say that the judge would have abused his discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>admitting in evidence Dr. Korn\u2019s opinion with respect to the inappropriateness of the defendant\u2019s grief response at the hospital. Furthermore, we reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the opinion testimony was inadmissible because it was \u201cbased on no cognizable scientific principle or theory\u201d within the import of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fatalo, supra, </em>and <em>Frye </em>v. <em>United States, supra. </em>Those cases focused on the admissibility of scientific testing methods, such as the polygraph test, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendes, </em>406 Mass. 201 (1989), and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) testing in paternity cases, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beausoleil, </em>397 Mass. 206, 215 (1986). The evidence in question here does not involve scientific test results. Also, contrary to another of the defendant\u2019s arguments, it was not inadmissible \u201cprofile evidence.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Day, </em>409 Mass. 719, 723 (1991). We conclude that the admission of Dr. Korn\u2019s testimony and report concerning the defendant\u2019s grief response at the hospital was not erroneous for any reason argued by the defendant and, based on the same reasoning, we conclude that there was no error in admitting Dr. Korn\u2019s opinion that the defendant\u2019s conduct (in returning Shawn to his crib and leaving him after Shawn failed to awaken while his diaper was changed and while Shawn was having trouble breathing) was unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The defendant next argues that the judge erroneously admitted evidence, offered without objection, that, during the course of Courtney\u2019s pregnancy with Shawn, the defendant urged her to have an abortion. The Commonwealth presented this evidence along with evidence that the defendant was already paying support for another son and that, for a period of time after Shawn\u2019s birth, the defendant contested his paternity of Shawn and rejected invitations to see him. The evidence was relevant to the defendant\u2019s attitude toward Shawn when Shawn died at the age of six months. We reject the defendant\u2019s argument that, even if the evidence was relevant, as a matter of policy we should not permit \u201ca person\u2019s desire or lack of desire for a particular nonviable fetus to be aborted to raise the inference that that person bears ill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>will . . . toward the child into which that fetus ultimately develops.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The defendant\u2019s fourth argument is that \u201c [t] he prosecutor improperly elicited previously stricken hearsay opinion evidence and prejudicial vouching evidence.\u201d During the direct examination of Dr. DuVally, the pathologist, the prosecutor asked, \u201cNow, with respect to the bruising or the injuries that you observed, Doctor, to the side of the child\u2019s face and lip area, do you have an opinion as to whether or not those injuries were consistent with a hand being placed over the face and mouth area and force then being applied to the child?\u201d Dr. DuVally answered, \u201cCould they have been? Is that the. question?\u201d The judge then excluded the question. Later in the trial, during the direct examination of Trooper Deborah Bruce, and without objection, the prosecutor asked if the trooper had asked the defendant how the victim could have sustained these injuries. She responded, \u201cI believe we went over it again. He stated something about falling off the couch again. Then I had mentioned to him that the baby had bruises on both sides of his neck and tearing under his lip that was consistent with someone with a large hand placing it over the baby\u2019s face and pressing down hard. He stated to me at the time, T know what you mean, yes. I have large hands. I see what you\u2019re saying.\u2019 \u201d Following this answer, the prosecutor then asked Trooper Bruce if she had ever seen Courtney\u2019s hands, to which she responded that Courtney is \u201ca small person. So, they were really small hands.\u201d The defendant argues on appeal that this was an \u201cunlawful ploy by the prosecutor to slip in inadmissible evidence through the back door. . . . Because of Officer Bruce\u2019s testimony, Dr. DuVally\u2019s stricken expert opinion was revived, without the benefit of cross-examination. This untested opinion, which the jury had heard from Dr. DuVally\u2019s lips before it was stricken . . . bolstered the Commonwealth\u2019s otherwise groundless \u2018large hands\u2019 theory \u2014 a theory also excluding [Courtney] who, Officer Bruce asserted, has \u2018really small hands.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>We note that the jury did not hear what Dr. DuVally\u2019s opinion may have been with respect to whether Shawn\u2019s injuries \u201cwere consistent with\u201d his assailant\u2019s having large hands, and Trooper Bruce did not purport to be repeating a theory that originated with Dr. DuVally. Nevertheless, we agree that Trooper Bruce\u2019s testimony should not have been allowed to stand. We are satisfied, however, that its admission did not result in a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. It seems quite clear that the identification of Shawn\u2019s assailant did not turn on whether the assailant\u2019s hands were large or small, but rather on the jurors\u2019 assessment of the credibility of Fontaine, Payne, and Courtney and the evidence bearing on the defendant\u2019s attitude toward Shawn and, to some degree, on the consciousness of guilt evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Next, we take up the defendant\u2019s contentions that the judge erred in failing to give a jury instruction concerning consciousness of guilt evidence and in giving incorrect and harmful instructions on malice. The defendant states in his brief: \u201c[T]he central ingredients of the Commonwealth\u2019s case were various acts and statements by [the defendant] allegedly demonstrating a guilty mind. The prosecutor emphasized all of these in his closing argument: (1) he argued that [the defendant] \u2018left a dying baby in his crib,\u2019 without calling the police for help, and gave an allegedly false explanation for doing so: \u2018this baloney about a cold\u2019; ... (2) he argued that [the defendant] examined Shawn\u2019s body inappropriately at the hospital: \u2018he knew what he was looking for\u2019; ... (3) he argued at length about allegedly inconsistent statements [the defendant] made to the police and others about telephone calls, about the baby falling off the couch, and about when he put the baby to bed: \u2018he\u2019s all over the ballpark\u2019 99</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The defendant\u2019s brief continues: \u201cBecause of the Commonwealth\u2019s emphasis on this evidence and because of the lack of much else in its case against [the defendant], it was particularly important that the judge instruct the jury \u2018(1) that they are not to convict a defendant on the basis of [consciousness of guilt evidence] alone, and (2) that they may, but need not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>consider such evidence as one of the factors tending to prove the guilt of the defendant.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toney, </em>385 Mass. 575, 585 (1982).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The defendant\u2019s trial counsel neither requested such an instruction nor objected to its absence. Recently, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, ante </em>27, 30 (1993), we held that a judge is required to instruct the jury according to this language in <em>Toney </em>whenever there is evidence of consciousness of guilt, regardless of whether the defendant so requests. \u201cIf the instruction is not given in a case such as this, which is subject to review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we test the error on the standard whether there was a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the required instructions had been given in this case, \u201c[w]e think it is reasonably clear that the verdict[ ] would not have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32. There was considerable evidence introduced and argued by the Commonwealth in addition to the consciousness of guilt evidence. Apart from consciousness of guilt, the Commonwealth\u2019s case was reasonably strong. Although consciousness of guilt was argued by the Commonwealth, it surely was not the main focus of its presentation. In our view, it is extremely unlikely that the jury convicted the defendant solely on the basis of such evidence, or that this conviction resulted from the jury\u2019s mistaken notion that they not only could, but also were required, to consider the consciousness of guilt evidence in this case as a factor tending to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Moving to the defendant\u2019s other challenge to the jury instructions, we consider whether the judge committed reversible error by instructing the jury on the so-called first prong of the malice aforethought element of murder, that is, proof that the defendant intended to kill the victim. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>414 Mass. 252, 265 (1993). No contention is made that the judge gave an incorrect definition of the first prong. Rather, the defendant\u2019s contention is that, since there was no evidence of the defendant\u2019s intention to kill Shawn, the jury should not have been instructed that malice aforethought may be proved by evidence of intent to kill. We are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>satisfied that that instruction did not give rise to a reasonable likelihood that the jury mistakenly found first prong malice aforethought, without sufficient evidence, rather than second or third prong malice, of which there had been considerable evidence. In addition, the identity of the assailant, not malice, was the principal issue in contention at the trial. The overly inclusive description of malice in the jury instructions, therefore, did not give rise to a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Puleio, </em>394 Mass. 101, 108 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Finally, the defendant argues that the \u201cevidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict of murder committed with extreme atrocity or cruelty; and, even if minimally sufficient, the thrust of the evidence calls for reduction to second degree murder.\u201d In view of the number and severity of the six month old victim\u2019s injuries, culminating in death after the passage of an uncertain but appreciable period of time, we cannot conclude that the jury\u2019s determination of extreme atrocity or cruelty was unjustified by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">We have reviewed the entire record and, as urged by the defendant, we have considered \u201cthe cumulative effect\u201d of any errors in the trial court that have been established. The defendant has not persuaded us that justice requires a verdict of less than murder in the first degree. Therefore, we decline to exercise our extraordinary power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reverse the judgment or reduce the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-10\">The defendant\u2019s counsel on appeal did not represent him at the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
