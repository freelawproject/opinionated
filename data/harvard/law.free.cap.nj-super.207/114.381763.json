Defendant\u2019s motions for a new trial follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>ing the jury verdict were denied. The trial court thereupon merged the conviction for possession of a handgun for an unlawful purpose with the conviction for murder and committed defendant to the custody of the Commissioner of the Department of Corrections for 70 years, with a parole ineligibility term of 35 years, and assessed a penalty of $1,000.00, payable to the Violent Crimes Compensation Board. In addition, defendant was committed to a concurrent term of 5 years, with a 2Va year period of parole ineligibility, and assessed a penalty of $25.00 for possession of a handgun without having first obtained the requisite permit to carry the same. Both custodial sentences were to be served consecutively to any sentence defendant was then serving for a prior parole violation. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Defendant seeks a reversal of his convictions or, alternatively, a modification of his sentences on the following grounds set forth in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN RULING THAT THE DEFENDANT\u2019S POST-ARREST VERBAL STATEMENTS TO THE POLICE WERE NOT OBTAINED IN VIOLATION OF EDWARDS v. ARIZONA, AND WERE, THEREFORE, ADMISSIBLE IN EVIDENCE AT THE DEFENDANT\u2019S TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">II.

THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED ERROR IN REFUSING THE DEFENSE MOTION TO STRIKE THE TESTIMONY OF KATHLEEN CAREY THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED NUMEROUS PHONE CALLS FOR THE DECEDENT, CARL GROSSMAN, ALLEGEDLY MADE BY AN INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFYING HIMSELF AS ROGERS KELLY, THE DEFENDANT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-11\">V. THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED PLAIN ERROR BY ALLOWING INTO EVIDENCE TESTIMONY AS TO BLOOD ANALYSIS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-12\">VI.

THE NUMEROUS ERRORS AT TRIAL CONSIDERED IN THE AGGREGATE AND CUMULATIVELY BROUGHT ABOUT AN UNJUST RESULT REQUIRING A NEW TRIAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">We have carefully considered these contentions and all of the arguments advanced by defendant in support of them and find that, with the exception of the challenge to the legality of the sentence (Point VII), they are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2). Further comment is appropriate, however, with respect to several of these points before we turn to a consideration of the challenge of the legality of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">The trial court did not err in refusing to permit cross-examination of the State\u2019s witness, Kathleen Carey, concerning her relationship with the murder victim, Carl Grossman. It is fundamental that trial courts have been accorded broad discretion in determining the proper limitations of cross-examination of witnesses on issues of credibility. <em>State v. Pontery, </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>457, 473 (1955); <em>State v. Zwillman, </em>112 <em>N.J.Super. </em>6, 17-18 (App.Div.1970), certif. den., 57 <em>N.J. </em>603 (1971). <em>See also State v. Smith, </em>101 <em>N.J.Super. </em>10, 14 (App.Div.1968), certif. den., 53 <em>N.J. </em>577 (1969) (trial court has \u201cdiscretion to determine how far details [of bias] may be allowed to be brought out\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">Statutory law in New Jersey provides that \u201c[fjor the purpose of affecting the credibility of any witness, his interest in the result of the action ... may be shown by examination or otherwise.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:81-12. Similarly, the <em>New Jersey Rules of Evidence </em>provide that \u201cfor the purpose of impairing or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>supporting the credibility of a witness, any party ... may examine him and introduce extrinsic evidence relevant upon the issue of credibility.\u201d <em>Evid.R. </em>20. However, these rules limit the admissibility of evidence affecting credibility by further providing that evidence of traits of character, other than honesty or veracity or their opposites, is inadmissible. <em>Evid.R. </em>22(c). In addition, the <em>New Jersey Rules of Evidence </em>provide, with respect to all evidence, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">A judge may in his discretion exclude evidence if he finds that its probative value is substantially outweighed by the risk that its admission will ... create substantial danger of undue prejudice or of confusing the issues or of misleading the jury. <em>[Evid.R. </em>4].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-7\"><em>See State v. Vaccaro, </em>142 <em>N.J.Super. </em>167, 177 (App.Div.1976), certif. den., 71 <em>N.J. </em>518 (1976) (cross-examination on issue of bias or prejudice may be limited by court in appropriate case because of remoteness or other grounds within the ambit of <em>Evid.R. </em>4); <em>State v. Thompson, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>396, 421 (1971) (where the probative value of evidence \u201cis so significantly outweighed by [its] inherently inflammatory potential as to have a probable capacity to divert the minds of the jurors from a reasonable and fair evaluation\u201d the evidence is inadmissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Therefore, the right of the defense to show the interest of a witness \u201cdoes not mean ... that the cross-examiner has a license to roam at will under the guise of impeaching the witness.\u201d <em>State v. Pontery, supra, </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>at 473. In <em>State v. Arbus, </em>54 <em>N.J.Super. </em>76, 83 (App.Div.1959), we noted that \u201cmore sins of admission have been committed during cross-examination in the name of \u2018credibility\u2019 than because of any other misconception in the law of evidence.\u201d <em>See </em>3A <em>Wigmore, Evidence </em>\u00a7 878 at 648 (Chadbourn rev. 1970) (cross-examination is not universal solvent for reducing everything to admissibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Here, Carey\u2019s interest or bias had already been adequately highlighted at trial through repeated references to her employment as Grossman\u2019s secretary and to her attendance at his funeral. If, as defendant asserts, the only reason for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>disputed cross-examination was to show that the witness had a personal interest in the outcome of the trial, this had already-been shown sufficiently. Any further testimony as to Carey\u2019s alleged relationship with a married man, would have served no legitimate evidentiary purpose and would have violated <em>Evid.R. </em>22, which proscribes the use of evidence of character traits other than honesty or veracity (or the lack thereof) to impugn credibility. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s limitation of the cross-examination of Carey was entirely proper. <em>See State v. Cranmer, </em>134 <em>N.J.Super. </em>117, 122 (App.Div.1975), certif. den., 68 <em>N.J. </em>283 (1975) (limitation of cross-examination upheld as non-violative of constitutional right of confrontation). <em>Cf. Graf v. Folarno, </em>99 <em>N.J.Super. </em>173, 177 (App.Div.1968), certif. den., 51 <em>N.J. </em>463 (1968) (cross examination in error because it \u201cdid not of itself relate to any legitimate question of the [witness\u2019s] credibility or qualifications\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Beyond this, in view of the overwhelming evidence of guilt, the \u201cerror\u201d alleged by defendant did not reach dimensions \u201csufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the error led the jury to a result it otherwise might not have reached.\u201d <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 336 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The trial court properly refused to strike the testimony of Carey that she had received numerous telephone calls for the victim, Grossman, made by an individual identifying himself as Rogers Kelly. In addition to the reasons expressed by the trial court in denying defendant\u2019s motion, it is perfectly clear that the State did not seek to prove the substance of these telephone calls. Rather, the testimony was offered only to show that defendant made at least 6 attempts to reach Grossman by telephone. <em>Cf. State v. Hudson, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>364, 372 (1962) (testimony that within an hour of homicide deceased received a disturbing telephone call admissible despite lack of identification of caller).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>When viewed in this light, Carey\u2019s testimony was clearly admissible as non-hearsay, as it was not offered to prove the truth of any assertion of fact made by the caller during the conversation. The testimony with respect to the calls was proffered only as verbal conduct that calls were placed by someone who identified himself as defendant. <em>Cf. State v. Humanik, </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>283, 306 (App.Div.1985) (oral statements not inadmissible as hearsay where they constituted verbal acts and were not offered to prove truth of their contents); <em>Robinson v. Branch Brook Manor Apartments, </em>101 <em>N.J.Super. </em>117, 122 (App.Div.1968), certif. den., 52 <em>N.J. </em>487 (1968) (testimony regarding telephone calls not hearsay when offered as verbal conduct showing discriminatory activity).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The trial court properly admitted testimony regarding the results of an analysis of the blood spots found in defendant\u2019s truck. The results of such \u201cscientific tests are admissible at a criminal trial only when they are shown to have \u2018sufficient scientific basis to produce uniform and reasonably reliable results and will contribute materially to the ascertainment of the truth.\u2019 \u201d <em>Romano v. Kimmelman, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>66, 80 (1984) (quoting <em>State v. Cary, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>343, 352 (1967)). Blood testing results were specifically considered in <em>State v. Beard, </em>16 <em>N.J. </em>50, 58-59 (1954), where the Supreme Court rejected the contention that testimony indicating that defendant\u2019s clothes contained human blood, of the same type as the victim, was inconclusive because 46 percent of the population was found to have blood of that type. In reaching this conclusion the <em>Beard </em>Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">No one circumstance standing alone would be sufficient to prove the defendant guilty of the crime laid against him, but each fact, taken in connection with others as constituting a chain of circumstances tending to corroborate the State\u2019s case and to support the inference that the accused was the person who committed the crime, was admissible in evidence. Additionally, in <em>Morton v. U.S., </em>79 <em>U.S.App.D.C. </em>329, 147 F.2d 28 <em>(C.A.D.C.WAS), </em>the court ruled the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>objection made by the defendant to blood tests and various tests related to them is applicable to the weight of the evidence and not its admissibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\"><em>The blood stains were a link in the chain of evidence forged by the State and were entitled to be weighed, with the other evidence presented, by the jury in arriving at its conclusion. [State v. Beard, supra, </em>16 <em>N.J. </em>at 58-59 (Emphasis supplied) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The right of the State to present evidence regarding similarities in blood type was similarly recognized in <em>State v. Alexander, </em>7 <em>N.J. </em>585, 596 (1951), <em>cert, </em>den., 343 <em>U.S. </em>908, 72 <em>S.Ct. </em>638, 96 <em>L.Ed. </em>1326 (1952), where the court affirmed the State\u2019s right to use defendant\u2019s blood to show that it was of the same type as that found on the murder weapon, even when a blood sample was taken against defendant\u2019s will. <em>Cf. State v. Baldwin, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>379, 391-392 (1966), <em>cert, </em>den., 385 <em>U.S. </em>980, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>527, 17 L.Ed.2d 442 (1966) (expert testimony comparing soil taken from automobile with soil from dirt road near murder scene and comparing hair particles in comb found near body with those of defendant was admissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Even though the blood analysis testing done after the Gross-man murder was not conclusive as to the source of the blood specimens found in defendant's truck, it was still relevant because such evidence rendered the desired inference \u2014 that Grossman had been in the vehicle \u2014 more probable than it would have been without the evidence. <em>See State v. Davis, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>611, 619 (1984); <em>State v. Coruzzi, </em>189 <em>N.J.Super. </em>273, 302 (App.Div.1983), certif. den., 94 <em>N.J. </em>531 (1983). The probative value of this evidence, therefore, was not outweighed by its potential for prejudice. <em>Evid.R. </em>4. The probative value of this testimony was to place the victim within the proportion of the population which had blood similar to that found in the truck. Since both the prosecution and the defense adduced testimony from Frances Gdowski, the New Jersey State Police Forensic Chemist, with respect to the inconclusiveness of her test results, the possibility of prejudice based upon over-speculation was extremely limited. <em>See State v. Baldwin, supra, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>at 392 (expert testimony that hair particles on comb \u201cwere of a general category within which defendant\u2019s hair would fall\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>not too speculative to be admissible). We are satisfied, therefore, that the trial court did not mistakenly exercise its discretion in ruling on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on two out-of-state cases, <em>People v. Robinson, </em>27 N.Y.2d 864, 317 N.Y.S.2d 19, 265 <em>N.E.2d </em>543 (Ct.App.1970) and <em>People v. Macedonio, </em>42 N.Y.2d 944, 397 N.Y.S.2d 1002, 366 <em>N.E.2d </em>1355 (Ct.App.1977), which held that evidence of a defendant\u2019s blood type should be accorded no probative value when a large proportion of the general population is shown to have blood of the same type, is not persuasive, particularly in view of a plethora of authority from other states supporting the use of blood testing results as evidence of whether certain blood is that of a particular person. <em>See e.g., People v. Vallez, </em>80 <em>Cal.App.3d </em>46, 143 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>914, 920 (Ct.App.1978) (trial court did not err in allowing expert testimony regarding blood typing of stains, despite fact that 40 percent of world\u2019s population had Type A blood); <em>People v. Henderson, </em>83 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>854, 39 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>8, 18-19, 404 <em>N.E.2d </em>392, 402-403 (Ct.App.1980) (no error in trial court\u2019s admitting evidence that defendant had Type A blood, although defendant had contended it was of little or no probative value since 40 to 43 percent of general population have blood of that type); <em>State v. Mark, </em>286 <em>N.W.2d </em>396, 412-413 (Iowa Sup.Ct.1980) (trial court properly admitted evidence that cigarettes found at murder scene had been smoked by person with Type O blood since probative value was not outweighed by prejudicial effect, even though 80 percent of population secreted evidence of blood type in saliva and 45 percent had Type O blood); <em>State v. Bolder, </em>635 <em>S.</em>W.2d 673, 688-689 &amp; n. 12 (Mo.Sup.Ct.1982), <em>cert, </em>den., 459 <em>U.S. </em>1137, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>770, 74 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>983 (1983) (testimony of forensic serologist as to blood type on murder weapon properly admitted, despite defendant\u2019s objection of remoteness, since blood type was that of 45 percent of population and related to its weight, rather than its admissibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Accordingly, the trial court did not commit error, let alone plain error, by admitting Ms. Gdowski\u2019s testimony with respect to the blood analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Finally, we consider defendant\u2019s challenge to the legality of the sentence imposed upon him for murder. The trial court sentenced defendant to an extended term of imprisonment of 70 years, with a 35 year period of parole ineligibility, pursuant to the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7. Defendant contends that this sentence was illegal in view of the sentencing options of W./.5.A.2C:ll-3b, as amended and in effect at the time of his sentence in November 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">At the time of the commission of the crime in January 1982, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:ll-3b <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Code of Criminal Justice provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">Murder is a crime of the first degree but a person convicted of murder may be sentenced by the court (1) to a term of 30 years of which the person must serve 15 years before being eligible for parole, or (2) as in a crime of the first degree except that the maximum term for such a crime of the first degree shall be 30 years. Nothing contained in this subsection shall prohibit the court from imposing an extended term pursuant to 2C:43-7 for the crime of murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">In January 1982, extended term sentences for murder were governed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7a(l)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> specifical<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>ly provided that a person convicted of a crime could be sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">In the case of a crime sentenced under 2C:ll-3 for a specific term of years which shall be between 30 years and life imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">In January of 1982, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7b provided, as it does now, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">As part of a sentence for an extended term and notwithstanding the provisions of 2C:43~9, the court may fix a minimum term not to exceed one-half of the term set pursuant to subsection a. during which the defendant shall not be eligible for parole or a term of 25 years during which time the defendant shall not be eligible for parole where the sentence imposed was life imprisonment provided that no defendant shall be eligible for parole at a date earlier than otherwise provided by the law governing parole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Therefore, at the time of the commission of this murder, the maximum sentence that could be imposed for murder was life imprisonment, with a 25 year period of parole ineligibility. Since 25 years was the parole ineligibility term for the maximum sentence (life imprisonment), it follows logically that a greater ineligibility term could not be imposed for a lesser sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">This conclusion is confirmed when <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7b is read in conjunction with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.51b of the Parole Act of 1979. The latter statute provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-11\">Each adult inmate sentenced to a term of life imprisonment shall become primarily eligible for parole after having served any judicial or statutory mandatory minimum term, or 25 years where no mandatory minimum term has been imposed less commutation time for good behavior and credits for diligent application to work and other institutional assignments. <em>If an inmate sentenced to a specific term or terms of years is eligible for parole on a date later than the date upon which he would be eligible if a life sentence had been imposed, then in such case the inmate shall be eligible for parole after having served 25 years, less commutation time for good behavior and credits for diligent application to work and other institutional assignments. </em>Consistent with the provisions of the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice <em>(N.J.S. </em>2C:ll-3, 2C:14-6, 2C:43-6, 2C:43-7), commutation and work credits shall not in any way reduce any judicial or statutory mandatory minimum term and such credits accrued shall only be awarded subsequent to the expiration of the term. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.51b (Emphasis supplied) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-12\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-123.51b, therefore, requires that an individual sentenced to life imprisonment be eligible for parole after having served a \u201cstatutory mandatory minimum term, or 25 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>years where no mandatory minimum term has been imposed.\u201d It further requires that when an inmate sentenced to a term of years \u201cis eligible for parole on a date later than the date upon which he would be eligible if a life sentence had been imposed ... [he] shall be eligible for parole after having served 25 years.\u201d Consequently, where a life sentence is imposed, the Parole Act of 1979 limits the maximum period of parole ineligibility to 25 years. Accordingly, under the circumstances of this case, although the trial court could properly sentence defendant to an extended term of 70 years, it could not impose a term of parole ineligibility in excess of 25 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Therefore, except to modify defendant\u2019s sentence to reduce the parole ineligibility term of his murder sentence to 25 years, the judgment of conviction and the order of commitment under review are affirmed. The matter is remanded to the trial court for the entry of an amendatory judgment consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-10\"> N.J.S.A. 2C:11-3b was amended by <em>L. </em>1982, <em>c. </em>111, \u00a7 1, effective August 6, 1982 to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-11\">Murder is a crime of the first degree but a person convicted of murder may be sentenced, except as provided in subsection c. of this section, by the court to a term of 30 years, during which the person shall not be eligible for parole or to a specific term of years which shall be between 30 years and life imprisonment of which the person shall serve 30 years before being eligible for parole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">Consequently, since August 6, 1982, a person convicted of murder who Has not been sentenced to death must serve 30 years before becoming eligible for parole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b152-13\"><em> N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7a(l) was deleted by <em>L. </em>1982, c. 111, \u00a7 2, effective August 6, 1982.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
