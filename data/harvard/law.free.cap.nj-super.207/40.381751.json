(temporarily assigned).</author>\n<p id=\"b69-14\">Defendant entered a guilty plea to a single count accusation charging that \u201cin about 1967 and continuing from that time until about January, 1983\u201d he committed \u201cthe crime of Aggravated Sexual Assault upon John Hamm, Steven Hamm and Peter Hamm, his minor children, contrary to the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(l), (2)(a)(c),\u201d a first degree crime. While the transcript of the plea has not been reproduced for this appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>there is no contest concerning the factual basis for the sexual abuse charge involving conduct for a period of more than 15 years. The presentence report contains a statement from defendant\u2019s oldest son John and excerpts of statements from his sons Steven and Peter; and defendant \u201cadmitted his guilt\u201d to the probation officer. The statements reflect oral and anal \u201cpenetration,\u201d <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-lc.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The accusation, of course, involves preCode offenses, as the Code of Criminal Justice did not take effect until September 1, 1979, and offenses occurring before that date are generally governed by preCode law. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-lb, c; 2C:98-4. While knowledge of relevant dates and ages of each \u201cvictim\u201d is necessary to establish the elements for commission of a first degree crime under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(l) and (2), we are satisfied that the facts admitted by defendant show a first degree crime occurring since the effective date of the Code and after the presumption of imprisonment was refined in 1981. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-ld. <em>See also, State v. Hodge, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>369, 374 (1984). This is not contested and need not be further developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Despite a recommendation that defendant be placed on probation with psychological counselling as a sex offender, the trial judge sentenced defendant to the presumptive 15 year sentence to be served at the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center at Avenel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">On this appeal defendant argues that the court abused its discretion by refusing to accept the recommendation of the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center to place defendant on probation. He relies upon <em>State v. Tucker, </em>169 <em>N.J.Super. </em>334, 337 (App.Div.1979), where the court stated that \u201cAlthough a sentencing judge may depart from the recommendation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>report <em>(State v. Tissot, </em>152 <em>N.J.Super. </em>42 (App.Div.1977); <em>State v. Mickschutz, </em>101 <em>N.J.Super. </em>315 (App.Div.1968)), ordinarily \u2018departure should be rare and then only for cogent reasons.\u2019 <em>Tissot, supra </em>at 44.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">PreCode case law made clear that the trial judge could reject the diagnostic center recommendation for a probationary term as a sex offender. <em>See State v. Mickschutz, </em>101 <em>N.J.Super. </em>315 (App.Div.1968). <em>See also State v. Tissot, </em>152 <em>N.J.Super. </em>42 (App.Div.1977). Even though <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-3c provides that in lieu of incarceration the court may, upon recommendation of the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center, place defendant on probation with the requirement as a condition of probation that he receive out-patient psychological treatment, the court need not follow the recommendation. <em>State v. Chapman, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>582 (1984) holds that the trial judge can impose a sentence to the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections (general prison population) notwithstanding the Avenel recommendation for sex offender treatment, and that the trial court can impose a parole ineligibility term, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6b, on a sentence to Avenel as well as to the custody of the Commissioner. <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-6; 2C:43-6c, -7b, c; 2C:47-3b, c. Given the <em>Chapman </em>analysis of legislative intent with respect to sex offenders, <em>see </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>at 591-593, we have no hesitation in concluding that the sentencing judge did not commit error in imposing the custodial treatment under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-4a. This is particularly true given the special resentencing and parole considerations available if defendant participates and responds to treatment, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-4c, -5, and the ability of the Commissioner to transfer defendant to general population if he does not participate or respond. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-4b. <em>See also State v. Chapman, supra, </em>at 590-594, noting that an ineligibility term mandated by statute cannot be relaxed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Moreover, since the Legislature refined the \u201cpresumption of imprisonment\u201d for the first and second degree offenses including the sex offenses governed by Chapter 47, after the effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>date of the Code, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-ld; <em>State v. Hodge, supra </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>at 373-374 (1984), we conclude that the Avenel recommendation must always be considered in light of the \u201cpresumption.\u201d <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-3a, b; 2C:44-lf(l); 2C:47-4a; <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334 (1984); <em>State v. Whidby, </em>204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>312 (App.Div.1985); <em>compare State v. Jones, </em>197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>604 (App.Div.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">As stated in <em>State v. Roth, supra </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>at 358:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">The presumption of imprisonment in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-l(d) differs from a mandatory sentence. <em>See State v. Des Marets, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>62 (1983). Although it did not recommend a general presumption, the New Jersey Criminal Law Revision Commission described such a presumption as leaving \u2018a residuum of power in the sentencing court not to imprison in those few cases where it would be entirely inappropriate to do so.\u2019 Code Commentary, <em>supra, </em>at 326. What the Legislature had in mind was that a finding of guilt \u2018would predictably incur a particular sentence unless specific mitigating or aggravating factors are established.\u2019 Fair and Certain Punishment, <em>supra, </em>at 20. Judges would be left with \u2018some degree of guided discretion\u2019 to deal with the particular crime and criminal.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 19.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">The residuum of power is to be exercised only under the narrow exception of the statute, that is, when \u2018having regard to the character and condition of the defendant, [the court] is of the opinion that his imprisonment would be a serious injustice which overrides the need to deter such conduct by others.\u2019 2C:44 \u2014 1(d). This standard is met only in \u2018truly extraordinary and unanticipated circumstances,\u2019 Fair and Certain Punishment, <em>supra, </em>at 21, the exceptional case, that case where it can be said in Chief Justice Hughes\u2019 words, that \u2018the human cost of such deterrence in this instance is too great.\u2019 <em>State v. Harris, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>586, 596 (1976) (restitution as condition of probation vacated for struggling mother of five).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-9\">$$$$$$$$</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-10\">Absent a proper determination of \u2018serious injustice\u2019 considering the character and condition of the defendant, the trial court must impose a custodial sentence. <em>State v. Gerstofer, </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>542 (App.Div.1983) <em>(per curiam).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">As Justice O\u2019Hern further stated in <em>Roth, </em>at 368, concerning another aggravated sexual assault:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-12\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2(a)(4) makes a sexual crime with use of a weapon a crime of the first degree, the highest degree of crime, with the exception of murder, in the Code. Only when a court \u2018having regard to the character and condition of the defendant\u2019 believes that incarceration would be a \u2018serious injustice which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>overrides the need to deter such conduct by others,\u2019 can a sentence of imprisonment be withheld. 2C:44-l(d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-6\"> We believe that a Diagnostic and Treatment Center recommendation for \u201cprobation\u201d with \u201coutpatient psychological treatment,\u201d <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-3c, for a sex offender convicted of a first or second degree crime must now be reviewed and considered in light of the \u201cpresumption of imprisonment\u201d embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-ld. We further believe that the \u201cpresumption of imprisonment\u201d is an additional factor warranting custodial treatment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-15\"> The transcript should have been produced. <em>R. </em>2:5-3. However, there is not the slightest suggestion of the absence of a factual basis from defendant himself. <em>See R. </em>3:9-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b70-9\"> The court expressed lengthy reasons for the sentence at the time of sentencing, <em>R. </em>3:21-4(e), and appended same to the judgment, <em>R. </em>3:21-5. A motion for change of sentence was subsequently denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AqP\"><em> Roth </em>did not evidence repetitive, compulsive behavior <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-3a) falling within the purview of the sex offender provisions. <em>See </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>at 340. <em>See also State v. Hodge </em>involving an aggravated sexual assault occurring prior to the amendment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-ld in 1981, and note that a sentence for a person found to be a sex offender is nevertheless to be \"set ... in accordance with Chapters 43 and 44\" of the Code. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-3b.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
