He was sentenced to a ten-year state prison term with a three and one-half-year parole disqualifier.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">On this appeal he raises three issues: (1) his confession was the fruit of an illegal arrest and inadmissible, (2) his confession was involuntary and should have been suppressed, and (3) his sentence was manifestly excessive. We find issues (1) and (3) to be clearly without merit and affirm. <em>R. </em>2:11\u2014 3(e)(2). On issue (2) we affirm for the reasons stated in Judge Menza\u2019s published Law Division opinion appearing at 188 <em>N.J. Super. </em>127 (Law Div.1983).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
