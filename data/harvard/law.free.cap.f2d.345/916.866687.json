The district court remanded the proceeding to the state court. Ruby appealed the remand order and filed a motion for a stay of the sanity hearing pending determination of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-18\">On the record before us and on the showing made to this Court, it appears that the sanity hearing is either an integral part of Ruby\u2019s appeal now pending in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals or is so closely related to it as to be under the supervision of that court. In the circumstances, we decline to issue an order staying the sanity hearing. This ruling is not to be considered as deciding or even touching upon the question of Ruby\u2019s right to remove under Section 1443 or any of the other issues in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-19\">The motion is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
