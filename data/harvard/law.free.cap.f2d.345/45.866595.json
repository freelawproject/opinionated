BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b123-25\">If not a new wrinkle, Mike Hooks, Inc. v. Pena, 5 Cir., 1963, 313 F.2d 696, this case presents at least a new ripple on the undulating sea of law dealing with maritime rights growing out of the application of state workmen\u2019s compensation statutes to a worker sustaining a maritime injury. The precise question is whether a compensation insurer, as a Louisiana statutory subrogee, seeking reimbursement from a vessel and its owner as tortious third parties may maintain a libel filed after the expiration of the state prescriptive period in which suit could be filed by the injured employee. The District Court, on motion for summary judgment holding in the negative, dismissed the libel. We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-26\">The facts for our purposes, neither complex nor conflicting, are simple.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-27\">The Insurer<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> *was the Louisiana Workman\u2019s Compensation insurer of the Employer<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for whom the Employee<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was working as a floorman on a drilling rig <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>located in Louisiana maritime waters. The injury occurred on April 4, 1961, when the crewboat MR. KIM hit a stump while navigating in broad daylight the calm waters of Grand Lake some 2,000 feet from a boat landing. The vessel was engaged in transporting Powell and fellow drilling rig crew members. Powell\u2019s injuries were apparently severe. Although the <em>libel</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>was not filed until May 20, 1963 \u2014 about ten months after the Louisiana one-year prescriptive period<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014the vessel owner through authorized representatives within a very short time of the incident knew of the occurrence and the Insurer\u2019s claim for reimbursement of compensation benefits paid and payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Not later than January 11, 1962 \u2014 just four months after the incident \u2014 the Insurer made formal letter demand on the vessel owner asserting that \u201cthe accident was the direct result of a negligent operation of Guidry\u2019s crewboat \u2018Mr. Kim\u2019 \u201d. To this demand the present proctors, representing \u201cthe P &amp; I underwriters on the C/B MR. KIM\u201d, on January 22 made a safe, if somewhat ambiguous, but perhaps nevertheless traditional response. It first expressed the \u201cwish to deny any liability on behalf of the vessel MR. KIM and/or her owner.\u201d But then with wisdom born of long experience plus whatever comfort or protection could be generated by the ubiquitous escape hatch \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d counsel stated \u201cwe are prepared to discuss this matter with you.\u201d The letter then requested \u201ccopies of the medicals in connection with Roy F. Powell\u2019s injury and any statements that you might have.\u201d The letter obviously was not a peremptory rejection. It contemplated further negotiation for it concluded, \u201cafter reviewing these documents, the merits of the case can be discussed * * *\u201d always, of course, \u201cwithout prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">And, of course, the negotiations continued. On February 23,1962, the Insurer advised the vessel owner\u2019s counsel that final settlement discussions could not then be held since it did not know what its total expenditures would be. At the same time, the Insurer furnished counsel with copies of all medical reports. The transmittal letter reiterated that the Insurer \u201cwill continue to look to Mr. Guidry\u2019s insurance carrier for reimbursement of our expenditures in this case, at such time as we know the exact amounts of\u201d them. On the first anniversary date of the accident, weekly compensation benefits were still being paid. The Insurer kept the vessel owner\u2019s counsel advised \u201cas to medical developments and as to when it would be possible to terminate compensation benefits.\u201d The lines of communications were open at both ends for during the year prior to the anniversary date, the Insurer received \u201cno less than three\u201d letters from the P &amp; I Carrier\u2019s lawyer concerning the claim. Compensation benefits were paid from August 4, 1961 through February 22,1963. Thereafter, on July 8,1963, the Insurer paid a further substantial lump sum pursuant to a compromise judgment of the Louisiana State Court under the Compensation Act. LSA-R.S. \u00a7 23:-1272.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">On this showing, we think the District Court could not properly grant summary judgment. This is so whether based on an Erie [Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188] view of controlling Louisiana law or here the more surefooted view of maritime law.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">On either approach, we accept, as we earlier have, American Universal Ins. Co. v. Chauvin, 5 Cir., 1964, 329 F.2d 174, the proposition so vigorously assert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>ed that a Louisiana compensation insurer's right of recoupment is statutory subrogation dependent entirely upon the rights granted in \u00a7 23:1101-1103.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We do not, therefore, explore the Insurer\u2019s right, independent of \u00a7 23:1101, to press the claim in its own name as real party at interest as frequently and traditionally allowed in the admiralty.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">But to accept this proposition which ties the Insurer to the Employee\u2019s rights is not at all the end of it. Under the yet undenied allegations of the libel,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Employee had a whole arsenal of rights \u2014 state, federal, maritime and mixed. Under the quaint codal language of Art. 2315 <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the Employee clearly has state rights which, independent of the state watercraft statutes,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> would be enforceable in the Federal Court on either the civil action or admiralty side, Southport Transit Co. v. Avondale Marine Ways, 5 Cir., 1956, 234 F.2d 947; W. E. Hedger Transp. Corp. v. United Fruit Co., 2 Cir., 1952, 198 F.2d 376, at least insofar as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>they do not reduce maritime rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> His Federal rights were abundant. As a passenger for compensation, the Employee was the direct beneficiary of substantive rights arising from long recognized, exacting duties imposed by the federal maritime law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Linseed King (Spencer Kellogg &amp; Sons v. Hicks), 1932, 285 U.S. 502, 52 S.Ct. 450, 76 L. Ed. 903. And the injuries having occurred on navigable waters, the Employee had an unquestioned claim under the \u201csettled principle of maritime law that a shipowner owes the duty of exercising reasonable care toward those lawfully aboard the vessel who are not members of the crew.\u201d Kermarec v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 1959, 358 U.S. 625, 79 S.Ct. 406, 3 L.Ed.2d 550. And for none of these rights did the Employee have to make himself out a Sieracki-Yaka<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> seaman since unseaworthiness is not, certainly at this stage, needed to make out a case of liability. Nor is it needed if, as later discussed, the doctrine of laches does not bar the claim even though tardily filed. Cf. Flowers v. Savannah Machine &amp; Foundry Co., 5 Cir., 1962, 310 F.2d 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">To all of this, the vessel owner has an Erie reply. The contention is that by the reasoning of Marquette Casualty Co. v. Brown, 1958, 235 La. 245, 103 So.2d 269, \u00a7\u00a7 1101-1103 (note 6, supra) incorporate \u00a7\u00a7 3536-3537 (note 5, supra) to effectually restrict the Insurer\u2019s statutory subrogation to the prescriptive period of one year. But neither for Erie nor for maritime purposes do we read the case that way. True, the Louisiana Supreme Court, expressly rejecting several of its earlier decisions, emphasized that there is \u201cbut one cause of action against the tortfeasor for the injuries sustained by the employee\u201d so that prescription starts to run with the employee\u2019s injury, not the time the insurer is \u201churt.\u201d But it did not undertake to hold that if, as to some compensable injury sustained by some employee, the prescriptive period was longer or was not a mandatory bar\u2014 e. g., an extraterritorial injury in Texas, laches, etc., there would be no enforceable statutory subrogation beyond one year. And, on this approach, if reading the-Compensation Act and the Prescription Statutes together does not serve to extinguish the Employee\u2019s claim, certainly the right would not be extinguished on the prescription statute alone. For we have held that Art. 3536 is a procedural restraint which bars the remedy, but does not extinguish the right. Page v. Cameron Iron Works, Inc., 5 Cir., 1958, 259 F. 2d 420, 422. It is also good Louisiana law, so we have held in an opinion written for the Court by J udge Wisdom that the codal \u201c[A]rticle expresses the general rule, supported by ample Louisiana authority, that prescription is procedural and the law of the forum governs.\u201d Kozan v. Comstock, 5 Cir., 1959, 270 F.2d 839, 841, 80 A.L.R.2d 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">That being so, the forum here is the Federal District Court in which the equitable doctrine of laches, not prescription, is controlling as to a maritime claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">The inquiry on laches partakes of two parts \u2014 (1) the excuse for the delay and (2) prejudice to the pursued. As J udge Friendly\u2019s opinion in Larios v. Victory Carriers, Inc., 2 Cir., 1963, 316 F.2d 63, carefully develops, the emphasis is more and more on (2) \u2014 prejudice\u2014 than on (1). \u201cA weak excuse may suffice if there has been no prejudice; an exceedingly good one might still do even where there has been some.\u201d 316 F.2d 63, 67. The delay aspect is extremely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>relative. For \u201c * * * saying that a plaintiff who has fully cleared each of two hurdles will win is not the same as saying that a plaintiff must fully clear each of two hurdles to win.\u201d 316 F.2d 63, 67. And we have recently both phrased the^ principle in positive terms and have applied it in a most revealing way. \u201cA suit in admiralty,\u201d Judge Hutcheson wrote for this Court, \u201cis barred by laches only when there has been both [1] unreasonable delay in the filing of the libel and [2] consequent prejudice to the party against whom suit is brought.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Akers v. State Marine Lines, Inc., 5 Cir., 1965, 344 F.2d 217 [April 13, 1965]. Upon considering the record we held that the District Court was correct in concluding that there was no acceptable excuse for the late filing. But the inquiry did not end there. Rather, we declared, \u201cIf it can be shown that respondents have suffered no prejudice from the delay, then the unexcused delay alone is not sufficient to cause the libel to be dismissed.\u201d 344 F.2d 217 at 220. On examination of the sketchy record the Court then concluded that the showing of no prejudice was sufficient to make a summary judgment of dismissal improper and remanded the case for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">We need spend little time, therefore, on the excuse for the delay \u2014 a delay of not more than ten months at most. The excuse, whether legally acceptable or conclusive, was a good one in fact. The Insurer, keeping its adversary posted on current medical reports, expressed its inability to talk final settlement until the amount or duration of its compensation payments to the Employee became known. Of course, it could have filed a libel for amounts thus far paid. But had the case been shortly thereafter tried, there would be at least doubt whether the Court could either award a money decree of reimbursement or a declaration of liability for future, but yet unknown, payments.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Actually, of course, little but the filing of the libel would have occurred. Our administrative duties teach us that in the Eastern District of Louisiana \u2014 the nation\u2019s busiest, most heavily laden District Court \u2014 a trial in ten months would have been a miracle.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">But even assuming that what made horse sense did not legally excuse the delay, this inquiry reveals that so far as yet appears, nothing was lost by the modest delay. The filing of the libel on or before August 4, 1962, would have revealed nothing not then known- \u2014 -the fact of the occurrence and the Insurer\u2019s demand for reimbursement from the allegedly negligent vessel and owner. Pure Oil Co. v. Snipes, 5 Cir., 1961, 293 F.2d 60. On the uncontroverted responsive showing by the Insurer,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> this was no stale, unknown claim striking the vessel owner out of the blue. Rather, it was a fresh claim which the owner and his underwriters regarded seriously enough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>to place in the hands of highly skilled, energetic specialists whose awareness of the facts of this sometimes weird \u201cthird party\u201d life was revealed by their immediate request for medical reports and witness statements as a prelude to discussions of the claim which took place thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Of course, the vessel owner may have thought \u2014 or at least hoped \u2014 that failure to file within the analogous one-year period would put an end to the claim without regard to its merits. But attractive as that statute of limitation concept is for one pursued, the gentle \u201cwand of equity,\u201d United States v. Maryland Cas. Co., 5 Cir., 1956, 235 F.2d 50, 53, is hardly that gentle. To the contrary, we have recently and many times emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">\u201cLaches is much more than time. It is time plus prejudicial harm, and the harm is not merely that one loses what he otherwise would have kept, but that delay has subjected him to a disadvantage in asserting and establishing his claimed right or defense.\u201d Point Landing, Inc. v. Alabama Dry Dock &amp; Shipbuilding Co., 5 Cir., 1958, 261 F.2d 861, 865.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">On this record there was neither proof nor finding of prejudice. To the contrary, the facts, such as they were, demonstrated no actual prejudice. The Trial Court, therefore, erred in dismissing the libel for laches. Consequently, the cause must be remanded for further consistent proceedings and for trial on the merits unless the contention of prejudice is factually borne out by evidence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">JONES, Circuit Judge, concurs in the .result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-28\">.

At this point the vessel owner\u2019s stress on the restrictive statutory nature of the subrogation right recognized in American Universal Ins. Co. v.

Prejudice is, or certainly may be, inexorably bound up with the underlying merits of the ease. In passing upon the vessel owner\u2019s factual support for its claim of prejudice, the Court might be dealing with the very same testimony relevant to liability. A trial Court does not have to pursue any such wasteful two-step process. It may hear both together. This case, with its abortive dismissal, appeal and reversal, proves again the wisdom of the procedure approved in Vega v. The Malula, 5 Cir., 1961, 291 F. 2d 415, 416, which assures a factual, evidential determination of laches which contemporary decisions demonstrate may now seldom be resolved on conclusory papers by mere presumptions, see Czaplicki v.
