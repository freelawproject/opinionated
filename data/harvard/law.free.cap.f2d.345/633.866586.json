On November 22, 1961 the Corporation applied to the Tax Exemption Board for tax exemptions and subsidies under the Act of July 5, 1957, No. 224, V.I.Sess.L. 1957, p. 146. The pertinent provisions of the Act are contained in section 5, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-12\">\u201cEach person, firm or corporation engaged in the business of constructing or operating apartment houses, housing projects, industrial or commercial buildings, within the Virgin Islands, shall be eligible for the tax or fee exemptions and the subsidies provided for in section 6 of this Act; Provided there is a demonstrable capital investment of at least One Hundred Thousand ($100,-000.00) Dollars; provided further that application for such subsidies and exemptions shall be made not later than December 31, 1960; and it is further provided, that no subsidies or exemptions shall be granted to any person for the construction of any home or dwelling to be occupied by himself or his family.\u201d 33 V.I.C. (1958 Supp.) \u00a7 4052.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-15\">By the Act of May 11, 1960, No. 551, V.I.Sess.L.1960, p. 57, the time limit on making applications under section 5 was extended from December 31, 1960 to December 31, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-16\">Section 6 of the Act of 1957, 33 V.I.C. (1958 Supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 4053-4056, provided for specific tax exemptions and subsidies to those qualifying under section 5 to continue for a period of 10 years. Section 9, 33 V.I.C. (1958 Supp.) \u00a7 4109, provided that the Act should be administered by the Board of Tax Review which for this purpose should constitute the Tax Exemption Board to which applications for tax exemptions and subsidies should be made. The Board was authorized to conduct hearings, make findings and recommend to the Governor the approval or disapproval of applications. Section 10, 33 V.I.C. (1958 Supp.) \u00a7 4110, authorized the Governor to grant tax exemptions and subsidies in the name of the Government of the Virgin Islands upon the recommendations of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-17\">The application of the Corporation to the Board stated the type of its business to be \u201cCommercial buildings and apartments\u201d, and the amount of demonstrable capital then invested to be \u201c$110,000.00 (as of June 30, 1961)\u201d. The land was described as waterfront property held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>on a 30 year leasehold and the buildings thereon were described as \u201c7 stores (retail); 1 restaurant; 8 apartments\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">On December 18, 1961 the Board held a hearing at which counsel for the Corporation appeared. On December 29, 1961 the Board held an executive session at which it voted to recommend to the Governor the denial of the application. Under date of February 2, 1962, the chairman of the Board transmitted to the Governor a communication from which we quote the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">\u201cReference is made to application filed by King Christian Enterprises, Inc., on November 22, 1961, for Tax Exemption and Subsidies for \u2018Commercial Buildings and Apartments\u2019 with indication of $110,000 capital invested, as of June 30, 1961. * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">\u25a0X\u00bb # # #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-7\">\u201cA Public Hearing was held * * on December 18, 1961 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuC3\">\u201cSubsequently, on December 29, 1961, the Board, in Executive Session, after lengthy discussion concluded that, \u2018King Christian Enterprises, Inc., does not seem to be engaged in the business of constructing or operating industrial or commercial buildings within the meaning of Section 4052 of our Tax Exemption Law\u2019. (See Excerpts of Minutes of December 29, 1961)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afn\">\u201cFollowing this discussion it was regularly moved, duly seconded and unanimously voted that the application of King Christian Enterprises, Inc., be denied, and recommendation made to the Governor for disapproval thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Thereafter the Governor, in a letter dated February 5, 1962, informed counsel for the Corporation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAY\">\u201cReference is made to application filed by you, on behalf of the above-named corporation on November 22, 1961, for Tax Exemption and/or Subsidies under our Industrial Incentive Program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-12\">\u201cThe Virgin Islands Board of Tax Review (Tax Exemption Board) has carefully considered this application and has recommended disapproval of same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-13\">\u201cThe Board holds that \u2018King Christian Enterprises, does not seem to be engaged in the business of constructing or operating industrial or commercial buildings within the meaning of Section 4052 of our Tax Exemption Law\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-14\">\u201cYou are therefore advised that I concur with the findings of the Board, and that the application of King Christian Enterprises for Tax Exemption and Subsidies is disapproved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-15\">In March 1962 the Corporation filed in the district court the present petition \u201cto review the determination and findings of the Virgin Islands Board of Tax Review (Tax Exemption Board)\u201d for an order directing the Government \u201cto grant tax exemption and industrial subsidy\u201d to it and for other appropriate relief. While the petition stated it was filed under section 9(b) of the Act of 1957<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that section did not confer jurisdiction upon the district court but merely limited its exercise. The court did, however, have jurisdiction of the petition for review under 5 V.I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1421 et seq., as a petition for a writ of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-16\">The minutes of the. Board disclose that at its executive session on December 29, 1961 the following took plaee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-17\">\u201cMr. Ambrose stated that Mr. Hilty [the sole stockholder of King Christian Enterprises, Inc.] has renovated and/or constructed eight apartments on the second floor of this property and renovated and/or constructed some seven retail and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>gift shops, and one restaurant on the street level. The application indicated that about $110,000 has so far been invested in the eight apartments and eight stores. <em>It was pointed out therefore, that Mr. Hilty does not have $100,000 invested in apartment houses or industrial or commercial buildings alone.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-3\">The petition for review was heard by the district court in December 1963. At the hearing the Corporation contended that it was qualified for the exemptions and subsidies it sought on the basis of the total amount of its investment. Its accountant testified that as of December 18, 1961, the date of the hearing before the Board, the total amount of the Corporation\u2019s investment was $104,000, but that this figure could not be broken down as to the separate amounts invested in the apartments and in the retail stores and restaurant. The Government contended that to qualify under section 5 of the Act an applicant must have invested at least $100,000 in apartment houses alone, in housing projects alone, in industrial buildings alone or in commercial buildings alone, and that the investments of an applicant in two or more of these types of enterprise could not be combined to make up the investment of $100,000 required by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Regarding the Corporation\u2019s total enterprise as a \u201cwaterfront apartment and shopping center\u201d which is \u201ccommercial in nature\u201d the district court rejected the Government\u2019s contention. Holding that the Corporation\u2019s investment in the enterprise on November 22, 1961 was in excess of $100,000 the court concluded that the Corporation qualified as a beneficiary of the industrial incentive program under the Act of 1957, and that the Board\u2019s recommendation and the Governor\u2019s decision denying its application were contrary to the Act and, therefore, arbitrary. On the basis of these conclusions the Court entered a judgment directing the Government to take the necessary administrative steps to carry out the court\u2019s decision. From this judgment the present appeal was taken by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The Government contends at the outset that the district court exceeded its power when, in effect, it directed the Governor to grant the Corporation\u2019s application. We are wholly in accord with the Government\u2019s position in this regard. It is quite clear that the Legislature intended to confer upon the Governor, and the Board as his advisor, wide discretionary power to carry out the legislative intent to benefit the economy of the Territory by extending the benefits of the tax exemption and subsidy program to appropriate individuals and corporations. This intent is highlighted by the provisions of section 9(b) of the Act of 1957, V.I.Sess.L.1957, p. 154, 33 V.I.C. (1958 Supp.) \u00a7 4109(b), that decisions of the Board as to questions of fact shall be final and not judicially reviewable except when arbitrary or fraudulent action is conclusively shown. And it is expressly indicated by section 4041 of 33 V.I.C., which was enacted by the Act of November 3,1961, No. 798, V.I.Sess.L. 1961, p. 253, and which was in force when the Governor acted in this case. For that section limits the benefits of the program to those whose \u201cindustrial or business activity, in the judgment of the Governor of the Virgin Islands will promote the public interest by economic development of the Virgin Islands, and which requires for its establishment or expansion the granting of the tax exemption and subsidy benefits provided for\u201d by the Act. And sec. 4113 of title 33, V.I.C., also added by the Act of 1961, provides that the \u201cfindings, decisions or determinations by the Governor as to questions of fact shall be deemed final [on judicial review] in the absence of conclusive showing to the Court of fraud or misrepresentation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">The language of Chief Judge Magruder, speaking for the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Everlasting Development Corp. v. Sol Luis Descartes, 1951, 192 F.2d 1, a case arising under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>the Industrial Incentive Act of Puerto Rico, is equally applicable to the case before us. He said (p. 6):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-4\">\u201c * * * Whether tax exemption is to be accorded to a particular applicant is not merely a question of law to be determined by a reading of and interpretation of statutory language. It involves, moreover, the weighing of complex economic factors, a forecast or prophecy of the extent to which an over-all gain in the Puerto Rican economy, in the direction of the statutory objectives, is to be anticipated from the launching of a proposed new industrial unit with the advantage of tax exemption. In the broad sense, the exercise of such a judgment is political in nature rather than judicial. It is a judgment which Act No. 184 clearly confided, not to the courts, but to the administrative determination of the Executive Council and, ultimately, to the executive determination of the Governor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-5\"> We conclude that the district court exceeded its power when it ordered the Government to grant to the Corporation the tax exemption and subsidy benefits which the Governor had denied it. But all this is not to say that the court was without power to review the action of the Board and the Governor in order to determine whether any error of law infected their proceedings or decision and to set aside the Governor\u2019s decision if such error was found and remand the case for further proceedings in accordance with the applicable rules of law properly applied. \u00a7\u00a7 1421 et seq. of title 5 V.I.C. give the court this power. We turn then to consider the question whether the Board and the Governor did erroneously apply the law in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The Corporation urges that the Board and the Governor erred in construing section 5 of the Act of 1957 as requiring the Corporation to show that it had invested $100,000 in apartment houses alone or in commercial buildings alone and, when it did not make such a Showing, in concluding that it did not seem to be engaged in the business of constructing or operating industrial or commercial buildings within the meaning of the Act. The district court apparently held that the Corporation\u2019s apartment and shopping center was a single commercial enterprise as to which its showing of investment was sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">It will be observed that section 5 of the Act of 1957, which we have quoted in full above, is applicable to persons, firms or corporations \u201cengaged in the business of constructing or operating apartment houses, housing projects, industrial or commercial buildings.\u201d Four different types of enterprise are listed in the disjunctive. An applicant may be eligible if he is engaged in the business of constructing or operating apartment houses, or if he is engaged in the business of constructing or operating housing projects, or if he is in the business of constructing or operating industrial buildings, or if he is in the business of constructing or operating commercial buildings. The section goes on to say that such an applicant shall be eligible \u201cProvided there is a demonstrable capital investment of at least One Hundred Thousand ($100,000.00) Dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">It is a well settled rule that statutory exemptions from taxation, being a matter of grace, are to be strictly and narrowly construed. Texaco Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Descartes, 1 Cir. 1962, 304 F.2d 184, cert. den. 372 U.S. 907, 83 S.Ct. 720, 9 L.Ed.2d 717; Lutkins v. United States, Ct.Cl.1963, 312 F.2d 803, cert. den. 375 U.S. 825, 84 S.Ct. 65, 11 L.Ed.2d 57. Applying this rule we are satisfied that section 5 of the Act of 1957 must be construed to require the showing of an investment of $100,000 with respect to any one of the four types of enterprise described in the section and that an applicant\u2019s investment in two or more of these types of enterprise may not be cumulated to make up the investment of $100,000 required by the statute. We hold, therefore, that the Board and the Governor did not err in so construing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>section 5 of the Act of 1957 and in holding that the Corporation was not engaged in the business of constructing or operating industrial or commercial buildings within the coverage of that section. And, we may add, a similar conclusion with respect to the business of constructing or operating apartment houses would have been equally justified under the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The district court\u2019s finding that the Corporation\u2019s entire operation should be treated as a single enterprise because it is \u201ccommercial in nature\u201d finds no support in the statute. For the statute is not directed to the business of constructing or operating an enterprise \u201ccommercial in nature\u201d but rather to the business of constructing or operating \u201ccommercial buildings\u201d. Since these are differentiated in the statute from \u201capartment houses\u201d it is obvious that the two different types of business cannot be combined into one for tax exemptions and subsidy purposes under section 5 of the Act of 1957 merely by calling the whole an enterprise \u201ccommercial in nature\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">Our conclusion that the Board and the Governor did not commit an error of law in their construction of the statute renders it unnecessary for us to decide the more difficult question whether the provisions of the Act of November 3, 1961, No. 798, V.I.Sess.L.1961, p. 253, 33 V.I.C. (1962 Supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 4001 et seq., which made many changes in the industrial incentive program of the Virgin Islands and which superseded the Act of 1957 on January 1, 1962, became applicable to the Corporation\u2019s pending application on that date. If so, it will be observed that the Act of 1961 appears to have eliminated the construction and operation of apartment houses and the construction and operation of commercial buildings, the two enterprises in which the Corporation is engaged, from the enterprises for which exemptions and subsidies might be granted. It is true that section 3 of the Act of 1951 expressly saved tax exemptions or subsidies theretofore granted under laws existing prior to January 1, 1962, but in the case of the Corporation here no tax exemption or subsidy had been granted to it prior to that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The judgment of the district court will be reversed and the cause remanded with directions to dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-9\">. \u201c(b) Decisions of the Board, as to questions of fact, shall be deemed final in any proceedings in any court except in such eases as it shall be conclusively shown that any such decision was arrived at by arbitrary or fraudulent means.\u201d Act of July 5, 1957, No. 224, sec. 9(b), Y.I.Sess.L.1957, p. 154, 33 Y.I.C.
