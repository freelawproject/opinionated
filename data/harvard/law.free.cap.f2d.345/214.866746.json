Tiffany &amp; Co. opposes on forty-seven registrations of \u201cTiffany\u201d and/or \u201cTiffany &amp; Co.\u201d for a wide variety of household and personal articles which it makes and sells through its own outlets. All registrations antedate \u201cTiffany Tile\u201d by many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Despite the virtual identity of the marks, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board was of the opinion confusing similarity would be precluded because the goods had \u201cnothing whatever in common,\u201d and dismissed the opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">In asking us to reverse that action, Tiffany &amp; Co. urges, inter alia, that for many years Tiffany has been a famous name, symbolic of good taste and quality; that Tiffany Tile\u2019s motive<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in appropriating \u201cTiffany\u201d was to capitalize on that reputation; that the board ignored Tiffany &amp; Co.\u2019s 1920 registration for \u201cChinaware, Bric-A-Brac, Earthenware<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Porcelain;\u201d as well as the fact that applicant\u2019s tiles are ornamental, and are prominently displayed as a wall surface decoration in homes, the usual destination of the Tiffany &amp; Co.\u2019s decorative products, including its ceramics and porcelain products.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-21\">Our review of the record and exhibits leads us to a different conclusion than that of the board. There can be no doubt that Tiffany &amp; Co. has for many years enjoyed an enviable reputation for the good taste and quality of its products, and is entitled to appropriate protection in the market place. While motives for appropriating the Tiffany mark here can hardly be said decisive of confusing similarity issues, they are not to be ignored. Appellee\u2019s incorporation of a jewelled crown and its general advertising formats are hardly in harmony with its alleged reason for appropriating Tiffany for its tiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-22\">We are not here dealing with such diverse products as bulldozers and cosmetics but with products that are, in the main, decorative in nature and appeal, made from the same basic material, and normally found and used in homes. Under such circumstances, we are satisfied that the average purchaser seeing such a well known mark as \u201cTiffany\u201d on the involved goods would be likely to assume they emanated from the same source.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-23\">The decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-24\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-25\">MARTIN, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b291-11\">. <em>A </em>jewelled crown design is used to dot the \u201ci\u201d in Tiffany.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b291-12\">.
