This is a petition to review a decision of the Tax Court entered January 23, 1964, determining a deficiency in the petitioner\u2019s payment of federal estate tax in the amount of $2,-270.57.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Petitioner, Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company, is executor under the will of the decedent, Albert L. Rice, who died on September 2, 1959, survived by his wife, Martha C. Rice, and two daughters. Letters testamentary were granted to petitioner on October 28, 1959, by the Probate Court of Norfolk County, Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">By the terms of his will, which was executed December 30,1958, the decedent bequeathed and devised all his property to his wife, provided she survived him for thirty days; otherwise to his two daughters equally. On December 30, 1958, decedent also executed an amendable and revocable indenture of trust designating petitioner as trustee and transferring certain property to petitioner as trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">The trust instrument provided that the trustee should pay over to the donor during his lifetime any income of the trust and also such amount of principal as the donor might from time to time request. It further provided that at the death of the donor, if his wife should survive him, the trustee should set aside as a separate trust fund, to be known as \u201cTrust A\u201d, a sum equal to one-half the value of the donor\u2019s \u201cadjusted gross estate\u201d as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, such sum to be reduced, however, by the value as finally determined for federal estate tax purposes of all other property passing to the donor\u2019s wife under the provisions of his will or by operation of law or otherwise, and qualifying for the marital deduction. The trustee was directed to pay the entire net income from Trust A to Martha C. Rice during her lifetime, and as well to pay to her or for her benefit such amounts of principal as the trustee in its sole discretion might deem necessary or advisable for her comfort, maintenance, and support. It was provided that upon her death the trustee should pay the entire remaining principal of Trust A to or for such person or persons as Martha C. Rice might by her will direct and appoint, such power including the right in her to appoint to her own estate. It was further provided that in default of any such appointment, the remaining trust principal should be added to and consolidated with a second trust created by the same indenture and designated \u201cTrust B.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">The trust indenture provided that the balance of the trust estate, or all thereof if the donor\u2019s wife should not survive him, should be retained by the trustee as Trust B. The trustee was directed to pay to Martha C. Rice during her life the net income from Trust B and so much of the principal thereof as the trustee might from time to time deem necessary or advisable for her comfort, maintenance, and support. It was further provided that upon the death of the survivor of the donor and his wife, the beneficiaries of the income and principal of the trust were to be the children and grandchildren of the donor.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">Article Ninth of the trust instrument gave the trustee absolute discretion to pay all inheritance and estate taxes out of Trust B.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trust also provided that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>it was to be construed according to Massachusetts law. Decedent\u2019s will made no provision as to payment of taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Acting pursuant to the provisions of Article Ninth of the trust indenture, petitioner, as executor, requisitioned from itself, as trustee, from Trust B, an amount sufficient to pay the Massachusetts inheritance tax and the federal estate tax. An estate tax return was filed by petitioner with the District Director of Internal Revenue for the District of Massachusetts on December 2, 1960. Therein a marital deduction was claimed in the total amount of $145,134.15, composed of $122,223.02 representing the value of the property in Trust A, and $22,911.13 representing the value of other property included in the gross estate and passing to the widow. In computing the claimed marital deduction petitioner did not reduce the value of any of these properties by any portion of the Massachusetts inheritance tax or the federal estate tax paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">In the notice of deficiency the Commissioner determined that in computing the marital deduction, the property interests passing to the surviving spouse under Trust A should have been reduced by the Massachusetts inheritance tax and the federal estate tax allocable to those property interests, in the amount of $6,680.07.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The only question raised by this petition, then, is whether the Commissioner was correct in reducing the size of the marital deduction by $6,680.07, the portion of the federal estate tax and Massachusetts inheritance tax which, at the time of decedent's death, was allocable to those property interests in decedent\u2019s estate qualifying for the marital deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">The first part of petitioner\u2019s argument is that the trust instrument evidences an intention that decedent\u2019s widow was to receive the entire amount of Trust A tax-free; that in any event all the taxes were paid out of Trust B; and that the size of the marital deduction should therefore not be reduced by the amount of any of the taxes. Petitioner relies on sub-section 2056(b) (4) (A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> asserting that the provisions of that subsection require us to recognize petitioner\u2019s exercise of discretion as an \u201ceffect\u201d within the meaning of the statute. The trouble with petitioner\u2019s argument is that, in determining the \u201ceffect\u201d of death taxes, we must place ourselves in time squarely at the moment of the decedent\u2019s death. Treas.Reg. \u00a7 20.2056(b)-(4) (a), (c) (1) (1961). See Jackson v. United States, 376 U.S. 503, 508, 84 S.Ct. 869, 11 L.E.2d 871 (1964) (dictum); Starrett v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 223 F.2d 163 (1st Cir. 1955); Ballantine v. Tomlinson, 293 F.2d 311 (5th Cir. 1961). At that moment a proportionate amount of tax was owing and payable out of Trust A and the other property interests qualifying for the marital deduction, and that fact is conclusive. No amount of \u201cintention\u201d can alter the result, and any actual exercise of discretion is irrelevant since it comes after the decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">Petitioner is not helped, with regard to the federal estate tax, by provisions of a Massachusetts statute cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>by it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petitioner would construe that statute (specifically, \u201cexcept as otherwise provided or directed\u201d) as removing the tax liability from Trust A to Trust B by including a discretionary provision within the scope of \u201cotherwise provided.\u201d That argument, however, must assume an actual exercise of discretion since the statute certainly could have no eifect were the discretion to remain unexercised (the trustee\u2019s discretion is absolute). And in making that assumption, petitioner once again is asking us to look to future events. That we have said we cannot do.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Also, petitioner\u2019s argument based on the Massachusetts statute\u2019s definition of \u201cnet estate,\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> as not including \u201cdeductions\u201d and therefore not including any part of Trust A in the taxable estate must fail. The argument assumes the issue, already decided against petitioner, that Trust A for the purpose of the marital deduction is not to be diminished by a proportionate amount of tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Judgment will be entered vacating the decision of the Tax Court and remanding the case to that court for entry of decision in accordance herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b703-8\">. \u201cArticle Ninth: Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, on the death of the Donor, the Trustee may in its discretion pay to the Executor of his will or to the Administrator of his estate such sum or sums from Trust B as such Executor or Administrator shall in writing request for the payment of legacies, debts, expenses of administration, and of legacy, succession, inheritance and estate taxes, or other death duties, or to reimburse such Executor or Administrator for the making of any such payments or may pay any of such taxes directly to the taxing authorities involved; * * * and the determination of the Trustee as to whether to make any such payments and as to the amount of any such payment made shall be final and binding upon all persons taking any interest hereunder.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b704-7\">. It is stipulated by the parties that the Tax Court\u2019s figure, $3,331.90, was a mathematical error and that the figure of $6,680.07 is the correct one.
