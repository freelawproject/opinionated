The appellant, J. J. Fourth Sales Corp. had moved for an order directing the Trustees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>in Bankruptcy of Dilbert\u2019s Leasing &amp; Development Corp. and Dilbert\u2019s Quality Supermarkets, Inc. to pay it $3,333.34, contending that this sum was security money deposited under a lease between appellant as tenant and Dilbert\u2019s Quality Supermarkets, Inc. as lessor of premises in Huntington, New York, or, in the alternative, that the sum was an advance payment for the last month of the lease which ended August 31, 1972. The District Court held that the sum was not a security payment because it was not identifiable in the Trustee\u2019s hands, and that appellant was only a general creditor with respect to the last month\u2019s rent. There is no dispute as to the facts. They are stated in detail in Judge Abruzzo\u2019s opinion, 241 F.Supp. 672 and need not be here repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">We affirm the decision. Whether a lessee\u2019s advance payment of rent is subject to refund depends on the provisions of the lease. 3 Collier, Bankruptcy (14th ed.) \u00a7 63.33 [3], Where, as here, the lease does not provide for holding advance rent as security, the landlord is free to mingle the advance payment with his own funds. See 34 West 34th St. Corp. v. Nehama Realty Corp., 7 Misc. 2d 532, 153 N.Y.S.2d 427 (1956), and his rights are only those of a general creditor. In re Banner, 149 F. 936, S.D.N.Y. If the lessee wishes to protect himself against the landlord\u2019s possible bankruptcy, he can provide as in Atlas v. Moritz, 217 App.Div. 38, 216 N.Y.S. 490 (1926), that the prepaid rent be held in a separate fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">On the appeal the appellant has somewhat changed the position advanced in the District Court. He now concedes that as to $833.34 of the sum sought to be recovered he is a general creditor, and contends that as to $2500 there was a double payment of rent for June 1963. The contention is not meritorious. When the advance was paid to Dilbert\u2019s Quality Supermarkets, Inc. in July 1962, the sum became its property. Acceleration of the lease merely created a debtor-creditor relationship between Dilbert\u2019s Leasing &amp; Development Corp. and appellant, J. J. Fourth Sales Corp. The equities do not favor appellant as against the general creditors because the advance payment was made prior to the bankruptcy proceedings; to grant a preference where none is authorized by \u00a7 64 of the Bankruptcy Act would be unfair to the general creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
