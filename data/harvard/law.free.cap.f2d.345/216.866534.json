Its sales outlets are department stores, shoe stores, and specialty stores. The dollar volume of imported BALLY shoes since 1956 approximated $17,500,000, the average yearly volume being in excess of $2,500,000. The goods under appellant\u2019s mark are advertised in such magazines as the \u201cNew Yorker\u201d and \u201cRetailing\u201d and newspapers at an annual cost of about $40,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-27\">Both marks appear in script and the goods of the parties comprise shoes, including women\u2019s shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-28\">The parties are in agreement that the only question for determination here is, as stated by the board, whether or not LA VALLI so resembles BALLY as to be likely to cause confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-29\">Appellant points out that the portion \u201cLA\u201d of LA VALLI<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is the well known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>French and Italian definite article meaning \u201cthe.\u201d From this premise appellant argues that inasmuch as this definite article is so \u201cwell known in the clothing and fashion industry and by fashion conscious women who have become familiar with certain French and Italian expressions used extensively in this field,\u201d it cannot be given any weight in resolving the question of whether or not the marks are confusingly similar. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"> Appellant\u2019s position is untenable. We cannot dissect and set aside any portion of a mark and eliminate it from consideration in judging the matter of similarity or dissimilarity of competing marks. We must consider the marks in their entireties and endeavor to assess their impact as so used in trade and as they appear to the purchasing public.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">So viewing the marks in issue, we find no reversible error in the conclusion reached by the board that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">\u201cConsidering * * * the marks \u2018LA VALLI\u2019 and \u2018BALLY\u2019 in their entireties, it is our opinion that they do not look alike, they do not engender the same connotation or suggestion, and while there is some resemblance between these marks in sound, it is not of such nature as to be likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJT\">Affirmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">WORLEY, Chief Judge, did not sit in the hearing in this case but by agreement of counsel, participated in the decision thereof.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-17\">. No. 42,043 filed July 23,1962.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b292-18\">. Serial No. 124,259 filed July 19, 1961.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b292-30\">. Reg. No. 232,197, September 6, 1927, renewed September 6,1947.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b292-31\">. The application alleges that the English translation of LA VALLI is \u201cthe valley.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b293-9\">RICH, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ai5\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">I consider confusion at least likely, even probable. Most people would recognize \u201cLa\u201d as the feminine definite article and, I think, attach little trademark significance to it. The Italian word for valley is \u201cvalle.\u201d The French word for valley is vall\u00e9e (f) orvallon (m). \u201cValli\u201d in Italian is the plural of \u201cvalle\u201d and the plural definite article would be \u201cle.\u201d \u201cLa valli\u201d lacks meaning in English, Italian, or French. \u201cBally\u201d has not been shown to have any meaning either, other than its trademark significance as indicating the origin of shoes. We are therefore dealing with two arbitrary marks, not recognizable words of the language.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">Due to the similarity in sound and general aural impression \u2014 including the impression on the sound-memory center of the brain where names are remembered, or <em>partially </em>remembered \u2014 it seems probable to me that prospective purchasers who have heard something good about <em>Bally </em>shoes might readily be deceived by a salesperson desiring to sell la <em>Valli </em>shoes or otherwise confused into buying <em>Valli </em>shoes on a hazy recollection of the reputation of <em>Bally </em>shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">I see no justification for bolstering up the proprietary rights in a mark, by registration, which inexcusably approaches so closely to <em>Bally.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">There is no question about opposer\u2019s priority and the goods are identical. In \u201cconsidering the marks in their entire-ties\u201d it seems to me that the majority and the board must have set them side-by-side and contemplated their visual differences, forgetting that confusion is caused in many cases by the frailty of human memory, not eyesight.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">After writing the above, I discovered the board\u2019s interesting unanimous opinion in Chaussures Bally Societe Anonyme v. Fritzi of California, Inc., 144 USPQ 609, wherein the same opposer prevailed in opposing the registration of \u201cVALLI\u201d for various items of women\u2019s apparel, not including footwear. The board said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfW\">\u201cApplicant\u2019s \u2018VALLI\u2019 and opposer\u2019s \u2018BALLY\u2019 are virtually indistinguishable in sound and similarity in this factor alone is sufficient to support a finding of a likelihood of confusion * * [Cases cited.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-16\">The board felt \u201cVALLI\u201d was sufficiently different from \u201cLA VALLI\u201d not to be bound by its prior decision (this case below). Considering that here the goods are the <em>same </em>and that in the \u201cVALLI\u201d case they differed, I think the board exercised better judgment in the Fritzi case than it did here.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-17\">I would reverse.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>SMITH, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"As\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The admittedly subjective nature of the consideration we must give to the marks BALLY and LA VALLI, when applied to identical goods, surrounds resolution of the issue with considerable \u25a0doubt. Visually, the marks are sufficiently different that confusion on that basis would not be likely. But there is more here than mere visual dissimilarity. The words sound alike, and both are arbitrary terms as applied to women\u2019s shoes. The mark BALLY was an established mark in this field when appellee entered the market. Under these circumstances, I would .resolve doubt against the newcomer, see Polymer Corp. v. Dayco Corp., 324 F.2d 1019, 51 CCPA 794, and Coral Chemical Co. v. H. D. T. Co. Factors, 332 F.2d 841, 51 CCPA 1413, and would reverse the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
