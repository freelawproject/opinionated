Any deed recorded in the District of Columbia is subject to a \u201crecordation\u201d tax of % of 1 percent of \u201cthe consideration for such deed.\u201d 76 STAT. 12 (1962), D.C.Code, Supp. V (1965) \u00a7 45-723. Section 45-724 provides that \u201cWhere no price or amount is paid or required to be paid * * * the consideration for the deed to such property shall, for purposes of the tax imposed by this subchapter, be construed to be the fair market value of the real property, and the tax shall be based upon such fair market value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">It appears that \u201cno price or amount\u201d was \u201cpaid or required to be paid\u201d for the deed. The recordation tax must therefore be based upon the fair market value of the property. We cannot accept the District of Columbia Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that, by giving up their equity in what the court described as the realized value\u201d of the real property, $207,-335.03, which appeared on the corporation\u2019s balance sheet as earned surplus, the stockholders paid that amount for the deed. The Tax Court\u2019s decision is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b186-14\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
