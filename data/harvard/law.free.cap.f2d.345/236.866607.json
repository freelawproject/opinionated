The claim is that the laws are unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and that they inhibit vital thought and speech in violation of the First Amendment as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Judge Henderson, finding no substantial federal question presented, refused to convene a three-judge court and dismissed the complaint (233 F.Supp. 752). Judge Henderson was correct in his general statement of the law: \u201cUnless no substantial federal question is presented, a three judge Court must be convened.\u201d Idlewild Liquor Corp. v. Epstein, 370 U.S. 713, 715, 82 S.Ct. 1294, 8 L.Ed.2d 794 (1962). It is likewise true that \u201cthe lack of substantiality in a federal question\u201d may appear from previous decisions of the Supreme Court, California Water Serv. Co. v. City of Redding, 304 U.S. 252, 255, 58 S.Ct. 865, 867, 82 L.Ed. 1323 (1938). However, we are not convinced that the issues raised here were determined in Adler v. Board of Education, 342 U.S. 485, 72 S.Ct. 380, 96 L.Ed. 517 (1952). We, therefore, reverse and remand with instructions to convene a three-judge court.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">While Adler held Section 3022 not to be unconstitutional as applied to teachers in the public schools of New York, it specifically refused to pass upon the constitutionality of section 3021 (342 U.S. at 489, 496, 72 S.Ct. 380) and certainly did not consider the application of section 3022 to university faculty members. The certificate here in question and several statutory amendments, such as Section 105(3) of the Civil Service Law, are all subsequent to Adler. Moreover, there is a significant similarity between the state laws in question here and those held unconstitutional in Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 84 S.Ct. 1316, 12 L.Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>377 (1964). Cf. also Dombrowski v. Pfister, 85 S.Ct. 1116 (April 26, 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Appellees rely heavily upon the statement in Adler that, \u201cIt is equally clear that they [public school teachers] have no right to work for the State in the school system on their own terms,\u201d 342 U.S. 492, 72 S.Ct. 384. However, the theory that public employment which may be denied altogether may be subjected to any conditions, regardless of how unreasonable, has been uniformly rejected. In less than a year after Adler the Supreme Court clearly limited its language in Adler:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">\u201cWe need not pause to consider whether an abstract right to public employment exists. It is sufficient to say that constitutional protection does extend to the public servant whose exclusion pursuant to a statute is patently arbitrary or discriminatory.\u201d Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. 183, 192, 73 S.Ct. 215, 219, 97 L.Ed. 216 (1952).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">See also, Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 84 S.Ct. 1316 (1964); Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.S. 488, 81 S.Ct. 1688, 6 L. Ed.2d 982 (1961); Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction, 368 U.S. 278, 288, 82 S.Ct. 275, 7 L.Ed.2d 285 (1961); Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U.S. 479, 81 S.Ct. 247, 5 L.Ed.2d 231 (1960); Slochower v. Board of Higher Education, 350 U.S. 551, 76 S.Ct. 637, 100 L.Ed. 692 (1956); Willcox, Invasions of the First Amendment Through Conditioned Public Spending, 41 Cornell L.Q. 12 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">In Wieman the Court \u201cnoted probable jurisdiction because of the public importance of this type of legislation and the recurring serious constitutional questions which it presents.\u201d 344 U.S. at 186, 73 S.Ct. at 216, and as late as 1964 the Court repeated the identical statement in Baggett, supra, 377 U.S. at 366, 84 S.Ct. at 1319. This case no less should not be dismissed as lacking in substance. We, therefore, reverse the judgment below and remand with instructions to the District Court to convene a three-judge district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2284.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-7\">. \u201cState Univeesity of New Yobk at Buffalo \u201cOebtificate</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">\u201cAnyone who is a member of the Communist Party or of any organization that advocates the violent overthrow of the Government of the United States or of the State of New York or any political subdivision thereof cannot be employed by the State University.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">\u201cAnyone who was previously a member of the Communist Party or of any organization that advocates the violent overthrow of the Government of the United States or of the State of New York or any political subdivision thereof is directed to confer with the President before signing this certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">H* *1* *1* \u00ab$*</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">\u201cThis is to certify that I have read the publication of the University of the State of New York, 1959, entitled \u2018Regents Rule on Subversive Activities\u2019 together with the instructions -set forth above and understand that these rules and regulations as well as the laws cited therein are part of the terms of my employment.
