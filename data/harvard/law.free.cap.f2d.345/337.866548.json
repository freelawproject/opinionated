BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b414-18\">This case presents the question whether the gain received by the Taxpayer-Optionee on the assignment back to the Employer-Optioner of the unexercised option granted as a compensatory restricted stock option is taxable as capital gain when a transfer of the underlying stock at such time would have been a disqualifying disposition subjecting the proceeds to treatment as ordinary income. In rejecting the Taxpayer\u2019s appeal, we agree with the District Court that the gain is ordinary income.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-19\">The facts are neither complex nor conflicting. And the case comes to us, as it did below, on stipulated facts which we repeat or paraphrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-20\">The Taxpayer<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was an employee of Southern,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the optionor. Southern\u2019s business was the production and sale of oil, natural gas, and gas distillates. In December 1950, Southern acquired Danciger Oil and Refining Company and substantially all of the personnel of Danciger. Danciger was a much larger company than Southern, with substantially larger reserves. It was vital to Southern that most of the former Danciger personnel remain with Southern. However, Danciger personnel had been allowed to deal in oil and gas leases and royalities outside the scope of their employment, and this practice was forbidden by Southern. In order to give the Danciger personnel a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>proprietary interest in Southern, and to induce them to remain with Southern a restricted stock option plan was made available to the former Danciger employees, as well as to Southern employees who had not participated in an earlier qualified restricted stock option plan of Southern.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">The stock option plan was approved by the stockholders of Southern on May 7, 1952. Under the plan 125,000 shares of the company\u2019s Unissued common stock were made available to employees of the company under provisions which qualified as restricted stock options under \u00a7 130A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Restricted stock options under the plan were issued on May 8, 1952 to Taxpayer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The option price was the fair market value of the common stock of Southern on that date ($532.50). None of the Taxpayers exercised his option.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">During the summer of 1956 the Board of Directors of Southern authorized negotiations with Sinclair Oil and Gas Company for the sale of its properties. The sale was made. On July 23, 1956, Southern announced the sale of its assets to Sinclair and its intention to comply with \u00a7 337 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. On August 10, 1956, a plan of complete liquidation was adopted by the Board of Directors of Southern. On October 11, 1956, at a special meeting of its stockholders, a plan of complete liquidation of Southern was approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-15\">On October 11,1956, there were options outstanding covering 98,960 shares under the restricted stock option plan.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These outstanding stock options represented a problem to Southern, in that in order to qualify for the tax treatment of gains on complete liquidation of a corporation, under \u00a7 337 all of the assets of the corporation, less assets retained to meet claims, had to be distributed within one year from the date of the adoption of the plan of liquidation. The existence of these outstanding stock options represented a potential barrier to such complete liquidation within a one-year period. For the purpose of eliminating the options and avoiding thereby possible litigation which would have prevented or delayed the orderly liquidation of Southern within the one-year period, the Board of Directors of Southern authorized the acquisition by Southern of optionees\u2019 rights under the outstanding restricted stock options at a price of $11.25 per share.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-16\">The holders of all of the outstanding options accepted this offer, and their options were sold to Southern by contracts dated October 25, 1956.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>The liquidation was consummated, the options acquired by Southern, and the agreed consideration paid by it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Thereafter the Revenue Service determined that the gain was taxable as ordinary income, not capital gains. After timely claim by each of the Taxpayers, the denial thereof, and payment of the disputed taxes, this refund suit was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The District Judge on these stipulated facts, and one possible excursion into fact finding on his own,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> held that the Commissioner\u2019s determination was correct, and that the gains received from the sale of these options should be treated as ordinary income in the years in which received.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-16\"> At the outset, it bears emphasis that had the stock been issued at this time and then sold \u2014 either to, a third party or back to the corporation \u2014 the very same gains would clearly have been ordinary income since the stock would not have been held the requisite six months to qualify as a statutory restricted stock option.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In other words, extinguishing for a consideration the option with its carefully built-in statutory restrictions would, in practical effect, enable the parties to obtain the immediate income tax benefit free of the very conditions prescribed by Congress in this area of high controversy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Of course we recognize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>that failure to satisfy the requirements of a statutory restricted stock option or the even more stringent contemporary qualified stock option<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> does not necessarily condemn gain to the unfavored, unwanted, more expensive ordinary income category. There are option plans which either by chance, neglect, accident, or choice are non-restricted. Their utility and tax incidents are the subject of extensive, sometimes hopeful, sometimes despairing writings.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But they are not for our decision now, and we readily leave these intriguing problems to another day.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>\u201cThe Board of Directors of Southern determined that the company would withhold income tax on the payments made by it to the option holders on the purchase of their restricted stock options on advice of counsel that it was not incumbent upon the company to determine the tax status of the payments made to the option holders in the hands of the recipients of such payments and that the company, to avoid possible controversy with the Internal Revenue Service, should adopt the ultra conservative approach of subjecting these payments to withholding. In its final income tax return, Southern showed the payments to the option holders for their options under the classification of other expense as \u2018Employees\u2019 Stock Option Payments\u2019, totaling $1,110,262.00. The stock option payments were not reported in such return as salary or wages. If the entire amount of such payments had been disallowed to Southern as an expense, no tax would have resulted. The final income tax return of Southern was examined by the Internal Revenue Service, and no deficiency was determined.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>\u201cTlie following quotation, usually attributed to Lincoln, best appears to sum up the policies for and against the restricted stock option provisions of the Internal Revenue Code: \u2018People who like this sort of thing will find this the sort of thing they like.\u2019 \u201d citing Schlesinger, supra note 11 at 756.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">We may do that because Taxpayer in seeking to justify capital gains treatment does not take the route of a non-restricted stock option. Rather, Taxpayer recognizes that this was in form a restricted stock option plan. The capital gains here sought are justified, not on the ground of compliance with that plan, nor as authorized effective modifications of it,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> but because the stock was never acquired, the option was never exercised, and on the contrary the option was sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-20\">Taxpayer\u2019s theory, as near as we can grasp it, runs this way. Options are property<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and come within the definition of capital asset.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Since Taxpayer was not a dealer in options and it is undisputed that these options were held for more than four years, the gain on sale qualifies for long term capital gain treatment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> And contrary to the contention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>of the Government here and below and the holding of the trial court, Commissioner v. LoBue, 1956, 351 U.S. 243, 76 S.Ct. 800, 100 L.Ed. 1142,:<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> does not prevent capital gains treatment. This case, as did those following it,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> held that it was the <em>transfer </em>of the <em>stock </em>to the employee for less than its full market value which conferred the benefit intended as compensation to the employee. Compensation, as such, must, of course, be taxed, but the compensation there involved was not in the grant of the option, but rather in the transfer of the stock pursuant to it. Upon a correct reading of such cases, the employer\u2019s intention to compensate^ was the purpose of transferring the stock. In no other way could the intention to compensate be made effective since the options themselves had no value.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Here, however \u2014 so the argument continues \u2014 no such purpose existed. The trial Court\u2019s finding that the stock options were compensation to the plaintiffs is unsupported, contradictory, and contrary to the stipulated facts. This is so because the Court also found the \u201coptions had no ascertainable market value at the time they were granted\u201d (see note 10, supra), and it was stipulated by the parties that the purpose of the purchase of the options was to enable the Employer to eliminate the options and avoid these impediments to its liquidation within the required one-year period.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Additionally, the Trial Court\u2019s finding is wholly unacceptable because if the options themselves were compensation, the initial stock option plan could not have qualified as the statutory restricted stock option which it was and was stipulated to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">And finally, so the argument runs, had Taxpayer exercised the option and acquired the stock, the stock would have been a capital asset in his hands. Under \u00a7 1234, as it then existed, capital gains would be acccorded when received from the sale of the underlying option.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\"><em>We </em>think that in emphasizing the Employer\u2019s purpose as between compensating employees, on the one hand, and avoidance of impediments to a \u00a7 337 liquidation, on the other, Taxpayer confuses the <em>time </em>for determination of that purpose and the <em>value </em>of the option at any such moment. In other words, for the intention to compensate to be fulfilled, there must be <em>value, </em>so it is the time when demonstrable value exists that likewise measures intention. But the Court in LoBue did not begin even remotely to suggest that merely because the options, with their built-in restrictions, had no \u201cascertainable market value,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the employer had no purpose to compensate the employees at the time the options were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>granted. On the contrary, in rejecting application of the normal rule that a mere \u201cpurchase of property * * * at a bargain price\u201d gives \u201crise to no taxable gain in the year of purchase,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the Court described the option plan as \u201can arrangement by which an employer transferred valuable property to his employees in recognition of their services.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> From the very outset, compensation was a significant, if not the only, purpose. It was the result of this arrangement that \u201cLoBue received a very substantial economic and financial benefit from his employer prompted by the employer\u2019s desire to get better work from him.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In declaring that \u201cWhen assets are transferred by an employer to an employee to secure better services they are plainly compensation,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the Court did not ignore the option. Indeed, it was the arrangement by which the subsequent transfer came into reality. And it was not the less an operative fact because, by reason of the contingencies, the option itself then had no value.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The result is that Taxpayer\u2019s emphasis upon the Employer\u2019s purpose offers no help. Clearly, the stipulated facts demonstrate that the Employer\u2019s dominant motive in granting the options in 1952 was almost altogether a compensatory one. It was a way to make newly absorbed Danciger employees happy despite the loss of their former outside oil trading privileges. And as to others, it equalized stock acquisition rights among former employees. Since it was the purpose to <em>compensate </em>at the time the options were granted, it matters not what the motive was for putting an end to those options. The options being compensatory in purpose, either the option or the fruits of the option must be treated as compensation and taxed accordingly unless \u2014 and the unless is a big one \u2014 there is compliance with statutory procedures which ameliorate those tax consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Application of these principles is fatal to the Taxpayer\u2019s appeal. There is, first, no doubt as a business-operative-fact that the payments made by the Employer in 1956 were the direct consequence of the existence of the option. It is further clear that the Employer looked upon these as perfectly valid obligations. The payments were in no sense an effort to compromise troublesome, doubtful claims or nuisance controversies. To the contrary, the payments represented an honest effort to give to the employee 100% of the value he would get had the stock been issued, held and then surrendered in the \u00a7 337 liquidation. In short, the money represented the net value of the stock after deducting the option price.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Of course ever since LoBue it has been unquestioned that, except for statutory alleviation, when a compensatory option has no ascertainable market value as of the time of grant, the receipt of fruits of the option when exercised, fixes the time and measures the value of the economic benefit intended to be, and now, conferred upon the employee. Thus under Commissioner v. Smith, 1945, 324 U.S. 177, 65 S.Ct. 591, 89 L.Ed. 830, and LoBue, the value of the stock received by the exercise of the option was treated as ordinary income and subject to taxation as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">And whatever the conceptual shortcomings might be to a theory which attributes to a right then having no ascertainable value the value of its fruits when and as they acquire demonstrable worth, it makes tax sense if not common sense, Steinhort v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 1964, 335 F.2d 496, and in any event it makes congressional sense since Congress gave its imprimatur to this approach in the legislation enacted to ameliorate the consequences of the Supreme Court decisions. As all know, LoBue gave operative effect to the \u201cuniform Treasury practice \u2022x- * * tQ measure the compensation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>employees given\u201d contingent \u201cstock options * * * by the difference between the option price and the market value of the shares at the time the option is exercised.\u201d 351 U.S. at 249, 76 S.Ct. at 804. True, Congress did not ordain that this would be the invariable consequence. But it did declare that if an employee to whom \u201ca share of stock is transferred * * * pursuant to his exercise\u201d of a stock option sought the preferential treatment of \u00a7 421(a) (1) which prescribes that \u201cno income shall result at the time of the transfer of such share,\u201d it is necessary that the option first qualify as a \u201crestricted stock option\u201d and the stock not be disposed of within \u201csix months after the transfer.\u201d \u00a7 421(a), (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">All of this seems doubly sure when considered in the light of \u00a7 1234, so earnestly but unsuccessfully pressed by Taxpayer. And it is not enough, as does the Taxpayer on brief, to rely on \u00a7 1234 \u201cas it then existed\u201d on October 25, 1956, nor to question the validity of the September 25, 1957 regulations.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> For the fact is that \u00a7 1234 was amended by the Technical Amendments Act of 1958 and made expressly retroactive to years prior to 1956.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-15\">Equally important, the legislative history eliminates all doubt that the attention of Congress was once again focused on this highly complex, if not controversial, question of employee stock options. The Amendments first restructured the opening subparagraph to carry out the intent of the 1954 changes that \u201cgain or loss attributable to an option to buy or sell property which would not be a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer would result in ordinary income or loss rather than capital gain or loss.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Through the nonapplieation section it then excluded the benefits of \u00a7 1234(a) in specific areas. In excluding from the benefits of \u00a7 1234(a) \u201cany income derived in connection with such privilege or option which, without regard to this section, is treated as other than gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset,\u201d (Par.(c) (2), note 25, supra) the committee reports spelled out the purpose to exclude employee compensatory stock options.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Additionally, subpar. (c)(2) is structured, not in terms of the \u201ccharacter\u201d of the property \u2014 a capital or a non-capital asset as in subpar. (a). Rather, it is expressed in terms of \u201cincome derived in connection with such * * * option which, without regard\u201d to \u00a7 1234 for purposes of taxation \u201cis treated as other than gain from the sale * * * of a capital asset.\u201d When, to the express language of the committee report spelled out in plain terms of this immediate problem (see note 27, supra), there is added the structure which speaks in terms of tax consequences, not status of property, it becomes quite plain we think that the conflict between subpar. (c) (4) and (c) (2) is more apparent than real. It is inconceivable to us that Congress would extend under (c) (4) the benefit of \u00a7 1234 to pre-1954 compensatory employee stock options having no ascertainable market value, after denying benefits to them under (c) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">As we have earlier stated, we do not rule out the possibility that prefectly valid nonrestricted stock option plans can be effected which afford to employees the much sought after benefit of capital gains.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The Regulations whose validity we do not here examine, now specifically take cognizance of nonrestricted, non-qualifying stock options and undertake to distinguish tax consequences as to options having or not having a \u201creadily ascertainable market value\u201d at the time of grant.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> But it would be making the silk purse out of the sow\u2019s ear, if not performing the alchemist\u2019s feat, Duncan v. United States, 5 Cir., 1957, 247 F.2d 845, 848, to attribute capital gain treatment to the proceeds received for the extinguishment of an option where the fruits of such option then legally obtainable, if received and translated into the same cash at that very moment, would have been treated as ordinary income. Whatever deficiencies there might be in the express terminology of the statutory mechanism for privileged stock options, we are satisfied that when these and the sections of the Code covering income and affording the preferred status of capital gain are matched together, no one could attribute to Congress any such incongruous result.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Asj\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b414-12\">.
