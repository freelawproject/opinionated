While Clayton was still on the telephone, Laiken instructed Lepore, another broker, to call out an offer of 26 contracts for May 1963 delivery at $2.54, and immediately accepted this offer. Lepore accurately understood that he was \u201cselling\u201d not for himself but for Laiken\u2019s house account; Laiken used the contracts thus \u201cbought\u201d to satisfy Clayton\u2019s order, in effect filling the order himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Laiken argues that the regulation was satisfied since Lepore made his offer \u201cby open outcry\u201d and enough time elapsed for another broker to accept. However, as the Judicial Officer found, Laiken\u2019s purchase for Clayton of Laiken\u2019s own contracts meant no one else trading on the floor was afforded an opportunity to sell to Laiken to fill Clayton\u2019s order. Whether any great harm was done or not, the Judicial Officer could find that a \u201cmethod\u201d which prevented anyone but the broker himself from filling his customer\u2019s order was not \u201copen and competitive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">The New York Mercantile Exchange, evidently acting under the proviso in the federal regulation, has established \u201cwritten rules\u201d governing transactions between a member broker and his customer or between two customers acting through the same member. The rules demand, <em>inter alia, </em>that an Exchange official witness the transaction, and, according to the Government\u2019s gloss, that a member selling to his customer allow other members a first chance to buy from him and sell to his customer at the intended price. In any event, the petitioner does not claim to have followed the procedures prescribed in these rules and we cannot relieve him from the consequences of his choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">Petition denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
