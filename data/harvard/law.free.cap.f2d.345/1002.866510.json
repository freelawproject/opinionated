Perhaps the outlines of this tax structure should be described in brief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>compass to make the facts more meaningful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">In the tax years in question, the <em>excess profits tax </em>(EPT) was computed by applying the high EPT rate to adjusted excess profits net income (AEPNI). This item in substance equalled normal tax net income (NTNI) less the excess profits credit (EPC). If EPC exceeded NTNI (either initially or after redetermination of EPC), an unused excess profits credit (UEPC) resulted. The UEPC from prior or subsequent years, carried forward or back, could also be deducted from NTNI in computing AEPNI. The <em>income tax </em>(IT) was found by applying the lower income tax rate to NTNI less. AEPNI. Thus, in simple algebraic terms:</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">EPT=EPT Rate (NTNI \u2014 EPC\u2014 UEPC)</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">IT=IT Rate (EPC+UEPC)</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-8\">All very easy so far- \u2014 comparatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-9\">Therefore, if after the respective taxes were paid, there was an increase in EPC or UEPC, there would automatically be an overpayment of EPT and a deficiency in IT. Since the EPT rate was considerably higher than the IT rate, the net result, if the originally estimated EPT and IT had been paid in full, would always be some net overpayment. The converse would be true if EPC or UEPC were subsequently reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-10\">EPC would initially be computed on the basis of an average base period net income (ABPNI) during 1936-39. However, if that figure caused inequitable adnormalities due to special circumstances during the base period, the taxpayer could, pursuant to \u00a7 722, file an application for relief under \u00a7 322. In brief, that meant that EPC could be computed on the basis of a higher constructive average base period net income (CABPNI) upon approval or modification (after some years of consideration) by the Excess Profits Tax Council. Although a wide range of time was allowed for filing a \u00a7 722 application, it often was filed, as here, simultaneously with the filing of the regular EPT return. The resulting re-determination of EPC, like the carryover or carryback of UEPC, meant that the ultimate deficiencies or overpayments would not be known when the tax was due or initially paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-12\">Because a \u00a7 722 application would tend to lead to a lower EPT, Congress provided in \u00a7 710(a) (5) for partial deferment of EPT. Thus, if a \u00a7 722 application had been filed and if AEPNI (without reference to \u00a7 722) exceeded 50% of NTNI, taxpayer could defer payment of % of the claimed <em>reduction in </em>tax due. With this deferred payment and with an eventual increase in EPC or UEPC it would be possible for the resulting IT deficiency to exceed the resulting actual overpayment. Briefly, then, overpayments could result from three relevant sources: (1) approval of a CABPNI for the tax year resulting in a higher EPC; (2) carryover or carryback of loss from different years resulting in a lower NT NI; or (3) a carryover or carryback of UEPC. The last could itself result from three relevant sources: (i) an initial excess of EPC over NTNI on a different year; (ii) carryover or carryback of loss resulting in a lower NTNI for a different year; or (iii) approval of a CABPNI for a different year leading' to a higher EPC for that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-14\">The various time lags and redeterminations created possible interest problems. As to interest on deficiencies resulting, from \u00a7 722 relief, \u00a7 292(b) provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adx\">\u201cIf any part of a deficiency for a taxable year * * * is determined by the Commissioner to be attributable to the final determination of an application for relief or benefit under section 722 for any taxable year * * * no interest shall be assessed or paid with respect to such part of the deficiency for any period prior to one year after the filing of such application * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1079-15\">As to interest on overpayments resulting from \u00a7 722 relief, \u00a7 3771(g), added at the same time, provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-16\">\u201c * * * If any part of an overpayment * * * is determined by the Commissioner to be attributable to the final determination of an <em>ap</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number><em>plication for relief or benefit under section 722 for any taxable year, </em>no interest shall be allowed or paid with respect to such part of the overpayment for any period prior to one year after the filing of <em>such application. * </em>* (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQg\">Section 3771(g) supplemented, without superseding, a pre-existing, more general provision in \u00a7 3771(e) for claims based on carrybacks of loss or credit, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-4\">\u201cIf the Commissioner determines that any part of an overpayment is attributable to the inclusion in computing the net operating loss deduction for the taxable year of any part of the net operating loss for a succeeding taxable year or to the inclusion in computing the unused excess profits credit adjustment for the taxable year of any part of the unused excess profits credit for a succeeding taxable year, no interest shall be allowed or paid with respect to such part of the overpayment for any period before the filing of a <em>claim for credit or refund of such part of the overpayment </em>* * *. \u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">Turning to the facts, in 1945 taxpayer filed with its 1944 EPT return a \u00a7 722 application for relief with respect to 1944; it also chose to defer payment of $2,200,000 of EPT under \u00a7 710. On April 24,1947, taxpayer filed with its 1946 EPC return an application for \u00a7 722 relief with respect to 1946; it again chose to defer payment of part of the EPT due. On April 13, 1949, taxpayer filed a claim for refund of its 1946 EPT due to a net operating loss carryback from 1948. At the same time taxpayer filed a claim with reference to 1944 EPT based on a carry-back of UEPC from 1946 which resulted from the carryback of loss from 1948. No reference was made in this claim, as it presumably could have been, to any additional UEPC for 1946 resulting from \u00a7 722 relief for 1946. Then on January 13, 1950, taxpayer filed another claim for refund for 1944 EPT due to carryback from 1946 of the UEPC created by \u00a7 722 for that year. Also, in January 1950 the Excess Profits Tax Council approved in part taxpayer\u2019s claim for \u00a7 722 relief with respect to 1943-46 by determining the appropriate CABPNI \u2014 a figure lower than the CABPNI estimated by taxpayer. The carryback to 1944 of the UEPC caused by 1946 \u00a7 722 relief resulted in a component EPT overassessment of $910,000 and a component IT deficiency of $380,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-7\">Taxpayer claims that under \u00a7 3771(g) interest on the overassessment should run from one year after filing of the first \u00a7 722 application for 1946, <em>i. e., </em>April 24, 1948; at the very least, taxpayer claims, under \u00a7 3771(e) interest should run from January 13, 1950, when the last claim for refund for 1944 was filed. Interest due would be about $150,000 under the former choice and about $55,000 under the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-8\">However, the Commissioner determined that the overpayment was attributable to the 1950 filing which was considered an application for \u00a7 722 relief under \u00a7 3771(g). Consequently, he allowed interest to the taxpayer on the over-assessment and charged interest against the taxpayer on the deficiency from January 13, 1951, one year from the 1950 filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-9\">A further twist was added by taxpayer\u2019s voluntary payment on December 7, 1949, of $3,670,000 to be applied against various past deficiencies in IT and EPT. $775,000 was to be applied against the 1944 IT deficiency, that being the additional amount shown due in an amended return filed the next day. Of that amount one-half was applied to the component IT deficiency arising from the grant of \u00a7 722 relief for 1944 and one-half was to be applied against any additional component deficiency arising from the grant of the carryback sought in the 1950 application. In fact, the eventual additional deficiency was exactly that amount and was deemed satisfied by that payment. Although the deficient tax would have been formally due in 1944, no interest would have run against taxpayer on the deficiency until one year from the 1950 filing. Because of this, taxpayer contends that, even apart from the statute, it is entitled to interest on the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>of the IT deficiency paid at a time when interest could not have run the other way. Again, the Commissioner disagreed and allowed no interest for this period. Taxpayer brought this action to recover interest. Judge Levet granted the Government\u2019s motion for summary judgment. 237 F.Supp. 169 (S.D.N.Y.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">It is clear that \u00a7 3771(e) governs interest on overpayments resulting from a claim for refund (such as taxpayer filed in 1949) based only on carryback of loss, or carryback of UEPC, due to any excess of EPC over NTNI not involving a \u00a7 722 determination. Thus, it applies to the \u201cstandard\u201d carrybacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">It is equally clear that \u00a7 3771(g) governs interest on overpayments resulting solely from the granting of an application (such as taxpayer filed in 1945 for 1944, and in 1947 for 1946) for \u00a7 722 relief. But the only \u00a7 722 application that, without more, could cause an overpayment in a particular taxable year is the \u00a7 722 application for that taxable year. For any other year\u2019s \u00a7 722 application to have that effect, a claim for refund and carryback or carryforward had to be filed. The crucial question, then, is whether a claim seeking to carry-back UEPC caused by \u00a7 722 relief for a subsequent year is to be assimilated to a claim under \u00a7 3771(e) or (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">Looking first to the text, nothing in \u00a7 3771(e) purports to distinguish between claims for carryback of UEPC resulting from subsequent \u00a7 722 relief and those resulting from other sources. On the other hand, \u00a7 3771(g) clearly contemplates overpayments resulting from \u00a7 722 relief in years other than the taxable year, thereby implicitly requiring a carryback or carryforward claim to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">Taxpayer claims that the legislative history anticipates that both (e) and (g) might apply at once and that then interest would run from a date no earlier than that provided by (e), but <em>at times </em>from the later date provided in (g). It further argues that an interpretation that treats the 1950 filing as within \u00a7 3771(g) will <em>always </em>result in (g) governing, contrary to the statutory intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-11\">We are not convinced that the legislative history will bear the weight of taxpayer\u2019s argument and hypothetical case but, in any event, the Government gave a sufficient answer. To Judge Levet\u2019s able discussion, 237 F.Supp. at 173-174, we would add only that the Congressional intention would seem to be satisfied where some part of the total overpayment could also be attributed to the claim for carry-back of UEPC resulting from determination of the 1946 \u00a7 722 application. While proration might then be a possibility there is nothing in the statute requiring it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-12\">As Judge Levet observed below and in Time, Inc. v. United States, 226 F.Supp. 680, 685 (S.D.N.Y.), aff\u2019d on the opinion below, 337 F.2d 859 (2d Cir. 1964), \u00a7 722 applications are in a somewhat unique category because of the complicated, time-consuming process of computing a CAB PNI; Congress therefore allowed more time \u2014 namely, a year \u2014 before interest liability would exist on either side. For this reason, the Government claims, and Judge Levet correctly held, \u201c \u2018application for refund or benefit\u2019 \u2014 was intended to include an application for any taxable year which claims the benefit for such year of a carryover or carryback of an unused excess profits credit resulting from the grant of section 722 relief for any prior or subsequent year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-13\">TJie \u00a7 722 application filed in 1946 is not the reckoning point because it in itself led to no overpayment. That came into being only because of the 1950 claim. See Headline Publications, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 263 F.2d 541 (2d Cir. 1959); Industrial Rayon Corp. v. United States, 155 F.Supp. 556, 140 Ct.Cl. 168 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-14\">Nor can the 1947 application be treated as a claim for refund resulting from a carryback. Pearl Assur. Co. v. United States, 324 F.2d 512 (Ct.Cl.1963), is quite distinguishable for it does not involve any \u00a7 722 determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number> Judge Levet\u2019s rejection of the claim for interest from December 1949 based on an equitable \u201cuse of money\u201d doctrine is entirely sound. Neither Manning v. Seeley Tube &amp; Box Co., 338 U.S. 561, 70 S.Ct. 386, 94 L.Ed. 346 (1950), nor United States v. Koppers Co., 348 U.S. 254, 75 S.Ct. 268, 99 L.Ed. 302 (1955), creates any such doctrine. Mutuality of result is irrelevant; for interest to run against the Government, taxpayer must point to a specific statutory provision. There is none for this situation. In any case, there is really no \u201cprepayment\u201d involved here. The tax was due in 1944. Only because Congress took into account the complicated redeterminations was taxpayer not liable for interest on the tax then due from an earlier date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
