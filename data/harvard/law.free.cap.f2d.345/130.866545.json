On coming into land on the assigned runway at La Guardia the landing gear of the plane struck the top of a dike at the end of the runway, and the plane crashed. The appellants claimed personal injuries and brought actions against American Airlines alleging careless and negligent operation of the airplane. The defense was that as the plane made a normal, safe approach to the runway it unexpectedly and without warning encountered a \u201cthermal sink\u201d or \u201cdown draft\u201d which caused it suddenly to lose altitude and hit the dike.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">To counter this defense, which so far as the record shows rested entirely on the testimony of the captain flying the plane, the plaintiffs without objection were allowed to introduce an accident report emanating from the defendant airline which contained the statement that \u201cweather was not considered a factor in this accident.\u201d Later for the same purpose the plaintiffs offered a mimeographed document in the form of a letter received by the plaintiff Arber on the letterhead of American Airlines. This letter is addressed only \u201cDear Sir,\u201d is dated October 17, 1960, and is signed, apparently with a rubber stamp, by one \u201cThornton Wagner, Captain,\u201d who identified himself in the body of the letter as \u201cEngineering Test Pilot\u201d for American Airlines. Its purport is to restore public confidence in the Electra airplane two of which had previously been involved in accidents attributed to structural failure. The letter stresses the safety of the plane flown at reduced speed and the fact that American Airlines flies it only at reduced speed and attributes this accident and one in which a similar plane crashed after flying into a flock of sea gulls as not having been caused by any structural defect in the plane. With respect to this particular accident the letter states: \u201cThe consensus is that this was an unfortunate accident, just too short and low a landing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The court allowed the letter to be marked for identification but on the defendant\u2019s objection refused to admit it in evidence as an exhibit on two grounds: lack of any showing that Captain Wagner had any authority to make admissions binding on the airline and failure of the letter to say \u201cwhose consensus it is.\u201d We think this ruling correct on the first ground and so do not need to consider the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Assuming for the moment that the letter constituted an admission against the defendant\u2019s interest, which is the purpose for which it was offered, its admissibility depends upon whether Captain Wagner had authority under the principles of the law of agency to make the admission on behalf of his corporate employer. See United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., 89 F.Supp. 349, 353 (D.C.Mass.1950). There is no direct evidence or offer of evidence that Captain Wagner was clothed with specific authority in this respect. However, it might be inferred from Captain Wagner\u2019s position as the defendant\u2019s engineering test pilot that he had apparent authority to speak for the airline with respect to the safety of the planes it flew. But the inference is not nearly so clear that he also had apparent authority to speak for the airline with respect to the manner in which one of its planes was flown on a specific occasion. We think it well within the discretionary power of the court below to require the plaintiffs to come forward with more specific evidence of Captain Wagner\u2019s authority to speak for the defendant on this subject before admitting the letter in evidence. See Restatement (Second) Agency \u00a7 286 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Subsequently, apparently in an effort to make the Wagner letter binding on the defendant by showing its endorsement by higher corporate authority, the plaintiffs, again through the plaintiff Arber, undertook to introduce another mimeographed document in the form of a letter of the same date. This letter is on the letterhead of C. R. Smith, 100 Park Avenue, New York, 17 New York, is simi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>larly addressed only \u201cDear Sir:\u201d and is similarly signed apparently with a rubber stamp. It gives no indication of C. R. Smith\u2019s connection with American Airlines. The letter refers to previous publicity about the Electra airplane, some \u201cexcellent\u201d and some \u201cunfavorable\u201d, and continues: \u201cYou will be asked questions about the Electra; we want you to be informed about it.\u201d The letter then goes on: \u201cNo one knows more about the capability of the Electra than the parties who fly it. Accordingly, I have asked Captain Thornton Wagner, Test Pilot for American, to write you a note about the Electra, and that note is attached.\u201d The letter concludes with a statement \u201cabout American\u2019s operating philosophy\u201d with respect to the safety of the planes it operates.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The court below allowed this letter to be marked for identification but after conference at the bench at which counsel for one of the plaintiffs said: \u201cSmith is president of the company\u201d refused to admit it in evidence as an exhibit on the same grounds assigned for refusing to admit the letter from Captain Wagner. The court announced: \u201cThe burden is on the plaintiff to show evidence is admissible, if it is offered by way of admission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The C. R. Smith letter is not an intracompany accident report such as the one introduced by the plaintiffs in this case without objection. Nor is it a letter written by an airline captain to his superior by way of a report of an accident such as Captain Sigman\u2019s letter ruled admissible in Pekelis v. Transcontinental &amp; Western Air, Inc., 187 F.2d 122, 125, 23 A.L.R.2d 1349 (C.A. 2, 1951), cert. denied, 341 U.S. 951, 71 S.Ct. 1020, 95 L.Ed. 1374 (1951). There is nothing to show that it was a record made in the regular course of business and thus admissible under Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1732(a). Nor is it a press release to the public generally for promotional purposes. On the other hand, neither is it a personally signed letter addressed to a specific recipient.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">We think the court below did not err in its ruling excluding the Smith letter from evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">There is no extrinsic evidence to indicate the source of the letter as a higher corporate official who might be assumed to have apparent authority to speak for his corporation. There is not even intrinsic evidence in the letter itself to indicate that the purported writer was president of the defendant airline. It is not written on airline stationery, like Captain Wagner\u2019s letter, but so far as appears on a personal letterhead, nor does the writer identify himself in the body of the letter as an airline official in any capacity. It appears to be an inexpensive mimeographed copy of a communication addressed generally to all passengers on the ill-fated flight in order to restore their confidence in the Electra airplane. In view of the content and form of the letter and the lack of evidence identifying C. R. Smith with American Airlines or any showing that the letter actually came from him, we think the court below did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit the letter in evidence on nothing but counsel\u2019s statement that \u201cSmith is president of the company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Moreover, the letter does not authorize Captain Wagner to commit the airline as to the manner in which its airplanes are flown on specific occasions. It only authorized Captain Wagner \u201cto write you a note about the Electra\u201d because \u201cwe want you to be informed about it.\u201d Thus, even if the C. R. Smith letter actually emanated from the president of the defendant airline, it would add nothing to the authority of Captain Wagner to admit the airline\u2019s liability for this particular accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">On the facts of this case we conclude that the court below did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow the jury to consider Captain Wagner\u2019s letter without more showing of his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">Judgment will be entered affirming the judgments of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
