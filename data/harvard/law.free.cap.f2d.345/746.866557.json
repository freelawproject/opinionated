Parry-Hill, a building contractor. On April 10, 1955, Joseph W. Parry-Hill signed a printed form real estate agreement as \u201cSeller\u201d in which he agreed to sell to appellees a certain lot of ground \u201cwith improvements to be erected thereon.\u201d Appellant Mrs. Janet S. Parry-Hill signed that real estate sales contract as \u201cWife of Seller.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b823-17\">Subsequently, on June 11, 1955, in a document styled \u201cAgreement Between Contractor and Owner,\u201d Joseph W. Parry-Hill agreed to construct a building on the lot pursuant to certain plans made part of the agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mrs. Parry-Hill did not sign this agreement of June 11, 1955. Neither she nor the sales contract of April 10 was referred to therein. The suit which is the basis of this appeal resulted from an alleged default on the building contract. Appellees sued both Mr. and Mrs. Parry-Hill, relying on the agreements of April 10, 1955, and June 11, 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-18\"> There is no basis in law for a claim against Mrs. Parry-Hill under either agreement. Since she was not a party to the agreement of June 11, 1955, she is not bound thereby. With reference to the agreement of April 10, 1955, she signed, not as a party thereto, but as \u201cWife of Seller,\u201d obviously for the purpose of releasing any dower or other marital interest she may have had in the lot which was the subject of the April 10 agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This act on her part certainly did not make her a party to that contract for all purposes or to the building contract for any purpose. Holt v. Doty, 193 Iowa 582, 187 N.W. 550, 552 (1922). See also 17A AmJur., DOWER,, \u00a7\u00a7 91, 92 (1957); 5 AM.JUR. LEGAL Forms 5:521, 5:522 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-19\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b823-14\">. An analysis of the April 10 and June 11 agreements discloses a discrepancy between the two of $500.00 in the proposed purchase price. The April 10 agreement provides for a deposit of $500.00 \u201cto be applied as part payment\u201d of the total price of $18,000.00. The agreement of June 11 ignores this $500.00 and contains detailed provisions for the payment of the full $18,000.00. Whether this $500.00 was intended by the parties to be payment for the lot, as distinguished from the \u201cimprovements to be erected thereon,\u201d is not clear. In any event, appellees here make no claim that they did not receive the lot or that the lot, as received, was in any way encumbered by appellant\u2019s dower interest. Their complaint is predicated primarily on Mr. Parry-Hill\u2019s alleged failure to comply with his building contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b823-21\">. There is not the slightest indication that appellant participated in this affair in any way except to release her dower interest in the lot. In deposition, appellee Edward P. Roberts testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-22\">\u201cQ. Well, with whom did you deal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-23\">\u201cA. Mr. Parry-Hill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-24\">\u201cQ. Entirely with Mr. Parry-Hill?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-25\">Nobody else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-26\">\u201cA. Nobody else.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-27\">The fact that Mrs. Parry-Hill signed the April 10 agreement, not as seller, but as \u201cWife of Seller\u201d negates her participation as \u201cSeller.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
