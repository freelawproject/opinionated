It purchased large quantities of vitamins from various manufacturers, and repackaged them under its own label at its headquarters in Middlesex, New Jersey. It thereafter sold to persons who responded to its advertising and promotional literature which appeared in magazines, newspapers and Sunday supplements throughout the United States. It also made sales to persons to whom it had mailed its promotional literature. It did not retain a record of persons to whom the literature was sent.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-21\">The Libel of Information alleged that the \u201clabeling\u201d which accompanied the Vitasafe product, a series of ten different pieces of promotional literature, falsely implied and suggested (1) that Vita-safe \u201cFormula M\u201d and Vitasafe \u201cFormula W\u201d were designed to satisfy the special nutritional needs of men and women respectively; (2) that the nutritional value of the Vitasafe capsule was enhanced by the addition of several ingredients which were in fact of \u201cno nutritional significance for dietary supplementation;\u201d (3) that the minimum adult daily requirements of vitamins and minerals, specified in the \u201clabeling\u201d, were the recommendations of the Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Science, National Research Council and (4) that large amounts of common foods would be needed to provide the nutrients supplied by one Vitasafe capsule.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>The Libel also alleged that the \u201clabeling\u201d falsely and misleadingly implied and suggested that Vitasafe, as a drug, was an adequate and effective treatment for several common maladies.; that practically everyone in the country was suffering from, or in danger of suffering from, a dietary deficiency of vitamins, minerals and proteins, which was likely to cause certain deficiency diseases; and that the deficiencies suggested were caused by a loss of nutritive value due to the soil in which food was grown, and the storage, processing and cooking of foods.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">The Libel further alleged that the \u201clabeling\u201d represented Vitasafe to be \u201ca lipotropic factor or agent\u201d without adequately stating directions for its use as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">The Government, in condemnation proceeding, presented several expert witnesses in support of its position. Vita-safe Corporation, as claimant, also presented expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">The District Court, 226 F.Supp. 266 (D.N.J.1964) found that Vitasafe was a \u201cfood\u201d within the meaning of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 321(f) because its \u201clabeling\u201d recommended \u201cits use and represent [ed] it to be of value as a dietary and nutritional supplement;\u201d that it was also a \u201cdrug\u201d within the meaning of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 321(g) because its \u201clabeling\u201d recommended \u201cits use and represent [ed] it to be of value as a curative or preventive of disease conditions in man affecting the structure and function of the body of man\u201d. It further found that the seized packages of Vitasafe were \u201cmisbranded when introduced into, while in, and while held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce,\u201d in that their \u201clabeling\u201d was false and misleading,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that there did not appear adequate directions for the use of Vitasafe as a lipotropic factor or agent.6 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">The District Court on the basis of the stated fact-findings, held that the seized 900 packages of Vitasafe capsules were subject to condemnation as \u201cmisbranded\u201d, under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 334, and so ordered. The record amply supports both the fact-findings and the order of condemnation with respect to these seized packages. It would serve no useful purpose to dwell on this aspect of this appeal in view of the exhaustive analysis relating to these packages in the District Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-12\">We are, however, of the opinion that the District Court erred as a matter of law in ruling that the 3,730,000 pieces of promotional literature seized while at rest in the Vitasafe warehouse in Middlesex, New Jersey, were \u201clabeling\u201d within the meaning of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 321 (m), and as such subject to condemnation under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-13\">The Government urges with respect to these 3,730,000 pieces that \u201call of the promotional matter seized was obviously intended to promote Vitasafe, and had no other useful purpose,\u201d and that \u201cit supplements the label on the bottle of capsules, and was intended by the claimants to be ultimately used in the sale of Vita-safe,\u201d and thus it was \u201clabeling\u201d subject to condemnation under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-14\">The claimant, Vitasafe Corporation, does not deny the alleged intended use of the seized material, but contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>it was never actually employed for such purposes, and therefore could not have been subject to condemnation under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Under Section 321 (m) the term \u201clabeling\u201d applies inter alia to \u201cwritten, printed, or graphic matter\u201d which appears upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers or <em>\u201caccompanying such article.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Section 331, 21 U.S.C.A. which prohibits, in subsection (a) \u201cThe introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food, drug, device, or cosmetic that is adulterated or misbranded\u201d, also proscribes in subsection (1) the use of \u201cany advertising\u201d matter thus used relating to the misbranded article. Section 334 provides for the seizure and condemnation of \u201clabeling\u201d as defined in Section 321 (m).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">Section 334(a) specifically provides that misbranded articles of food or drugs, \u201cwhen introduced into or while in interstate commerce or while held for sale * * * after shipment in interstate commerce\u201d, may be condemned.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">Critical here is the second clause \u201caccompanying such article\u201d in Section 321(m).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">The 3,730,000 pieces of literature seized while in the Vitasafe warehouse cannot be categorized as \u201clabeling\u201d within the meaning of Section 321 (m) since they perforce cannot be held to have been \u201caccompanying\u201d any misbranded Vitasafe capsules \u201cintroduced into or while in interstate commerce or while held for sale * * * after shipment in interstate commerce\u201d inasmuch as they never entered interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">The cases cited by the Government in support of its contention that the 3,730,-000 pieces of literature constituted \u201clabeling\u201d are inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">In Kordel v. United States, 335 U.S. 345, 69 S.Ct. 106, 93 L.Ed. 52 (1948), \u201cThe alleged misbranding consists of statement in circulars or pamphlets <em>distributed </em>to consumers by the vendors of the products * * *.\u201d Here there was never any \u201cdistribution\u201d of the seized literature, (emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b944-13\">In United States v. Urbuteit, 335 U.S. 355, 69 S.Ct. 112, 93 L.Ed. 61 (1948), certain machines misbranded as possessing \u201ccurative and therapeutic powers\u201d were seized <em>after shipment in interstate commerce. </em>The claimant \u201cadmitted that the devices and leaflets [extolling the alleged virtues of the devices], <em>had been shipped in interstate commerce, </em>but denied that they were shipped together or that they were related to each other.\u201d (emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b944-14\">In holding that the leaflets constituted \u201clabeling\u201d the Court said (pp. 357-358, 69 S.Ct. p. 114):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-15\">\u201cIn this case it is plain to us that <em>the movements of machines and leaflets in interstate commerce </em>were a single interrelated activity, not separate or isolated ones. * * * The fact that the false literature <em>leaves in a separate mail </em>does not save the article from being misbranded. Where by functional standards the two transactions are integrated, the requirements of \u00a7 304(a) are satisfied, though the <em>mailings or shipments </em>are at different times.\u201d (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-16\">Again, here both the machines and leaflets were introduced into interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-17\">In United States v. 47 Bottles etc. Jenasol, 2 Cir., 320 F.2d 564 (1963) cert. den. sub nom. Schere d/b/a Jenasol Company v. United States, 375 U.S. 953, 84 S.Ct. 444, 11 L.Ed.2d 313, where we affirmed the condemnation of promotional literature, the latter had been <em>shipped in interstate commerce </em>\u2014 from New York to the State of Washington \u2014 to a distributor in whose home it had been found. The literature had been separately shipped to the distributor to promote the sale of a drug found to be misbranded.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-18\">Again, in United States v. Hohensee, 3 Cir., 243 F.2d 367 (1957), cert. den. 353 U.S. 976, 77 S.Ct. 1058, 1 L.Ed.2d 1136, where we affirmed the judgments of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>viction for introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce, the promotional materials and misbranded drugs had been <em>transported in interstate commerce. </em>Likewise, in United States v. 353 Cases * * * Mountain Valley Mineral Water, 247 F.2d 473 (8 Cir. 1957) the condemned literature, which extolled the medicinal and therapeutic qualities of a misbranded mineral water, had been <em>shipped, </em>along with the water, in <em>interstate commerce </em>from Hot Springs, Arkansas to Memphis, Tennessee, where both were seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">We come now to the challenged sweep of the District Court\u2019s Preliminary Injunction at Appeal No. 15066.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">The defendants in the injunction proceeding concede that if the District Court correctly held that the Vitasafe capsules were misbranded that it could enjoin its continuance. They contend, however, that the Injunction as issued is too broad in that, they say, (1) it enjoins sales of the capsules \u201ceven with proper labeling, to anyone who previously received any of the appellants\u2019 advertising literature and to any former customer\u201d, and (2) it prohibits the distribution of literature \u201cwhich contains certain specified statements and representations and then adds a clause \u2018or which is otherwise false and misleading\u2019 \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">In support of their first contention, appellants urge that \u201cthe Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act does not authorize an injunction to prohibit shipment of a product, with proper labeling, on the ground that prior literature contained a false or misleading statement or misrepresentation\u201d ; that such a prohibition \u201cis punitive in nature rather than remedial\u201d; and that \u201cit is unjust in that it will cause substantial, if not, total destruction of a company for any past false or misleading statement in its advertising.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">In reply, the Government says, in substance, that the Preliminary Injunction, only restrains sales to \u201cpresent customers\u201d and that \u201cThere is no doubt that appellants can now market their product under appropriate labeling, to all the world \u2014 except those persons who have already been subjected to the false and misleading claims made by appellants.\u201d The challenged provisions of the Preliminary Injunction enjoin the appellants from</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-11\">\u201cB. Introducing and causing to be introduced and delivering and causing to be delivered for introduction into interstate commerce any of the aforesaid articles which are addressed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-12\">\u201c(a) to any person to whom the defendants have previously sent, prior to the date of this- decree, any written, printed, and graphic matter which makes any of the statements or representations set forth in paragraph A(a), or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-13\">\u201c(b) to any person who has sent to the defendants any of the order forms or order blanks which have been mailed by defendants prior to the date of this decree or which have appeared in any newspaper, magazine, Sunday supplement, or other advertisement published prior to the date of this decree;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-14\">The Injunction here was issued pursuant to Section 332(a) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 301 et seq., which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-15\">\u201cThe district courts of the United States * * * shall have jurisdiction, for cause shown * * * to restrain violations of section 331 * * *\u00bb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-17\">Section 331 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-18\">\u201cThe following acts and the causing thereof are prohibited:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-19\">\u201c(a) The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food, drug, device, or cosmetic that is adulterated or misbranded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-20\">\u201c(b) The adulteration or misbranding of any food, drug, device, or cosmetic in interstate commerce.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-21\">A food or drug is misbranded if \u201cits labeling is false or misleading in any particular.\u201d 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 343(a), 352 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number> It is settled that the \u201chigh purpose\u201d of the Act is \u201cto protect consumers who under present conditions are largely unable to protect themselves in this field,\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that the problem of its- enforcement \u201cis a practical one of consumer protection, not dialectics.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">In the leading case of United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277, 64 S.Ct. 134, 88 L.Ed. 48, the late Mr. Justice Frankfurter, speaking for the Court, laid down these guidelines with respect to the Act\u2019s construction and application, at page 280, 64 S.Ct. at page 136:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-5\">\u201cThe purposes of this legislation thus touch phases of the lives and health of people which, in the circumstances of modern industrialism, are largely beyond self-protection. Regard for these purposes should infuse construction of the legislation if it is to be treated as a working instrument of government and not merely as a collection of English words.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">In the instant case, the District Court, in its opinion reported at 235 F.Supp. 84 (D.N.J.1964), specified the respects in which the \u201clabeling\u201d of the condemned \u2022capsules misbranded them and the record \u25a0amply supports the specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">After so doing the Court said (pp. 88, 89):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-8\">\u201cPresent consumers of Vitasafe products became customers as subjects of the condemned ads. Any vitamins sold by Vitasafe to such customers now are as much mislabeled by that advertising as if they had been sold before the condemnation decree. The discontinued circulars remain labeling for Vitasafe products in the minds of those previously subjected to it. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-9\">\u201cThe condemned labeling was the substance of a long and concerted campaign by Vitasafe. It is fairly inferable from the facts that the vast majority of pre-decree customers were enticed into the Vitasafe net by false and misleading labeling. Furthermore, the literature which Vitasafe and its associate companies have used of late in connection with both old and new customers, innocuous though some of it may be, tends to reinforce, by similarity in content and form, the effect of the earlier mislabeling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-13\">\u201cIt is therefore our opinion that the condemned advertising mislabeled all Vitasafe products which were or will be sent to customers obtained prior to the decree. It is necessary and proper, in order to prevent further distribution of mislabeled vitamins, to restrain and enjoin defendant Vitasafe\u2019s continued distribution to these customers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b946-14\">It is clear from the foregoing that the District Court contemplated only enjoining sales of the capsules to those persons who had been subjected to, and inveigled by, the false and misleading claims made by the appellants in their directly mailed literature, and newspaper and magazine advertisements.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-15\">Under the facts in the instant case, and the applicable law, imposition of the restraints contemplated by the District Court would be well within permissible limits since a court* may reasonably conclude that post-injunction sales of an article may be the end product of prior misbranding, and enjoin such sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-16\">However, the Preliminary Injunction, in Paragraph B, subsection (a) enjoins sale of the capsules \u201cto any person to whom the defendants have previously sent, prior to the date of this decree, any written * * * matter\u201d making specified false claims, irrespective of whether the sale is the end product of such \u201cwritten matter\u201d, or the result of solicitation by proper post-decree literature.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-17\">That being so, we are compelled to the opinion that subsection (a) of Paragraph B of the Preliminary Injunc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>tion is beyond permissible limits and must therefore be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">The restraints contemplated by the District Court may be satisfactorily achieved and made effective by adding the italicized clause \u201cor will send\u201d to subsection (b) of Paragraph B so that it will read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-6\">\u201c(b) to any person who has sent, <em>or mil send, </em>to the defendants any of the order forms or order blanks which have been mailed by defendants prior to the date of this decree or which have appeared in any newspaper, magazine, Sunday supplement, or other advertisement published prior to the date of this decree;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">There remains for disposition the defendants\u2019 contention that the injunction is too broad in that, in Paragraphs A and C, it prohibits the distribution of literature which contains certain specified statements and misrepresentations, \u201cor which is otherwise false and misleading\u201d. The defendants urge that the clause \u201cotherwise false and misleading\u201d enjoins acts which are neither \u201cidentifiable\u201d nor \u201cspecific\u201d, and further fails to make \u201cknowledge of falsity\u201d a condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">We are of the opinion that the defendants\u2019 contentions in this respect are valid, and that accordingly, the clause \u201cor which is otherwise false and misleading\u201d must be deleted from Paragraphs A and C of the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-9\">Rule 65(d), F.R.Civ.P. requires that \u201c[e]very order granting an injunction * * * shall be specific in terms * The challenged clause lacks the required specificity. It places the defendants \u201cat the peril of a summons for contempt\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AB6\">without providing any guidelines for the carrying on of a future advertising program in a manner deemed appropriate by the District Court. Cf. National Labor Relations Board v. Express Publishing Co., 312 U.S. 426, 61 S.Ct. 693, 85 L.Ed. 930 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-13\">In closing, it must be noted that the District Court, in Paragraph A(a) (6) enjoined the defendants from shipping their product in interstate commerce when accompanied by \u201clabeling\u201d representing,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-14\">\u201cthat practically everyone in this country is suffering from or is in danger of suffering from, a dietary deficiency of vitamins, minerals and proteins, which is likely to result in specific deficiency diseases such as scurvy as well as a great number of nonspecific symptoms and conditions, and that such threatened deficiency is due to loss of nutritive value of ordinary foods by reason of the soil on which the foods are grown, and the storage, processing and cooking of the foods,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-15\">without a fact-finding that any such representations had been made in the past, or that they were false and misleading. It is apparent that the failure to make such a fact-finding was inadvertent since its basis is amply established by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-16\">For the reasons stated the causes at Appeal No. 14964 and at Appeal No. 15066 will be remanded with directions to the District Court to vacate its Decrees respectively entered therein on April 13, 1964 and September 29, 1964, and to enter new Decrees in accordance with the Opinion of this Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b942-9\">. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 334,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b942-10\">. \u201cFood\u201d within the meaning of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 321(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b942-12\">. \u201cDrug\u201d within the meaning of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 321(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b942-14\">.
