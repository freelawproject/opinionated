We think the district court erred in deciding this issue in favor of England.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The facts are undisputed. England was permanently transferred by his employer from Kansas City, Missouri, to Springfield, Illinois, where he arrived on June 19, 1960. He began then to look for a place for his family to live and on July 9, 1960 leased a house which was unavailable for occupancy until August 1, 1960, at which time his family moved in. Pursuant to its policy and regulations, the employer reimbursed England for $466.00 of his Springfield expenses incurred prior to taking possession under the lease. The major items of expense were his meals and lodging and a trip by his wife to inspect a house in Springfield.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> England did not request or wish to make the transfer, but did so at the behest of-the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue added the amount of reimbursement to the taxpayer\u2019s gross income and assessed an additional tax of $103.00. England paid the tax under protest, and brought this suit after the Government rejected his demand for a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">We agree with the Government, contrary to the district court\u2019s view, that in view of \u00a7 61 (a)\u2019s definition of gross income as \u201call income from whatever source derived, including (but not limited to) the following items,\u201d the fact that the reimbursement received by England might not fall within item (1) \u201cCompensation for services, including fees, commissions, and similar items\u201d is not in any way controlling. Nor is the fact, emphasized by the court, that England suffered a financial loss in the transfer to Springfield controlling as to whether the reimbursement constitutes gross income. We disagree, for reasons which will be clear hereafter, with the court\u2019s conclusion that congressional intent was that England\u2019s reimbursement should be excludable.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\"> Revenue Ruling 54-429,1954\u2014 2 Cum.Bull. 53, interpreting \u00a7 22(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, predecessor of \u00a7 61(a) of the 1954 Code, provides that an amount received as reimbursement by an employee from an employer for the expenses of moving himself, his immediate family, his household goods and personal effects from one official station to another for permanent duty is not includible in the employee\u2019s gross income. The Ruling then specifically provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-11\">\u201cAmounts received as allowances or reimbursements for meals and lodging of the employee and his family while awaiting permanent quarters at the new post of duty are includible in gross income of the employee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">We think that this ruling is a permissible interpretation of the Internal Revenue Code\u2019s definition of gross income, and a correct one. The expense of transporting an employee to a new post of duty for benefit of the employer is properly an expense of the employer, not compensation to the employee, but the costs of meals, lodgings, and expenses incidental to securing housing at the post are personal living expenses of the employee, and if they are provided by the employer, income is realized thereby. This question was resolved adversely to England in Cockrell v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 321 F.2d 504 (8th Cir. 1963), where the taxpayer received a per diem allowance from the employer at the new post and a special allowance to reimburse him for the cost, of living in motels near the new post while attempting to find housing, scarce in the area. The Tax Court and the Eighth Circuit upheld the Commissioner\u2019s determination that the allowances were includible in the taxpayer\u2019s gross income and that they were not deductible as travel expenses while away from home.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Plaintiffs and the district court relied on John E. Cavanaugh, 30 T.C. 300 (1961), in support of the court\u2019s decision. The Government contends, and we agree, that that case was wrongly decided in failing to follow Rev. Rul. 54-429 and in excluding reimbursements for \u201cextraordinary\u201d- post-arrival food and lodging expenses from gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The district court here held that even if the amounts in question are includible in gross income, they are deductible either as ordinary and necessary business expenses under \u00a7 162(a) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or as reimbursed travel expenses while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business, under \u00a7\u00a7 62(2) (A) <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 162(a) (2) .<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A taxpayer\u2019s \u201chome,\u201d for the purposes of the reimbursed travel expense deduction, is not necessarily the place of his residence. Rather, it is the place of the taxpayer\u2019s business. In this case Springfield clearly was England\u2019s \u201chome\u201d after the transfer, and expenses incurred there were not \u201caway from home.\u201d Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Flowers, 326 U.S. 465, 66 S.Ct. 250, 90 L.Ed. 203 (1946); Cockrell v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 321 F.2d 504 (8th Cir. 1963); Kalist v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 321 F.2d 508 (8th Cir. 1963); Light v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 310 F.2d 716 (5th Cir. 1962); Andrews v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 179 F.2d 502 (4th Cir. 1950); Ney v. United States, 171 F.2d 449 (8th Cir. 1948); York v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 80 U.S.App. D.C. 63, 160 F.2d 385 (D.C. Cir. 1947); Darrell Spear Courtney, 32 T.C. 334 (1959). No deduction for those amounts is allowable under \u00a7\u00a7 62(2) (A) and 162 (a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">We think too that the district court\u2019s decision that these amounts were deductible as \u201cordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business\u201d under \u00a7 162(a) cannot be sustained. The expense of England\u2019s meals and lodging, his wife\u2019s trip, and the sale of his house were personal expenses, expressly made non-deductible by \u00a7 262. Cockrell v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue; Light v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue; York v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue; Andrews v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">England relies on Walter H. Mendel, 41 T.C. 32 (1963), now on appeal before the Fourth Circuit, in support of his position that these expenses are deductible. That case, which the Government contends was wrongly decided, allowed deductions for unreimbursed expenses of transporting household goods and for hotels and meals in transit to the new post, which the Tax Court characterized as business expenses. In view of our decision that the expenses involved here are personal expenses, Mendel is not directly in point and we need not express any opinion as to its correctness.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded with instructions to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-24\">. Connie J. England is also a plaintiff in this case since she and her husband filed a joint return for the taxable year in question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\">.
