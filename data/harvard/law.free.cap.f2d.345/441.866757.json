It was his practice to sell to middlemen, who sold to the salesmen or \u201cpushers\u201d as they are called in the vernacular, for sale to the ultimate consumers. In this manner defendant has attempted to insulate himself from detection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>through intermediaries, and left the small, shabby vendors, who are frequently also addicts, to face the rigors of the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">With this background would the community be threatened and would the safety of the community be jeopardized by his release ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">He has had several convictions in the past, including burglary and sale of narcotics, and he would not appear to be dangerous in the sense of a murderer, a rapist or an armed robber; but when I consider the large number of persons ultimately affected by the activities of a wholesale supplier, I believe that the community would be threatened and its safety would be jeopardized, perhaps more than it would be in the case of a man of extreme violence, whose field of operations would be limited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">Of course, this presupposes that defendant would resume his operations. No one can be certain of that, nor can one be certain that a man of violence would resume his life of violence, but it is equally as likely, and perhaps more likely, in the case of a purveyor of narcotics whose livelihood will depend on continuing this past pattern of his life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">There is one other matter that deserves mention, and it is this: One of the purposes of punishment is its deterring effect on others. This is a violation of the law which preys on the weaknesses of mankind. It is a planned, organized, syndicated type of crime. Many persons will undoubtedly hear of defendant\u2019s conviction, and if released on bail pending appeal and in a few days he is seen in his usual haunts, and not incarcerated, the uninformed will believe that in some manner he has circumvented the law and those similarly disposed will be encouraged to enter into, or continue in, this vicious type of criminal enterprise, and the deterrent effect will be immeasurably lessened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-14\">Danger to the community is, in some circumstances, a ground for denial of bail pending appeal'.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But \u201c[i]mprisonment to protect society from predicted but unconsummated offenses is so unprecedented in this country and so fraught with danger of excesses and injustice that [courts should be] loath to resort to it, even as a discretionary judicial technique to supplement conviction\u201d 2<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for serious offenses. The finding that appellant is likely to commit offenses if released on bail must at least \u201cbe supported by a scrupulous inquiry into appellant\u2019s past history and all other relevant circumstances.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, because the right to bail pending appeal is \u201cheavily favored,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the \u201cburden [is] on * * * the Government to persuade the trial judge that the minimum standards for allowing bail have not been met.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court\u2019s action must be examined in light of these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-15\">The court denied bail because it found that appellant was likely to \u201cresume his operations\u201d as a narcotics wholesaler, which would endanger the community. The court appears to rely on two grounds for this finding. The first is that appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>lant \u201chas had several convictions in the past, including burglary and sale of narcotics.\u201d Appellant\u2019s prior narcotics conviction took place in 1953, for which he was sentenced from sixteen months to four years imprisonment. He had been convicted in 1946 of a misdemeanor, illegal possession of numbers slips, and in 1935 he was convicted of burglary. Prior to 1935 he has an extensive record of convictions for such offenses as petty larceny. Appellant\u2019s criminal record does not show that he has a recent proclivity to repeat narcotics offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Moreover, appellant was released on bail for approximately one year between his arrest and conviction for the present offense. But the Government did not allege before the trial court or this court that appellant had engaged in any narcotics offenses during that time or even that he had been observed in suspicious circumstances. In this court, the Government does allege that appellant was arrested on two occasions during the past year, once for maintaining gambling premises and once for violation of the National Firearms Act. But these arrests do not show that appellant engaged in narcotics offenses while released on pretrial bail.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The evidence regarding appellant's conduct during that time is not sufficient to support denial of bail on grounds of dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The second ground cited by the court is that \u201cappellant\u2019s livelihood will depend on continuing this past pattern of his life,\u201d that is, selling narcotics. This finding is expressly contradicted by affidavits, verified by the District of Columbia Bail Project, from two employers promising to hire appellant, if released on bail, as a \u201cgeneral restaurant worker in a full-time capacity at a salary of Fifty Dollars ($50) per week\u201d and for part-time work as a \u201cgeneral store clerk, to work 24 hours per week at the rate of $1.50 per hour.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">One other reason is cited in the trial court\u2019s memorandum as grounds for denial of bail: that the \u201cdeterrent effect\u201d of the criminal law will be \u201cimmeasurably lessened\u201d if appellant is seen \u201cin his usual haunts, and not incarcerated,\u201d immediately following his conviction. This wrongly implies that bail may be denied to punish a convicted defendant for deterrent effects. Moreover, this ground is not sufficient to overcome the principles that bail pending appeal is \u201cheavily favored\u201d in all cases and that bail may be denied only on the basis of an individual judgment regarding the defendant and not an automatic presumption based on the character of the offense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">The Government has not met its burden of persuasion that bail should not be granted. Indeed, it is evident that the Government did not even attempt to meet that burden below. When appellant requested bail, the Government said only: \u201cWe would oppose bond pending appeal on the grounds that the nature of the offense involves a danger to the community. The past record of this man supports it would be a danger to the community.\u201d While the court may rely on sources other than the Government, such as the presentence report, to deny bail, it must indicate its findings so that \u201c[t]here is [a] record on which we may proceed.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On this record, the court\u2019s finding of dangerousness is not adequately supported. I therefore agree that appellant should be admitted to bail in the amount of $10,000.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> with the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>ditions that he report regularly to a probation officer and that he be continually employed on a full-time basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">BURGER, Circuit Judge, would deny appellant\u2019s motion for bail.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-20\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b519-9\">.
