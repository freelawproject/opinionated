According to prosecution witnesses, appellant fought with James Wilson, Jr., and struck him on the head with a wooden board on June 30, 1963. One week later, on July 6, Wilson was found by a police officer lying unconscious on the street. The Deputy Coroner testified that Wilson died on July 6 from \u201cincreased intracranial pressure due to an epidural, which is a collection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>blood above the thickest covering of the brain, between the thickest covering of the brain and the skull * * He also testified that Wilson had a fractured skull and that his blood at his death contained 0.25 per cent alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">Appellant testified that two police officers, who had arrested him for the alleged offense, told him \u201cthat they knew that James Wilson was released from the hospital the same night I was supposed to have hit him and they also knew he was picked up for being drunk on the 6th of July.\u201d His testimony that the police told him Wilson was released from a hospital following the June 30 fight was not contradicted. Although the Government called one of the arresting officers, he was not asked about this; neither were any hospital records introduced. On the record in its present state the causal connection between appellant\u2019s blow and Wilson\u2019s death was attenuated. The Go' jrnment put on medical evidence that si.ch a time gap between a blow on the head and the victim\u2019s death from the blow is possible ; but it is also possible that some intervening event caused Wilson\u2019s death. If Wilson was, in fact, admitted to the hospital on June 30, examined, and released that night, this would'weaken the causal chain still further. It seems improbable that a man with a severe head injury with fatal potentialities would be treated so casually by a hospital. Hence, evidence of a hospital discharge, without some explanation of the reasons for discharge, would tend to exculpate appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">The Government\u2019s case is such, that under these peculiar facts, we think it appropriate to remand the case for a further hearing to explore appellant\u2019s allegation of the Government\u2019s knowledge of Wilson\u2019s hospitalization on June 30. If the police or prosecutor knew of evidence that appellant\u2019s blow might not have been the proximate cause of Wilson\u2019s death, there might be a due process issue under Brady v. State of Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). A just disposition of the case requires a fuller development of the events which transpired in the week between appellant\u2019s blow and Wilson\u2019s death, and the Government\u2019s knowledge of them. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106. The record is remanded for a further hearing and consideration of the case in the light of such information as is uncovered. If information which comes to light on this remand makes a new trial appropriate, the District Court should order a new trial. If the District Court concludes that a new trial is not needed, the record will be returned for our further consideration. At that time we can consider such issues of law as are presented by the full record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-7\">So ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1038-8\">BAZELON, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ABi\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-9\">I agree that the record should be remanded for an inquiry by the District Court. But I do not think the opinion of the court provides sufficient guidance to assure that an adequate record will be developed at this inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-10\">Appellant allegedly struck James Wilson, Jr.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the head with a wooden board on June 30, 1963. Wilson was found lying unconscious on the street one week later, and subsequently died from injuries apparently due to a fractured skull. Appellant testified that two police officers, who had arrested him for the alleged offense, told him \u201cthat they knew that James Wilson was released from the hospital the same night I was supposed to have hit him and they also knew he was picked up for being drunk on the 6th of July.\u201d He also testified that he saw Wilson on July 2, 3 and 4 with another man, Cooper, who had been involved in the June 30 fight. Appellant said he saw \u201cthree men run Cooper and Wilson down the alley * * * \u201d on July 4 and he then saw Cooper with \u201chis leg in a cast and his arm * * * broken\u201d on July 7 \u2014 the day after Wilson died of a fraetured skull. Cooper was not called as a witness at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>Appellant\u2019s testimony that the police told him Wilson was released from a hospital following the June 30 fight was not contradicted. Although the Government called one of the arresting officers, he was not asked about this.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Neither did the Government introduce the hospital records nor explain this omission. This leaves open a serious question whether the prosecutor or police knew, or had reason to know, of evidence that appellant\u2019s blow on June 30 might not have been the proximate cause of Wilson\u2019s death. If the police did have such information <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or if the prosecutor failed to bring it forward at trial, even believing in good faith that the information was unreliable or legally inadmissible,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> appellant\u2019s due process rights would have been violated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-4\">It is not clear from this record whether appellant\u2019s attorney knew before trial of appellant\u2019s allegation that the police had material exculpatory information. But even if the attorney did know of this allegation, we cannot presume- that he could successfully have obtained this information from the Government witnesses because of the virtual non-availability of pretrial criminal discovery in these circumstances. See Goldstein, <em>The State and the Accused: Balance of Advantage in Criminal Procedure, </em>69 Yale L.J. 1149, 1180-85 (1960); compare 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500. Moreover, the possibility that appellant might have developed this information without recourse to Government files or witnesses, by searching hospital records or by locating Wilson\u2019s alleged companion, Cooper, would not necessarily relieve the Government of its duty to disclose exculpatory information. Safeguards are required to ensure that a defendant is not disadvantaged by his indigency \u2014 and perhaps wrongfully convicted. Such measures as appointment of counsel, free transcript and appeal without prepayment of costs do not exhaust that responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-14\">\u201c \u2018The purpose of a trial is as much the acquittal of an innocent person as it is the conviction of a guilty one. The average accused usually does not have the manpower or resources available to the state in its investigation of the crime. Nor does he have access to all of the evidence, much of which has usually been removed or obliterated by the time he learns that he is to be tried for the crime.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-15\">Where, because of defendant\u2019s poverty, exculpatory information may be more readily available to the Government, it has a duty to bring that information forward or explain its failure to do so. Elementary justice requires no less.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>I think a just disposition, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106, requires that the case be remanded to the District Court with directions to conduct a hearing on whether the Government met its duty, as set out in this opinion, to protect appellant\u2019s rights.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1038-11\">.
