(REA) and various airlines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under each agreement the airline promised to carry, between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>specified points, cargo \u201cpresently moving in the services of [REA]\u201d to the extent the airline determined it had space available. The parties agreed that the airline should receive a fixed amount for each 100 pounds of cargo carried<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that REA would receive \u201cthe balance of the charges collected from the public.\u201d REA was to issue to the shipper its Uniform Express Receipt, on which it assumed responsibility to the shipper for the entire transportation, but the agreement provided that, as between themselves, each party would bear liability for damages occurring during its carriage of the shipment,</p>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">REA contended before the Board that the agreements were simply contracts between itself (a surface carrier subject to regulation by the Interstate Commerce Commission) and a specific air carrier for through service and joint rates, and that such contracts were clearly authorized under Section 1003 of the Federal Aviation Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Board concluded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>however, that the operations of REA under the proposed agreements would not be those of a joint carrier of through traffic, but rather that the agreements called for REA to undertake indirectly to engage in air transportation \u2014 an undertaking which requires Board authorization not presently held by REA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s conclusion was based on its finding that, as contemplated by the parties to each agreement, REA would be responsible to the shipper for the entire transportation and could charge the shipper a rate having no relation to the rate payable to the airline. The Board found, moreover, that REA would determine whether or not to ship any particular shipment by air and, if so and a choice of airline existed, REA could determine which airline to use. In short, the Board found that REA would be engaged in selling air transportation to the public. Since REA has no authority so to do, the agreements were held to violate the Federal Aviation Act and, hence, under Section 412, were not entitled to Board approval.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">\u201c(e) Orders of the joint boards shall be enforceable and reviewable as provided in this chapter with respect to orders of the Board.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">REA petitioned the Board for reconsideration and, in addition, requested that the Board refer the case to a joint board appointed under Section 1003 or, in the alternative, that the Board grant REA a hearing. The Board denied these requests and refused to reconsider its order. REA now petitions for review of the actions of the Board.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">The Federal Aviation Act permits engagement in air transportation, whether direct or indirect, only by persons who hold a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the Civil Aeronautics Board,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or who have been exempted from the provisions of the Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Board has defined an \u201cindirect air carrier\u201d as one who \u201cholds out to the public that it will undertake to transport property by air, and enters into contracts with shippers wherein it binds itself to discharge such an undertaking with respect to particular shipments.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In this case the Board found, upon substantial evidence, most of which was submitted by REA at the Board\u2019s invitation, that REA\u2019s operations under the proposed agreements would constitute indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>rect air carriage.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since REA is not authorized to carry on such operations, approval of the agreements was properly withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The case would end here were it not for REA\u2019s contention that in the situation presented here Section 1003 of the Federal Aviation Act overrides the requirement that indirect carriers be either certificated under Section 401 or exempted under Section 101(3). In essence, REA contends that when a surface carrier contracts with a direct air carrier and the contract calls for the surface carrier to operate as an indirect air carrier, the requirement for Board authorization differs from what it would be if no surface carrier were involved. This difference arises, according to REA, because of the provisions in Section 1003 which authorize air carriers to \u201cestablish reasonable through service and joint rates, fares, and charges with other common carriers\u201d and which provide procedures for regulation of the rates, charges, and practices of carriers operating under through service arrangements. Under REA\u2019s theory, all transportation in which the cargo is carried part way by surface carrier and part way by air must be regulated by a joint board convened according to Section 1003(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\"> Such a construction, however, is not consistent with the regulatory system ordained by Congress. Under the Federal Aviation Act, the Board is given exclusive authority and responsibility for the economic regulation of the air transportation industry, as therein defined. No one is permitted to engage in air transportation, either directly or indirectly, without Board authorization, either in the form of a certificate or, in the case of indirect carriers, possibly by exemption. Section 1003 is not designed to create an exception to the Board\u2019s responsibility in those cases where a surface carrier engages in operations which the Act includes in its definition of \u201cair transportation.\u201d That section merely provides a procedure for regulation of rates and practices in cases where an air carrier arranges with a surface carrier for through transportation service. When such an arrangement is made, and each participating carrier is operating within the proper scope of its authority, Section 1003 provides a method which may be invoked by either the Board or the Interstate Commerce Commission for regulating the participating carriers. But when, as in this case, an arrangement for through service calls for the surface carrier to perform operations which require permission from the Board, the surface carrier is not relieved of the necessity of obtaining such permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">Adoption of the statutory construction urged by REA would give Section 1003 an effect which could hardly have been intended by Congress. At present, the operation of assembling packages for air shipment is performed largely by concerns known as air freight forwarders.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These concerns are exten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>sively regulated by the Board.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the past REA has sought authority from the Board to operate as an air freight forwarder.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Board has refused such authority because it felt that the impact of REA\u2019s entry into the industry would have effects harmful to the public.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, it is now argued that Section 1003 permits REA to engage in operations which the Board has held to be not in the public interest. We cannot agree that Section 1003 has the effect of allowing REA\u2019s entry, without Board approval, into an industry expressly committed by Congress to the exclusive regulatory power of the Board<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">REA also contends that the Board erred in denying its request for a hearing. This request was made at the same time REA petitioned for reconsideration of the Board\u2019s order disapproving the agreements. The Board had previously invited REA to submit any relevant information. REA has done this, and it was on this information that the Board based its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">Section 412 contains no requirement for a hearing in contract approval proceedings. Nevertheless, REA contends that it is entitled to a hearing as a matter of due process.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But due process does not require that every administrative action be preceded by a hearing. The underlying facts of REA\u2019s operations under the proposed agreements were not disputed. The Board accepted as true the information submitted by REA. The only issues before the Board involved the legal consequences of those facts. Under such circumstances, a hearing is not required.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ANN\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-12\">.
