The bankruptcy court had summary jurisdiction of the parties and subject matter of the proceeding which gave rise to this appeal. The judgment of the District Court was premised on these conclusions, and in our view is free from error. It follows that the judgment is affirmed on the appeal and cross-appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
