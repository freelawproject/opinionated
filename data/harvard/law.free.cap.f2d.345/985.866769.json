The Board therefore provided that if the parties remained unable to agree on the \u201cconsist\u201d issue, special boards of adjustment should be convened, composed of one carrier and one union representative and one neutral member. The Board specified \u201cguidelines\u201d which the special boards should follow in resolving the consist dispute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the present case, the carrier and the Brotherhood Were unable to agree. A special board was convened which approved virtually all of the carrier\u2019s proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-17\">The Brotherhood then brought suit in the District Court, which affirmed the special board\u2019s award on its merits and dismissed the suit. On this appeal, the Brotherhood argues for reversal on the grounds (1) that the special board deprived it of procedural due process because, among other reasons, it was not given adequate time to prepare and the neutral member did not visit job sites as the Brotherhood requested; (2) that the special board failed to apply Board 282\u2019s guidelines as evidenced by the fact that the board approved, without opinion, every carrier proposal; (3) that the special board\u2019s award dealt in part with the number of baggagemen on crews which had not been included in Board 282\u2019s award; and (4) that the carrier did not adequately attempt to reach agreement with the Brotherhood before convening the special board, contrary to Board 282\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-18\">Board 282 is best able to decide these questions. For the most part, the Brotherhood argues that the special board\u2019s award was contrary to Board 282\u2019s instructions, and certainly Board 282 is more familiar with its instructions than we are. Furthermore, in arguing that it was deprived of procedural due process, the Brotherhood states that it was not given adequate time to prepare regarding the numerous and complex consist issues; the carrier responds that only a few basic issues were involved and thus the relatively short time was ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>quate. Board 282 has the familiarity with the crew consist issues necessary to resolve this argument. Moreover, the difficulties inherent in our review of the special board\u2019s award are compounded by the absence of any opinion accompanying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-4\"> Congress did not foresee that Board 282 would refer issues to special boards, and thus made no explicit provision for appeals from these boards. But Congress entrusted the work rules dispute to Board 282 for \u201ccomplete and final disposition.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Board\u2019s delegation of the crew consist issue to special boards should not mean that such boards, and in particular their single neutral members, could settle a dispute by compulsory arbitration without being subject to any meaningful review<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Unless a tribunal familiar with the work rules dispute interposes its judgment, with its reasons, between the special board\u2019s award and judicial review, no meaningful review will be available to an aggrieved party. Moreover, there are statutory limitations on the scope of our review<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and on our authority to prescribe flexible remedies.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These limitations need not bind Board 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-17\">The statute does provide that \u201cany difference arising as to the meaning, or the application of the provisions, of an award made by a board of arbitration shall be referred back for a ruling to the same board.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Board 282 has on numerous occasions reconvened to interpret its award.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And we read this provision to require that Board 282 retain review jurisdiction of the special boards of adjustment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, with one exception, the questions raised by the Brotherhood should have been presented to a reconvened Board 282 prior to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-18\"> One narrow aspect of this case is properly before us. The Brotherhood has previously submitted the following matter to the reconvened Board: \u201cSome carriers are refusing to review with our committees the assignments covered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>their notices * * *. Since the authority of the special boards is restricted to \u2018dispute limited to the application of guidelines to the issue involved,\u2019 are we correct in our understanding that the parties must attempt to agree upon the application of guidelines to the issues and that unless this attempt is made, no dispute is properly submissible to the special board ?\u201d On September 16,1964, the Board replied: \u201cUnder the terms of the Award it is expected that both parties will make an effort to resolve issues involving application of the guidelines. However * * * [our Award] does not limit the right of either party to invoke the review procedure.\u201d The Brotherhood now appears to argue that the Board\u2019s response was inconsistent with the statute. But we agree with the District Court that the response was not inconsistent. The Brotherhood further argues that the carrier, on the present facts, did not meet the Board\u2019s requirement to negotiate, as set out in its response. This is, however, a question for the Board\u2019s primary jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">This case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to dismiss the complaint without prejudice to such further application to Board 282 as any party may choose to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1062-11\">.
