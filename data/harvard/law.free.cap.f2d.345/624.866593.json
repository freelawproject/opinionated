Notices of tax lien were recorded in 1955 and January, 1958. Obligations of the taxpayer to the bank arose by virtue of various loans made commencing in March of 1958. The amounts here involved were deposited to the taxpayer\u2019s accounts prior to August 27, 1959. Notice of levy was served on the bank on August 27, 1959. At that time the taxpayer was indebted to the bank in the sum of $11,570.49. His bank accounts then amounted to $6,658.-31. The day following the Government levy, by bookkeeping entry, the bank credited the amount in the taxpayer\u2019s accounts against the taxpayer\u2019s indebtedness to the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">The District Court, in holding for the Government, ruled that this case is controlled by our decision in Bank of Nevada v. United States, 251 F.2d 820 (9th Cir. 1958), cert. denied, 356 U.S. 938, 78 S.Ct. 780, 2 L.Ed.2d 813 (1958). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">The bank seeks to distinguish this case upon the ground that in Bank of Nevada, supra, it was the levy itself which accelerated and rendered mature the obligation of the depositor to the bank, while here the obligation was mature at the time the deposit was made and at all times thereafter. The language and rationale of the Bank of Nevada case do not permit of such a distinction, 251 F. 2d 820, 827.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-17\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b701-11\">. Under Int.Rev.Code of 1954, \u00a7\u00a7 6331 (Levy and Distraint) and 6332 (Surrender of Property Subject to Levy).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b701-13\">. The opinion of this court on a prior appeal is reported at 317 F.2d 859 (9 Cir., (1963). The District Court\u2019s opinion on the remand from which this appeal is taken is reported at 229 F.Supp. 906 (S.D. Cal.1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
