S.C. \u00a7 78j(b) (1958), Section 15(c) (1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 49 Stat. 1377 (1936), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78o(c) (1) (1958), and Rules 10b-5, 10b-6 and 15cl-2 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5 (1949), 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-6 (Supp. 1963), 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.15el-2 (1949), the antifraud provisions; and Section 17 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 897 (1934), as amended, 15 U. S.C. \u00a7 78q(a) (1958), and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.17a-3 (1949, Supp. 1963), the record-keeping requirements. The Commission also found that the violations were \u201cserious and extensive\u201d and that in view of Batten\u2019s ownership and control of Mutual Funds of America, Inc., at the time of the violations,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the registrations of both Batten &amp; Co., Inc., and Mutual Fund's of America, Inc., should be revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-14\">The illegal activities of Batten &amp; Co., Inc., as found by the Commission were briefly these. On February 25,1960, Batten &amp; Co., Inc., as underwriter on a best-efforts basis, commenced a public offering of 106,875 shares of the stock of Saber Boats, Inc. (hereinafter Saber), at $2 per share; exemption from the federal registration requirements was claimed under Section 3(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 75 (1933), as amended, 68 Stat. 684 (1954), 15 U. S.C. \u00a7 77c(b) (1958), and Regulation A thereunder, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.220-224 (1949). On May 16, 1960, Saber and Batten &amp; Co. filed with the Commission a report stating that the offering had been completed on May 2, 1960. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Commission found, however, that Batten &amp; Co. had retained control over at least 10,000 shares reportedly sold publicly by recording them on Batten &amp; Co.\u2019s books as sold just prior to or on May 2 to certain of Batten\u2019s relatives, employees and friends, and by repurchasing shortly after May 2 most of these shares from the purported \u201ccustomers,\u201d a number of whom were unaware of and had not authorized any of the recorded transactions. The Commission thus found that because the terms and conditions of Regulation A had not been complied with, no exemption from regulation was available thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Subsequent to May 2, Batten &amp; Co., by use of the mails and interstate facilities, actively bid for, purchased, offered and sold to the public, at prices higher than the stated public offering price, Saber stock, \u201creacquired\u201d from the controlled accounts, thereby continuing beyond May 2 the public distribution of the offering and rendering \u201cincorrect and misleading\u201d the statement in the May 16 report that the offering was completed on May 2 and rendering \u201cuntrue and misleading\u201d statements in the Regulation A offering circular regarding the offering price and plan of distribution. From these findings the Commission concluded that Batten &amp; Co., aided and abetted by Batten individually, had willfully violated Sections 5 (a) and (c) of the Securities Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by offering and selling the Saber stock without either complying with the exemption requirements or filing a registration statement for a nonexempt public offering and sale, and by bidding for and purchasing Saber stock while engaged in a distribution thereof and by making false entries in its books and records had willfully violated Sections 10(b)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 17(a)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 10b-6 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 17a-3 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> thereunder. The Commission further found that Batten &amp; Co., under the complete control and supervision of Batten, in offering and selling the Saber stock had made unfounded predictions as to its future price and had led customers to believe incorrectly that the distribution had been completed; by these activities and the use of the false and misleading offering circular, the Commission concluded, Batten &amp; Co. and Batten individually had willfully violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Sections 10(b)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 15 (c) (l)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of the Securities Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and 15cl-2<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-16\">Our examination of the record in light of briefs and arguments satisfies us that appellants have not met their appellate burden of demonstrating that the findings and conclusions of the Commission are without substantial evidentiary support. The order of the Commission is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b160-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-12\">. During the revocation proceedings, Mutual Funds had moved to dismiss the charges against it because Batten had since divested himself of legal ownership of that company. The Commission denied the motion on two grounds: (1) because Batten had retained a substantial beneficial interest in commissions from Mutual Funds\u2019 operations; (2) because Mutual Funds had been Batten\u2019s alter ego and thus \u201chis willful violations * * * may be considered their willful violations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-5\">. 48 Stat. 77 (1933), as amended, 68 Stat. 684 (1954), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77e(a) and (c) (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b160-8\">. 48 Stat. 891 (1934), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b) (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b160-10\">. 48 Stat. 897 (1934), as amended, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78q(a) (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b160-12\">. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-6 (Supp.1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b160-13\">. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.17a-3 (1949, Supp. 1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b160-18\">. 48 Stat. 84 (1933), as amended, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a) (1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b160-20\">.
