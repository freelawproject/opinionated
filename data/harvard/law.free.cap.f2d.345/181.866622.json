St. Louis, S. F. &amp; T. Ry. Co. v. Railroad Yardmasters of America, 5 Cir., 328 F.2d 749, cert. den. 377 U.S. 980, 84 S.Ct. 1886, 12 L.Ed.2d 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">On August 5, 1964, the district court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the railroad from abolishing the yardmaster positions at Fort Worth, Texas, pending final determination by the National Railroad Adjustment Board. This appeal was taken by the railroad from the injunctive order, primarily on several jurisdictional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">While the appeal was under submission but was undecided, the National Railway Adjustment Board, on April 8, 1965, made its award sustaining the claim of the yardmasters.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The tribunal which had jurisdiction over the controversy has decided it. The decision of the Board was the event upon which the injunction was conditioned. The injunction is no longer operative and the appeal has become moot. Therefore, the appeal is</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
