' Each of the brothers, there-\u00bb fore, took an estate in fee-simple, disencumbered of the limitation, or an estate-tail,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> which, by virtue of th<em>e </em>act of <em>October, </em>1776, was converted into a fee-simple.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0j\">The case of <em>Porter </em>v. Bradley, <em>3 Term </em>Rep. 143. may be cited against me; but that case is mentioned and disapproved, 2 <em>Fearne, </em>206. and was not countenanced by this court in <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Burrow, </em>3 <em>Call, 349. </em>In <em>Roe v. Feffery, </em>7 <em>Term Rep. </em>589. an executory devise, s<em>o</em>me what similar to this, was allowed to be good, because the limitation over was not to the survivors and their heirs, (as in this case,) but to the survivors, who must have taken during their lives, or not at all. <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Scott and Smart, </em>2 <em>Fearne, </em>203. is a case in point, being as near to that now in question as ever a case cited was to the case in controversy.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-16\"><em>Hay, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7h\">This -i\u00bb a case upon the construction of a will; yet nothing has been said about the <em>intention </em>of the testator. But an attempt is made to bewilder the court with authorities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-17\">In <em>Anthony Sydnor's </em>will, a fee-simple is expressly de\u00bb vised to each of the sons; but, if either of them should die without heirs of his body, there is <em>then </em>a limitation over to the survivors and their heirs. This is manifestly a limitation to take effect in the compass of a life in being, because it is made to a survivor. Such is the construction of common sense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-18\">None of Mr. <em>Taylor's </em>cases have any application. The case of <em>Pells </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>Cro. <em>Jac. </em>590. is a great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>leading case, the authority of which has never been shaken, and is conclusive in my favour. It appears from that, and all the other <em>British </em>cases, that an express es\u00bf tate in fee-simple will not be contracted into a smaller estate, except for the purpose of effectuating the intention of the testator. la case of a limitation upon indefinite failure of issue; as in a devise to <em>A. </em>and his heirs, and <em>if he die </em>without heirs of his body, then to <em>B. </em>and his heirs; the devise to <em>A. </em>has been, decided to be an estate-tail, in order to effectuate the testator\u2019s intention because, otherwise, the devise to B. would be defeated. But where the limitation is to take effect within the compass of a life in being, there is no such necessity for narrowing down the fee-simple devised in the commencement of the clause; for the limitation over may well take effect by way of executory devise. Instead of which, a construction making it a fee-tail, would, in this country, defeat the intention by preventing the limitation over from taking effect at all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-4\">In <em>Porter </em>v. Bradley, 3 <em>Term Rep. </em>146. the case of <em>Pells </em>v. <em>Brown </em>is called ,the <em>magna charta </em>upon the subject of executory devises. If any case were wanting, <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Bradley </em>is decisive in our favour. There is indeed a <em>dictum </em>of Lord <em>Kenyon </em>in that case, which has been reprobated, and has since been unsaid by him, as far as he was able ; but the principle decided by the-court in that case has never been shaken. Mr. <em>Taylor </em>has endeavoured to distinguish <em>Roe </em>v. Jeffery, <em>7 Term Rep. </em>589. from the case at bar; but it is the same in substance. The question is, did the testator mean a definite or indefinite failure of issue ? He certainly meant a definite failure; because the devisee over was to take in character of survivor. The case in 2 <em>Fear</em>ne, 203. was only partly read by Mr. <em>Taylor. </em>The concluding part of the devise was, that \u201c if all the testator\u2019s sons should die without issue, then the estate was to go to his daughters', and their heirs and assigns for ever.\u201d This last limit\u00ae\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>tion was upon an indefinite failure of issue j for it was not to the daughters as survivors of the sons.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b286-4\"><em>Taylor, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0r\">1 admit the authorities I have cited have established a doctrine contrary to common sense, and the hardship of which the courts deplore; but still it is law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-5\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vuli.</em>\n</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b286-6\">\n<em>Tuesday, Nov. 12th.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><em> Walter </em>v. <em>Drew, Com.
