The defendant <em>Taylor </em>was a purchaser of some of those slaves at a sheriff\u2019s sale, by virtue of an execution against <em>Anthony Pate. </em>The sale was forbidden on the ground that the property belonged to <em>Stephen Pato </em>and <em>John </em>Pate, instead of <em>Anthony; </em>but there is no evidence in the record that <em>Taylor, </em>the purchaser, had notice of <em>Uriah. Stone\u2019s </em>claim at the time of his purchase. The late chancellor, on the 14.th of <em>September, </em>1803, upon his. view of the evidence in the 'cause, declared the bill of sale for the slaves, though absolute in form, to have been in fact a mortgage, and <em>u, </em>that this was known to <em>all </em>the defendants.\u201d He therefore decreed a restoration of the slaves in question held by each of them, an account of profits, &amp;c. A commissioner shaving reported the account, and no exception being taken to his report, the present chancellor confirmed it, and entered a final decree, frona which tfie defendant <em>Taylor </em>alone appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b334-13\">After argument, by <em>Call, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A_r\">and <em>Wick-ham, </em>for the appellee, the following opinion of .the court (consisting of Judges Brqqke, Cabell and Coalte$J was pronounced by Judge Brooke,</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AGV2\"><em>Saturday, June 22</em>d.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b335-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>The appellant claims as a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser of the slave in question at a sheriff\u2019s sale under an execution against <em>Anthony </em>Pate, one of the defendants. It does not appear, by any testimony in the cause, that he had, at the time of the sale, any notice of the equity existing between the complainant and <em>Anthony Pate, </em>if any did exist. The bill of sale from the complainant to the sons of <em>Anthony Pate </em>was absolute. The sale was forbidden on the ground that the property belonged to the sons, and not the father; but the appellant was apprized that the father was the real purchaser, and not the sons. The slaves were in <em>his </em>possession; and he was willing to incur the risk of there being any latent equity between <em>them. </em>If any had existed, he had notice, and must have lost the property. But, with respect to the equity of the complainant, founded on the alleged ground that the bill of sale was intended to operate as a mortgage, he had no notice until after the sale. The bill of sale was evidence to the contrary. In the case of <em>Hooe </em>&amp; <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Pierce\u2019s Administrator,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the doctrine seems to be set-tied that, in the cas\u00e9 of legal rights, the principle <em>caveat emptor </em>properly applies ; but equitable rights may be lost by a sale to a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser without notice. In the present case the complainant had parted with his legal right, and permitted his equitable claim to lie so long dormant, as, attended with other circumstances, to create considerable doubt whether it was not bottomed on a fraudulent combination to cheat the creditors of <em>Anthony Pate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The decree of the chancellor is to be reversed, and thp bill, dismissed as to the appellant Taylor.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"A2to\"> 1 <em>Wash. 217.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
