Poindexter </em>and <em>Jane </em>his wife, and <em>Patsy </em>Quarles, the three younger children \u00f3f <em>William Quarles, </em>deceased, against his executor, to recover the profits of certain slaves specifically bequeathed by the testator to the several plaintiffs, when t. -IN .. they should (respectively) attain the age of twenty-one , , . . , , , , years, or should marry. Annexed to each bequest was a provision that, \u201c if either, or all, of the above negroes should die before they should come into the legatee\u2019s possession, they should be replaced by others equally <em>1 J 1 J i J </em>valuable.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-22\">. . The testator also devised to the plaintiff <em>John, </em>and his heirs, certain lands, after his mother\u2019s death; to each of the plaintiffs a horse and saddle, and feather bed and furniture; and to the female plaintiffs <em>2Si. </em>each, when they should respectively attain the age of twenty-one years, or should marry. He directed, moreover, the sum of <em>SOl. </em>to be reserved out of his estate, and kept in the hands of his executor for the education of the plaintiffs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>After sundry devises and bequests to the widow , and elder children, the will concluded with directing an equal division of the residue, not disposed of, among all the children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-10\">The plaintiffs contended that, as the will appointed no particular fund for their maintenance during their minorities, their father\u2019s intention was that they should be maintained from the annual profits of the slaves bequeathed to them, and the interest accruing on their shares of the residuary fund; the said profits and interest being not more than sufficient to maintain them in a decent and comfortable manner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-11\">The defendant in his answer opposed the claim on the ground that considerable real and personal property was devised to the mother of the plaintiffs, and the respondent supposed the testator intended to make no other provision for their maintenance, as he well knew they would enjoy all the profits of that estate, of which no part would be received by the elder children, who were by a former wife. The respondent farther stated that the estate left the plaintiffs ought to have been sufficient to support them j that they had lived with their mother until the marriage of <em>Jane ; </em>and the other two still lived with her; that they had been at no expense for maintenance, nor had it been necessary for them even to apply the profits arising from their residuary proportion which they received at an earlier age than the elder children; .that at the time of the testator\u2019s making his will, the negroes devised to the plaintiffs were of as much or more value than those given to the other children, and at the time of their coming of age, or marrying, were, and will be, much more valuable than those received by the other children at their full age, or marriage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-12\">The answer concluded with admitting the amount of hire of the negroes left to the plaintiffs., up to the 25th day of December, 1803, to be 382l. 8s. <em>5d. </em>1-2. as would appear by an account thereunto annexed,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>The plaintiffs replied generally; and commissions to take depositions were awarded, but none were taken on either side. The cause was heard on the bill, answer, replication, and copy of the will; whereupon the county court decreed that the defendant pay tp the plaintiffs \u201c the annual profits of the negroes respectively devised to them by the testator, amounting to 382/. <em>8s. 3d. </em>1-2.\u201d and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-6\">The superior court of chancery having affirmed this decree, the defendant again appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b343-7\">Wickham, Tor the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhMe\">The plaintiffs were not entitled to intermediate profits on the slaves, possession, of which was not to be delivered them until a future day. They might have produced no profits, or might have been an expense to the estate. If such had been the case, could the executor have charged the expense against the legatee ? Would he not have been obliged to deliver the slaves free of charges ? If so, shall the legatee be entitled to profits, when he is not responsible for loss ? No case can be found of an allowance of inter-\u00bb mediate profits on a specific legacy of property to be de~ livered <em>in futuro.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b343-9\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8m\">This was a vested legacy to each of the plaintiffs ; and in all cases of vested legacies* the profits go to the legatee. The word \u201c when*\u2019 does not denote a condition precedent, but only marks the period when the legatee shall enjoy the benefit of the gift.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> In case of a devise of lands, it is now settled that the words \u201c when\u201d and \u201c then\u201d do not create a contingency.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-10\">But, \u201c in the case of a child, let a testator give a <em>legacy </em>how he will, either <em>at </em>21, or marriage, <em>or payable </em>at 21 or marriage, if the child has no Other provision, the court will give interest by way of maintenance.\u2019<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AN_i\">Mr. <em>Wickham </em>says there is no case of allowance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>profits on a specific legacy. But, in this country, there: is the same reason for allowing profits of slaves, as in England,, interest, on money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-12\">In <em>England </em>there was formerly a great controversy, whether profits were not to be allowed even upon contingent legacies. A distinction has been taken that, in such case, where there is a residuary clause, the profits shall go into the residuum. Here, there is a residuary clause; and, if the profits of the slaves go that way, there is no provision for maintenance, the 50/. being intended for education only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-13\">The decree, indeed, is defective ; for interest ought to have been allowed on the sum confessed by the answer.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b344-14\">Wickham, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXH\">The question whether this was a contingent or a vested legacy, is unimportant. If it was vested, I contend that no interest is allowed on a Vested legacy, payable when the legatee attains full age, or marries. It is \u201c <em>debitum in </em>prmsenti, <em>solvendum in futUro.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>I admit, where interest is necessary for the maintenance of a child, or there is nothing in the will showing a contrary intention, the court will allow it; but then, the necessity must be apparent; as where the child has no other provision. Education must be considered as part of maintenance; for, if we go to the root of words, education signifies bringing up. The testator\u2019s having partly provided, shows his intention to provide no more. Besides, the residuary estate may have been sufficient, the amount of which is not ascertained; it may be ten pounds, or It may be ten thousand.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-15\">As to interest on the profits, this is never allowed, no more than interest upon interest.(b)</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b345-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Thursday, <em>October </em>3d;</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"A2v\">\n<em> 3 Bro.
