The wife of <em>Ki- </em>\u2022 . r m i <em>ger, </em>though named as a party m the mortgage, taxied to sign it, and did not relinquish her right of dower. <em>Waite, </em>afterwards, bought, by parcels, at several times, the residue of the said tract, and thereupon, as a further security for the title, took a deed of trust, dated <em>September </em>28th, 7 7 <em>* </em>7 1803, andrecorded <em>December </em>i'th, by which thesaid <em>Kiger </em>conveyed <em>other real and personal property, </em>therein men- : ,r , _r , <em>r r r </em>\u201e tioned, to <em>Hugh Holmes, </em>as trustee, with power to sell such property for the purpose of repaying to <em>Waite </em>(in case the suit should be determined in favour of Gray-<em>son's </em>heirs) the several sum* of money he had paid, with <em>* J r </em>7 lawful interest from the respective times of payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AXYg\">The following clause was also inserted: \u201c Provided that such sale shall not be made, until the time and place of making thereof shall be previously advertised, &amp;c. and not more of said property shall be sold than suffix cient for the objects abovementioned; and if said property shall be insufficient, such deficiency shall be made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>up by a sale of the house and lot, mortgaged by the said <em>George Kiger </em>to the said <em>Obed </em>Waite, (on the 30th day of <em>July, </em>1802,) by proceeding to foreclosure of the equity of redemption, and making sale thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-9\">The whole tract was described in the said deed as containing, or as \u201c <em>supposed </em>to contain,\u201d <em>two hundred and thirty </em>acres, and nothing was suggested about a deficiency of quantity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-10\">After this, viz. on the 6th of <em>November, </em>1804, <em>George Kiger and Amelia his </em>wife, for and in consideration of the sum of six hundred dollars, conveyed the part aforesaid of lot No. 15. to <em>William Davison </em>and his heirs forever ; the deed to- whom was recorded, <em>together with a privy examination and acknowledgment of the said Amelia, May </em>5th, 1805. <em>Before this deed xuas executed, Davison had full notice of the contents of the mortgage and deed of trust. Waite, (also before that event,) </em>under a supposition that the part of the lot in <em>Winchester, </em>conveyed in the mortgage, would be sufficient for his indemnification, had permitted some of the personal property conveyed in the deed of trust to be sold, to satisfy other Creditors of <em>Kiger; </em>and himself had bought, and after-wards emancipated, a negro man, named <em>Nat, </em>who was one of the negroes mentioned in the said deed. But after the purchase of the same part of lot No. 15. by <em>Davison, (Kiger </em>having failed to pay to <em>Tidball, </em>administrator of <em>Grayson, </em>part of the money he owed him for the land, though <em>TidbalVs </em>power to make him a title was <em>established; </em>a deficiency being discovered in the quantity of the land, which proved to be only 203, instead of 230 acres ; and <em>Kiger </em>having become insolvent,) <em>Waite </em>proceeded to collecc the remaining slaves, and other personal property, conveyed by the deed of trust, and caused them to be sold by the trustee. The net proceeds of the sale (accounting to 343 dollars and 20 cents) being not sufficient to satisfy his claim, he instituted an action of ejectment, upon the mortgage, against <em>Davison, </em>and ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>tained judgment; whereupon the latter filed a bill in the superior court of chancery for <em>the.,Staunton </em>district, and obtained an injunction to stay proceedings until the matters in controversy should be heard and determined in equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-3\">The substance of the bill, answer and testimony is, for the most part, expressed in the following opinion, delivered by Chancellor Brown, the 16th of <em>April, </em>1808.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-4\">\u201c It cannot be denied that the mortgage and deed of trust, executed by <em>Kiger, </em>gave to <em>Waite </em>the <em>lien </em>which he now contends for. It is equally clear, from those words in the deeds of trust, \u201c <em>and if said property shall he insufficient, </em>such deficiency shall be made up by a sale of tbe house and lot mortgaged,\u201d &amp;c.\u2014and from the preceding words, \u201c <em>not more of said property shall be sold than sufficient </em>for the objects above mentioned,\u201d &amp;c. that it was the intention of the parties that the <em>trust </em>property should be applied to <em>relieve </em>the <em>mortgaged </em>property, though not absolutely to <em>discharge it. </em>But does it follow, as a necessary consequence, that <em>Kiger, </em>with the consent of <em>Waite, </em>might not dispose of any part of the property, included in the trust deed, for his own benefit j and that if he did, the <em>mortgage-lien </em>would be discharged, contrary to the express agreement and understanding of the parties?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-5\">\u201c The true state of the case appears to be this. When <em>Waite </em>took the mortgage, his purchases were inconsiderable ; and the mortgage was considered a sufficient security. After he had purchased the whole property, additional security was thought necessary, as part of the purchase-money had not been paid to <em>Tidball, </em>and the title to the whole land was still in controversy. But, after the dispute about the title was decided, and <em>Tid~ balds </em>right to sell and convey established, <em>Waite </em>(considering himself sufficiently protected by the mortgage against any claim for the purchase-money which <em>Kiger </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>might owe) was willing to permit <em>Kiger </em>to appropriate such parts of the trust property as he chose, to his owe use. Indeed, he might have considered it iniquitous, as it respected <em>Kiger\u2019s </em>other creditors, to insist upon his trust-lien, when his <em>mortgagerlien </em>was fully sufficient to indemnify him <em>\u00a1 </em>or to have compelled those creditors to resort to a court of equity to set aside the trust. It is manifest* that, acting under those impressions, some of the property of <em>Kiger, </em>included in the deed of trust, was sold to satisfy creditors. Negro <em>Nat </em>was purchased bjr <em>Waite </em>himself, with the consent of <em>Kiger, </em>and the money applied to the payment of <em>Kiger\u2019s </em>debts. Nor can it be material that no execution was actually levied on <em>Nat. </em>If one had been levied, it could not have been safely en-? forced without <em>Waite\u2019s </em>consent, or the aid of a court of equity. The purchase of this property, by <em>Waite </em>from <em>Kiger, </em>was an absolute discharge of <em>Waite\u2019s trust-lien </em>upon that property, and an implied consent, on the part of <em>Kiger, </em>that the <em>mortgage-lien, </em>if necessary, should stand charged with <em>Nat's </em>value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-3\">\u201c I have been considering the case as it would stand between <em>Waite </em>and <em>Kiger </em>himself. Let us now inquire how far <em>Davison </em>ought to be placed in a different situation from what <em>Kiger </em>would have stood in <em>?\u2014Davison\u2019s </em>purchase was made the 24th of <em>October, </em>1804. <em>Nat </em>was purchased by <em>Waite </em>in <em>June </em>preceding. <em>Davison </em>charges, in his bill, that he was deceived by <em>Waite\u2019s </em>concealment of facts, when consulted, at, or before, the time pf the purchase from <em>Kiger; </em>and that Waite* after his (Davison\u2019s) purchase, has misapplied the trust-property? which, with proper management, would have released the mortgaged property. If either of those charges were admitted, or <em>proved, </em>they would certainly entitle him to relief against <em>Waite. </em>But both are <em>denied; </em>and there is po proof to establish the charges. On the contrary, the <em>answer </em>is established, so far as relates to the management and- application of the trust property after the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>purchase, and after his interest in the application of it accrued. But it is said that the <em>records </em>of the mortgage and deed of trust proved that the trust property was to be first applied; and it may be contended that the <em>records </em>were evidence that no different arrangement had taken place between the <em>parties; </em>or that any subsequent or private arrangement would have been fraudulent. But this argument is not sound. And I think it has been already shown that the arrangement, between <em>Kiger </em>and Waite, respecting certain parts of the trust property, was both fair and honest. Besides, <em>Davison </em>himself cannot be supposed to have been governed solely by the information afforded by the records; for we find him bargaining with <em>Kiger, </em>not simply for the mortgaged premises, under a persuasion that all the trust property must be applied to its discharge, but also for part of the trust property 5 viz. <em>Smither\u2019s </em>lot. The truth appears to be this. The parties weredeceived as to the amount of the encumbrance. <em>Waite </em>swears that he was ignorant of it, and that he referred the plaintiff to <em>TidbalL Tidball </em>says the plaintiff applied : and, from his deposition, it appears that <em>he </em>was sot then capable of giving a correct statement of the amount due. The plaintiff knew of the encumbrances <em>1 </em>it was his duty to see how far the property was or might be boqnd by them. The defendant swears he never9 directly or indirectly, deceived him; that he always asserted his claim, though he was ignorant of its extent; that he informed the plaintiff, when the extent could be known; that he has released no part of the trust property since the defendant\u2019s interest occurred ; but has been zealous in securing and disposing of it in the best possible manner for the plaintiff\u2019s advantage; (and this part of the answer appears to be supported by the evidence.} Though a hard case on the plaintiff, this court can only relieve, and perpetuate the injunction, on his paying the plaintiff 418 dollars and 49 cents, <em>with interest, and the eas&amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number><em>of this court and the ejectment at law. </em>The mortgage ought'not to be continued to guard against claims which are not even suggested to exist; nor for the value of the girl <em>Beck,</em><footnotemark><em>(1)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which is a barely possible, but scarcely probable, claim. \u2022 The defendant may have redress for <em>her, </em>when injury appears.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-9\">For these reasons, it was adjudged, ordered, and decreed, \u201c that the plaintiff\u2019s injunction be dissolved, unless the plaintiff, on or before the 10th day of <em>July </em>next, pay to the defendant the sum of 418 dollars and 49 cents, the amount of the <em>lien </em>appearing to be due upon the mortgaged premises, and also such costs as the defendant has sustained in prosecuting his writ of ejectment at law; and the court, not yet being advised as to the amount of interest to which the defendant is entitled on the 418 dollars and 49 cents aforesaid, or whether to any, doth refer the cause to Master Commissioner <em>Bent, </em>to state and report an account of said interest, provided the parties cannot agree upon the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b552-10\">And afterwards, (viz. on the 1st of <em>August, </em>1808,) the plaintiff having been served with a copy of the decree, and failing to show cause to the contrary, the bill was dismissed with costs; whereupon an appeal was taken to the court of appeals.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b552-11\"><em>Thursday, December </em>19th, 1811,</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AxGx\">the following was pronounced as the opinion of this court.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b552-14\"> Note.. <em>Sack </em>was one of the negroes conveyed by the deed of trust, and, as <em>Kiger </em>pretended, was the property of one of his daughters (then an infant) by a previous gift fiom himself.

Because the appellant had procured the dower right of <em>Eiger\u2019s </em>wife, which had not been relinquished to the appellee, and who ought not to have been placed in a better situation than he stood under his mortgage; and the court, in letting the appellee into possession, or in directing a sale, ought to have guarded the appellant\u2019s right to the dower interest, which has now accrued, provided Mrs. <em>Eiger </em>has survived her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\u201c But the court also erred, as to the amount which was properly chargeable on the mortgage, as it respects the appellant, who claims as a purchaser under the mortgagor j that is to say, in allowing to the appellee the sum of two hundred and ninety-seven dollars on account of <em>deficiency in the quantity of land.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">\u201c The purchaser from the mortgagor will be bound for the amount intended to be secured by the mortgage, but not for other claims, of the mortgagee, on the mortgagor ; especially, if he has received no notice of such, claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">\u201c In this case, neither the mortgage, nor the deed of trust, gives notice of <em>this </em>claim, on account of a deficiency of the quantity of land; but as well the mortgage and deed of trust, as the communications between, the parties, had reference, first, to the inability of <em>Tidball </em>to convey, and, secondly, to the sum to be paid to him to procure the title, if he could convey. But as to a claim on <em>Eiger for a deficiency in the quantity of </em>land, the purchaser had no notice thereof. That sum of two hundred and ninety-seven dollars must therefore be taken from the sum of four hundred and eighteen dollars and forty-nine cents, decreed to be paid; which will leave one hundred and twenty-one dollars and forty-nine cents, to which, with the interest thereon, the mortgaged premises are to be subjected in the hands of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>\u00e9c Decree reversed with costs;' and suit remanded to be proceeded in to a final decree according to the principles of this decree.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
