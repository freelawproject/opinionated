The written instrument of submission, bearing date the 21st of August, 1787, and signed by both parties, recited that \u201c <em>Cuningham </em>was the purchaser of a tract of land in the county of Greenbrier, <em>which was warranted by Kincaid; </em>that the <em>title was evicted </em>in a court of judicature, <em>Cuningham being a party to the </em>suit, <em>and making the proper defence; </em>that he had called upon <em>Kincaid </em>in the county court of <em>Augusta </em>for compensation, and obtained a verdict, which the latter thought excessive; and that <em>Cuningham, </em>being unwilling to insist upon what might appear to <em>Kincaid </em>unrea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>r.oaable, bad submitted tlie matter to arbitrators to say what he should receive.\u201d <em>Cuningham </em>bound himself to release so much of said judgment as the arbitrators should award; and <em>Kincaid </em>bound himself to pay the balance. The <em>award </em>was, that <em>Kincaid </em>should pay to <em>Cuningham two hundred and fifty </em>pounds, by three instalments ; (.one of which was to be in certain property ;) that no execution should be levied until the last payment should become due j and that <em>Cuningham </em>should relinquish the residue of his judgment</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-3\">Being dissatisfied with this award, <em>Kincaid </em>refused to pay the instalments, and, on the 21st of <em>May, </em>1789, (shortly after the last had become due,) obtained an injunction from the county court of <em>Augusta </em>to stay proceedings on the judgment, as to 132/, 10$. part thereof; alleging, in his bill, that the arbitrators had awarded the payment of <em>2501. </em>upon the supposition that the said tract of land contained 400 acres; which opinion he was, at that,time, unable to controvert; having no testimony, or voucher, by which the real quantity could be ascertained; but that, in fact, there were only 188 acres. In this bill of injunction, <em>Kincaid </em>expressly admitted that \u201c <em>Cuningkanfs </em>title to the land, tinder the aforesaid hill of sale and endorsements, was, by the commissioners for settling the claims to lands on the western waters, previous to the establishing the commonwealth\u2019s land-office, determined to he a bad one, in consequence of which he lost the said land \u201d<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-4\"><em>Cuningham </em>answered the bill, denying any knowledge cr belief that the award was founded on the supposition of there being 4-00 acres of land in the tract; but expressing a belief that it <em>was </em>on the supposition that there <em>ought to have been that </em>quantity, <em>and his title thereto 'made good; </em>\u201c for, if the claim in its origin had been good, the aforesaid court of commissioners would have granted him the quantity of 400 acres of land, as that ivas the quantity allowed fcv lev to '\u00a1\u00a1vtioxi in <em>the. </em>mepivim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number><em>country.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The defendant did not remember that the complainant ever alleged any deficiency in the quantity 0f ianci} or ever attempted to prove or suggest any such matter before the said arbitrators; but that, even supposing there are only 188 acres in the survey, it includes tlle g'\u00b0\u00b0d or valuable land, and that the land adjoinjng5 to make 400 acres, is very indifferent, and could have very little weight with the arbitrators to make them increase the sum.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-6\">The affidavits of <em>David Stephenson, Joseph Bell, </em>and <em>James Bratton </em>(three or the arbitrators) were taken, from which it appeared that <em>they </em>were governed, principally, in their opinion of the value of the land, by the testimony of a certain <em>Benjamin Strother. David Stephenson </em>\u201c could not recollect whether that witness gave evidence as well to the <em>quantity </em>and <em>quality </em>of the land, as to the real value thereof taken as a tract.\u201d <em>Joseph Bell </em>states, that \u201c he <em>thinks Strother </em>was examined as well to the quantity in the survey made, as to what might have been made, had the claimer chose.\u201d <em>James Brat-ton </em>swears, that the award was made \u201c on the apprehension that the tract contained 400 acres.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-7\"><em>Benjamin Strother\u2019s </em>affidavit (also taken in support of the bill) states, that he valued the land at 250/. \u201c considering the survey as containing only <em>400 </em>acres.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-8\">A plat and certificate of survey, filed in the cause, showed the actual quantity to be 188 acres, according- to a survey made for the <em>Greenbrier Company, </em>in the year 1751.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-9\">The cause coining on to be heard, the court dissolved the injunction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-10\">\u201c The complainant thereupon showed to the court the original title bond, and contended that he had not stated his full equity, there being <em>no warranty </em>of the land iu the assignment, as erroneously stated in the submission; and that the court ought to consider that subject, (although not stated in the bill,) or, at least, permit him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>amend it by stating that the acknowledgment of a warranty in the submission was under the pressure of a judgment for 400/., and was lopping off his most material defence before the arbitrators, without consideration, and, therefore, could not be binding. The court were of opinion that they could not consider <em>that </em>equity, and refused an amendment of the bill.\u201d From which decree the plaintiff prayed an appeal, which was allowed, (though objected to by the defendant, on the ground that the decree was interlocutory only,) but docs not appear to have been prosecuted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-3\">He afterwards presented a new bill to the judge of the superior court of chancery holden at Staunton, and obtained a second injunction ; relying on the equity stated in the former bill, and on additional charges, that <em>Cnningham </em>had <em>artfully </em>stated in the submission lo\u2018 arbitration that <em>Kincaid </em>had <em>warranted the title; </em>(which was <em>not true;) that Cuningham </em>had been <em>legally emoted </em>in a court of law, <em>and had made the proper defence; </em>which was <em>questionable, </em>since he had never given the complainant <em>notice of the claim or trial, </em>and had neglected to have certain, witnesses summoned, by whom his right might have been established. The new bill expressed a firm <em>belief </em>that <em>Cuningham </em>had been guilty of fraud and collusion, in feebly defending the title; and further contended that Donnally, so far from colluding with the said <em>Cuningham, </em>to throw all the burden on the complainant, when he, Donnally, was equally bound himself, ought to have pursued the warrantor <em>Persinger. </em>The complainant also claimed certain credits for payments, but not to a large amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-4\">The answers of <em>Cuningham </em>and <em>Donnally </em>(both of whom were made defendants) pointedly denied all charges of fraud or <em>collusion; </em>and <em>Cuningham </em>particularly swore that no undue influence was exerted by him to induce <em>Kincaid </em>to agree to the submission, which was \u00edrecly and voluntarily done; that die words inserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>relative to the warranty, were plainly understood by the parties; \u201c that it was considered by this defendant that: the controversy was to be decided, <em>then, </em>in the same manner as if Persinger, the original obligor, was the party; this the defendant was further induced to do from, a knowledge of <em>Persinger\u2019s </em>situation, who was not able (as he supposed) to make compensationthat as to the defence of the title, the said defendant used every exertion in his power to get the land; that it was his wish to get it, and that he could then have sold it (if he had recovered it) for 400/. in property. He contended, moreover, that the circumstance that only 188 acres were surveyed in <em>1751, </em>could not avail the complainant, since <em>Persinger\u2019s </em>obligation (which was assigned) mentioned <em>no quantity, </em>and since the land law authorized 400 acres for a settlement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-5\">A number of depositions were taken on both sides, but need not here be stated, the general result being ex* pressed in the following opinions of the judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-6\">The Chancellor perpetuated the injunction as to SO/,. 19s. <em>9d. </em>paid by the plaintiff; but dissolved it, and dismissed the bill, as to the residue of the sum in controversy ; from which decree the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b26-7\">\n<em>Thursday, March 17.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A_T\">The judges pronounced their opinions.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"Ab\"> 1 <em>Call, </em>546.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"ALD\"> 2 <em>H. &amp; M. </em>139.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"AR\"> <em>4 H &amp; M. </em>180.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(d)\">\n<p id=\"Ah\"><em> 1 Wash. </em>14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"(e)\">\n<p id=\"Av\"><em> </em>Ibid. 158.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-6\" label=\"(f)\">\n<p id=\"Ay\"> 1 <em>H. &amp; M. </em>67.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-7\" label=\"(g)\">\n<p id=\"Az\"><em> 2 H. &amp; M. </em>408.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-8\" label=\"(h)\">\n<p id=\"A_\"> 4 <em>H. &amp; M. 356.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-9\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b22-9\"> See <em>Co.

Settlement rig' ts to lands in the western country, at the time the contract in question was made, were of little value, owing to the situation of the country, and, perhaps, also to the uncertainty whether the legislature would confirm them ; especially those that interfered with the previous claim of the <em>Greenbrier Company. </em>On tire ground of <em>hardship </em>alone, I see nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>hi the case that would authorize a court of chancery to interpose j though enough to induce that court to look with a critical eye for any other ground on which to grant relief. I have, therefore, with great attention, at least, examined the record, and feel some regret that I have not been able to discover any thing in the case to sustain any of the other objections of the counsel for the appellant. I can perceive nothing in the evidence that can authorize me to disturb the judgment of the land commissioners. The allegation that the appellee made a <em>ao'\u00f1nous </em>defence before them is not, in my opinion, sup\u00bb ported by the testimony; nor do I feel myself at liberty to revise the judgment at law upon the title bond (as it is called) in behalf of Donnally, the assignee of the appellant, for the benefit of the appellee. I think it more \u00a1man probable that the appellant intended to bind him,clf to Donnally, by the assignment of that bond, to warrant the title; and though, in strictness of law, he may not have executed a proper instrument for that purpose, yet no error that might have been corrected in that court can propex-ly be relieved against in a court of equity <em>; </em>especially one which consisted in conforming the judgment of the court to the intention of the parties, instead of defeating that intention by a rigid adherence to the strict rales of law. On this point I refer to the case of <em>Syme </em>v. Montague, in this court.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">Upon the last objection \u00cd have had less difficult)-. There is no evidence that the appellee practised upon the fears of the appellant, by holding the judgment at law over him, to constrain him to enter into the submission to arbitrators and the words in that instrument. that <em>Guningham </em>had made a proper defence before the commissioners,\u201d might have been inserted by the counsel who drew it, from excess of caution, or (what k more probable, as has been insisted on) to exclude from the arbitrators all other matter of controversy except the value of the'land. \u2019Whether that value was ascertained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>upon correct <em>data, </em>cannot now be questioned, unless mis\u00bb behaviour in the arbitrators, or some one of them, were proved, or a palpable mistake in the amount, and not in the manner of making up the award, were shown. The case of <em>Taylor\u2019s Adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Nicholson,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the case of <em>Morris </em>&amp; <em>Overton </em>v. <em>Ross,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>are authorities to that effect. The depositions of the arbitrators in the present case differ somewhat as to the ground on which the award was made; but nothing can be collected from them that will authorize either a court of law or equity to set aside the award, according to the principles established by the foregoing cases, and many others decided in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">I am, therefore, of opinion, that the decree dismissing the appellant\u2019s bill be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b28-11\">Judge Tucker..</author>\n<p id=\"AC0\">I feel every disposition (were it possible) to relieve the appellant from the effects of the original judgment against him, which is contrary to every principle of common law. But as, instead of prosecuting his appeal, he submitted his case to arbitrators, against whom no charge of partiality or misbehaviour is even surmised, and who, from length of time, appear to have, in some measure, forgotten, and certainly do not agree in their opinions as to the grounds upon which they went in making their award, I think there is not sufficient evidence of <em>mistake </em>(in respect to the quantity of land in the tract which they were called upon to value) to set aside their award, or to reduce the amount thereof in proportion to the supposed mistake. I am, therefore, (though very reluctantly,) of opinion, that the decree ought to be affirmed. I concur with the judge who has preceded me on the other points.- This case, in principle, bears so near an analogy to that of <em>Scott's Ex'rs </em>v. Trents, <em>Crump &amp; Bates,</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that I beg leave to refer to it for my teasons more fully on this subject.<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"A74\">judge Roane\u00bb</author>\n<p id=\"ACa\">For the reasons assigned by the fudgec <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>who have gone before me, I concur in ooinion that the Jccree be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b29-7\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqq\">This is, no doubt, a hard case on the part of the appellant; but it seems to have arisen, rather from his own incaution and folly, than from any misconduct or unfair dealing on the part of his opponents; and it appears, indeed, that <em>Cuningham </em>acted with candour and generosity, particularly before the arbitrators. The loudest clamour of the appellant against him is, that he lost the land before the court of commissioners by his own neglect, and the suggestion of a <em>covin </em>between him and <em>M\u00edClcnahan, </em>who claimed under Fulton, who recovered it in the commissioners\u2019 court. Besides that there is no evidence of such conduct, it is expressly denied by Cuningham, in his answer; and it is not to he presumed that he would make a feeble defence of the title, with a view of getting compensation from Kincaid, who is represented as a verv poor man. As to the deficiency in the quantity of land, supposed to have been 400 acres, which occasioned the high damages assessed by the jury, it may be sufficient to observe, that though there might not he more than 188 acres actually surveyed, whoever established a settlement right was not only entitled to 400 acres for the settlement, but also to a pre-emption of 1,000 acres, if there were so much unappropriated land adjoining.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> But, however all this may be, the appellant is bound and con-eluded by the award of the arbitrators, judges of his own choosing, who appear to have acted with great can-dour and circumspection ; and who, it is presumed, from some equitable circumstances that appeared in favour of the appellant, reduced the judgment at law more than one third of its amount, and made the terms of payment of the balance easy, by dividing it into throe instalments, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>orie of which was to be paid in property, at a reasonable , value.</p>\n<p id=\"A1\">On these grounds, I concur in opinion that the decree be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b27-11\"><em> </em>4 H. &amp; M. 180.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"Ap\">1 <em>H. &amp; M. 67.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"Azq\"><em> 2 H. &amp; M. </em>408.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b28-12\">4 <em>H. &amp; M. </em>356.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(d)\">\n<p id=\"AqO\"> See also, 3 Atk. 644. <em>Amb. </em>245. 1 <em>Ves. </em>370. <em>1 Wash. 14. 158.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"Ap6\"> <em>Ch.
