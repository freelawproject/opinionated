came on to be heard yesterday, and this day ; and, thereupon, the arguments of the counsel for the claimants, and of the attorney-general for the commonwealth, having been fully heard and considered, it is the opinion of the court, and accordingly decreed and ordered, that all surveys made by a county surveyor, or his deputy, properly qualified according to law, previous to the year 1776, and certified to have been made by virtue of the orders of council to the <em>Loyal </em>and <em>Greenbrier Companies, </em>or cither of them, ought to be confirmed; and that the register be directed to issue patents upon all such surveys as shall be returned and so certified.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-9\">The statement, made in each bill, was, in substance, that by the rules and regulations of the said company, settlers were enabled to acquire titles to the lands seated by them, on paying the surveyor\u2019s fees, and three pounds lor every hundred acres' contained in their surveys ; that she defendants, and those under whom they claimed, Though settlers, and holding by surveys.) had not paid the surveyor\u2019s ices, or any part of the purchase-money; / that <em>Thomas Walker, </em>one of the members of the company, and the person to whose management their affairs were intrusted, appointed one <em>William Inglis </em>an agent in that part of the country where those lands lay, and gave public notice, that those persons who had procured lands to be surveyed should be confirmed in their titles on paying, the surveyor\u2019s fees and purchase-money within a limited time ; that in the year 1768, the said <em>Walker </em>authorized <em>Inglis </em>to sell the lands, on which the survey- or\u2019s fees had not been paid, to such persons as would discharge them, and agree to pay the original price so soon as the company could make them a complete <em>title} </em>that <em>in September, </em>1768, <em>Joseph Scott </em>and <em>Stephen Trigg </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>paid to <em>William Inglis </em>the surveyor\u2019s fees oh the lands in question, and obtained a receipt for the same <em>;

and that grants should issue to them, on their paying the surveyor\u2019s fees and purchase-money to the company, on or before the 23d day of February, 1782; otherwise, the titles should revert to the said <em>Loyal Com.pany; </em>that the defendants had never complied with the terms on which their titles were declared valid by the commissioners ; and, if they had done so, the complainant did not admit that the decision of the said commissioners would have any authority in this case j that, in-order to defeat his claim\u00bb the defendants had destroyed the ancient landmarks, so that the boundaries could not he ascertained, and had surreptitiously and fraudulently obtained grants of prior dates to those of the complainant. He therefore prayed a discovery of the situation of the original landmarks called for in the surveys, possession of the lands, account of the profits, and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-3\">The defendants relied on the decisions of the land-commissioners an conclusive in their favour j averring that, within the limited time, they had, respectively, tendered the fees and purchase-money to <em>Thomas Walker, </em>who refused to receive them, in consequence of the pendency of the controversy between the commonwealth and the company, which, being at that time undecided, prevented his making titles; and denying the charges of fraud, they prayed to be dismissed. The judgments cf the commissioners, bearing date the 23d of <em>Angus' </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>1781, were, that Keewood, <em>Hoofacre </em>and <em>Smith, </em>respectively, were entitled to the lands in question j \u201c provided that they do pay or cause to be paid to the said agent, or the said company, the sum of five pounds specie, with interest thereon from the 22d day of February, 1762, till paid, for each hundred acres contained in the surveys, on condition that the said agent, or the said eompany, do make good titles in fee-simple to the said lands; or that, if the defendants shall pay the survey- or\u2019s fees in specie, with interest thereon from the 22d day of February, 1762, till paid, and also all other fees incident and necessary for obtaining grants for the said lands, then the defendants were to pay the sum of three pounds specie for each hundred acres, with interest from the said 22d of <em>February, </em>1762 :\u25a0 and if the defendants should fail to pay the said purchase-money, and interest, on or before the 23d day of February, 1782, then the said tracts of land should revert, and become vested in the said company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-9\">The tenders and refusals charged in the answers were fully proved by depositions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-10\">The chancellor was of opinion, \u201c that, though the right to the lands in controversy was in the <em>Loyal Company, </em>provided the surveys under their authority were such as would have tjeen established under the decision or order of the court of appeals of the 2d of <em>May, </em>1783, yet, it was but a qualified right, which the company was bound to confer on the first actual settler on certain conditions <em>; no </em>sale, or reservation, having been made previous to settlement; and the commissioners who had competent jurisdiction to decide upon settlers\u2019 claims having decided, in favour of the defendants, as the first actual settlers ; (which decision remains unreversed <em>;) </em>and, the defendants having tendered the money in con~ formity with their sentence, the <em>Loyal Company </em>were bound to convey to them the lands, and were not at If<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>berty otherwise to dispose of them.\u201d He therefore decreed that the defendant should pay the complainants the purchase-money and surveyor\u2019s fees, with lawful interest thereon, from the 23d day of February, 1762, to the 22d of February, 1782 ; and that, as to other matters, the bills be dismissed with costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b165-3\">Williams, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8O\">The commissioners had no jurisdiction to decide in a case of this description.

It was evidently, moreover, the intention of the legislature to vest in the court of appeals alone the power of deciding the rights of the company.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> After the court of appeals should have settled the controversy between the company and the commonwealth, the commissioners were empowered to take up the subject of claims under the company\u2019s authority; but not until then.

The court of appeals were only to decide between the commonwealth and the company. The commissioners were not to wait to see whether the company would carry the question before the court of appeals; but patents were to issue imme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>diately, as they should adjudge. The law as to lands of this very description was settled by the act <em>of </em>October, 1783; c. 29.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The case of <em>Stephens </em>v.

Upon a strict examination of the act of 1779, entitled \u201c An act for adjusting and settling*the titles of claimers to unpatented lands under the present and former government previous to the establishment of the commonwealth\u2019s land-office,\u201d and the subsequent acts on the same subject, I am satisfied, that there is no distinction between vacant, and <em>company </em>lands, that can have any influence on the decision of these <em>cases; </em>and that the appellant, having submitted his claims to the commissioners under the act of 1779, first mentioned, is bound by their decision, according to the case in this court, q| <em>Stephens </em>v. Cobun, 2 Call, 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>The objection, that the appellant has not been allowed \u00bfs much interest as he is entitled to on the money paid to the <em>Loyal </em>Company, 1 think also unfounded. After the payment by the appellant, the company had no claim apon the appellees, nor would the appellant, at any time, have received the money, though tendered to him by the appellees, previous to the chancellor\u2019s decrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">I am therefore of opinion that the decrees, by which the hills are dismissed, be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b167-5\">Judge Tucker.</author>\n<p id=\"AQu\">These cases (which all depend upon the same question) appear to me to fall completely within the provisions of the act of <em>May, </em>1779, c. 12. s. <em>7, </em>8, and <em>9.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The former of these sections regulates the manner in which settlements made by certain persons, upon lands surveyed for <em>sundry </em>companies, (of which, the <em>Loyal Company </em>was one,) by virtue of orders of council, without specific agreement, but yet under the faith of the terms of sale offered by such' companies, should be adjusted, and the title of settlers confirmed, and patents from the land-office of the commonwealth, obtained by such settlers, for the lands to which they were thus entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">It must here be remembered that the companies here spoken of had never obtained patents for the lands intended to be granted to them, so that their title, as well as that of the settlers, was inchoate only; the legal title being still in the commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Sect. 8th establishes a court of commissioners for the adjustment of the preceding claims, (and some others,) whose judgment is declared final; and has been accordingly so decided in the case of <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>Cobun; </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that is, no appeal or writ of error could be brought to reverse their, judgment. But any person, thinking himself aggrieved thereby, might sue out a <em>caveat, </em>from the general court, upon which the claims of .'\u25a0he <em>caveator </em>and <em>cave&amp;tee </em>might be reconsidered, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>a patent was to be granted to the party prevailing in the <em>caveat. </em>But if this were neglected until a patent should be actually obtained by the person in,whose favour the commissioners should decide, I presume it was afterwards too late to sue out a <em>caveat; </em>the object of which is not to repeal a patent, but to prevent the emanation of one.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> And, even if the party thinking him- <em>. y </em>/ . , \u2022 self aggrieved had such an equity as would, on a <em>caveat </em>prior to the grant, have entitled him to a preference, it would be no ground for a bill in equity to set aside the patent, unless he was prevented by fraud, or accident, from prosecuting a <em>caveat.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Here, then, had Mr. <em>Ross </em>r o his remedy, if he conceived himself aggrieved by the iudgment of the commissioners. But he has totally neg- */ w lected it, and shown no cause whatever .for such neglect, and, consequently, is hound by their judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"A0o\">On the ground of error in respect to interest, I concur with the judge who has preceded me, upon that point, as well as that in which I have spoken to <em>; </em>and am therefore of opinion, that the decrees be severally affirmed ; the appellees, as far as in them lay, having complied with the terms on which they were to obtain their patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-16\">Judges Roane and Fleming were of the same opb nion, and the decrees were unanimously affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b167-12\">\n<em> Ch.
