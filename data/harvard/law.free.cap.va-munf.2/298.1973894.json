Ltttlepage, </em>and an agreement by the defendant to sell them, at par, upon a credit of twelve months, with interest thereon from the date; the complainant executing\u2019 a bon\u00bf therefor, together with <em>Macon Green </em>(who was \u00a3^ien no\u00a3 Present) as his surety; that, it being unknown to the complainant whether he could procure that person . as a surety, it was stipulated that he should then sign a bond, with a blank therein for the said surety; and that, ille same was no\u00a3 given, the contract was to be void; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>but if the said security was given on or before the then ensuing <em>Hanover </em>court, (at which time and place the said bond was to be produced for that purpose,) then the defendant was to assign and deliver to the complainant the said escape-warrants, and thereby the said contract to take <em>effect; </em>that <em>Macon Green </em>refused to be the surety, whereby the contract became void ; that the complainant endeavoured to get such other security as he supposed might be unexceptionable, but could not; that, hearing no more from the defendant until after the bond had become due, and considering the contract as absolutely void, he proceeded to supply himself with other claims against <em>Littlepage </em>to the amount he wanted; that nevertheless, when he afterwards saw the defendant, (for the first time since the contract,) the latter, to his astonishment, affected to consider it as absolute and obligatory, although more than twelve months had then elapsed since it was made, and no application had been made to the complainant concerning it, other than through an agent, (as he believed,) at the <em>Hanover </em>court, when the surety was to have been given as aforesaid, and at which time the said agent was informed of <em>Macon Green's </em>refusal to become bound in the bond. Against this unreasonable conduct the complainant remonstrated, because it was well known to the said <em>Gaines </em>\u201c that he had not vested any, the least, shadow of a right in the complainant to the said escapes, and that no value whatsoever had been received by the complainant for the said bond; and, moreover, that he had been obliged to supply himself elsewhere but the defendant persisted in urging his claim to the money, and threatened a suit, \u201c upon which the complainant replied, that, if such was the determination of the said defendant, (which he conceived to be unjust,) he demanded a delivery and assignment of the said escape-warrants j\u201d which the defendant positively refused, and thereupon commenced his action at law, and obtained judgment on the bond; \u201cstill withholding from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>complainant the said escape-warrants, with an assignment' of the same, which alone could enable liim to take measures for his indemnification.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-9\">The defendant, by his answer, admitted the agreement Stated in the hill, but denied its being conditional, or that lie ever restricted the complainant to <em>Macon Green, </em>or refused to receive any other, good and sufficient man as security; alleging that \u201clie merely observed that, as he Was not very well acquainted with the generality of the people in Hanover, he would take the said <em>Macon Green, </em>whom they both knew; but never had an idea of making the validity of the bargain to depend on the willingness qf the said <em>Green </em>to sign the bond, or not,\u201d He proceeded fo pray that <em>Humphrey Brooke's </em>affidavit, corroborating the above statement, might be received as part of this answer, stating that he had acted by <em>his </em>advice, as attorney at law, \u201c and as one interested in the estate of <em>Robert Pag\u2019e, </em>deceased;\u201d \u201c that lie put the bond into bis hands for the purpose of getting the blanks filled, either by the said <em>Green, </em>or by some other person whom be might approve of as security, but that his said attorney had always informed him that his applications to the complainant had ever been evaded by some excuse or other,\u201d The respondent \u201c conceiving that he had fully answered the most material'allegations contained in the complainant\u2019s bill, and denying all fraud, &amp;c.' prayed to be hence dismissed,\u201d fkp.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-10\">No depositions were taken on either side, but that of <em>II.

It was either a bargain or no bargain. If it was no bargain, <em>Gaines </em>had no right to sue on the bond ; if it was a bargain, he was bound to assign the warrants.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b321-14\">Saturday, <em>June </em>1st.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-4\">The president delivered the following as his opinion, and that of the court:</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"AN-v\"> Note. This appears to be a proper modification of the rule laid down by the chancellor, in <em>Dangerfield </em>v. <em>Claiborne, </em>2 <em>H. &amp; M. </em>17. it being resp. sonable that in a case where the <em>onus probandi </em>lies on the <em>defendant, </em>he should not delay the plaintiff by an omission in his answer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b321-15\">The only evidence in the cause, except the answer, is the deposition of <em>Humphrey Brooke, </em>who, the appellant acknowledges, is an interested witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-16\">The appellee, however, had no cause to complain that the appellant would consummate the contract, upon his simple bond, without security; and had the latter tendered, within a reasonable time, and before the commencement of the suit, the escape-warrants against <em>IJt</em>tlepagc, with proper endorsements thereon, the contract, I conceive, would have been binding on the parties : but <em>Winston </em>expressly charges in his bill that \u201c the defendant had not vested any, the least, shadow of right in the complainant, to the said escapes ; and no value whatever had been received by him for the said bond;\u201d and, further, \u201c that when the appellant threatened him with a suit on his bond, he demanded a delivery of the said escape-warrants ; but which he positively refused; and still withholds from him the said escape-warrants, with an assignment of the same.\u201d To this very important charge in the bill, the defendant made no answer, but contented himself with saying \u201c that he has fully answered the most material allegations contained in the complainant\u2019s bill.\u201d But, in my conception, <em>\u201c </em>that he refused to deliver the escape-warrants, properly endorsed, when demanded,\u201d was the most material allegation in the bill; and the main hinge on which the merits of the cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>principally turned. And the defendant\u2019s having failed to answer it, was, in my apprehension, a tacit acknowledgment that the charge was true.</p>\n<p id=\"AcA\">Mr. <em>Brooke, </em>in his deposition, says, \u201c with respect to the escape-warrants, the deponent is of opinion that the said <em>Winston </em>might have procured them, and that he still may, upon making proper application.\u201d What were the grounds of <em>Brooke\u2019s </em>opinion, respecting those warrants, or what he might think would be making \u201c proper application,\u201d seems immaterial to be considered at this day; I am, upon the whole, clearly of opinion that the decree is correct, and ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The decree is affirmed by the unanimous opinion of the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
