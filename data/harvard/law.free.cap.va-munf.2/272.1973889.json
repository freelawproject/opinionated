Judgment was entered accordingly, to which a <em>supersedeas </em>was awarded by a judge of this c.ourt.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ArL\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4J\">made three points j\" 1. That money paid on a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction,afterwards reversed, cannot be recovered in <em>assumpsit, </em>the proper remedy being by writ of restitution, or <em>by </em>motion to the court.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> <em>Assumpsit lies,</em>indeed, for money paid under the sentence of a court which has no jurisdiction.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> But the case is otherwise where the authority is not void <em>ab initio, </em>though it may be afterwards vacated, <footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> And even if a special action- ' <em>' </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>of <em>assumpsit </em>could be supported, a <em>general indebitatus </em>could not.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-3\">2. The evidence demurred to was defective in this, that a <em>full </em>copy of the record of the original judgment and proceedings was not exhibited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-4\">3. It did not appear from the evidence, that the sheiff had overpaid the sum levied by him to the plaintiff. There was evidence enough to sue the sheriff, but not the plaintiff.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-6\"><em>Wirt, </em>on the other side,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgT\">contended that the decision in <em>Overton and Wife </em>v. Hudson, does not touch the present case. The reason given by the court<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> proves this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-7\">In support of the action, he cited 1 <em>Esp. N. P. </em>6. and <em>Feltham </em>v. <em>Tyrrel, Loft, </em>207. there referred to, as well as in <em>Bull. N. P. 131. </em>in <em>Cowp. </em>419. and in 1 <em>T. R. </em>387. <em>Moses </em>v. <em>M\u2019Ferlan, </em>2 <em>Burr. </em>1005. is the leading case establishing the principle that wherever the defendant has money in his hands, which, <em>ex mquo et bono, </em>he ought to refund, the general action for money had and received properly lies. The principle of that case exactly applies to this. The objection of surprise, the court will find, would equally apply to every case (founded on the same principle) that has occurred since.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> The action for money had and received is an equitable action, and the defendant may avail himself of every equitable defence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-8\">The writ of restitution lies, in <em>England, </em>after final judgment, on a writ of error; and sometimes, during the pendency of a <em>supersedeas, </em>the court will, on motion, order the sheriff, where the money is still in his hands, to pay it into court. But, in the case at bar, though it is not expressly proved that the sheriff had paid the plaintiff the money before this action was brought, there is reason to presume it.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> The remedy by motion could not, then, have succeeded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ayu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Our act of assembly says the appellate court shall, on a supersedeas, enter suph judgment as the court below should have given. This .does not empower it to award a writ of restitution; and there is no decision of the courts in this country authorizing such writ. But, at any rate, the defendant has no cause to complain that we relinquished a more summary remedy, and resorted to one which gave him a better opportunity of exhibiting any equitable defence which he might have.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-8\">As to the 2d point made by Mr. Wickham, I can see no necessity for producing the full record of the judgment. If the evidence was not proper, the objection goes to its competency, and not to its sufficiency. The defendant should, therefore, have excepted, instead of demurring. - The demurrant, has admitted the fact of the reversal of the judgment; by doing which, he admits every thing that was necessary to make it appear.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcS\">3. The action for money-had arid received will lie without proof of actual receipt of money. The case of <em>Israel </em>v. <em>Douglas, 1 H. Bl. </em>239. proves that it will lie on an accepted order. <em>Longchamp </em>v. <em>Kenny, Doug. </em>137. and <em>Leery </em>v. Goodson, 4 T. <em>R. </em>687. also show that, under circumstances, the receipt of the money may be presumed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APp\">But I contend, that payment to the <em>sheriff </em>is equivalent to payment to the <em>plaintiff,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the sheriff being, in effect, his agent, upon the writ <em>offieri facias.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ANV\">Wickham, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYrL\">The <em>dictum </em>in <em>Esp. 6. </em>\u201c that if money has been recovered in consequence of any judgment,\u201d &amp;c.- is not supported by authority. The- case of <em>Moses </em>v. <em>M'Ferlan </em>was of a judgment of an inferior court having no jurisdiction, and comes within the rule I have laid. down. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> <em>Espinasse </em>has clearly mistaken the law, or has. used an inaccurate expression.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>The doctrine <em>of\u201c ex cequo et bonof </em>in the latitude contended for, would lead to this; that in every case, by a side wind, the merits of a former cause might be tried over again. The defendant in the second action, who was plaintiff in the first, would have a right to say, \u201c it is true that my judgment was reversed for error in form; but, <em>ex cequo et </em>bono, I ought to keep the money levied on the execution, because it is a just debt.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-4\">As to the writ of restitution, I admit there is no decision of the courts of this country upon the subject \u00bf but neither has there been any decision that the action of <em>assumpsit </em>lies in such a case as this. We must, therefore, resort to principles and to <em>British </em>authorities.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-5\">2. The evidence is defective in not showing the whole Kecord of the reversing judgment as well as of that which was reversed. And this objection may well be taken by demurrer; for insufficiency is necessarily included in incompetency.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>3: There are no circumstances in this case to induce a presumption that the money was paid to the plaintiff. The contrary should rather be presumed, because it might have been stayed in the sheriff\u2019s hands by the very <em>supersedeas </em>upon which the judgment was reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b296-9\">The sheriff is not the plaintiff\u2019s agent, but an officer of the court; and by its order he might have been compelled to returh the money. In England, upon a <em>ca. sa. </em>the sheriff has no right to receive the money, unless with the assent of the plaintiff; (though the law is otherwise under <em>our </em>act of assembly;) because the writ commands him to take the <em>body </em>of the <em>defendant; </em>not to make the <em>money. </em>If he receives it with the assent of the plaintiff, he is then his agent for that purpose. But this does not proVe the sheriff to be the plaintiff\u2019s agent in the case of a <em>ft. fa. </em>Where an attorney regularly receives money for his client, the remedy of a third person, claiming the money, is against the client only, not the attorney; but the sheriff acts in a very different capacity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-10\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b296-11\">Monday, <em>Sept. 30th.</em></decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AuvO\">The president pronounced the following opinion of the court:</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\"> 2 <em>Bac. </em>Abr.
