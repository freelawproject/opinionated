The plaintiff, therefore, prayed a decree for partition of the land against <em>Jones ; </em>and an account of profits against <em>Donnally.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-3\">The answer of <em>Donnally </em>denied the partnership between <em>Matthews </em>and himself; averring that he <em>separately </em>bought <em>Pryor\u2019s </em>settlement right for his own benefit j (but admitting that he agreed to <em>sell to Matthews one half, </em>upon his paying the purchase-money, which <em>Matthews </em>never did <em>pay;) </em>that he afterwards had the land surveyed by virtue of a land office treasury warrant, which survey he sold and assigned to <em>Jones, </em>to whom a grant was issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-4\"><em>&gt; </em>The defendant <em>Jones, </em>in his answer, said that, at the time he made the purchase, \u201c he had no <em>certain </em>knowledge of any partnership between <em>Donnally </em>and <em>Matthews </em>in the right to said land.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b408-5\">It appeared, from <em>exhibits </em>in the cause, that the certificate of the commissioners for the land in question (dated <em>September </em>11, 1781) was to <em>Andrew Donnally </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number><em>Archer Matthews ; </em>that a survey was made on <em>their </em>behalf, the 3d of <em>May, </em>1785 ; that another survey of the same land was made for Donnally, <em>March </em>20,1791; assigned by him to <em>John Jones, May </em>5,1791; to whom the grant was issued on the 21st of March, 1792; and that, on the 24th of <em>March, </em>1798, <em>John </em>Matthews, son and heir at law of <em>Archer </em>Matthews, deceased, conveyed, by deed, \u201c for and in consideration <em>o\u00ed five shillings? </em>all his right and title in the said land to the plaintiif.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-4\">The depositions clearly proved that <em>Jones </em>knew of the title of <em>Matthews, </em>at the time of his purchase of <em>Donnally ; </em>that <em>Matthews </em>and <em>Donnally </em>were partners in a drove of cattle; and that part of the cattle were paid to <em>Pryor </em>for his settlement right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-5\">On the 1st <em>of </em>March, 1803, the defendant <em>Jones </em>filed a cross bill against Edgar, stating that, at the time of his purchase of the land, he executed sundry bonds to <em>Donnally </em>for the purchase-money, payable at different times; that one of those bonds was assigned by <em>Donnally </em>to <em>Edgar; </em>that, at the time of such assignment, the said <em>Edgar </em>was executor, or administrator, of the estate of <em>Archer </em>Matthews, and guardian of <em>John </em>Matthews, his infant son ; was acquainted with the claim of the said <em>Matthews </em>to the said tract of land, and knew, or believed, that the same would be prosecuted; that <em>Edgar </em>also knew that the bond, which had been assigned to him by Donnally, was for part of the purchase-money of said tract of land; yet he requested and received payment of the amount, without giving notice to <em>Jones </em>that any claim was about to be set up. The cross bill, therefore, called upon him to answer and say whether, <em>at the time of his receiving the amount of the said bond, </em>he did not know that the same was given in payment for the land in question?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-6\">The answer of Edgar, to this bill, averred, that, <em>at the time he took from Donnally the assignment of Jones\u2019s bond, </em>he knew not the, consideration of said bond, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>had no idea that the land in question was the considera\u00bb tion thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-3\">No exception was taken to this answer as insufficient; and no testimony was exhibited in support of the cross bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-4\">The causes came on to be heard the 1st of <em>December, </em>1804; when Chancellor <em>Brown </em>(without deciding upon the plaintiff <em>Edgar's </em>right, as it appeared in the original cause) dismissed the original bill with costs, and decreed that <em>Edgar </em>should pay the costs of the cross suit; \u201c It appearing to the court, from the allegations in the cross bill, <em>not denied by the answer, </em>that the defendant Edgar, knowing of the claim of his ward to the land in controversy, and that that claim would be prosecuted, took an assignment on one of the bonds given by <em>Jones </em>for the purchase-money, the payment of which he pressed and received, <em>knowing at the time of receiving payment </em>the consideration for which it was given, and not disclosing the claim of his ward, which he has since purchased for <em>five shillings, </em>and which the original <em>bill </em>is brought to recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-5\">To this decree a writ of <em>supersedeas </em>was awarded by a judge of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b410-6\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b410-7\"><em>Peyton Randolph, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-8\"><em>On the part of the defendants, </em>it was contended, that <em>John Matthews, </em>under whom <em>Edgar, </em>the plaintiff, claimed, ought to have\u2018been a party to the suit; and <em>Hoover </em>v. <em>Donnally, </em>3 <em>H. M. </em>316. was relied upon, as a case in point. <em>Edgar </em>was guardian of <em>Matthews </em>and bought the property of his ward for five shillings! Ought not the ward to have been a party, for the purpose of showing, if he could, that the purchase made by his guardian was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>fraudulent, or that his right had not, in fact, been relinquished ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-4\"><em>On\\the other side, </em>the position in the first marginal note to the case of <em>Hoover </em>v. <em>Donnally </em>was denied to be law, in the <em>general </em>terms there made use of; being contrary to the whole current of authorities. Where a <em>derivative </em>purchaser sues for a title, the <em>first </em>purchaser need not be a party, <em>if he has parted with all his right. </em>The only case, in which it is necessary to make him a party, is <em>where the equitable or legal title remains in him. </em>Mr. <em>Call's </em>yielding the point in that case, (3 <em>H. &amp; M. </em>319. <em>in the note,) </em>proceeded from a misapprehension of the law. The case of <em>Hobart </em>v. Abbott, 2 <em>P. Wms. </em>643. only shows that, where the assignee, <em>in part, </em>of a mortgage brings a bill to foreclose, the original mortgagee must be a party. But a mortgagee, who has parted with the <em>whole </em>of his interest, need not be a party.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-5\">In the present case, <em>Matthews </em>had, originally, nothing but an <em>equity; </em>and, by his deed to <em>Edgar, </em>parted with the whole of <em>that. </em>No decree could be rendered against <em>him; </em>therefore, it would have been improper to have made him a party.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-7\">\n<em>Wickham.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AE0\">I am prepared with authorities to show that courts of <em>equity </em>lean against the doctrine of the right of survivorship, in all cases of purchases in <em>partnership.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> Donnally </em>and <em>Matthews </em>were partners in a drove of cattle, and out of that property payment was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>made to <em>Pryor </em>for the land. This made the land part<em>nership </em>property, and, therefore, nota joint tenancy, but an estate in common j the survivor being, <em>in </em>equity, a trustee for the representative of the deceased partner.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b411-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number><em>Monday, September </em>30th.</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b411-13\"> <em>Hawes </em>v. <em>Hawes, </em>3 <em>Atk. </em>524. <em>Lake v. </em>Craddock, 3 <em>P. </em>Wms. 158. and <em>Sugden, 407.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AcMk\"><em> </em>Sugden, 406.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Al6\">Judge Brooke</author>\n<p id=\"Ats\">mentioned a point which had not yet been argued. It appeared that <em>Matthews </em>and <em>Donnally </em>had purchased the settlement right <em>jointly ; </em>and, as <em>Matthews </em>died in 1786, before our act of assembly concerning joint rights and obligations took effect, it might be a question whether <em>Donnally </em>was not entitled to the whole, <em>as survivor f</em></p>\n<attorneys id=\"A1d\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number><em>Peyton </em>Randolph, contra.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"AyK\">The testimony proves a partnership in cattle, but not in the land. Two partners may purchase lands jointly j and it will be considered a joint tenancy, unless it appear that the purchase was in the way of trade, and contemplated by them to be held as partnership property ;<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> or unless their advances of money were unequal. But there is nothing in this record to countenance the idea of unequal advances for the land. After the drove of cattle was sold, the partnership was concluded, and the subsequent application of the money to the purchase of land was a different transaction.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AA9\">\n<em>Wickham.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p id=\"ACt\">Whenever a partnership subject is converted into land, it partakes of the nature of the partnership, whether it related to a single transaction, or to a series of transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Thursday, <em>October </em>3d.

And the court is further of opinion, that the right of the appellant to \u2022one moiety of. the land, surveyed by virtue of the certificate of settlement right, alleged in the bill of the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>pellant to have been purchased in partnership, by An<em>drew Donnally </em>and <em>Archer Matthews </em>of <em>John </em>Pryor, is well proved; that it sufficiently appears that the appellee, <em>John </em>Jones, had notice of the title of <em>Archer </em>Matthews, and of the fraud practised by <em>Andrew </em>Donnally, at the time he purchased; and that the said decree is erroneous ; therefore it is decreed and ordered that the same be reversed, &amp;c.; that the cross bill of the appellee, <em>John </em>Jones, be dismissed; that the said appellee pay to the appellant his costs by him expended about his defence of that suit in the said court of chancery; and that the said appellee, Jones, deliver possession of one moiety of the one hundred and fifty-two acres of land surveyed by virtue of the certificate of settlement before mentioned, according to quality and quantity, to be ascertained by commissioners to be appointed by the court of chancery; and also execute a good and sufficient deed for the land, with special warranty, to the appellant; and that an account of improvements and profits be taken, if required by either party.
