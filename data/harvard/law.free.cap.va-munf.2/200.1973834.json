The plaintiff did not make out such a right, as entitled him to recover. The lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>from Lord <em>Fairfax </em>conveyed no more than an estate for the lives of certain persons ; and it does not appear from the demurrer, that any of those lives continued in being ;<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> or that any renewal of the lease had taken place. And if the lives were in being, the grandchildren, under whom the defendant claims, were the first occupants, after the death of the tenant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-3\">2. <em>Jacob Stookey </em>the younger, being out of possession, could not devise the land.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b222-4\"><em>Munford, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Adp\">The title of <em>Jacob Stookey </em>the elder, and his heirs, under the lease, ought to be considered as still in force; nothing to the contrary appearing; and both parties claiming ultimately under him. At his death, his title devolved on his eldest son and heir, who, alone, had the right of entry, as special occupant; (2 <em>Tuck. Bl. </em>259.) which right was not taken away during the absence of such heir from the commonwealth.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> But if the heir had not been absent, the v <em>' </em>length of time was not sufficient to bar his right: for, <em>\u00b0 </em>take out of the computation the period between the 5th of May, <em>1783, </em>and the 20th of <em>October, </em>in the same year, (in conformity with the act of limitations,)<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> and twenty years had not elapsed between the death of <em>Jacob Stookey </em>the elder and the service of the declaration in ejectment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-9\">The case of <em>Hall v. Hall </em>does not establish the doctrine contended for by Mr. <em>Call. </em>The marginal note, indeed, is, \u201c if the title of the heir be abated by a stranger, he cannot devise it before entry but this is evidently a mistake ; for the point decided in the case is not that a devise, but that a deed of bargain and sale, by one out of possession, is void. The rule, that a person con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>veying by bargain and sale must be in possession, to snake the conveyance effectual, is founded on the doctrine of <em>uses, </em>in which that species of conveyance originated. In like manner as a feoffment, by a person out of possession, was void, because there could be no livery of seisin; the deed of bargain and sale, which, under the statute of <em>uses, </em>is a substitute for a feoffment, cannot take effect, unless the bargainor be in possession ; without which the statute does not execute the use.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> the same reason does not apply to devises. But</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-10\">In <em>England, </em>the stat. 32 <em>Hen. </em>VIII. c. 1. uses the words \u201c being seised,\u201d <em>&amp;c.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Yet, even there, it has been repeatedly decided that \u201c contingencies and mere possibilities\u201d may be devised.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> But the language of our <em>. , </em>. , ., ,, , statute is much stronger <em>;</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>being, that \u201c all the estate, right, title and interest, in possession, reversion or remainder, which the testator hath, &amp;c. of, in or to lands, &amp;c. may be devised.\u201d ' If the legislature had intended <em>. </em>only to declare that estates in possession, reversion or remainder, might be devised, they would not have added the words right, <em>title and interest, </em>which, unless they meant something else than estate, were merely superfluous. But they have used the strongest words they could to express their intention, to render any right or interest in land (whether coupled with possession, or not) devisable. That such is the true construction of the act is said, in the argument of <em>Davies </em>v. Miller, 1 <em>Call, </em>130. to have been heretofore decided by this court, and seems admitted by president Pendleton, in delivering the opinion in that case. <em>Ibid. </em>131.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-22\"><em>Williams, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ata\">1. The plaintiff in ejectment must make out a complete title against all the world; which is not done here : for the court cannot draw conclusions from a demurrer to evidence, farther than the facts stated will warrant, <footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A78\"><em>2, </em>I admit that <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Hall </em>was a case where an heir <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>at law, out of possession, had conveyed by bargain and sale. But the reason of the rule applies equally to a devise. It is to prevent the increase of litigation arising from conveyances of defective or disputable titles.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b224-10\">The difference in phraseology between our statute and that of <em>Henry </em>VIII. is but small. The former says nothing of persons out of possession; except in case of <em>remainder </em>or reversion. A right of entry is not mentioned. In using the words \u201c in possession, remainder or reversion,\u201d the legislature had in view the policy of the rule relating to bargains and sales, and intended to apply it to devises. The true line of distinction is, between a devise of a contingency, and of a bare right of entry. The former is devisable, the latter not.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> No implication is to be drawn from the case of <em>Davies </em>v. <em>Miller i </em>for the point was not decided in that case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b224-11\">\n<em>Call.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqCD\">The case of <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Hall </em>settles the great principle that a person out of possession cannot convey a title to lands. The case from <em>East </em>(though a recent decision) is founded on <em>Co. </em>Litt., Shep. <em>Touch, </em>and other old authorities. The plain grammatical construction of our act of assembly is, that the words \u201cin possession, remainder or reversion,\u201d are connected with the antecedent words \u201c right, title or interest,\u201d as well as with \u201c estate ;\u201d so that the \u201c estate, right, title or interest,\u201d must be \u201c in possession, remainder or reversion,\u201d to be devisable.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b224-12\">Monday, <em>June </em>24th.</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"Aeh\"> See <em>Hoyle </em>v. <em>Young, </em>1 <em>Wash. </em>151.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b222-15\"><em> Hall </em>v. <em>Hall, S Call, </em>488.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b222-5\"> <em>Co.
