A legacy to a for her life, and afterwards <em>to </em>the children of the marriage, is no satisfaction of a promise, to the <em>husband, </em>of the amount of a specific debt, (when recovered,) to be applied to a particular purpose; there being no declaration in the will that the legacy was intended as satisfaction for the promise.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-10\"><em>JAMES SCOTT </em>filed his bill, on the 2d of <em>March, </em>1795, in the late high court of chancery against the exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>cutors of <em>William </em>Osborne, deceased; charging that, some time prior to the 16th day of February, 1785, the plaintiff being about to purchase a tract of land, in the county of <em>Prince </em>Edzoard, of a certain <em>Robert </em>Donald, for the sum of 946/. current \u2019\u2022..oney, whereof 434/. 10s. in part, was to be paid immediately, and the balance the <em>Christmas </em>following; <em>William </em>Osborne, of the county of <em>Notto</em>way, in order to encourage him to make the purchase, and in consideration that he, the plaintiff, had married his daughter Elizabeth, and for her advancement, did advise and instruct the plaintiff to contract for the purchase of the said land, and to make the first payment himself; and, in consideration of his so doing, agreed that he, the said <em>William </em>Osborne, would pay the last payment for him, out of a debt due to him by bond \u2022 from a certain <em>Henry </em>Anderson, (amounting to 315/. 15s. <em>3d. </em>with lawful interest from the 1st of <em>April, </em>1776,) when the same should be collected; that the plaintiff, depending on those promises, concluded the contract for the purchase, made the first payment to <em>Robert Donald; </em>and gave his bond for the balance of the purchase-money, amounting to 512/. 10s. payable the 25th day of December, 1785, in full hope and assurance that the same would be duly paid and taken up by the said <em>Osborne; </em>that his circumstances would not justify his making the said purchase; and that he would not have made it, if the promise aforesaid had not been made him; that, nevertheless, the said bond was not discharged by <em>Osborne, </em>who had not been able to collect the money from Anderson, and the plaintiff was himself compelled to pay it, with great difficulty and inconvenience, and a considerable sacrifice of property, which he finally accomplished, and took in the bond, about the year 1790 ; that <em>Osborne, </em>by hxs last will, made and published the 2d of <em>October, </em>1786, bequeathed to his daughter <em>Elizabeth, </em>wife to the plaintiff, <em>Si. </em>current money, and soon after departed this life, without having, in any manner, paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>or satisfied the plaintiff for the said sum of 512/. 10s. or an-' part thereof? that his executors had, since the year 1790, completed the collection of the debt due from Anderson&gt;\u2022 but the plaintiff is unable to prove, <em>at </em>law, when the same was collected, and to what amount ? that tht: said executors had assets to satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and were accountable to him, <em>as </em>trustees, to an amount equal to his last bond to said <em>Donald. </em>The bill concluded with special and distinct interrogatories, requiring the defendants to answer the several allegations aforesaid, and prayed a decree for 512/. 10s. with inte\u00bb rest from the 25th day of December, 1785 ? also for the legacy of <em>Si. </em>and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-4\">The defendants, by their answer, contended, that, if ths plaintiff\u2019s claim could be supported at all, it could in a <em>court of law; </em>that the promise of their testator (admitting that he made it) was not binding either in law or equity, because there was no consideration to support it, unless <em>marriage </em>shall be regarded as a <em>continuing consideration; </em>and because the <em>time </em>limited by law for the institution of actions for claims of this nature had long ago expired. They further answering said, that they Were present when a conversation took place, between their testator and the plaintiff, about the purchase of <em>Donald\u2019s </em>land; and they understood that, if the money due on <em>Anderson\u2019s </em>bond could be collected, the plaintiff' tvas to have the use of it, free from interest if returned in a short time ? and that he was to give his bond for it: 41 they feel a conviction that <em>such </em>was the nature of the agreement, (if it can be called one,) not only because their memories tell them so, but because, if their testator really intended that the said complainant should have the absolute ownership of the said bond, no reason can be conceived why an immediate delivery, or assignment, did not take place.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b435-5\">The answer further stated that the complainant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>given an incorrect, if not an uncandid, statement of the will of <em>William, Osborne; </em>who, in fact, devised to his daughter Elizabeth, wife to the complain\u00e1nt, during her natural life, a negro woman, named Cutchina, and all her. increase that she then had, or might thereafter have, and directed his executors to lay out the sum of 280/. in the purchase of negroes, which negroes he bequeathed to the said <em>Elizabeth </em>during her life, and, after her death, to her children by the complainant: he also devised to the said Elizabeth, (after the death of his wife,) during her life, with a limitation to her children as before, a negro woman named Poll, and her daughter <em>Milly </em>j \u201c all which, it is conceived, were certainly meant by the testator to be in full of the provision which it was proper for him to make for the plaintiif\u2019s family; the defendants aver that the complainant was spoken to by the testator, and then expressed his approbation of the manner in which the legacies aforesaid were to be made to his wife; that the said sum of 280/. has been disposed of according to his wishes, and he has received every benefit which was intended for him, or any part of his family, by the will aforesaid ; that the widow of the said testator hath since departed this life, and hath made considerable bequests, to the children of the complainant, out of the residue devised to her; which residue could not be ascertained until all accounts were settled, and the estate divided; and now the complainant finding, perhaps, that he has got all that he is likely to receive, is setting up'a claim, about which he has thought proper to be silent for nearly ten years.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-11\">\u2022 In this answer the respondents said nothing about the time of collection of, or sum received by, them upon <em>Anderson\u2019s </em>bond. But from certain <em>exhibits </em>in the cause, (whether filed by the plaintiff, or by the defendants, does not appear,) the sum of 128/. 14s. <em>6d. </em>appears to have been made, by an execution issued <em>May </em>.13, <em>1790, </em>and the balance, amounting to 594/. 9s. <em>Ad. </em>be-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>sidles costs, to have been recovered, in an action of debt on the judgment, <em>in </em>September, 1793.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-4\">The last wills of <em>William Osborne </em>and <em>Elizabeth Os</em>borne, his widow, were also <em>exhibits, </em>and corresponded with the description of them given in the answer. Many depositions were taken on both sides ; the general tendency of which was to prove the plaintiff\u2019s having been induced to make the purchase of <em>Donalds </em>land by <em>William Osborne's </em>promise to let him have the amount of <em>Anderson's </em>bond when collected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-5\">The late chancellor dismissed the bill with costs; from which decree the plaintiff appealed to this court; and, the appellant and appellees having departed this life, the appeal was revived in favour of <em>Scott's Executor </em>against <em>The Executor of Abner </em>Osborne, who was surviving exe\u00ab eutor of <em>William </em>Osborne.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b437-6\">Wickham, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqEE\">1. <em>Scott </em>came into <em>equity </em>upon two grounds; 1st. The <em>trust </em>relative to <em>Anderson's </em>bond; the amount of which, when collected, he was entitled to receive ; and for that purpose had a right to demand an <em>account; </em>and, 2d. The uncertainty as to the time when the money was collected ; which made a <em>discovery </em>necessary.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-7\">2. The promise was supported by a sufficient consideration, the purchase of <em>Donald's </em>land having been made at the <em>request </em>of <em>Osborne; </em>and the plaintiff having thereby sustained a great inconvenience, against which he promised to indemnify him.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-8\">3. The act of limitations did not bar the plaintiff\u2019s claim; which never accrued until the money due from <em>.Anderson </em>was collected.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b437-9\"><em>Hay, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aikd\">According to <em>Scott's </em>own statement, the money when collected being his, an action for money had and received, or a special action for breach of contract, would have lain in his favour : adequate redress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>might then have been had <em>at law; </em>and, therefore, even if the consideration were sufficient, and the contract proved., there is no ground for coming into a court of equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-3\">But the consideration, in this case, was not sufficient t the promise, in fact, was merely voluntary. For the bill states that the plaintiff was <em>about </em>to purchase the land in <em>Prince Edward, </em>before his father-in-law said any thing to induce him to make the purchase. He' must have applied to <em>Osborne </em>for help, and the promise must have been made in consequence of that application. 'His allegation, that the purchase was far above bis abi\u00ab lity, is no basis for a <em>consideration; </em>since (from his own showing) he was able, and actually did pay for the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-4\">\u2022 The delay of bringing suit ought to bar the plaintiff j especially, since he waited till the deaths of Mr. and Mrs. Osborne, to get whatever might be bequeathed, by either of them, to himself, or his wife and children, and then set tip this claim on account of <em>Anderson\u2019s </em>bond, for which, probably, the old gentleman supposed he had made him complete satisfaction by the ample provision made in his will. The hill being, in substance, for a <em>specific </em>performance, in which case the giving relief is <em>discretionary </em>with a court of equity, the court ought not to countenance the present plaintiff. ,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b438-5\"><em>Wickham, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHNt\">An action for money had and re\u00bb ceived will lie against every trustee; yet the bill in equity lies, That action is, in many respects, of modern date; introduced to obtain relief <em>at law </em>in many cases where the remedy formerly was, <em>exclusively, in equity. </em>But this circumstance does not take away the old established jurisdiction of the court, proving, then, that <em>that </em>action <em>will </em>lie, does not prove that a bill in equity will <em>not </em>lie. But the prayer for a <em>discovery </em>is abundantly, sufficient to give the court jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-6\">,As to the consideration of the promise j the plaintiff\u2019s saying he was <em>about </em>to buy the land, proves nothing ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>ioi\u2019 ibis was not actu\u00e1lly buying it. Another allegation in the bill is, that he would hot have bought it, <em>but for this promise. </em>In all human probability, <em>Anderson's </em>bond was <em>in suit </em>at the time, and <em>that circumstance alone </em>prevented <em>Osborne\u2019s </em>assigning it to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-4\">In <em>Rowton v. </em>Rowton, 1 <em>H. &amp; M. </em>92. there was no difference of opinion among the judges, on the point that the agreement, <em>if </em>proved, was upon sufficient consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-5\">Mr. <em>Hafs </em>argument that <em>Scott's </em>claim is uncbnscieh* <em>tious, </em>is not supported by the facts in the record. The devise in <em>Osborne's </em>will, to <em>Scott's tvife, </em>is no satisfaction of the contract. Even a devise to <em>hhnself </em>could not have had that effect, without an express declaration in the will. Such a devise could not be <em>presumed to </em>have been intended as a satisfaction; especially in opposition to the testimony of witnesses, which ought always to be admitted to rebut an equity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b439-6\">\n<em>Hay.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0h\">The suggestion of a want of <em>discovery </em>is merely colourable, to give jurisdiction. The time when <em>Anderson </em>paid the money might easily have been proved*</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b439-7\">\n<em>Wickham.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWtz\">The decision in <em>Chichester's Ex'% </em>v. <em>Cass's Adm'r, </em>is a complete answer to this objection. I contended, there, that the plaintiff having proved his case by evidence aliunde, a discovery was not necessary <em>i </em>but my argument was overruled.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b439-8\">Wednesday, <em>September </em>25th.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Avi\">The following opinion was pronounced as the opinion and decree of the court, consisting of Judges Fleming, Roane, Brooke and Cabell.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b437-16\"> <em>Chichester's Ex\u2019x v.

That a bill <em>in chancery </em>was necessary to discover whether, and at what time, the money due on <em>Anderson\u2019s </em>bond was recovered and received by <em>Osborne\u2019s </em>executors; 2d. That the appellant was not barred by the statute of limitations, as he had ho right to the money, under the said promise, until it should be recovered of Anderson, the time of which was uncertain, and which, it appears, did not happen until the year 1793; 3d. That a very good and sufficient consideration is charged in the bill, and proved by sundry witnesses; and, lastly, that the legacies to the appellant\u2019s wife, being for life only, are by no means a satisfaction, <em>pro </em>tanto, of the engagement of the testator <em>Osborne </em>,* it being a promise of a specific debt, when recovered, to be applied to a particular purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-16\">The decree, therefore, ought to be reversed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-17\">\u201c Decree reversed; and, this court proceeding, &amp;c. it is decreed and ordered that the appellee, <em>Conrad Webb, </em>executor of <em>Abner </em>Osborne, the surviving executor of <em>William </em>Osborne, out of the estate of the said <em>William Os</em>borne, pay to the appellant the full amount of the debt, with the interest thereon, by him recovered and received, on the bond of <em>Henry </em>Anderson, in the proceedings mentioned, and also interest, at the rate of <em>5 per centum per annum, </em>on the said aggregate sum, from the time the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>same was received by the said executor, until payment thereof shall be made by' virtue of this decree.
