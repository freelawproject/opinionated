At least, such was the case previous to the act of <em>January 24th, </em>1798 ;<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> though since that time, thirty years\u2019 possession is good against the commonwealth.

Mr. <em>Call </em>relies merely on an entry with the surveyor, not an actual entry upon the land. Under the act of 1748, the petitioner for lapsed land, when the decision was in his favour, was \u201c entitled\u201d to the land itself \u201c in the same manner, and subject to the same conditions and provisoes as lands not before patented , are subject.\u201d The land, therefore, was no longer \u201c waste and unappropriated,\u201d and could not be granted by the king or commonwealth to any other <em>person,</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>without destroying the petitioner\u2019s lien upon it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-7\">Even if the question were between the king and us, we do not answer to the description of intruders; for an intruder is one who enters by strong hand, without colour of title.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b279-17\"><em>Wickham, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVL\">I might admit every position of Mr. <em>Call, </em>and safely rely on our length of possession ; for, in ejectment, nothing farther need be pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>ved. The plaintiff is entitled to recover on twenty yearn\u2019 possession, without showing any title from the commonwealth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-4\">The doctrine laid down in Runnington, p. 14, <em>15. </em>is only that the king\u2019s lessee has the benefit of the maxim of <em>nullum tempus; </em>presupposing that the title has all along remained in the king : but when he has parted with it by a grant to one person, he cannot afterwards grant it to another. The second grantee is merely a wrongdoer, and cannot take advantage of the maxim. The case in 2 <em>Leon. </em>147. is badly reported, and scarcely intelligible. That in Alleyne, p. <em>11. as </em>far as I can understand it, is authority in our favour.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b280-5\"><em>Call, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiR\">Every plaintiff in ejectment is bound to prove that the land has been granted by the commonwealth ; for, unless the commonwealth has granted, her right cannot be devested. If the king\u2019s lessee for years has the benefit of the maxim of <em>nullum tempus; </em>surely, <em>d fortiori, </em>a patentee of the fee-simple (as <em>Nandi </em>is) has the same benefit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-6\">In <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>1 <em>Wash. </em>230. <em>David Rodgers, </em>in favour of whose right the court decided, had made a prior settlement, which gave him the right of pre-emption to obtain the patent: but in this special verdict nothing is said of seating and planting. In <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Page, </em>(MS. <em>May, </em>1806,) Col. <em>Carey </em>and his heirs had paid the quitrents for many years yet the court determined that <em>Page\u2019s </em>title was good, not from his being representative of <em>Carey, </em>but only on the ground of the entry made by himself.

Under the operation of that section, the judgment in effect revested the legal title to the land in question in the crown, and, at the same time, entitled the petitioners, <em>John </em>and <em>Charles </em>Christian, under whom the lessors of the plaintiff claim, to a grant, upon the same conditions and provisions as if the land had not before been patented. There is nothing in the act which limits the right of the petitioners in point of time; and, unless the land had again been petitioned for as lapsed land, and adjudged forfeited, the lessors of the plaintiff, yrho have deduced an unquestionable title from the petitioners <em>John </em>and <em>Charles </em>Christian, are still entitled to a patent from the commonwealth, on which the title of the crown has devolved. Having a title to a grant, and it being found in the special verdict that the lessors of the plaintiff, and those under whom they claim, have been in the undisturbed possession of the land in the declaration mentioned, from the year 1774 until the year 1800, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>I am of opinion they have made out a good title in this action against the defendant; and that the judgment of -t^e \u00bf\u00a1strict court must be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"AZb\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"AF6H\">If it were necessary for the appellees in this case to show a complete title to enable them to recover, they would probably not succeed; but they have shown a possession of 26 years; and we are told \u201c that 20 years\u2019 possession tolls the entry of the person having the <em>right; </em>and \u2022 that, consequently, although the very right be in the defendant, yet he cannot justify ejecting the plamtifF.\u201d<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A5It\">To obviate the force of this position, it is said that the appellees, and those under whom they claim, were intruders upon the crown, and consequently gained no right whatsoever by the length of possession. Without questioning the correctness of this doctrine, as applying to the naked case of intrusions upon the demesne lands of the crown, without any colour of title whatsoever; it may be doubted whether it is applicable to the case before us, in which there is a judgment, or certificate, which (although it does not vest an absolute and indefeasible estate in the person who obtains it)<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> gives him u a right to purchase the particular tract of land in preference to others.\u201d The <em>English </em>doctrines on this subject, which have been cited, do not, therefore, seem to apply to this case, in which, on the payment of a moderate composition within a reasonable time, the party might have taken out his patent. On the ground of the 26 years\u2019 possession, therefore, the appellees were entitled to recover; -and the judgment of the district court in their favour is correct, and ought to be affirmed. -</p>\n<author id=\"b282-10\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar6\">It has been decided by this court, in a variety of cases, that a treasury land-warrant cannot be laid on land, as waste and unappropriated, that has been patented and settled; and, more especially, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>(as in the case before us) the land had been in quiet possession of others, lawfully acquired, for near thirty years. I therefore concur in opinion that the judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Judgment unanimously affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b282-7\"><em> Buller\u2019s, N.
