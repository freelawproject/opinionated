Whereupon, the plaintiff proved that he was a <em>British </em>subject, and held, and was entitled, by assignment, to the. . . , _ , \u2022 , _ _ note in question, before the year <em>1776; </em>and moved the court to instruct the jury that he was protected from the operation of the said statute, under the second section of treaty<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> which is in these words : \u201c Whereas it is agreed by the fourth article of the definitive treaty of peace, concluded at <em>Paris </em>oh the third day of September, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three, between his <em>Britannic Majesty </em>and the <em>United </em>States, that credit-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>\u2022-\u25a0rs on either side should meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value, in sterling money, of all <em>bonafide </em>debts theretofore contracted; it is hereby declared, that the said fourth article, so far as respects its future operation, is hereby recognised, confirmed, and declared to be binding and obligatory on his <em>Britannic Majesty </em>and the said <em>United States ; </em>and the same shall be accordingly observed with punctuality and good faith, and so as that the said creditors shall hereafter meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value, in sterling money, of their <em>bona fide </em>debts.\u201d But the court, being of a different opinion, refused to give such instruction. To which opinion of the court the plaintiff filed a bill of exceptions, setting forth the above circumstances only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-4\">Verdict and judgment for the defendants, and appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b275-5\"><em>George K. </em>Taylor, for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afh\">quoted <em>5 Burr. </em>2630. <em>^uantock </em>v. <em>England., </em>as showing that the act of limitations is not an absolute bar, but only a legal impediment to the recovery of a debt. He then relied on the cases of <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>Brailsford and </em>others, 3 Dallas, 1. <em>Ware </em>v. <em>Hylton, ib. </em>399. and <em>Page </em>v. <em>Pendleton, Wythe\u2019s Rep. </em>127. as establishing the position that the restoration of peace, as well as the very terms of the treaty of 1783, revived the creditors\u2019 right of action to recover <em>British </em>debts. In <em>Hopkirk </em>v. <em>Bell, 3 Cranch, 434. </em>and 4 <em>Crunch, </em>164. it was decided that the act of limitations was no bar to those debts. It is now understood, in the federal courts, as settled, that the act runs only from the time of the plaintiff\u2019s coming into this country since the date of the convention of 1802, and this court, on questions relating to the construction of treaties, abides by the opinions of the supreme court of the <em>United States ; </em>in like manner as that court is governed by the decisions of the state courts, on the subject of state laws.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AKr4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number><em>Hay, </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-yL\">was not disposed to controvert* the authority of the case of <em>Hopkirk </em>v. <em>Bell; </em>though ifc was an <em>expartc </em>decision. The only question is, whether taSe *s so stated as to come within the scope of that <em>decision; </em>the ground of which was, that <em>Hopkirk, </em>the surviving partner of <em>Spiers, Bowman Co. </em>had always been resident in the kingdom of <em>Great Britain </em>/ and though it was afterwards certified (4 <em>Cranch, </em>164.) that <em>Andrew fohnston, </em>one of the partners, came into this country in 3 ^84, and died here in 17*85, the court said, this additional circumstance was not sufficient to vary the former decision. If the company had had a factor-resident here, the decision would have been different.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-6\">But in this case, it is only stated that the plaintiff is a <em>\u201c British </em>subject.\u201d Where he resided does not appear. It is true that it does not appear that he was always resident in this country; but it was incumbent on him to make out a case to entitle him to recover in opposition to the plea of the act of limitations.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A-S\"><em>George Ki Taylor, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1K\">Admit that the plaintiff always resided here, (though such was not the fact,) yet <em>Hopkirk </em>v. <em>Bell </em>is clear authority in his favour ; and if it were not, the convention of 1802, in itself, is sufficient. The <em>British </em>authorities are conclusive that, if the act of limitations runs against one of the partners of a firm, it runs against all. The true meaning of the decision is, that though the act once did run, it was set aside by the convention; by which it was intended to revive claims already barred by the act, which is merely a lawful impediment, as decided in <em>5 Burr. </em>2630.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b276-9\">\n<em>Thursday, May 9th.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b274-20\"> Note.
