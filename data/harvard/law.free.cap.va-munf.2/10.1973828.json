The other defendants pleaded, jointly, not guilty.

By the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, and the record therein mentioned, it appeared that the defendants <em>had aprobable cause </em>for commencing their prosecution.\u201d The court determined the law to be for the defendants ; and \u201c it was considered that the plaintiff take nothing by his bill, but, for his false clamour, be in mere}',\u201d See, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>To this judgment the plaintiff obtained a writ of <em>supersedeas </em>from this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-3\"><em>Wirt </em>and <em>Call, </em>for th\u00e9 appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-4\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-5\">The only point determined by the court, and that on which the argument principally turned, was, whether it was necessary to aver in the declaration the <em>want of probable cause.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A-\">The counsel <em>for the appellant </em>insisted,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzLM\">1st.

This </em>action is founded on the act of assembly against conspirators,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> copied from 23 Edw. I. which the words \u201c <em>falsely and maliciously\u201d </em>are used, and not the words \u201c <em>without probable cause.\u201d </em>The <em>gist </em>of the action is the <em>conspiracy, </em>united <em>with falsehood </em>and <em>malice </em><footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> The better opinion seems to be, that the writ of conspiracy, which is a <em>formed action, </em>requires an indictment and acquittal; but the action on the case, in the nature of the writ of conspiracy, will lie with- \u2019 ..... out a bill found, or preferred.<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> This distinction is admitted in <em>4 Burr. </em>1972. one of the cases on which the leading cage <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Thilman </em>was decided. In 1 <em>Saund. </em>228. the declaration against three persons for a conspiracy, is exactly similar to the one now in question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ah7\">On principle; the rule in the action for malicious prosecution is founded on this, that, if there be a probable cause, individuals ought not to be deterred from prosecuting. But how will this reason apply to the case at bar ? that if there be a probable cause to <em>conspire, </em>individuals ought not to be deterred from conspiring, and that <em>falsely </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number><em>and maliciously S </em>A <em>conspiracy </em>implies, <em>ex t&gt;i terminiy </em>that the object against whom it is formed, is innocent; and when to this conspiracy, \u201c <em>false </em>and malicious\u201d are added, and a prosecution liowing from that source, every thing essential to the charge is averred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-3\">2. Even in the action for malicious prosecution, the averment of \u201c want of probable cause\u201d is not necessary, <em>totidem verbis. </em>In <em>Young </em>v. <em>Gregory</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is admitted that <em>equipollent </em>expressions are sufficient; and from 10 <em>Mod. </em>214. and <em>Gilb. Rep. </em>K. B. 185. <em>(same case more fully </em>reported,) it appears that the words \u201c falsely and maliciously\u201d are equivalent to \u201c without probable cause.\u201d Wherever a man prefers an indictment containing slander on the face of it, or putting the indictee to trouble and expense, this action lies; unless the indictor can justify; and this must come from his side.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> Malice is the <em>gist </em>of this action. Where one sues another without probable cause, he is not subject to an action, unless malice appear, the payment of costs being sufficient punishment ; but where the original suit was falsely and maliciously brought, an action for it lies.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-5\">In <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Thilman</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the doctrine on the subject was not fully before the court. The cases cited did not support the position that want of probable cause must be alleged in the declaration. In 6 <em>Mod. </em>25. 73. it was held that, if there were a probable cause, the action would not lie. The conclusion to be drawn from 4 <em>Burr. </em>1974. is only that want of such cause must appear at the trial. In <em>1 Term Rep. </em>544. the question was not presented by the case before the court; the want of probable cause being actually alleged in the declaration. 2 <em>Term Rep. </em>226. was not a case of the kind at all; but turned upon the, necessity of an averment that the prosecution had terminated. The decision of <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Thilman </em>is, therefore, not supported by the authorities on which it rested; neither did that case resemble this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-6\">3. Under the act of jeofails, the jury having found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>prosecution malicious, the court ought to presume that every thing necessary to justify such a verdict was pror ved before them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b34-11\">Wickham, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiU\">observed, that he considered this case as settled by the two cases of <em>Ellis </em>v. Thilman, and <em>Young </em>v. <em>Gregory. </em>The question is not whether the verdict was according to evidence ; but whether the declaration was sufficient. The distinction attempted to be drawn between conspiracy and malicious prosecution, is supported neither by reason nor authority. In point of moral turpitude and public policy, what difference can exist between a prosecution by one, or by many ? As to precedents, they prove directly the contrary. The cases cited on the other side relate to the writ of conspiracy, or to indictments for conspiracy; but not to case, in the nature of a writ of conspiracy, which this action is.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-12\">The writ of conspiracy, at common law, lay only where the prosecution was for treason or felony;<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> and whether at common law, or since the statute, there could be no recovery, unless the plaintiff was acquitted by the verdict of a petit jury.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> The declaration here would clearly, therefore, not be a good one, if this were an action of conspiracy. In 10 <em>Mod. </em>219 Chief Justice Par<em>ker </em>says, \u201c That actions of conspiracy are the worst sort of actions in the world to be argued from, for there is more contrariety and repugnancy of opinions in them, than in any other species of actions whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-13\">The argument, by analogy, from cases relative to indictments for conspiracy, will not hold; for the action is more discouraged than the indictment; because the indictment is exhibited by a high and responsible officer, and must be found a \u201c true bill\u201d by the grand jury, before any proceedings can be had upon it; whereas the action may be, and often is, brought for corrupt purposes ; for which reason it is usual to deny the plaintiff a copy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>the proceedings on which he means to bring suit.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> It does not follow, therefore, that because the averment of Want of probable cause is not necessary in the indictment, it may be dispensed with in the action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-4\">The <em>gist </em>of the action in this case is not the conspiracy, but the damage sustained by the plaintiff in consequence of the mal cious prosecution.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> If the <em>g\u2019st </em>of the action were the conspiracy, judgment could not go against one only, the rest being acquitted ; but the rule is well established, that this may be done.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-5\">In substance, then, there is no distinction between this, and the action for a malicious prosecution; the only difiere nee being that this is against several, and that against <em>one </em>only. n that action it has been settled, ever since the time of Lord Holt, that the words <em>\u201c </em>without probable cause.\u201d or vords equivalent, are essential. In 1 <em>Ld. Raym. 375. </em>\u201c <em>absque rational:li </em>causa\u201d were used in the declaration, and passed without objection, the point not having been made: but in <em>Young </em>v. Gregory, this court decided tha<em>t </em>without justifiable cause\u201d was not sufficient. The modern precedents are all drawn with the words \u201c without probable cause.\u201d<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b35-6\">\n<em>Curia adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b35-20\"><em>Wednesday, March 6th, </em>1811.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"An2\">The judges pronounced their opinions.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b32-6\"> <em>3 Call, 3.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"A4c\"><em> Ibid. </em>446.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"AhT\"> l <em>Rev.

N. B. </em>116. is expressly to the contrary, and the distinction there taken is, that it will not lie against husband and wife <em>alone, </em>because they are but one person; but against husband and wife and a third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>person, it well lieth. Mr. Wirt, for the appellants, very properly contended that the first and fourth of these reasons assigned for arresting the judgment were improper, since the court below could not take notice of the matter contained in the bill of exceptions, upon which the same court had already finally decided; a bill of exceptions being in the nature of an appeal, from the judgment of the court, where the cause was tried, to a higher tribunal. In this he was certainly correct; but, as the whole record is now before this court, we are f it be necessary) to examine these points as well as the others. As the argument, here, has turned almost altogether upon the <em>second, </em>the want of averment of <em>probable </em>cause, I shall consider <em>that </em>first. That these words are neither necessary' in an indictment for a conspiracy, nor in the ancient action, or writ of conspiracy, appears from <em>Rastall's Entries, </em>123\u2014126. as to indictments, and in <em>F. </em>N. <em>E. 114\u2014116. </em>as to the ancient <em>writ of conspiracy.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>, , <em>V, </em>And 1 Strange, 193. shows they are equally unnecessary in an <em>information. </em>9 <em>Co. 56. (The </em>Poulterers\u2019 <em>Case,) </em>was an action on the case, like the present, for a combination, confederacy and agreement between the defendants <em>falsely </em>and <em>maliciously </em>to charge the plaintiff with a robbery, and to procure him to be indicted, &amp;c. There is no notice of this averment in that case; yet the plaintiff, upon <em>good consideration, </em>(as Sir <em>Edw. Coke, </em>expresses it,) had judgment. No such averment appears either in the case of <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Wirral, Cro. Jac. </em>193. where the declaration was held good ; or of <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Crashaw and others, </em>3 Cro. 15.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> or <em>Bagnal </em>v. <em>Knight, ibid. 553. </em>And even in a <em>qui tarn </em>action on the statute of <em>Hen. </em>VI. c. 10. there is no such averment. <em>Rast. Entries, 126. </em>In <em>Smyth </em>v. Drinkwater, 1 Keble, 627. a motion, was macje jn arrest of judgment for want of the averment of jurisdiction; but the court said that, after a verdict, they would not intend the want of jurisdiction, and the plaintiff had judgment. In <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Gunton and </em>others. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>(21 <em>Car. </em>II.) 1 <em>Saund. </em>228.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> there is an averment, that the defendant held the plaintiff to bail, without any just cause. This is the first averment that I have found in any declaration, in this action, at all similar to the present. <em>Saunders </em>moved in arrest of judgment without noticing this averment, or the distinction, so much pressed since, between a <em>just </em>and a <em>probable </em>cause. The plaintiff had judgment. In the case of <em>Box </em>v. Taylor, (32 and 33 Car. II.) 2 Shower, 154. \u201c the action war, for a false and malicious prosecution of a suit in an inferior court; the declaration says only <em>absque justa causa, </em>and held naughtbecause it <em>might </em>be with a <em>probable cause </em>for the suit, and this action will not lie; <em>absque aliqua causa </em>will do; or, <em>sine causa </em>justa, <em>vcl probubili </em>; but <em>absque justa causa </em>is not good, for the reason afore* said, and judgment for defendant.\u201d In <em>Saville </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>(10 <em>Wm. </em>III.) 1 <em>Ld. Raym. </em>374.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> the prosecution was alleged to be <em>neqniter ct mahtiose, </em>and <em>sine causa rationabili, </em>and judgment for the plaintiff. In <em>Muriell </em>v. <em>Tracy, </em>at <em>nisi prius, </em>(3 <em>Ann.) </em>6 <em>Mod. </em>169. an exception was taken, at the trial, to the declaration, because it was not laid that the warrant, upon which the plaintiff was arrested, was taken out without <em>probable cause. </em>Holt, Ch. J. upon this exception, recommended to the parties to withdraw a juror; for he held the de - claration <em>ill, </em>for not alleging it to have been <em>without probable cause. </em>In the case of <em>Jones </em>v. Gwynn, which occurred about nine years afterwards, (12 <em>Ann.) </em>10 <em>Mod. </em>214. more satisfactorily reported by Ld. Ch. Baron Gilbert, in his Reports, 185. the question, as to the necessity of such an averment, came on upon a demurrer to the declaration; in which one of the reasons for the demurrer is, that it is not alleged that the indictment was procured by the defendant to be exhibited <em>sine aliqua rationabili causa. </em>Ld. Ch. J. Parker, (afterwards Earl of <em>Macclesfield </em>and Lord Chancellor,) in delivering the opinion of the court of K. B. is reported to have' ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>pressed himself as follows : \u201c As to the declaration, <em>ad </em>primam, I do agree, it is a circumstance necessary to maintaining of this action, that the indictment was preferred without cause.\u201d \u201c For if there were what \u00cd3 usually called a probable cause ; nay, if there be a fair and reasonable account given, how a complaint came to be made before a magistrate which produced an indictment, though it fell short of probability of guilt in the party-accused, this action will not lie. M. <em>5 Jac. </em>B. R. <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Wirral. Cro. Jac. </em>193. pl. 19. <em>Yelv. </em>105. <em>Roll. Abr. </em>113. (Q) pl. 2. \u201c Action for maliciously preferring against the plaintiff an indictment for the rape of one <em>A. </em>\u25a0an infant, whereupon he was arraigned and acquitted s the defendant pleads that <em>A. </em>was his daughter, of the age of eight years, and came to him with tears, and complained that the plaintiff had ravished her; that, thereupon, he immediately complained to a justice of the peace, and carried her with <em>him; </em>that the justice sent for the plaintiff, and, upon examination of the cause, bound the plaintiff to appear at the next assises, and the defendant to prosecute him; whereupon the defendant went to the assises, and, to save his recognisance, preferred an indictment of rape against the plaintiff, which was found, and that he carried his daughter to the assises, <em>prout ei bene </em>licuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">\u201c In this case, though there was no averment that any rape was committed, it must be understood, as Rolle, in express terms, puts it, that none was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">\u201c Though it would not be a just cause to arrest a man for felony, without averment that a felony was committed; though, as Mr. Justice <em>Croke's </em>opinion was, the father seemed too credulous to cause a bill of indictment to be preferred upon the complaint of so small a girl; yet the justification was held good. For the defendant shows how, by degrees, lawful and justifiable, he came to exhibit the indictment. 1st. There was the complaint of his daughter, whom nature forces him to pity, and tender<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>ness of age frees from suspicion of malice ; 2d. He hereupon bruits it not abroad, but applies in a course of justice ; and a father could do no less; 3d. He then prefers an indictment for safety of his recognisance; 4th. The crime complained of is what is usually committed in secret; and, on complaint of his daughter, though it be but conjecture, he might well exhibit a complaint to a justice ; so that I hold this action is not maintainable, but where there is no probability of guilt, nor reasonable cause, nor honest occasion for complaint; but, yet, though this must be the case to maintain the action, it is not necessary to be expressly alleged in the declaration, nor need the plaintiff use the words <em>sine probabili </em>causa, or <em>sine </em>ra* <em>tionabili causa.\" Gilb. Cas. </em>186\u2014188.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-3\">After such an express decision upon the point by the court of K. B., delivered by a judge of Lord <em>Macclesfield's </em>high standing and reputation, as the opinion of that court, and upon a special demurrer, it seems rather extraordinary that the point should have been stirred again ; nor, in fact, have I found any subsequent case in <em>England </em>m which it has been drawn in question, either by a demurrer, or by a motion in arrest of judgment, except the case of <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>2 T. R. 225. Nothing that Is said in either of the cases of <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Spraggs, </em>2 Burr. 993. (1 <em>Bl. Rep. </em>209. S. C.) nor in <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Rispal, </em>3 <em>Burr. </em>1320. nor in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Chapman, ibid. </em>1418. (1 <em>Bl. Rep. </em>427. S. C.) nor in <em>Farmer </em>v. <em>Darling, </em>4 <em>Burr. </em>1971. nor in <em>Ludley </em>v. <em>Mott, </em>1 <em>Wils. </em>210. nor in <em>Sutton v. Johnstone, </em>1 <em>T. R. </em>493. has any relation to the necessity of such an averment in the declaration; but they all show that the plaintiff must prove the want of probable cause upon the trial. But the mere rejection of the bill of indictment by the grand jury to whom it was preferred, has been held to amount to such proof. In the case of <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>2 <em>T. R. </em>225. <em>Buller, </em>J. alone spoke <em>to </em>this point. His words are, \u201c The grounds of a mali clous prosecution arc, 1st, That it was done maliciously; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>and, 2d. Without probable cause. The want of probable cause is the <em>gist </em>of the action ; but that is not stated here; for it should have been shown upon the record that the prosecution is at an end.\u201d It would seem, then, as if his opinion were, that if it had appeared upon the <em>record </em>that the <em>prosecution was at an end, </em>that circumstance might have supplied the want of a positive aver* ment that the prosecution was without probable cause. If this be in reality his meaning, his opinion may be well reconciled to that of Lord Macclesfield, where he says, <em>e\u00ed </em>I do agree it is a circumstance necessary to maintaining of this action, that the indictment was preferred without cause.\u201d But what he (Lord Macclesfield) says after-wards clearly shows, he did not mean to say it was necessary to be expressly alleged in the declaration, but the direct contrary. However, from the whole current of the later authorities in <em>England, </em>as also from the several books of precedents, it seems to be now fully agreed and understood there, that the want of probable cause is the <em>gist </em>of the action. Lord <em>Mansfield </em>and Lord <em>Loughborough, </em>in the celebrated case of <em>Johnstone and Sutton, </em>say, \u201c that the essential ground of an action for a malicious prosecution is, that a legal prosecution has been carried on without any probable cause. We say this is emphatically the <em>essential </em>ground ; because every other allegation may be implied but <em>this; </em>but this must be substantially and expressly proved, and cannot be implied.\u201d They proceed to say, \u201c From the want of probable cause, malice may be, and most commonly is, <em>implied. </em>The knowledge of the defendant is also <em>implied. </em>From the most express malice, the <em>want of probable cause cannot be </em>implied.\u201d 1 T. <em>R. 544, </em>545. In the case of <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Thilman, </em>3 Call, 3. Judge <em>Lyons </em>delivered the resolution of the court, that the plaintiff ought to have alleged the want of probable cause; and that the omission was not cured by the verdict. In that of <em>Young </em>v. Gregory, <em>(ibid. </em>446.) an averment that the prosecution (which was. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>an attachment in a foreign country) was instituted without any legal or justifiable cause, was held not to amount to an averment of the want of probable cause. Judge Lyons, in that case, said, that he did not think it indispensably necessary that those very words, and none other, should be used; for any which are tantamount, and calculated to bring the probable cause fairly into issue, would be sufficient. And he rather inclined to think the words <em>justifiable cause </em>are of that kind. But he thought the declaration defective on another ground, and pressed the point no further. These decisions have gone abroad among the gentlemen of the profession, and they will be now better advised as to the necessity of this averment, than they could have been from the mass of conflicting opinions upon the subject, which occur in the <em>English </em>books. I think a uniform practice, and a uniform course of decisions upon practical points, of too much importance not to subscribe cheerfully to the former decisions of this court; and am, therefore, of opinion, that the judgment be affirmed. I therefore consider it unnecessary to notice the other points in the case, as this <em>alone </em>must decide it.</p>\n<author id=\"b41-3\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"AD7h\">In the cases of <em>Ellis </em>v. Thilman, and <em>Young </em>v. Gregory, this court decided that, in an action on the case for a malicious prosecution, the want of probable cause is of the very <em>gist </em>of the action; that its non-existenob must be averred in the declaration; and' that the want of this averment is not cured by a verdict. The most that was admitted by any of the judges in those cases was, that similar or equipollent expressions might be sufficient. Nothing to impugn, this principle is to be found in any modern case that I have seen. The case of <em>Farmer </em>v. Darling<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> was relied on, in the argument, for that purpose; to show that it was necessary to <em>prove </em>the want of such cause on the trial; whence it seems to be inferred that it was not necessary to <em>aver </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>it in the declaration : but that case falls far short of that purpose. It came up on a motion for a new trial, and the sufficiency of the evidence to support the action was particularly discussed hy the court; but nothing was said by the court respecting the declaration, unless, indeed, that the contrary of what is contended for by the appellant\u2019s counsel is to be inferred from Lord Mansfield\u2019s introduction to the case, which runs in this manner : \u201c This action is for a malicious prosecution <em>\u2022without a probable cause.\u201d </em>If, therefore, I were to infer any thing from that case, as relative to the declaration, it would rather be to conclude (for the declaration is not reported) that it expressly averred the want of probable cause. This idea is again corroborated by its being agreed by the whole court in that case, \u201c that malice and the want of probable cause must <em>both </em>concur as the <em>grounds </em>of this sort of action.\u201d Both these grounds being necessary to entitle a plaintiff to recover, I should, upon the general principle, (and independently of any authorities whatsoever,) infer that they must both be stated,, as well <em>approved, </em>to entitle the plaintiff to a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"AC\">An attempt is made, however, to withdraw the present declaration from the effect of these decisions, by placing the action upon the ground of the writ of conspiracy at the common law, and by contending that the <em>conspiracy </em>in this case, and not the <em>bringing of the action, </em>is the essential part of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. The case of <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Gunton</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is directly in the teeth of this position. It was there held, in an action against three, which is pretty similar to the one before us, that the action was \u201c <em>an action on the case\u201d </em>and that, therefore, <em>(aliter </em>in a writ of conspiracy,) judgment would lie against <em>one </em>defendant, though the other was acquitted ; and that the \u201c substance of the action was the undue arresting of the plaintiff, and not the conspiracy.\u201d This idea of the court is entirely supported by a note of the learned editor of the late edition of <em>Saunders\u2019s Reports ; </em>by <em>Buller\u2019s N. P. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>p. 14.; by 1 <em>Bac. </em>94. and other <em>authorities; </em>which also lay it down, that it is the damage sustained by the plaintiff by the bringing the action, and not the conspiracy, which is the ground of the action j and that the insertion of the words <em>\u201cper conspirationem. inter eos </em>habitant\u201d does not convert the action into a formal action of conspiracy, but it nevertheless remains \u00e1n action on the case; that those words are mere surplusage, intended as matter of aggravation, and are, therefore, not necessary to be proved to support the action. This is further shown by its being also held, as aforesaid, that, in this action, all the other defendants may be acquitted except one, and he found guilty, notwithstanding the words <em>\u201c\u25a0per conspira</em>tionem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">The appellant\u2019s counsel are, therefore, mistaken in their aforesaid idea relative to the character of this action: it is substantially the same, as to the point in question, with the common action for a malicious prosecution, and stands on a common foundation with it, in respect of the necessity of the averment now in question. I do not deny but that there may have been considerable contrariety and diversity in the old books and entries on the subject; but I take it that this averment is, at this day, a <em>sine qua non </em>in actions for malicious prosecution, and must equally be <em>so </em>in the action before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">On this ground I concur with the district court in arresting the judgment, and am of opinion that its judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b43-6\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"A6h\">The declaration in this case being insufficient to maintain the action, it seemed to me unnecessary to consider the other errors filed in arrest of judgment; especially as the whole case has been fully discussed by one of the judges who has preceded me, Besides the <em>English </em>authorities cited on the occasion, we have two decisions of this court in point: and founded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>principally on those authorities: one fox' a malicious prosecution in a criminal, and the other in a <em>civil </em>case. In the fjrst? <em>Ellis </em>v- Thilman, the declaration stated that the defendant, \u201cwithout any just cause,\u201d prosecuted the plaintiff on a charge of his having feloniously taken a negro, the pi-operty of the defendant. In the other case, of <em>Young </em>v. Gregory, the declaration stated that the defendant, without any <em>legal or justifiable </em>cause, did attach, or cause to be attached, at Dunkirk, fifty hogsheads of tobacco, or the proceeds thereof, the property of the plaintiff. And this court, in both cases, adjudged that, for want of an averment in the declaration that the prosecution was without probable cause, the action could not (as the want of probable cause is the <em>gist </em>of the action) be sustained. I therefore concur in the opinion, that the judgment of the district court be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Judgment unanimously affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AVP\"><em> See </em>also <em>Salk. </em>174 2 <em>Ld.
