Browne </em>at the time of his death in her hands to be administered, and that the said <em>Judith, </em>at the day of the exhibition of the said bill, and ever after, had goods and chattels, which were of the said <em>William B. Browne </em>at the time of his death, in her hands to be administered, wherewith she could have paid the debt in the said bill specified; and that the said defendant\u2019s testator\u201d (meaning intestate) \u201c did not pay in his lifetime the debt in the declaration mentioned.\u201d The judgment was dated the 15th of <em>May, </em>1793; the <em>fieri facias </em>the 30th of <em>June </em>following. The order of court, committing the estate of <em>Judith Browne </em>to the hands of the sheriff, was made in <em>October, </em>1802; and that allowing the claim of <em>John D. Watkins, </em>administrator, &amp;c. in <em>February, </em>1803. It also appeared, from a copy of a record laid before the county court when the claim was allowed, that, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>10th of <em>June, 1797, </em>a suit was brought in the district court of <em>Williamsburg, </em>on the same administration bond now in question, (for the benefit of <em>William Clayton, </em>executor as aforesaid,) against <em>Charles Carter, </em>as security for the administratrix, and was determined in favour of the defendant, <em>(May 5, </em>1802,) upon a question submitted to the court by the jury, whether the defendant, \u201c as a security in the bond for the due administration, &amp;c. was liable to the plaintiffs in this action, before a judgment obtained against the administratrix in an action against her, charging a <em>devastavit.\"</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-3\">Upon this evidence, (being all that was exhibited in this cause,) the defendant\u2019s counsel moved the court to instruct the jury, \u201cthat it was necessary for the plaintiffs to produce the verdict of a jury, convicting the administratrix of a <em>devastavit, </em>in a suit for that purpose against her, before this suit can be maintained; and that, unless the plaintiffs produced such conviction, they should find for the defendantand the court instructed the jury to that <em>effect; </em>to which opinion of the court the plaintiffs excepted. The jury found for the defendant: judgment was rendered on the verdict; and the plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b47-9\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellants, relied on the following points:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-10\">1st. That, after judgment against the administratrix, as such, execution issued, and return of <em>nulla bona, </em>she having died intestate, and no person administering on her estate, the creditor had a right to proceed, immediately, on the administration bond, against her sureties. In the case of <em>Gordon's Adm'rs v. The Justices of Frederick,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it could not have been intended <em>to </em>require a second suit, suggesting a <em>devastavit, </em>in all cases. The inconvenience of such a rule would be extreme, and, in some cases, the bringing the second suit impossible; as where an executor has left the state, on purpose to prevent it. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>authorities collected by Serjeant Williams, in his note (8) to 1 <em>Saunders, </em>219. show the doctrine on this subject very fully, and do not justify the conclusion that the action suggesting the <em>devastavit </em>is the only way in which it can be fixed upon the executor. But,</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-5\">2dly. If further proceedings were necessary, the order against the sheriff (being the only step that could be taken in this case, before the suit on the administration bond) was sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-6\">3dly. The court\u2019s direction to the jury was clearly erroneous ; since an executor or administrator, by suffering judgment to pass by default, or on demurrer, might always prevent the plaintiff from putting the matter in issue before a jury; without which there could be no <em>verdict </em>convicting the defendant of a <em>devastavit.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-7\">4th. The plea of the general issue, (in so many words,) without expressing what plea was intended, was informal and <em>insensible ; and, therefore, there </em>should be a repleader.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AY\">Call, contra. I admit the plea is informal; but that is no ground of repleader.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-9\"><em>1. </em>The point is settled, that there must be two suits, before the suit against the sureties. It is contended that this has been sufficiently done. But the second suit required is to establish the point, devastavit, or not. Here the proceedings (as to the sheriff, &amp;c.) have only shown that <em>Judith Browne </em>had no property of her own; but not that she wasted the property of her intestate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-10\">2. The right of <em>Watkins, </em>the administrator <em>de bonis </em>non, to sue on the judgment obtained by <em>Clayton, </em>the executor, is also questionable. In 6 <em>Bac. </em>112. <em>(Gwill. edit.) </em>it is laid down, that where an executor obtains a judgment, and dies, the administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>cannot sue out a <em>scire facias, </em>but must bring a new trial.<footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>3. Another point makes the plaintiff\u2019s case very defective. A judgment against an executor does not bind his security, who may still controvert the <em>devastavit.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Therefore, in this suit, the plaintiffs were bound, in the first place, to prove that, once, there had been assets j then the security would have been bound to prove what had become of <em>them; </em>that they had been expended in due course of administration; but this the plaintiffs have not done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-4\">4. The judgment for the defendant, Carter, in a former action for the same cause, is a bar to this action.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-5\"><em>Wickham, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIQ\">The last point is not law. This suit was for a new cause of action accruing after that judgment. According to Mr. <em>Call\u2019s </em>own doctrine, the right of action against the security accrues only by the judgment in the second suit against the executor. Here, after the judgment for the defendant had been given on the ground that the action against him was premature, we obtained a judgment against the estate of the administratrix, which judgment became the <em>gist </em>of the present action. The court of appeals cannot have intended that where a decree in chancery has been obtained for a balance against an executor, on a settlement of his administration account, to be paid <em>de bonis </em>propriis, a second suit should be necessary, before the creditor can sue the securities. In this case, the order was that the sheriff should pay out of the estate of <em>Judith Browne. </em>We did, therefore, what was equivalent to the second suit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-6\">The federal court, in the case of <em>Granbury </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>did indeed decide that a judgment against an execu tor was not binding on his securities; but certainly it is <em>prima facie </em>evidence, and of itself sufficient, if not controverted.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AWh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number><em>Wednesday, March </em>27th.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aec\">The Judges, Brooke, Tucker, and Fleming, (Roane not sitting in the cause,) pronounced their opinions.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b44-15\"> <em>Quare, </em>whether there may not he some exceptions to this rule ?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"Atf\"> <em>See Rev. </em>Code, vol. 167. also vol. 2 p. 120.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"Ail\"> 1 Munf. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b48-11\"> See the case of <em>Kirtley </em>v. <em>Deck, </em>3 H. <em>&amp; M. </em>388.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b48-12\"> Judge <em>Brooke </em>asked Mr. <em>Call </em>if this point had not been decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>otherwise in the case of <em>Backhouse </em>v. <em>Tabb, </em>in the federal court; to which he answered \u201c yes; but it never has been determined <em>in this court?'</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-6\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b49-12\"> <em>Granbury </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>in tie federal court; a case not reported.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-7\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A0W\">Judge Brooke.</author>\n<p id=\"Ag-\">Though I do not entirely subscribe</p>\n<p id=\"Anq\">to the opinion of the district court, delivered in its instruction to the jury in this <em>case; yet, </em>confining that opinion to the subject matter to which it related, I think it was correct enough.
