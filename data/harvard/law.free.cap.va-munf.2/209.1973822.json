A copy of a deed of trust from the testatrix to <em>Joshua Chaffn </em>and <em>Waller Ford, </em>dated the 20th of <em>October, </em>1807; 2d. A record <em>* </em>of certain proceedings in <em>Amelia </em>county court, for the / , , , , purpose ol trying whether the said <em>Anne Hughes </em>was a : . . * <em>r </em>lunatic, or person insane; 3d. A report oi certain commissioners, dated <em>December </em>the 8th, 1807, declaring her, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>at that time, a lunatic ; and, 4th.

She farther gave to <em>Anne </em>Hughes, daughter of <em>Blackburn Hughes, </em>a feather bed and furniture, and a riding-saddle <em>; </em>to <em>Folly </em>and <em>Henderson </em>(two of the negroes) a bed and furniture; to the negroes, for their support, all the provisions on hand at the time of her death, and the growing crop. All the remainder of her estate she directed to be sold, and, after paying her debts, to be equally divided between <em>George B. Hughes </em>and <em>John Hughes, </em>sons of <em>Blackburn Hughes. </em>She desired no appraisement or inventory to be taken of her estate, and appointed <em>Blackburn Hughes, Waller Ford </em>and <em>Parham Booker, </em>executors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-7\">By the codicil, she emancipated three negro children, whose names had been omitted in the will; bequeathed to <em>Henry </em>and <em>Polly </em>(two of the negroes) each a cow; and appointed <em>Waller Ford,' Joshua Chaffin, Blackburn Hughes </em>and <em>Parham Booker, </em>executors; desiring that they should not be compelled to give security for their executorship.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-8\">By the deed of trust she \u201c granted, bargained, sold and confirmed to <em>Joshua Chaffin </em>and <em>Waller Ford, </em>and to their heirs for ever, all her estate, both real and personal, to wit, a tract of land containing 186 acres, twenty-six slaves, (by name,) her stock of every kind, household and kitchen furniture and plantation utensils, and also all debts that were then due to her by bond or otherwise, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>that might thereafter become due, and the reversion and reversions, remainder and remainders thereof, and all the estate, right, title, interest, property, claim and demand whatsoever, of her the said <em>Nancy Hughes, </em>of, in, and to the premises j\u201d covenanting for herself and her heirs, to warrant and \u201c for ever\u201d defend the same to the said <em>Chaffin </em>and <em>Ford, </em>and their heirs ; \u201c Nevertheless upon this special trust, that they, or the survivor of them, shall take into their possession every part of the estate herein mentioned, and have the sole management thereof, and the profits arising therefrom to be paid unto the said <em>Nancy Hughes, </em>annually, for her benefit and support, during her natural life; and it is the true intent and meaning of these presents that, at the death of the said <em>Nancy Hughes, </em>every thing herein contained between the parties is to become null and void.\u201d This deed was duly recorded the 22d of <em>October, </em>1807.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-4\">On the part of the appellee, <em>Waller Ford, </em>and <em>Dudley Seay, </em>the subscribing witnesses to the paper purporting to be a will, clearly proved the competency of the testatrix to make a will on the day of its date. It also appeared in evidence that, in the year before her death, but on what day was not stated, she made another will; but <em>Waller Ford, </em>one of the subscribing witnesses to that instrument, (by whom also it was written,) did not think her competent then. He said the slaves were emancipated in both. The second will was not produced; but <em>Ford </em>deposed that it differed from the first only in this, that, in the second, she left some provision to compensate Mr. <em>Chaffin </em>and himself for their trouble. \u201c As a lawsuit concerning the will was expected, the estate was directed to be kept together until the decision of the lawsuit, and they were to have the profits until it should be decided. The land, also, (to the best of the recollection of the witness,) was directed, in the second will, to be sold, and he believed the negroes were to be hired out until the suit should be decided; that the hire of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>negroes, and use of the money for which the land should be sold, was, in like manner, to go to compensate them for their trouble ; and (a law having passed for removing out of the state negroes that should be emancipated) the second will directed the expense of removing them to be paid out of that money. But as to this, the witness was not very particular; neither was he so in writing the will. He stated that at that time, the testatrix could hardly speak at all, and appeared quite like a child; seeming, at some lucid intervals, to have some sense, but not enough to make a will; that Mr. <em>Chaffin </em>told him in what manner she wanted to have it written j and, when it was finished, he gave it to a negro, and told him to give it to Mr. <em>Chaffin. </em>He thought it of no account ; otherwise would have been more particular.\u2019*</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-6\"><em>Dudley </em>Seay, the other subscribing witness to the second will, but who was not present when it was written, and knew nothing of its contents, deposed that he thought her. competent, at that time, to make a will; having, had many dealings with her about the time; and that Mr. <em>Ford </em>and she both declared in his presence that it had been read to her, and she was satisfied with it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AGAZ\">Mr. <em>Ford </em>moreover deposed that he was present when the testatrix signed the deed of trust; that she asked him whether her executing that deed would interfere with her- will, and he told her that, in his opinion, it would not. She seemed very anxious lest her negroes might not be free, and said she would not execute any writing that would interfere with her will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A8C\"><em>Dudley Seay </em>was also a witness to the deed, and deposed that she assigned, as a reason for making it, that her brother and relations were going to have trustees appointed, and she thought, if there were to be any, she pught herself to haye the choice of them.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Doctor <em>Bathurst </em>Randolph, one of the commissioners appointed by the county court of Amelia, was also examined, and stated his opinion that Mrs. <em>Hughes </em>was in a state of mental derangement, not only at the time of her being examined by the commissioners, but a long time before. His impression (though he could not be positive) was, that she must have been, diseased both in mind and body six months or more. <em>Dudley Seay </em>also saw her then, and did not think her as sound as formerly, but supposed it proceeded from her being disturbed by the number of people about her : she had been bed-ridden, and was in that situation when the commissioners came to examine her.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b233-10\">Leigh, for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ays\">submitted, without comment, the evidence as to the sanity of the testatrix at the time the will was executed; and insisted,</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-11\">That (allowing the will to have been good in its origin) it underwent, during the testatrix\u2019s life, a twofold revocation; 1. By her deed of trust subsequently executed, and comprising the whole subject of the will; 2\u00bb By the commission of lunacy afterwards issued, and never revoked, by the court of <em>Amelia.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-13\">1. By the trust deed, <em>Anne Hughes </em>conveyed to the trustees the; whole legal estate meant to be disposed of by the will, in respect both to subject matter and quantity of interest; subject to the trust expressly declared by the deed\u2014which was a trust for her support during life ; and (where such declaration of trust stopt short) to the use implied by law\u2014a resulting use to her heirs at her death,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> This would be, without doubt, the legal effect of the deed, but for the clause avoiding it at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>death of <em>Hughes. </em>Now, as every part of a deed should (if possible) be made to take effect, and every word to operate in some shape or other <em>;</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and as the words of inheritance, (they are peculiarly strong,) limiting the legal estate in this deed, cannot fully enure, if at all, on any other construction; it is, therefore, a just construction to refer this clause of avoidance, not to the legal estate vested in the trustees, but to the trust estate vested in the grantor, so as to determine the latter only, and not the former, with her death. The like words of inhei-itance, in a trust deed, have been adjudged to pass the whole legal estate to the <em>trustees.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And it was formerly held that even in a will, where the construction is more liberal, if a particular estate be expressly devised, a contrary intent is not to be implied.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> Still less should such looseness of construction be admitted of a deed. Therefoi'e, though by this clause of avoidance, <em>Anne Hughes\u2019s </em>trust estate ceased with her life, yet the legal estate of the trustees continued, the use thereof (which the statute of uses executed into possession) resulting to her heirs. But if this view be erroneous, and the clause of avoidance be applicable to the legal estate vested in the trustees, then they took by the deed a base fee determinable by the grantor\u2019s death. But still they took a fee. And there is no difference, in point of ampleness and quantity of estate, between a base qualified fee-simple, and afee-simple pure and <em>absolute.</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Such, then, being the nature and effect of the deed, it is in law an absolute revocation of the previous will disposing of the same subject. For the property devised by a will must remain in the testator, in the same plight, and unaltered, to the time of his death; for any alteration, or new modelling, will work a revocation.<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> So inflexible is this rule, that, though the alteration in the legal estate, in effect, leave the testator as to beneficial interest in the thing in the same plight as before, yet the will is thereby revoked.<footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark> Neither is there any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>mode of conveyance, or species of property, exempt from the rule. No matter whether the conveyance be by deed at common law, or deed operating under the statute of uses ;<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> nor whether the subject be equitable or legal ;<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> nor whether, if it be a trust, it be a limited or , , it resulting one;<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> nor whether it lie <em>m livery </em>or grant <em>m,</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>nor whether it be realty or personalty <em>:</em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in all cases, where the whole estate is conveyed away, though the ultimate reversion come back to the grantor by the same instrument, it operates as a revocation of a Will.<footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-14\">This principle goes the length of deciding the present case. Here, the same estate <em>in </em>omnibus, meant to be passed by the will, passed out of the testatrix by the deed. And that circumstance is conclusive: for that it is, which makes the basis of the rule, as is illustrated by . _ <em>J </em>the diverse effects of a mortgage in fee, or of a covenant \u00b0 to convey, according to the different views of courts of law and of equity. A mortgage in fee is a total revocation at law, and <em>pro tanto </em>only in equity ; because, at law, such a mortgage is regarded as a conveyance, but in equity only as a pledge, a mere chattel interest: a covenant to \u2022 ,\u2022 \u00bb \u00bb , convey is a revocation m equity, but not at law <em>; </em>because, as it may never be performed, it passes no estate at all at law, while equity considers it as tantamount to an actual conveyance.<footnotemark>(g)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-32\">If objected, that here was no intent to revoke the will by the deed, the fact is agreed: but the same objection would equally apply to almost every case of revocation implied from alteration in the estate of the testator, and has been often overruled ; such revocation being a consequence of law, and the intention immaterial. Not to mention weaker cases that abound and concur\u2014revoca- . tions oi prior wills have been implied from alterations in the estate, necessarily and expressly done, to effectuate, and to confirm the will. <footnotemark>(h)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>It may be objected, that on the testatrix\u2019s death, ih\u00e9 use of the estate being no further limited, resulted to her heirs, and so they Were in of the old us\u00e9 again, and that precisely at the moment when the trust estate under the deed ceased, and the interests derived from, the will commenced; therefore, the deed did not interfere with, the will. But the estate came back by a new limitation, and (whether so intended or not) the deed was incompatible with, and so revoked, the will.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> And in Par<em>sons </em>v. Freeman, Lord Hardwicke said, \u201c If one seised in fee devise, and then levy a fine to his own use in fee, this has always been held a revocation, though the testator was in of his old use,\u201d which he thought&lt;s a <em>pro</em>digious strong caseand truly so it was-; for so completely was it the old use, that if the estate be derived <em>ex parte materna, </em>the descent is not diverted from the maternal blood by such new limitation.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> Now, if such a conveyance as that, which passes the estate out of testator, instantaneously to return, be a revocation of a Prior win; much more shall the deed, in the principal case, work such revocation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-21\">As to the reason of the rule\u2014favour to the heir; the reason of favouring our system of descents is as strong in regard to our policy, as is the reason of favouring the <em>British </em>system, in regard to theirs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AF5R\">It may be said, the rule contended for is but the general rule, subject, like all others, to exceptions. Agreed. But this case resembles none of those exceptions, in fact or in principle. It is not like a testator changing by deed the trustees of a trust estate devised by prior will; which is no revocation ;<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> nor like partition between tenants in common <em>;</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>nor like a subsequent surrender v of a copyhold before devised <footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>nor like the case where v ' . several deeds make one conveyance, and a devise, m the interval between the first and last, is held not revoked by the last, because all parts of the conveyance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>and relate to the beginning; <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> no: like the case put by Lord HARDWICKE, in Parsons V Freeman, of a testator subsequently converting an equl table estate disposed of by will into a legal one; whici he thought would not revoke the will ;<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> though h~ afterwards mentioned this opinion doubtingly; <footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> an the converse thereof is certainly not true.<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> Williams v. Owens<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> was decided on similar ground, it bein~ held, that the will there operated on an equitable estate and that the subsequent deed had no other effect than tc give the devisor a legal, in place of the equitable estate of which he was seised at the time of making the will The decision, however, was afterwards questioned,<footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark> explained,<footnotemark>(g)</footnotemark> and finally exploded. <footnotemark>(h)</footnotemark> The case of Loyd v. Spillet<footnotemark>(i)</footnotemark> is a distinct one, decided on the ground, thai there nothing more was done by the deed than to affirm the will, in order to secure the object of both in all events, and, therefore, the trustees in the deed were held trustees for the benefit of the will. Tht case does not touch our question. But it may be objected, lastly, that the deed in this case was only for a particular purpose, and so a revocation of the will only pro tunto. But the excepted cases out of the general rule of revocation, grounded on the deed being for a particular purpose, and so a revocation pro tanto. only, \"have been confined to mortgages and securities for money, and to other con- veyances for raising money to pay debts.\"<footnotemark>(k)</footnotemark> The opinion of Lord Chief Justice Eyre, indeed, in Goodtitle v. Otway,<footnotemark>(l)</footnotemark> would extend the bounds of such excep- tions: but the rest of the court differed from him, and their judgment was affirmed in K. B.<footnotemark>(m)</footnotemark> And in that case, the will was revoked by the passing of a base fee out of the devisor. In Lord Lincoln's case,<footnotemark>(n)</footnotemark> \"nothing could be more decidedly particular than the purpose for which he made the dced\"-to provide for a marriage that never took place, and never was likely, nay, never in- VOL. ih (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>tended to take place. Yet was the deed held to revoke the will <em>in toto ; </em>and the decree has been repeatedly, by the highest authorities, and sometimes against the strongest inclination to renounce it, recognised for law.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Nay, where the particular purpose of the subsequent conveyance has been to confirm the will, the conveyance, passing the estate devised out of the testator, has been held (as we have before seen) to revoke the will. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> The truth is, although the conveyance, whereby an estate before devised is altered, be evidently for a particular purpose, yet if the whole estate be affected thereby, the conveyance will work a revocation of the will ;<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> and to make such conveyance a revocation <em>pro tanto </em>only, not only its purpose must be particular, but its effect partial.<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-17\">2. But admit this reasoning to be fallacious or inapplicable, if the deed was not, the commission oF lunacy \u25a0was, a revocation of the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b238-18\">According to both civil and common law, a subsequent lunacy is no revocation of a prior will:<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> but our law, in effect, compels lunatics to die intestate, <footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark> The clause referred to expressly intends, not hospital lunatics, but those in custody of committees. It has been thought that this clause was designed, not to compel, but to provide for, the intestacy of lunatics; but on that construction it is unnecessary and idle. To all objections to the effect of this commission, on the score of irregularity in the proceeding whence it resulted, I answer, that this court is not now reviewing, in an appellate character, that proceeding; and that, though it be not conformable to the course of the <em>English </em>chancery in like <em>cases,</em><footnotemark><em>(g)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the paramount authority of our own law has been substantially <em>pursued; </em>for the clause before quoted ordains the appointment of a committee for \u201c all idiots and lunatics in like manner as before directed\u201d for hospital idiots, &amp;c. and for these latter the courts are expressly authorized to appoint committees.<footnotemark>(h)</footnotemark> Regular inquests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>on such occasions, are unnecessary and unwonted in <em>Firginia. </em>Nor was the commission of lunacy in this case ever revoked: there are but two ways it could be done\u2014 by <em>scire facias,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which is obsolete; or by petition in chancery <em>:</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and here no such proceeding was ever had.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"An0\">In one way or the other, or both, therefore, the will of <em>Ann Hughes </em>has been in law revoked ; and it has been settled in this court,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> that such implied revocations are cognisable before courts of probate.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b239-13\"><em>David </em>Robertson, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbI\">1st. As to the alleged revocation by the deed of trust. If any of the authorities quoted have any application, I am much mistaken. If they did apply, this court should not be bound by adjudications, the absurdity of which some of the .BrzizsAjudges admit to be \u201c shocking.\u201d<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> But, in fact, the cases cited have no bearing on the subject; for no , , , , . , . , . . case has been produced m which an express intention not <em>\u2022 </em>\u2022 \u2022 <em>to revoke </em>the will appeared in evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-23\"><em>The </em>object of the deed was to convey an estate, for the life only of Mrs. <em>Hughes, </em>to the same gentlemen who were to be her executors. The whole instrument must be taken together; the restrictive or explanatory clause in connection with the donative. There was no such clause in any of the cases relied upon by Mr. <em>Leigh. </em>There is not the smallest incompatibility between the deed and will in this case. The will took effect at the death of the testatrix, and she was very anxious to prevent it from being set aside.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-25\">All the cases cited are reducible to two classes; 1st. Where there was a conveyance of the whole property immediately <em>; </em>(that of a common recovery is a striking example;) 2d. Where a party, having a temporary interest, surrenders it, and takes a different interest in exchange.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-27\">The revocation must always arise from a change of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>the intention of the testator, or, necessarily, from the change of his estate ; neither of which is the case here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-12\">2d. As to the revocation by the commission of lunacy. A greater absurdity would result from this proposition than from the other. Our act of 1792, concerning wills, (passed <em>December </em>14th, 1792,) says that a will shall not be revoked, but by cancelling, or <em>by </em>a subsequent will, codicil, or declaration in writing.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Yet it is contended that by an act of the same session of assembly, (passed <em>December </em>24th,) a will is declared to be, <em>ipso </em>facto, revoked by a subsequent privation of understanding <em>! </em>But these two acts may stand very consistently together.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-13\">The clause in question in the act concerning lunatics has not introduced a new rule.' Its intention was only to prevent the property of the lunatic from going to the commonwealth j as, at common law, it went to the king. It is, indeed, literally copied from the statute of 17 <em>Edw. </em>II. c. <em>10.;</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>except as to the last clause, which gave the estate <em>pro salute </em>qnimce, whereas in this country it goes to the relations. But here, as well as in England, a previous will is. not to be set aside,</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-14\">A different construction would establish the strange position that all persons who may lose their senses by disease are compelled to die intestate, however judicious wills they may have previously made! A man\u2019s being pvertaken by madness ought no more to operate a revocation, (on the ground that he might have intended to revoke,) than sudden death has such effect, In that case an intention to revoke may be <em>defeated; </em>but inconveniences of this nature cannot be guarded against. All that can be done is to lay down general regulations.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-15\"><em>George K. </em>Taylor,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ab6\">on the same side, contended that, this being an appeal from a court of probate, if the will b.e made out according to the act of assembly, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>must admit it to record ; the court of probate having nothing to do with implied revocations : but he observed that future litigation might be prevented if the court\u2019s opinion could be obtained upon all the points in dispute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-4\">The will is good as to whatever property may not be conveyed by the deed : for the general residuary clause might operate upon property, afterwards acquired, and therefore not conveyed. The court, then, should say, \u201c Let it be recorded; let the executor qualify : if any part has been revoked, the person entitled will not be injured ; and others will get that to which they are entitled.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-5\">The rule is the same in relation to revocations of wills of personal estate as of real, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Let us see, then, whether the deed in this case was a revocation as to either.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-6\">There must be a concurrence of the intention and act, in a subsequent instrument, to operate a revocation of a former: in the same manner as tearing a will is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of revocation, but accidental or unintentional tearing is not a revocation. Therefore, in <em>Onions </em>v. <em>Tyrer, </em>1 <em>P. Wms. </em>343. a new will repeating the old <em>totidem verbis </em>was decided not to have the effect of a revocation; and in Harwood v. <em>Goodnight, Cowp. 87.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a subsequent will, though found by the jury to contain a different disposition from a former, was considered no revocation ; the particulars of the difference between the two instruments being unknown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-7\">Such is the doctrine as to express revocations; and it equally applies to such as are implied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-8\">Mr. <em>Leigh </em>and myself agree in the law, that a conveyance of the whole estate is an implied revocation; but we differ as to the question of fact, whether the deed in this case conveyed all the estate. It clearly was but a conveyance for the life of the grantor. Suppose, in the body of the deed, it had been, \u201c To them and their heirs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>for ever, during my life, and no longer,\u201d would not the estate conveyed have been for life merely ? And is not the effect the same where there is a condition or defeasance limiting the duration of the deed to the party\u2019s life ? 0 . . _ , . For the court must construe it all together; and, it this be done, what is it but a lease of her lands, and hire of her slaves, for her life ? If it ever was a grant of the whole interest in either, at what time was it so ? Before the concluding clause was added? Surely not; because then the deed was not signed; and when sealed and acknowledged, was it not together with the limitation ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-8\">It may be said that a deed is to be taken most strongly against the grantor. Agreed <em>; </em>when the court is reduced to that melancholy alternative. But there is no intricacy or ambiguity in the language of this deed. The trustees could not claim the estate to them and their heirs, in opposition to the defeasance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-9\">There never was, for a single moment, a devestment of all her estate, right and interest; in which respect this case differs from that of <em>Goodtitle </em>v. <em>Otway, 7 T. R. </em>399. and <em>Lord Lincoln\u2019s Case, 1 Eq. Cas. Abr. </em>411. There was no defeasance on the face of the deed in either of those cases; the first of which comes nearest to the present, of any cited by Mr. <em>Leigh. </em>As the court, I trust, will not be disposed to extend the doctrine of revocations farther than it has gone, they will decide that there was no revocation here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARk\">2d. As to the operation of the act of assembly concerning lunatics, all the <em>English </em>authorities are, that subsequent lunacy shall not revoke a will.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> And those authorities apply here, because our act is copied from the <em>English </em>statute, except the last clause. But the act itself removes every <em>difficulty; </em>for it does not say that the lands and chattels shall be distributed as if the lunatic had died intestate, (so as to abrogate any will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>which he may have made,) but it merely refers to the *ct of descents. Now the act of descents, in its terms, provides for the distribution in the manner therein directed, in case of intestacy <em>\u2022, </em>but not where there is a will.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b243-10\">Wickham, on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATO\">It appears strange to me that in this, as a court of probate, the point about implied revocation should have been made, in this case. An implied revocation of the whole will may be considered by the court of probate.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> But the case is otherwise with respect to implied revocations of particular bequests. According to the case of, <em>Beard </em>v. Beard, 3 <em>Atk. </em>73. even \u201c though all the legacies be revoked, yet, the executor continuing, the will must be proved, and he becomes a trustee for the next of kin.\u201d All Mr. <em>Leigh's </em>cases are of wills which had been admitted to probate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-12\">On the merits, whether the will was revoked, or not, the <em>English </em>authorities, I admit, are not to be departed from. But they are founded on the technical construction of the statute of wills; and, if not, do not apply to this case. Mr. <em>Leigh's </em>premises, that all the interest was parted with by the deed, are clearly not founded in law. Two erroneous positions are the <em>substratum </em>of his whole argument; first, that an estate to <em>A. </em>and his heirs for the life of <em>B. </em>is a fee-simple ; and, secondly, that a like estate for 500 years, though carved out of the fee-simple, is the whole estate. An estate <em>pur autre </em>vie, or for any number of years, is not even a base fee) though conveyed for the limited time to the donees and their heirs.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abe\">This fallacy, therefore, being removed, the superstructure falls to the ground) for there is not a <em>dictum, </em>to show that, where a part onlv of the estate is conveved by a subsequent deed, the will is not good for the balance) and the doctrine laid down in <em>Brydges v. The </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number><em>Duchess of Chandos, 2 Ves. </em>jun. 428. is express that, m such case, the will is good <em>pro tanto.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXZ\">But, even if the question as to a devise of land were against us, the rule would be otherwise in relation to \u2022 ademption of legacies, which depends altogether upon the intention of the testator, according to the circumstanCes of each case.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> And it should be remembered that .... the parties contending in this cause are interested only in the slaves. <em>Ned </em>Hughes, the devisee of the land, is not a party.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2j\">Another point, also, is in itself conclusive in our favour, viz. that parol evidence is admissible to rebut an implied revocation.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkhD\"><em>, </em>, . , . . <em>r </em>, As to the question upon the commission or lunacy, tbe act assembly concerning lunatics<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> ought not to be construed as repealing the 3d section of the act concerning <em>wills.</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Both laws took effect on the same day, (the 1st of October, 1793,) by virtue of the suspending act, passed <em>December </em>28, 1792 <em>;</em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and both, being <em>in pari </em>materia, should be considered together. No more violence would be done by interpolating the words \u201c in case of intestacy,\u201d after the word \u201c distributed\u201d in the 17th section of the act concerning lunatics, (for the purpose of effectuating the obvious intention of the legislature,) than was done in the case of <em>Browne </em>v. <em>Turber</em>mile, 2 <em>Call, </em>398. by interpolating the words \u201cin case of an infant,\u201d in the 7th section of the act of descents.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b244-27\">Botts,'in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AD-I\">As to the parol proof of <em>Ann Hughes's </em>declarations, that she did not intend to revoke her will; such proof is admissible to repel, or fortify, presumptions arising, 1. From marriage and birth of a child;<footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark> 2. From cancelling, defacing, tearing, obliterating or burning the will;<footnotemark>(g)</footnotemark> 3. From imperfect memoranda which may have been made with, or without, the testator\u2019s intent <em>;</em><footnotemark><em>(h)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>4. Or, from any other presumptive facts. But the imnort and effect of words in a deed cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>contradicted, explained or controlled by such proof. There is no case or <em>dictum </em>for <em>it; </em>and the general rule is expressly against it. Mr. <em>Taylor </em>knew this, and therefore did not contend for the doctrine.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-4\">But the revocation depends not on intent, but a rule of law ;<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> and the rule itself is based on twenty-four concurring cases without one contradicting.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abv\">The rule is admitted to be binding and conclusive where the deed conveys the whole estate. But it is objected that, in this case, the deed is only for a life estate. J , \u2019 <em>. r </em>According to the rules of construction of deeds,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> the court is to reconcile the different parts, if possible, but, if there be two clauses totally repugnant, the first shall be received, and the latter <em>rejected; </em>keeping- also in view the maxim that the deed is to be taken most strongly against the grantor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-9\">Applying these rules to the present case, it is to be observed that the conveyance is of all the estate to the trustees, their heirs and assigns (not during the life of <em>Anne </em>Hughes, but) \u201c foreverto be held by them \u201c forever and she warrants to them \u201c forever.\u201d This important word \u201cforever\u201d has not been noticed by the counsel for the appellee. It is three times repeated, is stubborn and inflexible, and its empire over the deed cannot be destroyed but by a violence reaching to the heart of that instrument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-10\">The latter clause is, therefore, irreconcilable with \"the former, and must be rejected; especialfy since this construction is most strongly against the grantor. In case of a mortgage, the proviso is that, on payment of the money, every thing is to be <em>void; </em>yet, at law, the fee is in the mortgagee from the moment of execution, even before payment; and a release is necessary to reconvey <em>lt;</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>though in the different parts of a mortgage there Is no repugnancy. \u201c I give to <em>A. </em>a tract of land for ever, in case 1 do not pay him a sum of money by a cesv <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>tain day ; and if I do pay it, then I do not give him the land,\u201d is sense, and common to mortgages: but \u201c I give to <em>A. for ever, </em>to have <em>for life,\u201d </em>is a contradiction in terms. The argument is stronger, then, for vesting the fee-simple in the trustees, under this deed, than in the case of a mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-10\">Ijt is said that the court of probate is to consider .express revocations only. But according to the authorities; its powers are certainly more extensive.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> It is also said that some pittance, not comprehended in the deed-, might have passed by the will: but she conveyed all by the deed; was bedridden until her death; and it is not probable that, after executing the deed, she acqui\u00bb red any property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-11\">But \u201c the will should be recorded to give validity tQ the appointment of the executor!\u201d The gentlemen are welcome to this fish out of water, this general without an army, this executor of a will without any will to execute! But in <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Rootes, 1 Wash. </em>141. the court rejected the office, with the will, though the point was made ; and, in that case, the marriage and birth of a child furnished no presumption of revocation of the executor\u2019s office.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-12\">If the will be not revoked as to one thing, while it is as to another, it ought to be recorded only for the purpose for which it is good; for, if admitted generally, it is conclusive as .to every part, unless set aside by bill in equity; and thdse who contested the probate cannot be Received, afterwards, to file a bill.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-13\">Mr. <em>Wickham, </em>was the only counsel who said there was a distinction, between the two species of property, with respect to the effect of a revocation. The cases referred to by Mr. <em>Leigh </em>related not to land only, but personal property; for example, <em>Rudstone </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>2 <em>Vez. </em>sen. 418. and <em>Hone </em>v. <em>Medcraft, </em>1 <em>Bro. Ch. Rep. </em>264. The court, in both those cases, considered personal estate as governed, in this respect, by the same rules as real.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>But in this ease, if the deed revoked the first will, as to land only, the revocation was extended to personals <em>by </em>the second will. The act of assembly<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> only requires a subsequent will to be \u201c in writing,\u201d to make it effectual to revoke a <em>former; </em>not that it shall be proved by two witnesses. 1 he testimony is, indeed, contradictory as to the sanity of the testatrix at the time of making the second will. <em>Seay </em>and <em>Ford, </em>the two subscribing witnesses, differ on this point; but <em>Seay </em>is most to be relied upon, since he declares himself to have been more intimately acquainted with Mrs. <em>Hughes, </em>and therefore better qualified to form a judgment on the subject.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-10\">\n<em>Wickham.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArG\"><em>Ford </em>proves that she had lucid intervals: he was called in to write the will, and had the best opportunity of knowing the state of her mind at the time. He says, too, it was not her intention to revoke the former will. The case of <em>Cogbill </em>v. <em>Cogbill, 2 H. </em>&amp; <em>M. </em>467. proves that a subsequent will may be made without-revoking a former.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-13\">\n<em>Batts.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjUB\">The second will ought certainly t\u00f3 be produced to clear up this point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-14\"><em>Cur. adv. </em>vult.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b247-15\">Tuesday, <em>June </em>25th.</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b232-9\"> Note.
