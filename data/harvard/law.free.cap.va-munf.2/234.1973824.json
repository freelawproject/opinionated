When, in the context of a will, the testator has explained his own meaning in the use of certain words, the court should take <em>that </em>as their guide, without resorting to <em>lexicographers </em>to determine what those words ought to signify in the abstract, or to adjudicated cases to discover what they have been decided to mean under different circumstances.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AsT\">THE contest in this case arose on the following clause in the will of <em>Thomas Bryan Martin : </em>\u201c I devise ant^ bequeath to my present housekeeper, <em>Betsey </em>Powers, an(] her heirs, if she be alive at the time of my death, one thousand acres of land, as described by a survey made by <em>George </em>Bell, dated the.\u2014 --day of July, <em>m </em>the year 1794, whet;e I now live, together with all houses thereon, and all the appurtenances and crops thereon, whether gathered or growing at the time of my death, and all the implements of husbandry used, or intended to , k be used, upon the said land, and one half my stock of horses, cattle, sheep and hogs, and all my household goods and furniture, (except my plate and watch,) and, moreover, the choice of ten slaves to be made by herself.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>The suit was brought in the county court of <em>Frederick, </em>by <em>William Carnagy, </em>and <em>Betsey </em>his wife, (late <em>Betsey </em>Powers,) claiming all the crops ; not only those that were growing on the 1,000 acres the year in which the testator died, but also those that were severed at the time of his death, whether made in that year, or the preceding year ; whether made on that particular tract, or on the adjoining plantations, and brought thither to be stored.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-6\">The plaintiffs also claimed the liquors, books, and various other articles mentioned in a schedule annexed to the bill, viz. \u201c A spyglass, <em>7 </em>empty double barrels, 11 do. single, a pair of large brass scales, 4 hogsheads, a copper tea urn, a large mahogany chest, 2 large brass sifters, 6 hearth stones, 2 crow-bars and 2 sledge hammers, a garden pitcher, 2 grindstones, all the narrow axes, 1 steel apple mill, 1 do. corn mill, 2 large jack screws, 1 brass bushel, <em>77 </em>barrels of flour, do. do. in the mill, 1 marble mortar, 1 marque, <em>3 </em>backgammon tables, 1 speaking trumpet, 1 large office press, 1 corn mill iron, 4 plough plates, 2 pair large money scales, and one iron chest.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-10\">The county court rendered a decree pursuant to the construction put on the will by the plaintiffs <em>; </em>but, upon an appeal, the chancellor of the district court of <em>Staunton </em>excluded all crops except those on the 1,000 acres the year of the testator\u2019s <em>death; </em>being of opinion that the words, \u201c Whether gathered or growing,\u201d were used \u201c to prevent such as should be severed before the 31st day of <em>December </em>from being assets in the hands of the executors.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-11\">He also excluded the liquors, books, and all other articles that did not come strictly within the idea of household furniture and implements of husbandry. On this branch of the controversy, his opinion was in the following words: \u201c The next difficulty arises on the devise of the household goods and furniture <em>; </em>for, I presume, none <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>can arise about the implements of husbandry : whatever is necessary or useful in carrying on the business of the farm are embraced by these words. Household goods, and household furniture must receive the same interpretation; for they are the same. In <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Pozulett, Arab; </em>605. household furniture is said to comprise every thing useful or convenient to the householder, or ornamental to the house; and that circumstances are to be considered in determining what will pass by it. But this definition or description of household furniture must be taken in a limited sense ; for, in the same case, it is held that books will not pass by it; though there was some evidence of the testator\u2019s intention to pass them. In <em>Bridgeman </em>v. <em>Dove, </em>3 <em>Atk. 176. </em>it is laid down that a library will <em>not </em>pass by a devise of furniture, and it is there said to have been so determined. In <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Tournay, </em>3 Vesey, jun. 311. it is said to have been determined that the word furniture does not include books or wine.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-9\">\u201c The marque cannot pass under any construction of the will; nor the backgammon tables; for I cannot consider them more useful or ornamental than a library, and, more especially, as the devisee is a female, whom I will not presume either very skilful in the game, or inclinable to practise it. With respect to the spyglass, and speaking trumpet, I cannot bring them within any idea which I have of household furniture. It is true, that they may be useful and convenient to the proprietor: but not more so than a surveyor\u2019s compass, or a set of blacksmith\u2019s tools. The hearth stones, if intended for any of the houses upon the 1,000 acres, ought to pass: the intent of the testator must have been such. The corn mill iron (perhaps an iron corn mill is meant, as there is before mention made of a steel corn mill) if so, it passes; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>or, if it is the iron of a mill devised to the appellee <em>Eli</em>zabeth, it must also pass. The liquors, as before said, do not pass: nor can I consider the empty barrels, &amp;c. within the devise; they are not household furniture, nor implements of husbandry, though they might be useful in securing some of the products of the farm. The other articles in the schedule (except the flour, the right to which will depend on circumstances, one important one will be the crop out of which it was made) will, I think, pass by the devise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-5\">\u201c It has been contended that the exception of the testator\u2019s plate and watch affords evidence that every thing else was intended to pass by the devise; and that, though the plate would pass, yet the watch would not; and therefore the exception would have been idle and useless in any other view. But it must be observed that the plate and watch were intended as specific legacies to near relations, and reserved for that special purpose. The exception of the watch might be therefore connected with the plate, out of abundant caution.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-7\">The chancellor, therefore, reversed the decree of the county court, and directed an account to be taken of the several articles to which the appellees, <em>Carnagy and </em>Wife, were entitled, according to the principles, and subject to the restrictions, he had mentioned.

The judges pronounced their opinions.</p>\n<author id=\"b258-15\">Judge Cabell</author>\n<p id=\"AAe\">(after stating the case) proceeded as follows : This is not one of those cases in which we are obliged to bend the testator\u2019s intention to some stubborn rule of law. On the contrary, it is admitted, on all hands, that that intention (whatever it may be) must here prevail. And it appears to me that all the difficulties made in this case have arisen from attending to the common and natural acceptation of certain terms, rather than to the sense in which they are used by the <em>testator; </em>from considering those terms in the abstract, rather than as explained by other parts of the will, and the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>stances of this particular case. I can perceive nothing in the will calculated to restrict the devise of the crops as the chancellor has done. The expressions are broad and general, extending to all crops \u201c gathered or growing,\u201d and correspond with the liberal provision intended by the testator. The construction of the chancellor would render almost nugatory that part of the will which gives the crops \u201c gatheredfor, suppose the testator had died on the 1st of <em>April; </em>to what could the term \u201c gathered\u201d have applied, but to the crops of the preceding year r</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">With respect to the books, liquors, &amp;c. it is important to be observed that this was a devise in fee ; that the devisee took the lands, with all the houses, all their appurtenances, all the implements of husbandry, half the stocks of every kind, and all the household goods and furniture; and, even if the testator had left us to collect his intention from these circumstances only, I think the inference would have been extremely strong that, although, \u201chousehold goods,\u201d and \u201c household furniture,\u201d have in some cases been decided, and may in general be considered, synonymous, yet, in this case, the testator intended, by \u201c household goods,\u201d something more than mere \u201c furniture;\u201d that he intended every thing about the houses that had been usually held and enjoyed therewith, and that would tend to the comfort and accommodation of the householder. But this inference is rendered irresistible when we consider the exception of the \u201c watch,\u201d which the testator thought it necessary to make from this devise. There is not one article, in the whole list objected to by the executors, which would not fall under the idea of \u201c household goods,\u201d with as much, if not more, propriety, than the watch ; and yet the testator shows that these terms, as understood and used by himself, would have comprehended the watch, had it not been specially excepted. Of course, the articles not excepted must pass. The testator having explained his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>own meaning in the use of these terms, I shall take that my guide, without resorting to lexicographers to determine what the same terms ought to mean in the abstract, or to adjudicated cases to discover what they have been decided to mean under different circumstances. Without inquiring, therefore, what would, in general, not pass by the terms \u201c household goods and- furniture,\u201d but believing, from the particular circumstances of this case, that it was the intention of the testator to bequeath the articles objected to, I am of opinion that the decree of the chancellor be reversed, and that of the county court be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Judges Brooke and Fleming said that their sentiments were expressed in the opinion just pronounced.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Decree of the chancellor unanimously reversed, and that of the county court affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
