No administration of her estate was taken until <em>December, </em>1803, when <em>Richard Eppes </em>qualified as her administrator. <em>John Royall </em>departed this life, intestate, in the year 1802, possessed of all the slaves of which his father and his mother had died possessed, (except those whom he had sold,) and without leaving any lawfully begotten child.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-10\">An action of detinue was then brought, in the Peters\u00bb <em>burg </em>district court, by the administrator of <em>Lucy Royallf </em>against <em>John </em>Royall, who was one of the lawful co-heirs and distributees of the said <em>John </em>Royall, deceased, and also administrator, (but not charged as such in the declaration,) to recover the slaves <em>contingently </em>devised, as above mentioned, to the said <em>Lucy </em>and her heirs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-11\">The parties agreed a case, setting forth the will <em>in hasc verba; </em>the death of the testator and qualification of his executors, (one of whom, <em>William </em>Royall, is still living,) and the other facts aforesaid. It was also agreed that the defendant was the legal representative of <em>John Royall, </em>but not the legal representative or distributee of <em>Lucy Royall; </em>and that the slaves in question were part of those described in the will, as <em>\u201c\u25a0 </em>the negroes the testator had by his wife.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-12\">The case concluded with an agreement that judgment should be entered for the plaintiff for the slaves in the declaration mentioned, and one penny damages, if the court should be of opinion, first, that the limitation, to his wife, of the slaves which the testator had by her, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>ike event of <em>John\u2019s </em>dying without <em>heir </em>of his body was a legal and valid limitation ; and, secondly, that (notwithstanding the death of the said <em>Lucy </em>in the lifetime, of <em>John, </em>who was her only child and heir) the slaves, so limited to her on the death of <em>John </em>as aforesaid, became vested in the plaintiff as her administrator : but if the court should think otherwise, on either of these two points, judgment should be entered for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-6\">The declaration demanded \u201cthe following negro slaves, to wit, <em>Isbell and her three </em>children, of the value of thirty pounds each;\u201d without mentioning the names of the children. ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-7\">The district court, being .of opinion that the law was for the plaintiff, entered judgment that he recover against the defendant \u201c <em>the slaves Isbell, Tabb, Fanny </em>and, <em>Chenar, </em>in the .declaration mentioned, and one penny damages, and the costs;\u201d from which judgment the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b501-8\"><em>Hay </em>and Wickham, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b501-9\"><em>George K. Taylor </em>and <em>Call, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-10\">The first point made by the counsel for the appellant was, that the limitation to <em>Lucy Royall </em>was too remote, and therefore void; depending, not upon the event of <em>John\u2019s </em>dying without issue at the time of his death, but upon an indefinite failure of his issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-11\">In support of this position they took a general view of the authorities; relying chiefly on <em>Beauclerk </em>v. Dormer, 2 <em>Atk. </em>308. (in which all the previous cases were examined and commented upon by Lord Hardwicke,) and <em>Bigge </em>v. <em>Bensley, </em>1 <em>Bro. Ch. Rep. 187. </em>which differs from the present case only in this, that no bequest is made, in the will now in question, to <em>John. </em>In <em>that </em>case, too, as in <em>this, </em>the remainder over, in case of the death of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>first taker without issue, wa3 given to a person <em>in esse </em>ai the time when the will was written; which circumstance seemed to show that the testator could not have intended a failure of issue indefinitely, but only at the death of the first taker. Yet it was determined that the contingency was too remote, and the remainder over could not take effect, being to the remainder-man and his heirs. It is, indeed, settled that a devise for life to one <em>in </em>esse, to take place after a dying without issue, may be good? because in such case, the future limitation being only for life, it must necessarily take place during that life, or not at all; and therefore the failure of issue is confined to ^le comPass a life in being :<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> but that case is not like this; for here the limitation is to <em>Lucy Roy all </em>and her heirs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhBZ\"><em>On the other </em>side, it was contended, that the rule, by which a distinction is made between an indefinite failure of issue and a failure at the death of the first taker, is contrary to common sense; arising from a strained construction of wills, originally introduced in England, to carry into- effect, but now operating constantly to defeat, the intention of testators. It is generally agreed that the will must have effect where it conflicts with no positive legal rules ;<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> that where the courts decide against the plain meaning of the will, they universally express regret; and that, therefore, to get (\u201c in favour of common sense\u201d) around this difficulty, \u201c the most trifling circumstance is sufficient.\u201d<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> Will it, therefore, be deemed unpardonable, if every effort be used, in this case, to give common sense a liberation from the fetters in which pedantry and law jargon, two hundred years ago, bound her ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-12\">\u2022 The cases in <em>England </em>on this point are contradictory. In some of them, a limitation, after a dying without issue generally, is considered as identified with a limitation.' after a dying without issue at the time of the death of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>tiS\"sf taker,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> In others a different doctrine is laid down; not admitting this construction <em>ex vi termini; </em>but intending an indefinite failure of issue, unless the contrary intention be inferred from other expressions in the will.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> The general result from all these authorities is, that any expression which <em>can </em>indicate the testator\u2019s intention to take the case out of the old rule is to be effectual for that purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-7\">^ ^ But in this will there are not only trifling, but strong circumstances to show the intention.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-8\">The words \u201c then and in that case,\u201d are equivalent to the words, \u201c then after her decease,\u201d in <em>Pinbury </em>v. <em>Elkin, 1. P. Wms. 563. </em>which is recognised as authority in 2 Fearne, 191. and 1 <em>Call, </em>344. <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Bray. </em>It is said <em>y </em>that the case of <em>Pinbury </em>v. <em>Elkin </em>was overruled by 1 <em>Bro. 188. Bigge v. Bensley. </em>But surely the court of appeals of <em>Virginia </em>had a right to take the authority supported by common sense, in preference to later decisions which are opposed to it; unless a maxim be resorted <em>to </em>that <em>our </em>judges have no right to decide until permission be wafted over to them from the other side of the Atlantic !</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-22\">Again, the expression \u201cwithout heir of his body\u201d (in the singular number) is important: for although, with respect to devises of lands, the cases of Tilbury v. Barbut, 3 Atk. 583. and Hill v. Burrow, 3 Call, 342. are against us, there <em>is </em>no such decision in the case of be quest of personal property; and <em>Forth </em>v. Chapman, 1 P.<em>Wms. </em>667. shows, that even where the realty and personalty are devised in the same clause, a different construction, as to each, will take p<em>l</em>a<em>c</em>e.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-28\">In addition to all this, the terms of the will are, that if <em>John </em>(the son) should die without issue, the widow should have all the negroes the testator had by her; and the brothers <em>Littlebury </em>and <em>John </em>should have the remaining part of the estate after the death of the widow. Hence it appears conclusively, that the testator could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>have contemplated an indefinite failure of issue, but only a failure at the death of his son <em>John; </em>because the negroes he had by his wife were living at the time of making the will; and it might have been impossible to trace their pedigrees at the end of, perhaps, one hundred years thereafter, which might have elapsed before an indefinite failure of issue ;<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> and because the bequest to the brothers, after the \u201c death of the widow,\u201d being good, (as not too remote,) the bequest to the widow herself must be good also ; taking effect prior in point of time t0 that of the brothers, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQla\"><em>In reply to these arguments </em>it was said, that the rule established in England, that where real estate is devised to <em>A. </em>and his heirs, and, if he die without issue, remainder over, it shall be considered an estate tail for the benefit of the issue, never was applicable to personal estate j with respect to which, originally, there could be no limitation over; it being the old maxim that a bequest of a chattel, for a day, was good for ever. This rigour was relaxed in <em>Matthew Manning's Case,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and by subsequent authorities,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> it is now settled that limitations over, in bequests of chattels, may take place ; but with this restriction, (to prevent perpetuities,) that the event, upon which the absolute right of property is to be vested jn the i^t taker, must happen within a life or lives in being.<footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> It is settled in England, that \u201c failure of issue\u201d must be considered indefinite failure, unless there be some other Words to tie down the failure within such period.<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> The position, that \u201cdying without issue\u201d (inv general terms) means \u201c dying without issue living at the time of the death,\u201d is not supported by any authority. In <em>Nichols </em>v. Hooper,<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> the legacy was payable \u201cwithin six months after the death of the survivor,\u201d &amp;c. In Tar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>get v. Gaunt,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> the words were, \"for his life and no longer, and, after his decease, to such of his issue as he by his will should appoint; and in case he should die without issue, then.\" &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-a\">In Hughes v. Sayer,<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> the bequest was to two persons, and if either should die without children, then to the survivor. In Pinbury v. Elkin,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> the testator gave his wife all his goods and chattels; provided, that if she shall die without issue by the said testator, then, after her decease, 801. should remain to his brother I. S.\" In Forth v. Chapman,<footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> the devise was \"to William and Walter, and if either of them should depart this life, and leave no issue of their respective bodies, then,\" &amp;c. The operative word there was leave, which was construed to confine the failure of issue to the time of their deaths, which was also the case in Atkinson v. Hutchinson, 3 P. Wms. 258. In Pleydell v. Pleydell,<footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> the ground of the decision was, that the former limitations being to sans, the dying without \"issue\" must mean \" such issue,\" 2. e. \"sons.'' <footnotemark>(f)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtO2\">None of these cases are in opposition to Beauclerk v. Dormer, <footnotemark>(g)</footnotemark> and Bigge v. Bensley,<footnotemark>(h)</footnotemark> in the former of which all the authorities were reviewed by Lord Hard-wicke, and in the latter, by Lord Thurlow, and the doctrine then laid down has never been departed from in any subsequent decision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AL1\">The act of 1776, docking entails, gave an opportunity to this court of introducing a new rule which might have been founded upon the spirit of that act; but this it failed to do, (declaring that the act had not the effect of altering the law in thi~ respect,) and adopted all the English authorities. In Dunn v. Bray,<footnotemark>(i)</footnotemark> the limitation was held to be good; the words being, \"in case my son William should die, and leave no lawful issue, then,\" &amp;c. The dictum of Judge Pendleton, concerning the effect of the word \"then,\"<footnotemark>(k)</footnotemark> was not the point decided. The word then\" has never been considered as sufficient to vary the construction, It is, in such cases, merely a word of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>relation, not an adverb of time <em>:</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but whether it be understood as one or the other, its effect is the same ; for, in either case, it refers to the failure of issue, without ascertaining when.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-14\">Neither does the word \u201c heir\u201d (in the singular number) make any difference. That word occurred in <em>Hill v. Burrow </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> Tate </em>v. <em>Tally,</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Eldridge </em>v. <em>Fisher</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>yet, in every instance, was considered by this court as equivalent to the word \u201c heirs since \u201c heir\u201d is <em>nomen collectivum, </em>comprehending not only immediate but future inheritors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-15\">In <em>Higgenbotham v, Rucker, </em><footnotemark>(e)</footnotemark> the limitation was not too remote ; the gift being \u201c to the daughter of the plaintiff and the heirs of her body, and in case she died without issue, that is, children of her body, the said slaves to return to the grantor.\u201d The meaning intended to be affixed to the word <em>issue </em>was there explained by the grantor himself, and very properly confined to issue living at the time of the daughter\u2019s death. But this case is not like that.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-16\">The circumstance that a particular family of negroes are the subject of the bequest cannot vary the construction. If the devise had been of a negro man, the limitation over would have been good, since it must have taken effect in his life, or not at all. But the case is otherwise with a woman and children devised over upon an indefinite failure of issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-17\"><em>The counsel for the appellant farther </em>contended, that, if the testator did not mean an indefinite failure of issue, but intended the limitation to take effect on the death of <em>John </em>in the lifetime of the widow, the limitation is void: not as being too remote, but because the contingency never happened; for she died in the lifetime of <em>John. </em>If it be contended that the limitation Over after the death of <em>John </em>fixes the time of failure to that epoch, whether <em>John </em>should die in her lifetime or not; the manifest intention of the testator was otherwise ; for the property was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number><em>to go </em>to her until the death of John, and there is another limitation over after her death.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-4\">\u25a0 <em>In the next place they </em>contended, that admitting the limitation to the widow was good, the slaves went to her son <em>John, </em>as <em>her </em>legal representative, who, according to <em>Cutchin </em>v. <em>Wilkinson, </em>1 <em>Call, </em>6. was entitled to the administration of her <em>estate; </em>and to all her property real and personal, (including this contingent interest,) by virtue of the acts of descents and distributions, since she died in <em>1793. </em>The defendant, therefore, is entitled, as legal representative of <em>John Royall.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-5\"><em>In answer to this, </em>it was said to be clear law, that, upon the death of <em>Lucy Royall, </em>her contingent interest in the slaves, which was a personal and not a real interest, belonged not to her heir, but to her executor or administrator. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-7\"><em>In reply, </em>it was said that the administration was surreptitiously granted to <em>Eppes, </em>the present plaintiff j that the beneficial interest was in <em>John </em>Royall, who should have been the administrator of his mother, whose debts and funeral expenses he paid; that the true meaning and intention of the case agreed, was to submit the question <em>who </em>had the substantial, beneficial interest? not as to the mere formal right: but if strict law was to be insisted upon, the plaintiff had no right to recover, it not being-stated that the executors of <em>Joseph Royall </em>ever assented to the legacy.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-10\"><em>To repel this </em>objection, the counsel for the appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>observed, that in <em>Hairston </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>the point, whether the assent of the executor was necessary, was expressly made in the case <em>agreed; </em>and there was no ground for inferring assent; but in this case there are strong circumstances in favour of such inference; it being agreed that <em>John Royall </em>the son held the property during his life, and that the defendant (his administrator) is in possession : the court, then, will not permit him to raise the <em>objection </em>that the executors have not assented to the legacy. Besides, he has expressly waived it, by agreeing that judgment shall be entered for the plaintiff, in case the court shall determine two specified points in his favour. This was a relinquishment of all technical objections, not involved in the points stated, on which he agreed to rest his cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-3\"><em>On the other side, </em>it was urged that matter of inference is not sufficient to prove the assent of the executor; for this is not a finding of the fact. Such facts as are necessary to decide the points submitted must be expressly found.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> The case agreed is therefore imperfect; but a <em>venire de novo </em>is not necessary, the merits being against the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-4\"><em>But in answer to this argument, </em>it was said that a case agreed, of the character of that now in question, is not like a special verdict. The plaintiff might have gone on to prove assent; if the defendant had not agreed to submit to the court\u2019s opinion upon two points of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-5\"><em>Two other objections </em>were taken by the appellant\u2019s <em>counsel; </em>1st. That the evidence stated in the case agreed, showing a possession by the defendant as administrator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number><em>of John Royall, </em>did not support the declaration, which was against him in his own right: and, 2dly. That the declaration failing to mention the names of <em>Isbell\u2019s </em>children, judgment could not be entered for them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-4\">The first of these objections was opposed, <em>on the other side, </em>by observing that <em>John Royall </em>had only an estate, for life in the slaves. The defendant, therefore, is himself a wrongdoer, and personally responsible; for he is not justified in holding as administrator. The second objection ought not to be regarded, because, according to the maxim \u201c <em>partus sequitur ventrem ,\u201d </em>if the court shall decide that the plaintiff is entitled to the mother, his right to the children will be unquestionable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-5\"><em>In reply to this, </em>it was insisted that the court had no right to enter judgment, witl^yut something to warrant st. A child in its mother\u2019s arms may be described as such,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> without specifying a name; but the rule is otherwise as to negroes that may be presumed to have names. If the plaintiff knew not their names, he might have brought a suit in chancery for a discovery.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b509-7\"><em>Thursday, November </em>7th.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AS8\">The president pr\u00f3nouhced the following opinion of the court:</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"A7M\"> 2 Fearne, 279.

While the court is clearly of opinion that, in relation to land, there is nothing in the will which would restrict the limitation aforesaid, so as to make it Valid; and while, even in relation to personal estate, (as to which a more liberal rule of construction has prevailed,) the court does not see that either the terms \u201c then and in that case,\u2019 or the word \u2018heir,\u2019 used in the singu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>lar number, would justify them in adopting the restrictive construction, (under the decisions on this subject, either in this country, or in England,) the court is inclined to think that the testator could not have contemplated a vesting in his wife and her heirs, at a remote point of time, of the negroes in question ; and, consequently, that the restrictive construction should be adopted in relation to them. This opinion is induced by his mentioning in the will the \u2018negroes he had by his wife;\u2019 omitting to say any thing about their issue: which negroes, thus specifically limited to her, were <em>in esse </em>at the time ; and, consequently, the idea of a return of them, or their posterityj to the heirs of the wife, at a remote distance of time, seems to be reprobated.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\u201c The court adopts this construction, by analogy to the principle of the case of <em>Pleasants </em>v. Pleasants, in this court,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> and to that of the numerous class of cases in which a remainder over to a person, who is <em>in esse </em>for life, has been held to restrict words, otherwise purporting an indefinite failure of issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\u201c On these grounds, the court is of opinion that the judgment of the district court should be <em>affirmed?</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AhBd\">\n<em>2 Call, 319.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
