(proceeding to set forth the assignments, and alleging that) \u201c the said <em>George, </em>in his lifetime, or the defendant, since his \u2022 1^9 death, or any other person for them, or either of them, the said sum of money had not paid,\u201d &amp;c. without containing any averment that <em>Carter Braxton </em>(the joint obligor) was dead, or that no payment had been made by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-20\">The defendant pleaded that her testator, <em>George Brax- </em>. <em>Son, </em>was an infant within the age of twenty-one years, when the said writing obligatory, in the plaintiff\u2019s dec\u00edaration mentioned, was signed and sealed; on which plea issue was joined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-26\">At the trial the defendant offered in evidence the deposition of Mrs. <em>Elizabeth Braxton, </em>proving that * u was mother of <em>George Braxton, </em>lately deceased, and that n i t , , \u00ab , :ae was born on the 17th day of <em>September, </em>1762.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-30\">The jury found a special verdict as follows : \u201c We of the jury find for the plaintiff, &amp;c. if the court shall be of opinion that the deposition of <em>Elizabeth Braxton, </em>the widow of <em>Carter Braxton, </em>one of the obligors in the bond in the declaration mentioned, and who died intestate, be inadmissible | if not, we find for the defendant; it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>being agreed by the plaintiff and defendant that the presence of the said <em>Elizabeth Braxton </em>is dispensed with.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-14\">The district court was of opinion that the law upon this verdict was for the plaintiff. Judgment was, therefore, entered in his favour: whereupon the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b70-15\">Call, for the appellant made two points <em>}</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-16\"><em>1. </em>The declaration is substantially defective, in not setting forth what had become of <em>Carter </em>Braxton, the joint obligor. Neither does the special verdict relieve the plaintiff from this difficulty; for it does not appear when <em>Carter Braxton </em>died, whether before <em>George Braxton, </em>or afterwards.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-17\">2. <em>Elizabeth Braxton's, </em>deposition ought to have been received as evidence. If <em>George Braxton </em>was a surety, it was plain to the commonest apprehension that she stood indifferent; for, whichever way that suit went,'her husband\u2019s estate was responsible; he being the principal in the bond. If, on the contrary, <em>George Braxton </em>was not merely a suret3\u2019, but bound for part, Mrs. <em>Braxton </em>swore, in fact, against her own interest; for, by relieving <em>George Braxton </em>entirely, she diminished her own dividend of the estate of <em>Carter Braxton. </em>In this point of view, then, she was the.best possible witness.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A9z\"><em>Peyton </em>Randolph, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6n\">1. In the case of Bentley, <em>Executor of Ronald, </em>v. <em>Harmanson, </em><footnotemark><em>(</em>b)</footnotemark> the same objection with that taken by Mr. <em>Call </em>to this declaration was overruled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-19\">2. Mrs. <em>Braxton </em>was not a competent witness. <em>Carter Braxton, </em>her husband, could not have been a witness to prove the infancy of <em>George Braxton </em>at the time of signing the bond; because the record of the judgment against <em>George Braxton </em>would be conclusive evidence in a suit, by him as surety, to recover the money of <em>Carter Braxton </em>as principal, <footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> It may be said that <em>Carter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number><em>liraxton\u2019s </em>interest was equal either way. But, ii he exonerated <em>George Braxton </em>by his testimony, the record would not be evidence against him, in a suit on behalf of <em>Hilyard. </em>The interest, therefore, does not hang equal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-3\">Again; if <em>Gw, ter Braxton </em>was sued by <em>HVyard, </em>he might bring forward discounts; but, in defending a suit by <em>George Braxton </em>against him, (founded on a recovery by <em>Ililyard </em>in this suit,) he could not avail himself of any discounts he might have against <em>Ililyard.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-4\"><em>Carter </em>Braxton,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5Z\">therefore, was not indifferent between these parties. And, if he could not have been a witness, neither could his executor or administrator. An executor or administrator is identified, in the eye of the law, with the testator, or intestate; being considered as a legal continuation of his life. His liability to costs, also, when defendant, disqualifies him from giving evidence. The case of Goodtitle, <em>Lessee of </em>Fowler, v. <em>Welford,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> \u2019 J J J </em>seems to discountenance this idea ; but that is counteracted by <em>Rhode\u2019s Case,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>cited <em>Esp. N. P. 705. </em>and, <em>ibid. </em>704. the doctrine is laid down, as well established, that a /'&amp;- <em>chein ami </em>cannot be a witness, because responsible for costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b71-11\">But Mrs. Braxton, as widow of <em>Carter </em>Braxton, was clearly inadmissible. He died intestate; and she is entitled to her share of his residuary estate. Her interest, therefore, is stronger than that of an executor; and, being certain and immediate, was sufficient to set her aside, <footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-12\">Williams, on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A79\">A witness when examined must be competent as to all questions that may be asked. <em>Carter Braxton </em>must have known the age of his son; he, therefore, practised a fraud on the obligee by passing him as an adult, when he signed the bond. Mrs. <em>Braxton </em>(his wife) ought not to he received to,, prove her husband guilty of fraud. If she could not be a witness for such purpose during his life, neither could-she after his death.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number><em>Call, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQT\">It did not judicially appear in the case of <em>Bentley </em>v. Harmanson, 1 <em>Wash. 273. </em>that the bond was <em>joint; </em>but it was admitted by the court that the objection would have been a sound one, if the fact upon which it was founded had appeared in the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-10\">As to the competency of Mrs. Braxton&gt;\u2022 there is no such rule of law as that a wife can in no case give evidence proving her husband guilty of fraud. But it does not appear that <em>Carter Braxton </em>was guilty of fraud. \"There is no evidence that he concealed from the obligee the fact of his son\u2019s being under age.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-11\"><em>Carter Braxton </em>himself might have been a witness in this case ,\u2022 because he was responsible, whether <em>George Braxton </em>was, or not.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b72-12\"><em>Tuesday, March </em>26th.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A6qy\">The Judges Brooke, Roane, and Fleming (Tucker not sitting in the cause) pronounced their opinions.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b70-8\"> <em>Peake\u2019s Ev. </em>160. 2 <em>East, </em>458. <em>Birt and others </em>v. <em>Kevshaw.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"ATB\"><em> </em>1 <em>Wash, 273</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b70-11\"><em> Peake\u2019s Ev. </em>144. 1 <em>Esp.

Instead of averring he was dead, it rather showed, on its face, that he was still alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-15\">In the second place, <em>Elizabeth Braxton\u2019s </em>testimony should have been admitted. The verdict does not show clearly how she could be considered as interested. If she had any interest at all, it was in favour of the party who objected to her evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-16\">Judges Roane and Fleming concurred onboth points, which (the former observed) had been well settled in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-17\">Judgment reversed, and <em>lf </em>this court proceeding, &amp;c. is of opinion that the law arising upon the special verdict is for the appellant; therefore, it is further consh- \u2022 fjered that the appellee take nothing,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
