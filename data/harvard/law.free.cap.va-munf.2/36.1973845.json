Rootes </em>came to his house, about the latter end of 1801, and proposed to sell two bonds, (without at first naming the obligors,) at a discount of 25 <em>per cent. </em>that he afterwards showed the bonds; when they appeared to be executed by <em>Baylor; </em>the one for <em>TOOL </em>dated 30th of September, 1801, payable on demand, the other for <em>7271. </em>payable the 10th of <em>December </em>following; and not such bonds as were in the bill mentioned; that these bonds were regularly, to appearance, executed by the. complainant to the said Rootes, who, of course, had a property in them, as the defendant supposed; that, considering bonds as a proper subject of traffic, and knowing that the best men in the country had not scrupled to purchase them at less than their nominal amount, (holding it, as they seem to do, more fair to appreciate, and deduct for, the risks of insolvency, the trouble, the expenses, and hazards of lawsuits and collections, than to purchase at an under value any other property capable of immediate enjoyment,) he neither felt or expressed any reluctance at treating with the said <em>Rootes </em>for the purchase of the bonds ; yet that treaty was not of his own seeking: the defendant purchased the said bonds from the said <em>Rootes </em>for the sum of 1,070/. <em>5s. </em>which he settled with the said <em>Rootes: </em>he could not say what the understanding of the complainant was about time, as he knew him not, as a contracting party, or as interested in the contract made by the said <em>Rootes </em>with the defendant; but the defendant knew that he gave no promise that he did not perform; he denied that <em>Rootes </em>treated or contracted in the character of agent for the complainant, or that Rootes, or any other person, gave the defendant the least reason to believe that be was not a <em>nona Jide </em>obligee of the bonds, until some time after the contract had been completed ; when the. defendant war <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>informed that the complainant had issued these bonds to be sent into market, for the purpose of raising what money they would bring, and that, in the sale, Mr. <em>Rootes </em>was a mere private agent of the complainant; and the defendant solemnly declared that, if he had <em>known of </em>that circumstance before the completion of his contract, he would not have been concerned in the purchase: he utterly denied the usury charged upon him ; averring that the contract was not a device to evade the statute against usury, or intended to cover, or conceal any other transaction; that there never was any loan from him to the said Baylor, or any contract between them, directly or indirectly, further, or otherwise, than as declared in this answer; and that he had not the most distant suspicion that his purchase was morally, legally, or equitably exceptionable.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-7\">This answer was supported,. in all its material parts, by several depositions, and contradicted by none.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-8\">The late chancellor for the <em>Richmond </em>district being of opinion \u201c that the bonds were usurious, against the form of the act of the general assembly, to amend the act against usury, and a shift, past between the parties, relative to the loan,\u201d adjudged and decreed that the injunction, awarded, &amp;c. be perpetual, exceptaste 1,070/.; from which decree the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-9\">Wickham,, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-10\"><em>The </em>Attorney-General, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b58-11\">Thursday, <em>March </em>14th.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ApW\">By the whole Court, (consisting of Judges Fleming, Roane, Tucker and Brooke,) the decree was reversed, and bill dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-12\">The following opinions were pronounced by Judges Tucker and Fleming.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b58-13\">Judge Tucker</author>\n<p id=\"A8\">(after stating the case) observed, this answer which is rather supported by the testimo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>ay) is not anywhere impugned or contradicted in the record. It, therefore, must prevail, being perfectly responsive to every allegation in the bill. Had those allegations been proved, I should have felt no doubt that the transaction was a shift to avoid the statute of usury, and, consequently, within the words, as well as the true intent and meaning thereof. For I concur with Lord Mansfield, that, \u201c in all questions, in whatever respect repugnant to the statute, we must get at the nature and substance of the transaction; the view of the parties must be ascertained, to satisfy the court that there is a lpan, and a borrowing; and that the substance was to borrow on the one hand, and to lend on the other; and where the real truth is a <em>loan </em>of money, the wit of man cannot find a shift to take it out of the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">If the bill and answer in this case be both true, (as is possible from the manner in which the transaction was conducted,) whatever might have been <em>Baylor\u2019s </em>intention, <em>Hansbrough </em>was ignorant of it; and though the former might have intended to borrow, even upon usury, the latter seems only to have intended to make a fail-purchase, instead of a loan. That the deposition of Mr. Bootes, the agent employed by Mr. <em>Baylor </em>on this occasion, was not taken in this cause, although upon the spot, is to me convincing proof that he could not have contradicted the answer of <em>Hansbrough. </em>I am therefore for <em>xe </em>versing the chancellor\u2019s decree, and dismissing the bill with costs.</p>\n<author id=\"b59-5\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"AYs\">Although I am strongly prepossessed against usurious contracts, in whatever form they may appear, it seems to me that this case is not within either of our acts of assembly against usury. The transaction appears, as well from sundry depositions, as from the answer of the appellant, which is in no instance contradicted, to have been fair and upright, without any knowledge, or suspicion in him, that the bonds were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>executed merely for the purpose of traffic. The contract was hot of his own seeking, but pressed upon him by the friend and agent of Mr. <em>Baylor; </em>concealing, from him, for whose use the money was to be applied; and it is every day\u2019s practice to purchase bonds at a discount, without blame or censure on the purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">I am therefore of opinion that the decree is erroneous, and ought to be reversed, and the bill dismissed vnth costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b59-11\"><em> Floyer Edwards, Cowp. </em>114.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
