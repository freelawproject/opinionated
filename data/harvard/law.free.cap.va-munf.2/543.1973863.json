The slave in the declaration mentioned was proved to be the daughter of a female slave mentioned in the said deed. The plaintiff also produced two witnesses to prove that <em>Polfe Eldridge, </em>and the said <em>Susanna </em>his wife, <em>said, </em>when the slaves came to his possession, (which happened several years after their marriage, and 12 or 14 years prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>the date of the deed,) that the same were a <em>loan </em>front <em>David Meade; </em>and that <em>Rolfe Eldridge </em>made the same declaration and acknowledgment, at sundry times, be\u00bb fore, and within, five years preceding the date of the said deed.

The defendant produced several witnesses, who proved that <em>Rolfe Eldridge </em>had possession of the negroes, in the said deed mentioned, 12 or 14 years before its date; and that he had, at sundry times\u00bf before and within five years preceding the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>date, declared that part of the said negroes were his <em>own </em>property; and that they, knowing the circumstances of the said <em>lio Iff </em>Eldridge, before his marriage, supposed and believed that the aforesaid negroes had come to him, by his wife, as part of her portion. And, this being all the evidence in the cause, the plaintiff moved the court to instruct the jury that the law, upon the evidence aforesaid, was in his favour; and the court did so instruct the jury : to which opinion the defendant also excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-3\">Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b565-4\">Upon an appeal to the district court of <em>Prince Edwards </em>it seemed to the court there that the said judgment was erroneous, in this, that the county court admitted improper evidence to go to the jury ; and also that the court was too general in its instructions to the jury. it war. therefore considered, that the came be reversed and annulled, as far back as to the issue ;5? from which judgment the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b565-5\">After argument, by <em>Peyton </em>Randolph, for the appellant, and Wickham, for the appellee, the following was pronounced, on</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A8p\"><em>Monday, March </em>16, 1812,</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A6Ub\">by judge Roane, as the opinion of this court, consisting of judges Soane, Brooke, and Coalter.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b565-6\">\u201c The court is of opinion, that the female ancestor of the slave in the declaration mentioned having been <em>loaned by David Mead to Rolfe </em>Eldridge, and the said <em>Rolfe Eldridge </em>having <em>remained in possession </em>of the said slave <em>more than five years </em>since the commencement of the act to prevent frauds and perjuries,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> without any demand made on the pari of the lender; and the deed, under which, the appellant claims the said slave, in trust for the benefit of <em>Susannah </em>Eldridge, not having been duly recorded in any court contemplated by that act, the same is not competent to do away the effect of such possession enuring in favour of the creditors of, or purchasers under, the said <em>Rolfe.
