It did not appear whether,, in fact, the deed for the land was recorded in due time, or not. And as the bill was filed within eight months after it was executed, the law of recording deeds could not be brought any way to act upon the case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b332-14\"><em>Samuel Taylor, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzTW\">relied on the decision in <em>Moore's Executor </em>v. <em>The Auditor, </em>3 <em>H. &amp; M. </em>232. as being in point to show that the court may take notice of a deed\u2019s not being recorded, although the fact be not put in issue.

The chancellor having declared the deed <em>not </em>to have been recorded; if this court affirm his decree, it will be binding, however plain the fact may be to the contrary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b332-17\">It being represented that a speedy decision of this case was very important; both parties claiming to be in possession of the land, which was taken in execution by ari <em>ele fit; </em>(there being no appeal from so much of the decree as was against <em>Thomas </em>Gibson/) the judges (Roane, Cabell and Coalter) immediately retired to consult; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>and, after some time, returning into court, Judge Roane reported the following opinion:</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"ARq3\"><em> Acts of </em>1810, c. 5. s. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b333-4\">\u201c The court is of opinion that the said decree is erroneous in declaring that the deed of the 26th day of <em>October, </em>1803, is void in consequence of its not being duly recorded according to the provision of the act in such case made and provided; both because the appellee appears, by his bill, to have had that notice of the existence of the deed aforesaid which it was the object of the act to afford, and because the construction upon this subject must have reference to the time of the exhibition of the bill, at which time, in the present case, the limitation provided by the said act had not expired. On this ground, the court is of opinion to reverse the said decree, and remand the cause for further proceedings, both as to the validity of the deed of the personal estate, and as to \u2022that of the said deed of the 26th day of <em>October, </em>1803, on grounds other than that on which the said decree was founded, neither of which last-mentioned grounds were within the contemplation of the decree in the present case, nor, as to them, was the testimony taken in the cause read or considered; and although, if that testimony were now fully matured, this court might probably enter such decree thereupon as the said court of chancery ought to have rendered, yet it would be improper so to do, as the said decree was made in anticipation of the final trial upon the merits, and confined to the single point before mentioned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Decree reversed, and cause remanded, to be finally proceeded in, pursuant to the principles above stated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
