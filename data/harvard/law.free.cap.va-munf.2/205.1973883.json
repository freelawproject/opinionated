Flowers, </em>plaintiff. And the said defendant <em>Samuel Mangum, </em>by <em>Archibald Thweatt, </em>his attorney, comes and defends the force and injury, when, &amp;c. and, as to the coming by force and arms, sai th that he is in no manner or sort guilty thereof. And of this he putieth himself upon the country, and the plaintiff doth the like. And, as to the residue of the said trespass in the declaration charged, the said defendant saith, that the said close, and also the place in which the said trespass is supposed to have been committed, were the proper soil and freehold of him the said defendant, by reason whereof he the said defendant, at the time when the said trespass is charged to have been committed, broke the said close, as his own close, soil and freehold, &amp;c. as it was lawful for him to do, and this he is ready to verify,\u201d &amp;c. To this plea no replication appears to have been filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-7\">After a verdict for the plaintiff \u201c upon the issue joined,\u201d a new trial was granted, and leave to amend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>declaration. An amended declaration was filed, not 7 varying the assignment of the trespass, but charging it with a continuando, and no change in the pleas took place. Another verdict was found for the plaintiff, after motions, on the part of the defendant, to the court to instruct the jury on several points arising upon the evidence ; and a bill of exceptions was signed and sealed. Judgment was entered according to the verdict, and affirmed by the district court, from which the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b226-6\">The cause was argued, at considerable length, by <em>George Keith </em>Taylor, <em>for the </em>appellant, and Hay, for the appellee, upon several points ; but the court\u2019s opinion was given as to one only, to wit, that issue ought to have been joined upon the second plea.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-7\"><em>Hay </em>was inclined to think there were not, in fact, two pleas, but one only. The defendants filed their plea jointly of not guilty as to part, and justification as to the residue. This is one plea only, according to all the prece\u00a3Jents <em>;</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>because <em>every </em>plea must go to the whole <em>J 3 v </em>f declaration. If so, it follows that this is a mere \u201c misjoining\u201d of issue, which is cured by the act of jeofails. But, if there were two pleas, and an omission to take issue on'the second, that omission was not fatal in this case, because, under the plea of not guilty, the defendant\u2019s title to the land might have been given in evidence.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> Both pleas were, therefore, substantially the sam\u00e9; and the second plea was bad, amounting to no more than the general issue :<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> the court, on motion, would have set it aside, and ordered the general issue to be but for this there was no necessity; the generaj issue being already entered. <footnotemark>(d)</footnotemark> The defendant erred \u00b0 . , , in filing such a plea. Is our judgment, then, to be arrest- ^ on grounci that he committed an error, which we failed to notice? In <em>Hammett </em>v. <em>Bullitt's </em>Executors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>1 <em>Call, </em>567. it was determined that a defendant shall not be received to object to such errors in pleadings as are for his benefit : a judgment, therefore, ought not to be reversed because the plaintiff failed to take issue upon an immaterial plea.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-4\">Besides, the second plea may be considered as waived by the defendant. When the plaintiff had leave to amend his declaration, the defendant had a right to plead <em>de novo ;</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but he did not. The trial, then, must be regarded as brought on by consent of parties; and since it %vas a trial \u201c of the issue,\u201d it must have been of the issue joined upon the first plea ; no other issue being in the cause. The second plea was waived, of course, by plain implication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-5\">In <em>Brown </em>v. Belsches, 1 <em>Wash. </em>9., after a reference to arbitrators, a trial was had in court, without discharging the order of reference; yet the verdict and judgment were not set aside ; it being inferred that the trial was by consent. In <em>Barnett </em>&amp; <em>Woolfolk </em>v. <em>Watson </em>&amp; <em>Urquhart, 1 Wash. </em>379. <em>Barnett's </em>appearance, and desiring to be made a defendant with <em>Woo folk, </em>was considered as implying a consent to be united with him in his plea; especially, since he proceeded to the trial, and defended the suit. So, in <em>Murdock and others </em>v. <em>Herndon's Executors, 4 H. </em>&amp; <em>M. </em>200. where the suit would have abated by the deaths of the plaintiffs, and the defendants might have pleaded <em>de novo, </em>but omitted to do so, and went to trial, they were precluded from making the objection after verdict: in that case, it is true, there was an express admission that <em>Murdock </em>and others were the surviving partners; but this, together with the defendants' going to trial, was considered as implying a consent that; \u00bfhe suit might be prosecuted in their names.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b228-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number><em>George K. </em>Taylor, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADL\">There certainly were two pleas in this case; 1st. The general issue as to both the defendants; and, 2d. A special plea on behalf of <em>Samuel Mangum </em>only. The clerk, indeed, has, inaccurately and inconsistently, after stating that \u201c The defendants pleaded not guilty,\u201d proceeded to state that they filed <em>their </em>plea, which, upon inspection, appears to be a separate plea of <em>one </em>of them; and should be so considered, upon the authority of <em>Chinn </em>v. <em>Heale, 1 Munf. </em>63. notwithstanding the mistake of the clerk.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-12\">This is not a misjoining of issue, but a total failure to join issue upon the second plfe@. If there be any issue as to that plea, it is upon the formal part only; while, as to the realms* of the defence, no issue is joined. <em>Even </em>if the <em>similiter </em>had been put at the end, instead of in the middle, it would not have been sufficient; for it is a rule that, when the defendant, in his own right, claims any interest in the land in dispute, a general replication is 1 bad. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-13\">No waiver of the second plea can be inferred in this case. The failure to plead <em>de novo </em>rather showed a willingness to abide by the pleadings already filed; and this, because, the amendment to the declaration not i having varied the case in substance, a change of the pleas was in fact unnecessary. In the cases cited from 1 <em>Wash. </em>379. and 2 <em>H. &amp; M. </em>200. there were express agreements, or admissions, from which assent was properly inferred; but there is no such agreement or admission here. To prevent surprise, it was the duty of the court to direct the cause to be sent to the rules. This, indeed, might have been dispensed with by express consent of parties, or by terms imposed upon the defendant in granting him the new trial; but nothing of this appears in the case.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b228-14\"><em>Thursday, April </em>25th.</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b225-8\"> Note.
