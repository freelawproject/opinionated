He therefore prayed an injunction to restrain the relatives of the said <em>Harriett, </em>and every of them, as well as the said <em>Peter </em>Bowles, until the final decree in this cause, \u201c from proceeding at law against him the said administrator, for the recovery of any estate, late of the said Sally, before her intermarriage with the said Peter, and also from interrupting his administration in the recovery of what were then her rights, in his character of administrator of all and singular the goods, &amp;c. whereunto the said <em>Sally </em>was entitled at the time of her death, which are considered by her relatives to have then been cast upon the said <em>Harriett, </em>as her daughter, heiress, and distributee, and from the said Harriett, upon them, as <em>her </em>heirs and distributees ;\u201d which injunction was accordingly granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-4\">The defendant, <em>Peter Bowles, </em>in his answer, \u201c <em>admit-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>always insisted that the said </em>Harriett, <em>though </em>\u00e9orra \u00bfra wedlock, <em>was not his child: </em>but as, by the law of t|je kn\u00a3j} the sai\u00bf <em>Harriett </em>would have been entitled to ckim as <em>his </em>heir, if she had survived him, he thinks that he hath right to <em>insist </em>that the property, which belonged to her mother, and afterwards to her, shall be considered' <em>as vesting in him.\u201d </em>He therefore prayed a decree for the said property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-7\">The joint and several answer of the other defendants contained a statement of the grounds of their claim analogous to that set forth in the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-8\">The indenture of separation (among the exhibits) did, <em>not expressly </em>mention the circumstance which induced the parties to sign it, but only that \u201c the most convincing caus\u00e9 had taken place which rendered it impossible that they the said <em>Peter </em>and <em>Sally </em>should live in happiness together as becomes man and wife.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aixq\">By the terms of that instrument, the parties agreed that \u201c all the property, of whatsoever denomination, which she the said <em>Sally Bowles </em>brought, by virtue of the said marriage, to the said <em>Peter </em>Boxvles, should be restored, and put into the .hands of <em>Mary Anne </em>Blythe, for the use of the said <em>Sally Boxvles ; </em>that <em>she </em>should be considered as acting as a <em>feme sole, </em>and no longer as a <em>feme covert, </em>and <em>he </em>as no longer her husband; that he should not be liable for any debts hereafter contracted by her, nor for her maintenance, or support, under any circumstances whatsoever; and that she should never claim, or demand any part of his estate, in right of dower, distribution, or otherwise.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-10\"><em>No depositions were taken in the cause. </em>Chancellor Taylor, on the 19th of <em>March, 1807, </em>\u201cbeing of opinion that the <em>illegitimacy of the said Harriett was fully proved; </em>that she, if living, could not, in the event of the death of the said <em>Peter </em>Boxvles, succeed to any part of his estate as heir; and that he, therefore, in the event which has happened, cannot, as such, succeed to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>part of the estate of the said <em>Harriett; </em>and, more especially, as it would be against the true intent and meaning of the articles of separation, in the bill mentioned, which are considered as binding in equity; therefore decreed that the <em>injunction be made perpetual as to the said Peter Bowles and those claiming under him ; </em>that the plaintiff, as administrator of the said Harriett, make distribution of her estate among her next of kin on the part of her mother; and liberty is reserved to the said administrator, or any one, or all, of the parties, except the said <em>Peter Bowles, </em>to resort to the court for any further directions in the settlement, or division of the said estate; and that the defendant <em>Peter Bowles </em>pay the costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-4\">From this decree <em>Peter Bowles </em>appealed; and <em>James Bingham </em>having afterwards departed this life, the appeal was revived against <em>John Woody, </em>administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of <em>Harriett Bowles.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b465-5\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avao\">laid it down as an invariable rule that a child bom in lawful wedlock is legitimate ; unless a physical impossibility of procreation, or of access be proved, or there be <em>strong </em>evidence of non-access. In support of this, he quoted <em>Com. Dig. </em>tit. <em>Bastard, </em>(B.) and 2 <em>Bl. Com. </em>446. and as to the evidence of access, or non-access, he observed that declarations, or admissions of the parties, are not to be received <em>after marriage,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to prove that they had had <em>no connexion, </em>and that the offspring was spurious. The marginal note to <em>Goodright </em>v. <em>Saul, </em>3 <em>T. R. </em>356. (which states that \u201c the child of a married woman may be proved to be a bastard by other evidence than that of the husband\u2019s non-access,\u201d) is wholly unsupported by the case itself. The decision was, only, that the question of access, or non-access, ought to have been left to the jury.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-6\">In 2 <em>Burn\u2019s Ecc. Law, </em>431. it is said, the sole confes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>sion of the parties is not admissible to prove <em>adultery. </em>There is a difference, however, between the question of adultery, and that of <em>illegitimacy; </em>for the mother may be convicted of adultery, and yet the child be legitimate. If the husband might have had access to the wife, he is not permitted to disavow the child, unless it was naturally impossible for him to be its father. Such is the doctrine, I believe, in every civilized nation.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-3\">The consequences of a contrary rule would be pernicious indeed. Declarations of this sort, by a husband, may be occasioned by unfounded jealousy; and since they are not to be used against him, in case he chooses to retract them afterwards, (which he may do, upon discovering his error,) the rule must be reciprocal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-4\">I cannot discover any authority showing a difference in relation to this point, between a child <em>begotten before marriage, and born </em>afterxvards, and a child <em>begotten and born in </em>xvedlock.-</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b466-5\"><em>Warden, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABWE\">The husband, by his answer, declared the child not his ; and though he swore to this, and the child was born only three months, after the marriage, he claims the estate as heir of that child!</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-6\">All Mr. <em>Wickham\u2019s </em>cases, except that from <em>Com. Dig. </em>relate to circumstances occurring <em>during the marriage, </em>whereas, in this case, <em>the </em>child was <em>begotten before. </em>Is not the evidence of the husband and wife, both declaring there was no access-, as conclusive as any other proof of non-access can be ? Besides, the <em>deed </em>bars him from claiming any of the property of <em>Sally Boxvles. </em>There never was a case in which law would be made more clearly consonant to reason than by affirming this decree.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b466-7\">Wickham, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aj7\">The defendant has not sworn in his answer that the child <em>was not his. </em>He only says <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>that he always <em>insisted so; </em>without averring that those assertions of his were true. If the question, whether the child was actually his, had been put to him by the bill, he would not have been obliged to answer it, but might have demurred. He might, perhaps, have refused to answer concerning his own former <em>declarations.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-4\">The deed of separation says nothing about the legitimacy or illegitimacy of the child. <em>Peter Bowles </em>does not claim against the deed; nor any thing inconsistent with it: he claims the property, not as that of <em>Sally </em>Bowles, but as that of <em>Harriett. </em>Whether the title of the child was derived from the mother, or not, is unimportant; the property is admitted on all hands to have belonged to the <em>child </em>at the time of <em>her </em>death; and he claims as <em>her </em>heir.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-5\">If every allegation in the bill were established by testimony, the whole would be inadmissible to prove illegitimacy, The law will rather permit a particular injury, than encourage a general inconvenience. If this man should get by inheritance what he is not entitled to, (the child, in reality, not being his,) he will have been poorly compensated for his sufferings of body and mind, occasioned by the infidelity of his wife.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b467-6\"><em>Wednesday, December </em>4th.</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b462-21\"> Note.
