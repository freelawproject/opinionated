She afterwards intermarried with <em>John W. Watson, </em>who, in right of his wife, brought an action of ejectment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>against <em>Tunnell </em>and wife, to recover one half of the deceased child\u2019s undivided third, part of a tract of land in the county of Accomack, of which the testator died seised in fee-simple.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-4\">The jury found a special verdict setting forth the facts above mentioned, and some others, which need not here be noticed: but they did not state whether the deceased child had any other heirs besides his mother and sister.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b304-5\">Upon this verdict the county court entered judgment for the defendants, which, upon an appeal, was reversed by the superior court, and judgment entered for the plaintiff. The defen\u00bfants thereupon appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b304-6\"><em>Attorney-General, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahg\">The special verdict was too imperfect to found a judgment upon.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AeS\">Wickham, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7c\">There is enough in the verdict for the court to infer that the female lessor of the plaintiff was entitled, as co-heir of the deceased posthumous child, to one half of its share of the land. It was not necessary for the jury to use negative as well as affirmative words, and (after finding that <em>Betsy Selby </em>and the posthumous infant were legitimate children of the testator) to say there were no other children. A person\u2019s being heir is an inference of l^w, which the court may draw from the facts found; not a distinct fact, necessary to be found by the jury. In many cases, verdicts equally defective with this have been sustained, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AlD\">\n<em>Attorney-General.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_f\">Mr. <em>Wickham </em>is carrying the doctrine of presumption, as to special verdicts, farther than I suppose it allowable. No material fact, not expressly found, can be intended by the court. In the case of the <em>alias capias, </em>in Viner, the defect in the finding was very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>slight. In <em>Birch </em>v. Alexander, the court only took the evident meaning of the jury ; no intendment was necessary at all. Who is heir is an inference of law; but _ facts sufficient to warrant the inference must be found. The court, in this case, cannot infer that there were no other children.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b305-9\">Wednesday, <em>May 15th.</em></decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AoE\">The following was entered as the opinion of the court:</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b304-7\"> <em>Birch v.
