the said <em>Truheart </em>allowing nine inches of ground; the said <em>Duval </em>to be at all the other expense.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-4\">The deed from <em>Trueheart </em>and wife to <em>Duval, </em>(which bears date the 25th of <em>December, 1794*, </em>and was not executed until after the latter had built a brick house on the ground,) said nothing about the twelve feet, but conveyed \u201c a lot or piece of ground, with its appurtenances, lying on the main street in the city of <em>Richmond, </em>it being a part of the tenement called or known by the name of <em>Buchanan\u2019s, </em>forty-four feet in front, and running back ninety-six feet, preserving the breadth of forty-four feet all the way.\u201d A memorandum was subjoined, \u201c that <em>Trueheart </em>should have the liberty, without cost or hindrance, of <em>joining walls </em>to the house which <em>Duval </em>had built on the above conveyed lot; it being part of the original contract.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-5\">The bill charged that, at the time when the agreement: was made, the said <em>Trueheart </em>owned the ground, on the main street, immediately above and below the tenement in question, but had leased the tenement held by <em>William Galt, </em>and called <em>Galt\u2019s </em>store, for a term of years; that the interval of twelve feet, between <em>Galt\u2019s </em>store, and the upper line of the ground agreed to be sold to <em>Duval, </em>was understood by <em>Duval </em>to have been some time before laid off by the said <em>Trueheart, </em>and established as a lane to be in common between the two tenements; that <em>Trueheart </em>had agreed with the said <em>Galt </em>that, during the continuance of his term, the said vacant space of twelve feet should be used by him as a lane; \u201c and the said <em>True-heart, </em>at the time of the said agreement, actually informed the said <em>Duval </em>that he had laid off the said space of twelve feet in breadth for a lane, to be always kept open as it then was.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number><em>. </em>The answer admitted that, <em>during Galt's lease </em>the twelve feet alley was to be kept open, but positively denied the last-mentioned allegation; insisting that if such a stipulation had existed, it would have been inserted in the written agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-9\">The bill stated farther, that the brick house, erected, by Duval, extended the whole length of forty-four feet on the main street, with a separate <em>back building </em>for a kitchen and other offices, and a communication from the said offices to the said lane ; there being no other way from the offices to the street, except through the apartment of the mansion-house, which, in general, would be inconvenient, and in some instances impossible to be used; that the said <em>Trueheart knew </em>that the said <em>Duval </em>intended to build his house in this way, and frequently saw it while building j that, during this period, he never set up any claim to a separate property in the lane, or made any objection to the said <em>Duval's </em>having a way through it; and he must have known that the said <em>Du-val </em>would not have built in the manner he did, but in full confidence that the said lane was always to be kept open. The truth of these allegations was, in a great measure^ supported by testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-10\">The deposition of <em>William Duval </em>was taken, and proved the parol agreement of <em>Trueheart </em>that the alley in question should be <em>always </em>kept open: but this deposition was objected to by the defendant on the ground of his being an interested witness.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-11\">It was proved, however, by the deposition of <em>Isham Bethel, </em>a subscribing witness to the original agreement, that, when he was called upon to attest it, \u201c the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number><em>'trueheart </em>and <em>Duval </em>were in conversation, respecting the ground and its situation, which the said <em>Duval </em>had bought of the said <em>Trueheart; </em>that he, the said <em>True-</em>heart, observed to said Duval, the alley, running from the main street to <em>Byrd\u2019s </em>warehouse, between <em>William Galt\u2019s </em>store and said <em>Duval\u2019s </em>ground which he had bought-of said Trueheart, was to be kept open; and that he, the said Trueheart, did not in any manner intimate to said <em>Duval </em>that the said alley was ever to be shut up, but gave said <em>Duval </em>every reason to believe the said alley was always to be kept open.\u201d Duval, in his deposition, said that the written agreement was drawn by <em>True--heart; </em>and that he signed it, without a clause expressing the stipulation that the alley should be kept open, because <em>Trueheart </em>assured him that he was bound already to leave the alley, between <em>Galt\u2019s </em>and the deponent\u2019s ground, twelve feet wide.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-6\">From other depositions it appeared that the house occupied by <em>William </em>Galt, which was built by the defendant\u2019s direction, probably cost upwards of <em>7001.; </em>that it was not probable that the defendant, when he had it built, could have intended removing it from its present situation, not only considering its size and co3t, but the particular manner in which it was built, having two doors and two windows on the side next the alley; that the warehouse called <em>Byrd\u2019s </em>was the property of the defendant j that the alley in question was more generally used by foot passengers to the said warehouse than the street, and much the dryest and best way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b491-7\">The cause came on to be heard the 7th of October, 1806, by Chancellor Taylor, who, (\u201cbeingof opinion that <em>William Duval </em>purchased the ground in the proceedings mentioned, under an express declaration by the defendant, that an alley twelve feet wide was established, and to be always kept open, between the tenement of <em>William Galt </em>and the ground purchased by the said <em>William Duval </em>of the defendant,) adjudged and decreed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>that the defendant be perpetually enjoined from obstructing the way between the tenement occupied by the said \u2022 <em>Galt </em>and that of the plaintiffand that the alley, as laid down in a survey among the proceedings, <em>be established.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-10\">From this decree the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b492-11\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARV\">There was no agreement between <em>Duval </em>and <em>Trueheart </em>that the alley should be kept open. There was no stipulation to that effect in the written agreement. On the contrary, there is a stipulation that <em>Trueheart </em>might join his houses to the walls of <em>Duval's </em>house. Is not this conclusive that <em>Duval </em>was to be excluded from the use of the lane r</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-12\">In opposition to this, parol evidence is offered! to prove a title in <em>Duval </em>to part of <em>Trueheart's </em>land !<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-13\"><em>Duval's </em>own testimony, if admissible, (though I contend it is wholly inadmissible,) operates in our favour. It shows that the very point about the alley was controverted at the .time; yet he took a verbal promise, and accepted the deed from the man who refused to commit that promise to writing! The story is so strange and improbable, that Mr. <em>Duval </em>must be mistaken in his recollection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b492-14\">But his evidence is not admissible. His deed to <em>Price </em>conveys the tenement, with its appurtenances, with warranty. He is, of course, interested; for the privilege of this alley is one of the appurtenances. It is a very dangerous precedent to admit a vendor to be a witness. If he did <em>not </em>convey the alley by his deed, <em>Price </em>has no title to it; if he <em>did, </em>he is an interested witness.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b492-15\"><em>Williams, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ai3\">The agreement itself shows that the parties had it not in contemplation- that <em>True-heart </em>should join his wall to <em>Duval's </em>house on the upper part. It follows, that neither of them had it in conternplation that <em>Trueheart </em>should build on these twelve feet of ground. We do not contend that <em>Duval </em>was to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>S2ne property in the ground of the alley; but that it was always to be kept open. To prove this, there is enough in the written agreement itself. If the word \u201c appurtenances,\u201d in the deed from <em>Duval </em>to Price, would convey the alley, surely that word must have the same effect in the deed from <em>Trueheart </em>to <em>Duval.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-5\">Whether we resort to <em>Duval's </em>testimony, or not, is Unimportant: but he is not an interested witness : he warrants only the quantity of ground which he had bought, and is a good witness to prove that these twelve feet were always to be a public highway. I suppose it unquestionable that a vendor, not warranting a title, is a competent witnessthe objection goes only to the credibility, not the competency.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-6\">The cases cited by Mr. <em>Call </em>do not apply. Our parol evidence does not go to vary the written agreement, but to fortify its obvious meaning.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b493-7\">Wickham, on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AQOx\">Mr. <em>Call </em>has not paid that attention to <em>fact </em>which he generally pays to <em>law.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-8\"><em>The </em>attempt is only to prove a representation, made at the time of the contract, relating to the situation of the property. <em>Duval </em>did not buy the alley, but only the property adjoining. He had every reason, though, to believe that the alley was to be kept open: if not, it was a deception to his injury. He had only a right to use the lane, in common with every body else.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-9\">If <em>Trueheart </em>had contemplated building on the upper side of the lot, would he not have stipulated for a right to join walls to the upper side, in the same manner as he stipulated with respect to the lower ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-10\">The stipulation as to the lower side, and the absence of any stipulation as to the upper, (where the lane was,) shows the clear understanding of the parties that the lane was not to be shut up. Would any man reserve twelve feet of ground for the purpose of building a house ? <em>Common </em>sense repels the supposition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Mr. <em>Call </em>contends that the word \u201c walls,\u201d being in the plural number, applies to both sides of the lot. But surely that wor(} js satisfied by joining the wall of <em>Trueheart's </em>house, intended to be built, to the wall of <em>Duval's </em>house, though on one side only j for this, in common parlance, and very properly, is called \u201cjoining walls.\u201d As to this point, too, 'the deed refers to the \u201c original contract,\u201d which shows that the parties did not intend to go beyond that. In all such cases, the deed is controlled by the articles.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-5\">The only object of <em>Trueheart </em>is to levy contributions . upon <em>Price ; </em>not to build ; but to shut up the lane by a fence. This is evident from all the circumstances appearing in evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-6\">Parol evidence is always admissible to prove representations made about the state of the property. The representation here was, that the ground was adjoining a lane ; which circumstance added to the value of the property. If <em>Trueheart </em>had not been the vendor, but a third person, who misrepresented the situation of the ground, damages would have been recoverable of him. As he is the vendor, we have a better remedy, viz. to compel him. to permit-us to enjoy the use of the lane.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQhE\">. The- statute of frauds does not apply where there is part performance: or where one party, by fraud, prevents the other from having a circumstance inserted in the writing.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOu\">This is what is called'in equity constructive fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ald\">this case <em>Duval </em>was prevented by <em>Trueheart's </em>fraud having the reservation concerning the alley inserted. He had a right to confide in his word when he assured him he was <em>already hound to keep it open. </em>In this respect, hrs testimony is corroborated by <em>Bethell's. </em>But he clearly is-a competent witness.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> Neither, indeed, *s he at all interested; for the word \u201c appurtenances\u201d only such peculiar privileges as are annexed to the property ; not a general privilege which all the citi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>ssens of the commonwealth have a right to enjoy; such as a public highway. Our application to the court of equity is merely to stop a public nuisance. No action could be framed so as to make <em>Duval </em>responsible to Price.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b495-3\"><em>Hay, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQWl\">relied on the case of <em>Moon </em>v. Campbell, 1 <em>Munf. </em>600. as conclusive to show that <em>Duval, </em>being the vendor of the land, could not be examined as a witness to support the title conveyed by himself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-4\">It is said, however, that if his testimony be left out,, there is still one witness, aided by circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-5\">But, <em>Bethell\u2019s </em>deposition does not completely support the bill. It proves merely a reference to a known fact, the existence of an alley, which was to be kept open; but does not ascertain how long. The agreement which he attested was in <em>July, </em>1789. At that time the alley was to be kept open under <em>Galt\u2019s </em>contract) until the 1st of <em>October, </em>1797; that is, more than eight years. <em>Trueheart, </em>therefore, might well have said that it was to be kept open; meaning during the lease to <em>Galt; </em>but not for ever. The stipulation for the privilege of joining to the lower wall, was inserted, obviously, because he wanted to build immediately at that place; but he conceived it not important to stipulate for the privilege of joining to the upper wall, because he could not avail himself of that for eight years to come. There was another reason for omitting the last-mentioned' stipulation. <em>Galt\u2019s </em>house had not long been built. The twelve feet alley could not be built upon, unless that house was taken down. <em>True-heart </em>could hardly calculate on such an increase of the value of property, as to make him suppose it his interest to take down that house, and build a new one. But in <em>December, </em>1794, the case was altered. In two years and nine months <em>Gait\u2019s </em>interest would expire. New and valuable buildings were daily erected. True-<em>heart </em>might well calculate, <em>then, </em>that the privilege of join* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>lng to the upper wall would be important. The memorandum annexed to the deed was therefore worded so as to give him the privilege of \u201cjoining walls,\u201d plainly meaning to join his buildings to both the upper and lower walls of <em>Duval\u2019s </em>house. Why was this <em>new </em>agreement made if it was not intended to vary the <em>old </em>one ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-9\">The circumstance, that <em>Duval </em>built his house without leaving an alley, is much relied upon. But this was an act <em>of-Duval, </em>which cannot affect <em>Trueheart. </em>Besides, houses are often built in this city with no passage to the' back yard, but through the cellar. He might have built in that manner, knowing that the alley would be open for eight years, and supposing it would remain so afterwards, unless <em>Trueheart </em>should pull down <em>Galt\u2019s </em>house for the purpose of building a larger one. The communication, too, by the alley was not so very important; since <em>Duval </em>built stores, and not dwelling-houses. But does the mode of his building show that he had the idea of a permanent alley ? Is it proved that his house has a door into the alley ? or even a window ? Of this there is no proof; neither is it the fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-10\"><em>Bethed's </em>deposition is, therefore, not supported by any circumstance ; while those to contradict it are numerous and conclusive. Particularly, if it was distinctly understood that the alley was to be always kept open; why not say so in the agreement or the deed ? If the fact was so, <em>Trueheart </em>had no motive for excluding it; and <em>Duval </em>had a strong motive to insist upon its being inserted ; to prevent disputes. Yet he says, himself, that <em>Trueheart </em>refused to sign the agreement first written, which contained a stipulation that the alley should be kept open <em>l </em>He says, too, the existence of the alley enhanced the value of the ground ten dollars per foot; yet he suffered its continuance to depend on chance, and signed the agreement, without any provision binding <em>Trueheart </em>t\u00a9 leave it open.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-11\">But if the fact were proved, the evidence (however <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>satisfactory) must be rejected; for a writing was necesaary, under the statute of frauds : and, even at common law, parol testimony is not admissible to prove the contract to be different from what it appears to be in the writing.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> An attempt is made to repel both of these <em>...... </em>i , objections, by saying there was no contract that the alley should be kept open; but a mere representation: which, of course, is not equivalent to a contract; This is, truly, an ingenious device ; according to which the statute will operate on an actual, formal contract, but not on a representation. But the plaintiff\u2019s bill charges a contract; his own witness says there was an express promise ; and, if there was not, upon what ground can he claim that the alley should be kept open ? <em>Trueheart </em>is the exclusive proprietor of the ground; and if he did not bind himself by a contract to part with it, he cannot be compelled to do so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-10\">Mr. <em>Wickham, in </em>the next place, (rather inconsistently,) contends there was an agreement, and that, in consequence of a fraud committed by <em>Trueheart, </em>it was not inserted in the writing. But of this pretended fraud there is no proof; and circumstances show that, when the writing was signed, <em>Duval </em>relinquished his claim to the alley, by-consenting to the omission of the stipulation which had been inserted in the writing first prepared, and disapproved by <em>Trueheart. </em>The actual agreement, and nothing else, was reduced to writing.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b497-11\"><em>Friday, October </em>11.</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b490-12\"> Note.
