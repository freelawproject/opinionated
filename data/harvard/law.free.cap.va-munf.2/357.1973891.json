He had accepted a conveyance from <em>Francis </em>Walker, the executor, of 840 acres, and executed bonds and a deed of trust to secure the payment of the purchase-money, at twenty shillings per acre; but contended that <em>F. Walker, </em>at the time of executing the writings, verbally agreed that if he could, at any time thereafter, prove the contract between <em>Thomas Walker </em>and himself, he should be allowed the benefit of it. The evidence in the cause was of the same nature, and nearly to the same effect, with that adduced in <em>Vance </em>v. Walker, 3 <em>H. M. </em>288.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-8\">On the 4th of <em>July, </em>1804, the chancellor pronounced his opinion and decree : \u201c That, as almost all the affidavits in this cause, as well as in the cause of <em>Vance </em>against the said defendant Walker, go to prove an advertisement, or public declaration, on the part of Dr. Walker, or his agents, that settlers on the <em>Wolf-hill </em>tract should be entitled to the lands by them settled, at 11/. per hundred acres, the court must believe that such inducements <em>were </em>held out by the said Dr. Walker, or his agents; and that those terms could not relate to the lands of the <em>Loyal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Company, of which the said <em>Walker </em>was a partner and an agent, because the price required of the settlers for the lands of the <em>Loyal Company </em>was but 3/. per hundred acres. The court is also of opinion that Dr. <em>Walker's </em>promise to the plaintiff, (some years after his settlement,) that he should hold lands on the same terms with those who settled under the faith of his proposals, provided he took a certain quantity, then described, by metes and bounds, (by which the plaintiff was induced to remain on and improve the lands,) entitled him to a settlement right equally as if he had first settled under the faith of those proposals; more especially, as 8/. <em>10s. </em>were paid to Dr. <em>Walker's </em>agent, <em>Daniel Smith, </em>in part consideration of the purchase-money, and Dr. <em>Walker </em>always acknowledged the plaintiff\u2019s right to some land in the <em>Wolf-hill </em>tract; this acknowledgment is proved by the receipt itself, by Dr. <em>Walker's </em>letter to his agent <em>Smith </em>respecting the controversy between <em>Vance </em>and the plaintiff, .and by the deposition of <em>Jacob Murrell. </em>It then only remains to be inquired, to how much land was the plaintiff entitled? For an answer we must look to the bill, (not absolutely contradicted,) and to the affidavits of <em>Murrell </em>and <em>Andrew Vunce; </em>from these it will appear that the plaintiff was entitled, on the terms of settlement, to not less than the quantity for which he has obtained a deed from the defendants, to wit, 840 acres. And it is further the opinion of the court that the plaintiff has not waived his right to demand a fulfilment of the contract with Dr. <em>Walker, </em>by the execution of his bond and the deed of trust in the bill and answer mentioned. This case differs from the case of <em>Vance </em>and the defendant. In that case, the agreement, as set forth in the bill, (except for three hundred acres,) was too vague and uncertain for the court to act upon; three hundred acres, or thereabouts, appeared to be in the contemplation of the parties, and for that quantity <em>Vance </em>obtained a title on the terms of settlement; the bounds to which he claimed a title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>were undefined; and, for more than three hundred acres, there was no mutuality of contract.\u201d The decree, therefore, (though in <em>Vance\u2019s Case </em>it was for the defendant,) was in this case for the plaintiff; whereupon the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b379-4\">After argument, by <em>Wirt </em>and <em>Call, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AQj\">and <em>Wickham, </em>for the appellee, the judges, on</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AVj1\">Wednesday, <em>June </em>12th,</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AkzH\">pronounced their opinions <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b379-5\">Judge Coai.tee.</author>\n<p id=\"AQqq\">From the statement in the bill itself, the plaintiff\u2019s first settlement on the land in controversy was not under the faith of <em>Walker\u2019s </em>propositions to settlers; though he says that after seeing those proposals, he contented himself to live on and cultivate the land for several years. He did not, however, intend to purchase as much land as he now claims; on the contrary, says he objected to purchase so much, but <em>Walker </em>would not let him have any unless he took the whole ; to which, on <em>Walker\u2019s </em>saying he would make the matter easy, and take property, he finally assented. When this conversation between him and <em>Walker </em>took place is not stated <em>; </em>nor does it anywhere appear. From the quantities for which taxes were paid, it would seem that 300 acres was the quantity the plaintiff first contemplated taking ; and this was all he claimed from 1793 until 1799. Yet his witness, <em>Jacob Murrell, </em>says that, in 1793, Dr. <em>Walker </em>told him he had given to the plaintiff, when last in that country, the preemption for 1,000 acres! Why did he not, then, pay taxes for that quantity ? But, even in 1800, he is charged with only five hundred acres. Yet it is said that in <em>April, </em>1800, he purchased from <em>Francis </em>Walker. He had probably directed an extension of his claim, on the commissioners\u2019 books, as far as 500 acres before <em>Francis Walker </em>went to that country; and, in 1801 and 1802. he is charged with 840 acres, the quantity sold by <em>Francis Walker, </em>When D,r. <em>Walker </em>had been last in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>country, next preceding the year <em>1T93, </em>(at which time, i\u00a3 is said, the contract with him took place,) does not ap-* pear; and it may be that it was after the statute to pre\u00ab vent frauds and perjuries was in force. The plaintiff, therefore, ought to have stated and proved the time more precisely than he has done; in order to show that his case did not come within the influence of that statute, even as to <em>Thomas Walker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">But, with respect to <em>Francis </em>Walker, the contract with him is since the statute; and was reduced to writing. It is said, however, that a very important verbal condition accompanied that written contract, whereby, at any future day, it could be done away. But such condition, forming, as it is said, part of the contract, ought to have been reduced to writing, as well as the principal contract itself. Otherwise, the statute, which requires a writing, would be completely evaded, if verbal conditions, totally changing its nature, are to be set up as part of the contract. It would be contrary to the statute, therefore, to admit of such evidence, unless there was clear proof that such condition\u2019s not being introduced into' the writing was superinduced by fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">But it is said the plaintiff does not claim under the\" contract with <em>Francis Walker, </em>but under that made with <em>Thomas Walker. </em>To this I answer, first, that it does not appear that <em>that, </em>even, Was made prior to the statute; but the reverse is presumable from the circumstances above stated. But, if that contract was before the statute, how would the case stand, stripped of what is said to be the verbal agreement of <em>Francis Walker ? </em>It would be this, that the plaintiff, about the year <em>1773, </em>took possession of, or settled on, part of the lands of <em>Thomas Walker; </em>that, some time afterwards, <em>Walker </em>agreed to sell him a quantity, supposed to be 1,000 acres, at <em>111. </em>per hundred ; that he neither gave a bond for the price, ascertained the quantity, or took one for the <em>title; </em>(nor does it sufficiently appear that he ever paid a cent for it;) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>and even had a smaller quantity taxed to him on the commissioners\u2019 books than he now claims to have purchased; that, after the death of <em>Thomas Walker, </em>he voluntarily purchased the land from his devisee, paid him 225/, (a sum greater than would have been due for the 850 acres, under the alleged contract with <em>Thomas Walker,') </em>and gave his bonds, and a deed on the land to secure the balance. Would not all these acts and omissions preclude him, at this day, from setting up this stale, verbal agreement with <em>Thomas Walker, </em>so as to set aside his subsequent written agreement with <em>Francis f </em>The plaintiff, therefore, must make out a case for a court of equity by means of the verbal condition said to be entered into with <em>Francis Walker. </em>To admit of such proof, without proof that the non-reduction of that condition to writing was induced by fraud, I think would open a door intended to be shut by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">I think the case of <em>Vance </em>v. Walker, for the quantity claimed beyond the 300 acres, was a case as strong, or stronger, for that plaintiff, than this is for the present plaintiff, as to the 850 acres he claims ; and that that case is conclusive as to this.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The decree must, therefore, be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b381-6\">Judge Cabell.</author>\n<p id=\"A12\">This case comes completely within the principles settled in this court in the case of <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Vance, 3 </em>H. <em>&amp; M. </em>p. 288. I am therefore of opinion, that the decree of the chancellor be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b381-7\">Judge Brooke.</author>\n<p id=\"A9y\">This, case comes clearly within the rule laid down by this court in the case of <em>Vance </em>v. <em>Walker. </em>There is certainly no proof of fraud in obtaining the deed of trust, nor of mistake in the execution of it. The important question in controversy seems to be whether, at the time of executing that deed, there was an effectual agreement between the parties that, if at any time after-wards, the appellee could prove a prior agreement with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the father of the appellant of a different nature from the one which was the basis of the deed of trust, and going to avoid it, in that Gase the deed should not be a bar to such agreement, and that the appellee should have the full benefit of it. The proof offered of the alleged prior agreement is not, in my opinion, conclusive, to establish it; but, if it were, the principle is settled by the case before referred to, that proof of any agreement which would operate as a proviso to a deed solemnly executed, must be in writing. None of the evidence in this case is of that character. I am therefore of opinion, the decree of the chancellor must be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b382-10\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"Arq\">In conformity to the decision of the court in the case of <em>Vance </em>v. Walker, I concur that this decree should be reversed; my own opinion, however, is otherwise, for the reasons assigned by me in that case, though, perhaps, this is rather a weaker case than that.</p>\n<author id=\"b382-11\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"A2jg\">I have examined this record with great attention, and discovernothing to distinguish it, in principle, from the case of <em>Vance </em>v. <em>Walker ; </em>and, though the evidence, in the case before us, is more copious, it is of the same complexion and character with that adduced by <em>Vance ; </em>which varies the two cases in some immaterial circumstances only; and, in my conception, is inadmissible to annul a solemn contract, deliberately entered into, committed to writing, and signed, and sealed by the parties. The admission of oral testimony, for such a purpose, would* in my apprehension, be a virtual repeal of one of the most wise and beneficial acts in our statute-book.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">The grounds, or reasons, on which this court decided the case of <em>Vance </em>v. Walker, are so cogent, explicit, and conclusive to my mind, that a volume written on the subject would throw no new light upon the cause; and I shall only add my opinion that the decree ought to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>reversed, the injunction dissolved, and the bill dismissed with costs, ,</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Decree unanimously reversed, and bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
