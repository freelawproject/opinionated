From that affirmance, an appeal was taken which (having abated by the death of the appellant) was revived on behalf of his administrator.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b514-12\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afs\">A promise to make compensation, <em>in general </em>terms, for a trespass or neglect, is not founded on sufficient consideration to support an action of <em>assumpsit; </em>for it only puts the party on the footing of the legal liability. If the party was legally liable, the promise is a mere nullity, being unnecessary, and not increasing his obligation; and if he was <em>not, </em>the promise founded on the supposed liability is not obligatory ; for the consideration must be coextensive with the promise.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-13\">But <em>Nelson </em>was not leakily liable for the neglect charged. It was not the duty of the <em>clerk </em>to take the bond ; but of the <em>justices </em>themselves, under whose immediate direction he acted. When they intrust this to the clerk, it is a <em>personal confidence, </em>for which he is not responsible <em>as clerk. </em>Otherwise the law would have given the party injured his election, to sue the clerk, or the justices. The clerk had no right to judge of the sufficiency of the securities.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-14\">The defect of consideration for the promise is manifest in another respect. It is nowhere stated that the plaintiffs have paid the amount of the judgment against them, or that they are able to pay it. Indeed it is possible they may never pay it; and so may get something for nothing. In this case, as in that of a security suing his principal, it must be shown that the money has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>paid. It may be said that the verdict cures this defect. But according to <em>Rushton </em>v. <em>Aspinall, </em>2 <em>Doug. 679. </em>and <em>Chichester </em>v. <em>Vass, </em>1 Call, 83. no <em>material </em>omission in the declaration can be supplied by verdict.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b515-4\"><em>Botts, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqA\">Mr. <em>Wickham </em>contends that this is an effort of the justices to charge their own delinquency on their clerk. To judge of the relative duties of the court and the clerk, the practice of the country ought to be considered. The common practice, on allowing <em>appeals, </em>is to permit the bonds to be given in the clerk\u2019s office; and, even when the court is in session, the clerk receives the security, upon affidavit that he is worth the requisite sum; and upon such <em>affidavit alone. </em>This practice leads to no inconvenience; but to depart from it would be excessively inconvenient: if a contrary rule be established the courts must hereafter read all the affidavits, and see to the sealing and delivery of all the bonds. The necessity of the <em>clerk's </em>performing these duties, in the inferior courts, is very strong. The justices are continually shifting from the bench. It cannot, therefore, be expected that they should attend to the entering of every qualification, and the administering of every oath. The general practice, that the clerk shall do this, is equivalent to a rule of court; and when the court confides to its minister a duty which he fails to perform, he must be liable. If two parties agree on damages to be paid for an <em>assault </em>and <em>battery, </em>and the assailant promise payment of the <em>sum agreed, </em>to the injured party, <em>assumpsit </em>will lie upon <em>that </em>promise. Admit that the tort or misfeasance would not <em>raise a promise </em>t\u00f3 be sued on; yet, in favour of the judgment, an. <em>express </em>promise will, after verdict, be presumed to have, been proved at the trial ;<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> for whether the promise was express or implied, the declaration would charge it as of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>the former character; and, in the latter case, the IaW presumes an implied promise, and therefore raises it, if the case proved be a fit one ; if not, the plaintiff must fail without proof of an <em>express promise. </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The promise, in this case, being to pay the amount of a <em>certain judgment, </em>in consideration of a previous legal liability, is therefore sufficient to support the action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-10\">But even if the defendant were not originally responsible, his express promise would bind him, being founded upon a moral, though not a legal obligation; as in the case of a'bankrupt who has obtained his certificate, his promise to pay a previous debt is obligatory ; because he is morally bound.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-11\">If the declaration be defective, it is, at most, only a perfect case imperfectly set out. The case of <em>Murrell </em>v. <em>Johnson's Adm'r, 1 H. &amp; M. </em>450. is decisive that the recovery against the justices is sufficient to raise the consideration, without averring payment, or ability to pay. The cases cited there by Judge Tucker go the whole length of this. It is a strange idea that the vexation and expenses of a suit, and the subjection of their bodies to imprisonment under the judgment, are no injuries to them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b516-12\">Wickham, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"As3\">The affidavit of the security is not sufficient to justify the clerk, if he know him to be insolvent. But in this case, of a guardian\u2019s bond, that point is unimportant. This bond must be taken in open court, to the justices then sitting: and, according to the case of <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>3 Call, 421. a bond taken under a statute must be strictly conformable to it. The justices had no right to delegate their authority to the clerk: a judicial authority cannot be delegated. But, admit it to be a ministerial act, and that it could be delegated, it was intrusted to this man as their agent or representative only ; not to him as part of his official duty. They are responsible for the act of their own agent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-13\">I have never .known an instance of a clerk\u2019s judging of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>the sufficiency of a guardian\u2019s bond ; between which and bonds taken upon appeals, writs of error, supersedeas, or injunctions, there is a plain distinction in this respect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-3\"><em>Murrell </em>v. <em>Johnson's Adm'r </em>was a case of an indemnifying bond. In such case, suit may be brought as soon as the plaintiff is damnified; even as soon as suit is brought against him. A judgment, 1 admit, does damnify. But the declaration in this case does not charge that <em>Nelson </em>was bound to indemnify the plaintiffs. He is not bound to pay them the money. If he be responsible at all, it must be on the ground that he was originally liable. If so, he might now be compelled to pay the money again, if they should fail to pay it to the party who obtained the judgment against them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-4\">This is not like the case of a promise by a certificated bankrupt. In that case the declaration does not charge the defendant with being legally liable, and therefore promising, as the declaration here does. If the clerk was not legally liable, the consideration upon which the plaintiffs have thought proper to rest their case sinks under them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-5\">If <em>A. </em>should sue <em>B., </em>charging that <em>B. </em>hid beaten him, and in consideration thereof, became legally bound to pay him a certain sum of money, and therefore promised to pay that <em>sum; </em>the action would not lie. But in case of a compromise, if the plaintiff agree not to bring his action of assault and battery, upon the defendant\u2019s promising to pay a certain sum <em>; </em>an action lies upon the promise.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b517-6\">Thursday, <em>November </em>28th,</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Alu\">Stanard, on the same side, to show that the action of <em>assumpsit </em>would not lie in cases like this in principle, referred to 1 Crunch, 332. <em>Marine Insurance Company of Alexandria </em>v.

For instance, if he refuse to prepare the bond for signature, the court will immediately punish him for such contempt: or, if the bond, after it is legally executed, be lost by the negligence of the clerk, not the court, (who did their duty,) but the clerk., will be answerable to the party injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">I cannot, therefore, well see how the clerk can be made liable to damages for the non-execution of the bond; inasmuch as the law directs the justices to take it; prescribes a remedy against them for neglect, and shows how they may secure themselves against this penalty, if bond be not given, to wit, by appointing a curator, &amp;c. But, as there may, perhaps, be cases in which the clerk will be answerable for the non-execution of a bond of this kind, I am not prepared to say that neither the justices, nor the parties, shall, in any event, have recourse to him for indemnity. Before such recourse, however, shall be had, I am of opinion it must at least appear that the clerk had it in his power to take a legal and proper bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">If we- consider the order of the court in this case, as stated in the declaration, to mean that the clerk was to take the bond in the office, I think the clerk would not be responsible; because this would impose on him the doing an illegal act; and, if he did it not, especially as the order appointing the guardian is absolute, (not conditional, \u201c on his giving bond in the office,\u201d) the clerk ought not to be responsible, for the consequences of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>irder: since he could not compel the party to give bond, and could not indemnify himself by the appointment of a curator, in case of failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">If we consider the order as directing him to take the bond in court, it does not appear that he had it in his power to do so; for, admitting that the order was not blank, as to the penalty, as stated in the declaration, but that the court, after yerdict, would presume a penalty had been <em>fixed; </em>yet it does not appear that the party was either able or willing to give security, or that such security was approved by the court: on the contrary, it appears that they had not approved of any one as security, but directed the clerk to take good security. The order was not conditional ; the clerk could not compel the party to give security, or appoint a curator in case of failure : and it nowhere appears that he could have taken bond, even if he had power to judge of the sufficiency of the security j he was, therefore, not responsible for the non-execution of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">There are other circumstances, too, in this case, which have great weight on my mind, but on which I forbear to give any absolute opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">It is not stated in the declaration that the suit against the justices was brought by the wards generally ; by any one of them in particular; or by whom it was brought <em>\u00a1 or </em>that the suit was for such damages as had been assessed against the guardian in a suit by the orphan, or orphans, against him, and which he was unable to pay; (for which amount only, by the third section of the law, were they liable ;) nor is it stated that they had paid those damages, or any part of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Nor am I prepared to say whether, after,'verdict, thw <em>is </em>to be considered an express or implied assumption; or if the former, how far an action of that kind, for malfeasance in office, can be maintained; or how far such action, arising <em>ex </em>delicto, would be lost by the death of the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Upon the whole, I think there is nothing in this dec\u00eda\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>tion to support either an express or implied assumption ;<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> and that both judgments are erroneous. \u25a0</p>\n<author id=\"Avh\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"ADzA\">Not deeming it necessary to consider, <em>or </em>decide upon, the other objections made to the judgment and declaration in this case, I am of opinion to reverse both judgments, and enter judgments for the appellant,on this ground, that no sufficient cause of action is stated in the declaration: for, while the promise stated in the declaration is predicated upon the alleged neglect of the deputy of the appellant\u2019s intestate to take the bond and surety, in and by the said declaration supposed to be necessary, it is not averred that the appellees and their associates designated the said sureties, and admitted their sufficiency; without which the deputy aforesaid was not bound to complete the bond aforesaid ; and, consequently, the promise erected thereupon was without, an adequate consideration to support it.</p>\n<author id=\"b520-8\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"AUq\">Not doubting but every clerk of a court of record is responsible for the malfeasance, or neglect of the official duties, of his deputy, I am yet of opinion that neither the principal nor deputy is to be mulcted for failing to perform a service not required of them by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">The ground of the present action is, that the deputy clerk of the defendant neglected to take a bond, with sufficient security, of a guardian appointed by the court. From the plaintiffs\u2019 own showing, they had no cause of action against the defendant; the taking a guardian\u2019s bond being not a ministerial, but a judicial duty ; which the law imposes on every court appointing a guardian. The clerks generally provide blank bonds, which are, or ought to be, always filled up, and executed, in open court, which is to judge of the sufficiency, or insufficiency, of the security offered, and to order accordingly ; which order (among others of the day) is to be read by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>clerk, and signed by the presiding member before the adjournment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">It seems to me, therefore, that the defendant was not chargeable, either on an express or an implied <em>assumpsit; </em>and, consequently, that the judgment of both courts ought to be reversed, and judgment entered for the appellant; which is the unanimous opinion of the court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"A-7\"> <em>7 T.
