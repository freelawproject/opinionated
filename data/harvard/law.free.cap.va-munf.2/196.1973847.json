Whereupon <em>Nanny </em>the appellee filed his bill in chancery m the county court of <em>Bedford </em>against <em>George Lambert </em>and <em>William Graham, </em>(the trustee,) to compel a conveyance from the former, and a due execution of the trust by the latter. The bill stated that the plaintiff had been compelled to pay the debts for which he was bound as security for the said <em>Pfuinn.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-5\">The answer of <em>Lambert </em>denied that he had any knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s claim at the time he received the conveyance from <em>Lynch; </em>but the contrary was fully proved by depositions, showing that, although he might have known nothing of the trust deed when he made the arrangement with, and obtained the order from, <em>ifuinn, </em>he was fully apprized of it before he received the conveyance from Lynch.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-6\">The county court was of opinion \u201c that <em>John Ifuinn </em>had the power and did convey the lot, in the town of Liberty, in the proceedings mentioned, by the trust deed to <em>Graham ; </em>and that the defendant <em>George Lambert </em>purchased the same, subject to the equity of the said conveyance.\u201d It was therefore adjudged, ordered, and decreed, that the said <em>Lambert </em>(having received the legal title from Lynch) do convey the same to the said <em>William Graham, </em>the trustee aforesaid; that he the said trustee proceed to sell the said lot, with its appurtenances, under the limitations in the said trust <em>deed; </em>and that the said <em>Lambert </em>pay to the complainant his costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aqy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>Upon an appeal, this, decree was affirmed by the su\u00bb perior court of chancery for the <em>Richmond </em>district? whereupon the appellant again appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b218-6\">Wickham, for the appellant, made three points.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZ-\">1st. Proper parties to the suit were wanting. <em>Quinn </em>is materially interested- The debts for which the deed, of trust was given may have been satisfied, and he may have the evidences of payment. He ought, therefore, to be a party, to afford him an opportunity of showing this, and of thereby protecting himself from <em>Lamberts </em>claim: for if <em>Lambert </em>loses the land, <em>Quinn </em>is responsible to him. <em>Kennedy </em>and MtCormack, the creditors mentioned in the deed of trust, should have been parties also ; because the money due to them may not have been paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-8\">In support of this point, Mr. <em>Wickham </em>cited <em>Harrison v. </em>Harrison, 1 Call, 428. <em>Hoover </em>v. <em>Donally, </em>3 <em>H. &amp; M. </em>316. <em>Waggoner </em>v. Gray, 2 <em>H. &amp; M. </em>603. <em>Cooper\u2019s Eq. Pl. </em>33\u201437. <em>Wyatts Pr. Reg. </em>299. <em>Call </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>MS.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-10\">2d. Admitting that <em>Lambert </em>had notice of the claim of <em>Nanny </em>before he obtained the legal title, he had no such notice before he made his arrangement with Quinn. His case, therefore, resembles that of a subsequent mortgagee, not having notice of a prior mortgage, and afterwards purchasing a mortgage precedent to both; in which case the rule is established that the last mortgagee shall hold the land till he be satisfied what is due upon both securities,- though he had notice of the intervening,\" before his purchase of the prior mortgage. <em>5 Bac. 55. (Gwill. </em>edit.) A subsequent purchaser (though without deed) stands on the same footing as a subsequent mortgagee. <em>Ibid. 57.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-11\">3d. If <em>Lambert </em>cannot protect himself as a purchaser without notice, he is entitled as a creditor; the deed of trust having never been recorded.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> rl he clause in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>act of assembly makes a deed not recorded, void against <em>u </em>any creditor,\u201d whether with notice or without.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-9\"><em>Samuel Taylor </em>and Munfordcontra, 1st.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACo\">There was no necessity to make <em>Quinn </em>a party; because, with respect to the subject in controversy, he stands indifferent between the present parties; it being certain that the property in dispute is liable to one or the other; and the only question being which of them has the preference; a point in which he is not interested. <em>Quinn </em>is responsible, indeed, if <em>Lambert </em>loses the land : but he is equally so if <em>Nanny </em>should lose it. And should he prove that <em>Nanny's </em>deed of trust was satisfied, he would not be benefited ; for the only effect would be to remove an obstacle to <em>Lambert's </em>title. If <em>Lambert </em>wished the assistance of <em>Quinn </em>to defeat the plaintiff, he might have taken his deposition, or filed a cross-bill, and made him a party ; <em>Nanny </em>was not bound to do so, since he wanted no decree against <em>Quinn, </em>but against the property only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-10\">Neither was there any necessity to make <em>Kennedy </em>and <em>McCormack </em>parties. If <em>Nanny </em>has not paid them the debts for which he was surety, they have still their remedy against him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-11\">2d. <em>Lambert </em>was a purchaser with full notice of <em>Nanny's </em>equitable title; it being in proof that he had such notice before he obtained the conveyance. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-12\">3d. The act of assembly relating to deeds not recorded does not apply ; for <em>Nanny </em>and <em>Lambert </em>are both creditors of Qitinn; and <em>Nanny </em>has the preference in equity, by virtue of his prior deed, (of which <em>iMmbert </em>had notice,) though not recorded.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b219-13\">Saturday, <em>April </em>20th.</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"ASf\"> Note. The statute of frauds was not pleaded in this ease, nor in any way relied upon. In the deed <em>Lambert </em>admitted the validity of the contract. between <em>Quinn </em>and <em>Lynch, </em>because he claimed under it himself. That the statute does n0t apply in equity where the parties admit the contract, and do not insist upon the statute; see 1 <em>Fonb. </em>b. 1. c, 3. s. 8. and the notes thereto; and <em>3 H. &amp; M. </em>162. part of Judge <em>Tucker\u2019s </em>opinion in <em>Argenbright </em>v. <em>Camp</em>be<em>ll and Wife.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b218-9\"><em> Rev.
