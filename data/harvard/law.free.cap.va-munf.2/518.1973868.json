The defendant <em>Green, </em>on whom alone the process was executed, \u2022 1 <em>7 </em>pleaded \u201c paymentand issue was ioined; and at a sub-1 r . , sequent term (the plaintiff assenting thereto) he filed two other pleas; one of which was, in substance, that the defendant <em>Green </em>was only a <em>security William Black-</em>the ether obligor; and that, according to the act Gf assembly<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> in that case made and provided, he had <em>J </em>v <em>' </em>1 <em>* </em>required the plaintiff to bring suit against the said <em>Blackwell </em>which he neglected to do; wherefore, he the said <em>Green </em>was exonerated from the said writing obligatory.

The third plea was as follows: \u201c And the said defendant, for further plea in this behalf, &amp;c. says, that the plaintiff his action aforesaid thereof against him ought not to have or maintain, because he says that, after executing the said writing obligatory in the declaration mentioned, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>to wit, on the day of ,in the year 18 ,at the county aforesaid, he the said defendant, according to the act of assembly, &amp;c. (he being then and there only a <em>security </em>in the said bond, for the said <em>William Blackwell </em>in the said writing obligatory mentioned,) did then and there require the said plaintiff to institute a suit on the said writing obligatory in the said declaration mentioned, and prosecute the same to judgment; and the said plaintiff, afterwards, to wit, on the day of ,18 , in the county court of <em>Fauquier, </em>according to the said notice, did institute a suit against the said <em>William Blackwell, </em>but, afterwards, to wit, on the day of , 18 , did dismiss the said suit, without prosecuting the same t\u00f3 judgment; whereby, according to the act of assembly, &amp;c. the said defendant is exonerated and discharged from the said writing obligatory; and this he is ready to verify,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-6\">The plaintiff replied as follows; \u201c And the said plaintiff, further, for answer, saith, to the said plea of the defendant last above pleaded, that he ought not, by any thing therein contained, to be barred of his action aforesaid ; because he saith that the said defendant did not, at any time after executing the writing obligatory aforesaid, give notice to, or require, the said plaintiff, <em>in writing, </em>to institute a suit thereon; and the said plaintiff saith, that he did not institute any suit on said bond, in pursuance of any notice given by the said defendant according to the act of assembly, &amp;c. and this he is ready to verify, wherefore he prays judgment,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-7\">To this replication the defendant <em>demurred; </em>setting forth as causes of demurrer; \u201c 1st.
