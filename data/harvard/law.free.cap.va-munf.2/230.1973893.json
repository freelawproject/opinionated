Hardaway, </em>gave in evidence, to support the issue on his part, a bill of sale executed to the plaintiff by his father <em>William Hardaway, </em>dated <em>April </em>25th, 1802, and duly recorded, conveying to him, his heirs, and assigns for ever, twenty-eight negroes, by name, (of whom was one,) for and in consideration of the sum of <em>\u2022* ' </em>1,680/. current money. He further proved that the said <em>William Hardaway </em>had been frequently anxious to sell his said slaves before this sale to the plaintiff; that the sum \u00b0f 1,680/.\"was a, full price for them; that to the payment \u00b0f sum the plaintiff\u2019s own means were fully adecluate&gt; independently of the property acquired by him by the said purchase | and, moreover, he gave bond with good atad sufficient security for the payment of the same; having actually paid in part the sum of 900/. or thereabouts; nearly all of which sum of 900/. was paid, not to the said <em>William Hardaway </em>himself, but to his creditors, in discharge of their just demands against him, and such payments were by the plaintiff accounted for, allowed as discounts, and actually credited upon the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>bond; that at the time of the execution of the said bill of sale, the said <em>William Hardaway </em>delivered to the plaintiff all the slaves therein mentioned, though with an express verbal stipulation that part of the said slaves, of whom <em>Jack </em>was one, should remain with him the said <em>William Hardaway </em>till the <em>Christmas </em>following, in order to finish the <em>crop; </em>but the plaintiff and the said <em>William Hardaway </em>lived upon the same plantation, within one hundred yards of each other, and used the same gardens, &amp;c\u201e and the stipulation, that part of the slaves, of whom <em>Jack </em>was one, should remain with the said <em>William Hardaway </em>until the <em>Christmas </em>ensuing, was a part of the original contract, which was accordingly carried into <em>effect; </em>that, at the expiration of that time, the plaintiff hired a part of the said slaves (including Jack) to the said <em>William </em>Hardaway, for a valuable consideration, for the ensuing year, (1803,) and, again, on the 23d of December, 1803, for the year 1804. It further appeared from the testimony, that the slaves had always, from the date of the bill of sale, been registered on the commissioners\u2019 books of <em>Dinwiddle </em>county, as the property of the plaintiff, by whom the taxes chargeable thereupon had always been paid: \u201c And a witness of the plaintiff, who was intimately acquainted with both parties to the said bill of sale, who drew that instrument, and who lived, during a considerable portion of the time in which these transactions happened, in the family of the said <em>William </em>Hardaxvay, declared that he never heard a syllable drop from either of the said parties, or observed any part of their conduct, that justified the remotest suspicion that there was any fraudulent design in making the said contract; and that he verily believed that it was a <em>bona fide </em>transaction.3\u2019 It was further proved that, in February, 1804, the said slave Jack, then being in the possession of the said <em>William </em>Hardaway, by virtue o\u00ed the bailment last mentioned, was seized by the sheriff of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number><em>Dinwiddle </em>county to satisfy a <em>fi. fa. </em>against him, and sold by the sheriff, though forbidden by the plaintiff, under which sale the defendant held; the debt, on which the judgment was rendered, having originated prior to the execution of the bill of sale, though the judgment was not rendered till afterwards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-9\">This being all the evidence in the case, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved the court to instruct the jury \u201c that the law was, that, wherever there is an absolute bill of sale for a valuable consideration, the possess on must accompany and follow the deed, in order to make the conveyance valid against creditors j that, if the possession remain in the grantor, that circumstance is not only evidence of fraud, but is <em>fraud per se, </em>not to be controverted by any evidence of fair and <em>bona fide </em>intentions in the contracting parties, however strong; and that, in this particular'case, the possession of the said slaves stated to have remained in the bargainor <em>William </em>Hardaway, under the circumstances and for the purpose above stated, after the execution of the said bill of sale to the plaintiff, was such a possession as was not only evidence of fraud, but of itself fraud, which no countervailing evidence, however strong, of <em>bona fide </em>intentions in the parties to the contract, could wipe away; and therefore the jury ought to find for the defendant; and the court did so instruct the jury, and added, that the possession proven to have remained in the bargainor <em>William Hardaway </em>was such, that counsel could not go into argument to prove to the jury that the possession, so as aforesaid proven, was not such a possession as the rule of law (sanctioned by the court as above mentioned) applied to and established as a fraud of itself.\u201d To which opinion the plaintiff by his counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-10\">Verdict and judgment for the defendant, and appeal taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b252-11\">Hay, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvC3\">The court erred in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>\u00a1traction to the jury.

Prior to his time there was no decision, that possession must follow and accompany the deed, otherwise it is fraud <em>per se. </em>Lord <em>Coke </em>never thought a transaction, fair and honest in fact, was fraudulent in law. In <em>Twine\u2019s Case,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the circumstance that possession did not accompany the conveyance is not said to be fraudulent <em>per se, </em>but only evidence of fraud, or a circumstance to be weighed with other circumstances.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-5\">I admit: the modern judges have sanctioned the doctrine of <em>Builer ; </em>as in <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>1 <em>Cranch, </em>309.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b253-6\">No counsel for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b253-7\"><em>Tuesday, April </em>23d,</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ayj\">(in the absence of the president,) Judge Roanis reported the unanimous opinion of the court (consisting of Roane, Beooke and Cabell) that the judgment be reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-8\">The court\u2019s opinion was entered as follows ;</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b253-15\"> See 2 <em>T.
