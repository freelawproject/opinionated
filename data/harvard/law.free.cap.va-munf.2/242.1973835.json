In <em>Sayre </em>v. Grymes, the court went upon the general principle, that a person not interested can neither appeal nor obtain a <em>supersedeas. </em>Besides, this was not a proper subject for an appeal: the county court had conclusive power on the subject, and were the best judges whether the commission of 7 1-2 <em>per cent, </em>was reasonable or not.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-5\">\n<em>P.

Nothing is to be presumed in favour of their decision. The account is brought up, and this court has all the <em>data </em>to enable it to form a judgment. Seven and a half <em>per cent, </em>is an extravagant compensation in this case. An executor is not to be allowed as an insurer of the debts ; but in proportion to his trouble and expense, according to fixed principles.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b263-6\"><em>Wednesday, April </em>24th.</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b262-22\"> Note.

The only doubt the court had upon the Subject was, whether, inasmuch as the order of allowance by the court of <em>Fairfax </em>county was only <em>ex parte,' </em>\u00bfh appeal would lie from the judgment; but considering that such <em>ex parte </em>settlement might operate injuriously to the appellee and others, in the event of the loss of testimony and documents competent to impeach that allowance, when the same might thereafter be more deliberately question- ' ed; the court is inclined to sustain the appeal, under that provision of the act which gives a right of appeal to all Who may be injured or aggrieved, by the sentence or judgment of a county court, in any suit br contest whatsoever,-,7</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed*</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
