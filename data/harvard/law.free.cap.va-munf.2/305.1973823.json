The account of rents and profits, thereby directed, was taken <em>May </em>30th, 1799, by Master Commissioned <em>Dunscomb, </em>who stated in his report, that he \u201c appointed that day for the defendants to render the account,\u201d and, they \u201c failing to attend,\u201d he proceeded to form an estimate of the annual value of the lands by means of the affidavit of .a certain <em>Samuel </em>Perrin, charging <em>Samuel J. Winston </em>with <em>7Si. </em>as one half of the amount thereof, from July, 1789, (the date of the deed of gift to him,) to July, 1795, when <em>Geddes Winston </em>died ; and <em>William Winston </em>with 861. <em>Ss. </em>calculating in like manner from March, 1790. When this-report (to which there was no exception) was returned, does not appear in the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-5\">On the 5th of October, 1799, the chancellor decreed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>\u201e that the defendants, <em>Samuel Jordan </em>Winston, and <em>William </em>Winston, do pay unto the plaintiff <em>671. 15s. </em>1 <em>Id. </em>(the amount of his judgment,) with interest on 28/. <em>7s. 3d. </em>1-2 from the 8th day of <em>October, </em>1788, until paid, and the costs; and that the hill be dismissed as to the other defendant William, <em>Radford\u2019\u2019</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-5\">To, this decree <em>Samuel Jordan Winston </em>filed a bill of review, on the following grounds: 1st. That Commissioner <em>Dunscomb's </em>report was made <em>ex </em>parte, and, \u201c to the best of his knowledge and belief, without any notice to him2dly. \u201c That the said report was confirmed the session after it came in, contrary to the practice of the court, and without the knowledge of his counseland, Sdly. \u201c That the decree ought not to have been against the defendants <em>jointly; </em>since it appeared by the report that the profits received by <em>William Winston </em>were greater than those charged to <em>Samuel J. Winston; </em>and the effect of this joint decree is that the latter, instead of being charged with half the debt, is made liable for the whole.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-6\">The bill of review also set forth sundry new matters 3 viz. \u201cthat, during the lifetime of the said <em>Geddes, </em>the complainant did not receive any rents or profits from the said lands, they being held by the said <em>Geddes ; </em>that the profits stated by the commissioner greatly exceed the actual value of the <em>land; </em>that part of the said land is held by the widow of the said <em>Geddes </em>as tenant in dower 3 that the complainant has paid large sums of money on account of the said <em>Geddes\u2019s </em>debts, and is moreover charged by a decree, in a suit, <em>Dandridge and others against </em>him, for a considerable sum; that whathe has paid, and is chargeable for, (exclusive of <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>claim,) is, he verily believes, fully equal to his interest in the said land ; and that the bond given by him to his father having been transferred, a suit has been brought thereon, and he has discharged it.\u201d No reason was assigned for not bringing forward all these circumstances (except the last) in the answer to the original bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number><em>Noel Johnson </em>having removed to <em>Kentucky </em>before the bill of review was exhibited, an answer by <em>William </em>Duval, his attorney and agent, was received on his behalf, defying generally the allegations in it. . Sundry depositions and exhibits were taken and filed in support of the new matter set forth in the bill. The. cause came on to be heard, the 5th of <em>October, </em>1805, when the chancellor affirmed the .decree reviewed, \u201c wherein error was not perceived,\u201d and dismissed the bill of review with costs; whereupon <em>Winston </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AQn\"><em>Munford </em>and <em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aaj\">The proceedings subsequent to the decree, which this court affirmed, have not conformed to that decree, which was, that the defendants should account for the profits of the lands held by them respectively, that is, they should sepaT rately account, as they held separately. There is a great difference between a joint contract and such a cas? as this. Each vyas answerable only for the estate in his hands,. Yet the decree was joint, and not <em>pro rata. </em>This was a direct departure from the decree of this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8o\">2. There are great objections to the commissioner's report on its face. In the first place, the order was no.t that he should make up an account; but that the defendant should render one. He had, therefore, no right to proceed <em>ex parte, </em>but should have reported to the court tfieir default, and the court might haye directed an attachment against them- Again, the commissioner was to report the rents and profits received by them; instead of which, he has staged the annual Value by conjectural estimate, \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-12\">\u25a0 3, The want of notice is an extrinsic objection, but sufjiciently established by <em>Winston's </em>affidavit to the truth of the bill qf review. In this cas? there being no proof, nor explicit statement by the commissioner that notice Was given, the mere presumption was rebutted by <em>Win---. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number><em>\u00bfton\u2019s </em>affidavit, and actual notj.ce should have been proved by tbe other party. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-4\">This objection was not taken in the original suit, because the report was not suffered to lie long enough in court. It was dated the 30th of <em>May, </em>and acted upon by the chancellor the 5th of <em>October </em>following; and it does not appear that the parties were heard; for the decree has this remarkahle peculiarity, that it is not said to have been rendered \u201c after hearing arguments of counsel,\u201d , (as is customary,) but only \u201c on consideration of tbe commissioner\u2019s report.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b329-5\"><em>Warden, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYt\">The decree against <em>Samuel J. </em>Win<em>ston </em>and <em>William Winston </em>jointly was correct; for they <em>answered </em>jointly, and there was no reason for making a distinction between them, since they were both volunta_ ry purchasers of lands, every part of which was e(lually liable to the plaintiff\u2019s demand. If the whole debt be taken out of the lands conveyed to the one, he may have his remedy out of those conveyed to the other.<footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-6\">As to the want of notice; the phrases used by <em>Dunscomb </em>in his report, \u201c that he appointed a day,\u201d and that the defendants \u201c failed\u201d to attend, sufficiently imply that they must have had notice. Arid, if they had not, they should have made the objection before the decree was rendered; for, from the date of the commissioner\u2019s re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>port, it must be supposed to have been returned, within the term of the then high court of chancery,.which commenced on the 12th of <em>May, </em>and not to the <em>September </em>term, as is-pretended in the bill of review.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b330-5\">\n<em>Cur. adv. vult.</em>\n</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b330-6\"><em>Wednesday, September </em>25th.</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b325-38\"> Note. *** See the 17th.

In his answer to the bill of review, <em>Duval </em>insisted that <em>Samuel J. Winston had notice </em>to attend the commissioner, <em>i( u\u00a7 would expressly appear by the papers filed in the original suit.\u201d </em>But no paper proving such notice appears in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b329-8\"> Note. The case of <em>Jliasorfs Devisees </em>v. <em>Peters' </em>Administrators, 1 Munford, 437. in which it was decided that where devisees are made responsible to <em>simple contract </em>creditors, upon the principle of marshalling assets, they shall be subjected, <em>not </em>jointly, but <em>pro </em>rata, does not appear to contradict this doctrine, as it respects the claim of <em>a judgment </em>creditor; because the <em>marshalling assets </em>being the mere creature of a court of equity, the court will manage it so as to do complete justice, and make an end of litigation; but the <em>judgment </em>creditor has a right in equity to as extensive a rqmedy as'he liad <em>at law% by </em>elegit,</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Aypv\">Judge Roane</author>\n<p id=\"AseZ\">reported the following opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"Ag5B\">\u201c The court is of opinion, that there is neither any error apparent upon the face of the decree sought to be reviewed, nor any new matter shown in the case before us, whicjh is competent to authorize the bill of review allowed in this case ; and .is farther of opinion that neither the allegation of the appellant that the report of. the commissioner was made without due notice to him of the time and place of taking the same, nor that the said report did not lie long enough in court, prior to the rendition of the decree, (objections on neither ground having been taken in the court below,) are of a character to justify a bill of review. On these grounds, this court affirms the decree of the chancellor dismissing the bill of review, with costs.\u201d .</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
