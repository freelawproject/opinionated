In a suit against a mercan! \u00fce company, if the names of the partners be omitled in th\u00ab writ and declaration, and the writ be served on <em>a, </em>person not named in either, a judg. meat <em>affaire! the company, </em>for that person\u2019s failing to appear, can \u2022 not be sustained.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b369-23\">2. <em>Quarc, </em>!H such case, whether <em>any </em>judgment by default could be sustained?</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-19\">THIS was an action of debt in the county court of Chesterfield, brought by Dunlop, <em>Pollok </em>\u00a3s? <em>Co. </em>against <em>Thomas Scott </em>8? <em>Co. </em>upon a penal bill, alleged in the declaration to have been sealed and delivered \u201c by the said defendants without specifying their names.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-20\">The writ was against \u201c <em>Thomas Scott </em>\u00a3s? <em>Co. </em>or either \u00aef the partners, if they be found,\u201d &amp;c. and was executed on <em>Archibald M'-Rae; </em>the sheriff returning that <em>Thomas Scott </em>was not found. <em>MLRae </em>gave bail for his appearance, but failing to appear, an office judgment was entered and confirmed, \u201c against the said defendants,\u201d for the debt in the declaration mentioned. This judgment was affirmed upon a writ of <em>supersedeas </em>awarded by the district court of <em>Richmond; </em>and thereupon the plaintiffs in error appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-21\">Hay, for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Amr\">1. The judgment is erroneous because it does not appear from the record that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number><em>Archibald M'Rae </em>was a member of the concern of <em>Scott </em>fc? <em>Co., </em>or ever sealed and delivered the bond ; or that there was any connexion between him and the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b370-9\">It may be said that a judgment by default admits the facts-; but a judgment by default can only be considered as an admission of that which is stated in the declaration. In this case, the declaration only charges that <em>Thomas Scott </em>Si? <em>Co. </em>signed and sealed the penal bill; but not that <em>Archibald M'-Rae </em>signed it, or was a partner. Neither does a defendant admit, by default, every thing necessary to maintain the plaintiff\u2019s action ; the <em>gist </em>of the action must be set forth in the declaration. But, even if <em>M'-Rae </em>was bound by <em>his </em>default, the other defendants, upon whom no process was served, were not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b370-12\">2. If <em>M'-Rae </em>was a partner, and had been so averred in the declaration, he was not legally bound by this bill penal, which has only one seal, and is signed \u2018\u2018 <em>Thomas Scott </em>&amp; Co.'\u2019<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b370-13\">One partner cannot bind the company by a bond signed by himself only, unless it be done with the assent of the rest, and on their behalf.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> If the declaration had said that <em>M'-Rae </em>signed for himself and the other partners, the judgment could only have been against <em>M'-Rae.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Aey\">3\u2018 Service of the writ upon a partner might have warranted a judgment against that partner, but not against the company.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> The rule in <em>England </em>is that, where t<em>h</em>e process is against two, on a joint cause or action, and one only appears, the other must be outlawed before there can be any further proceedings.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> It is, indeed, PrePosterous that judgment should be rendered against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>a man who had no opportunity to defend himself; such a position is contrary to the first principles of justice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Ae3\"><em>4. </em>A judgment on behalf of, or against, persons not named, is erroneous; except in the case of corporate bodies, who may sue and be sued by their corporate names; but individuals cannot.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Dunlop, <em>Pollok </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>the plaintiffs, should have shown who were the partners of their company; and, as to the could only be against such of after process served upon them. defendants, judgment could only be against such of them as were named; and</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b371-13\"><em>Call, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1b\">The cases of <em>Stott </em>&amp; <em>Donaldson </em>v. Alexander <em>&amp; </em>Co., 1 <em>Wash. </em>331. <em>Keel </em>&amp; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Herberts </em>Executors, <em>ib. </em>138. and <em>Taylor </em>&amp; <em>Co. v. M'Clean, </em>3 <em>Call, 557. </em>are examples of suits brought for, or against, mercantile companies without naming the partners. The uniform custom of this country (and such custom is greatly regarded in this court)<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> sanctions the practice. it was introduced and warranted by the situation of this country before the revolution, when business was generally carried on by <em>Scotch </em>factors, representing great numbers of persons residing in <em>Great Britain. </em>In such a state of affairs, the names of the partners being often unknown, the safe and fair way was to sue the company by the name of the firm. And in this there was no inconvenience; for the plaintiff was to take care that his execution was levied on the right property. The case of <em>Murdock, &amp;c. v. Herndon's Executors, 4 H. </em>&amp; <em>M. </em>200. shows that the death of a partner will not abate the suit, unless it be suggested on the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-17\">The <em>British </em>authorities quoted by Mr, <em>Hay </em>only show the practice in that country, but have no application, if I am right about the practice here, as founded in necessity. <em>Ye</em>t, even there, a foreign company, not acknowledged as corporate in <em>England, </em>has been permitted to sue by its corporate title.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> So a <em>scire facias </em>upon a recognisance lies against executors, without naming them by their <em>' </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>proper names.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Another analogous case is that of <em>terretehants ; </em>against whom a <em>scire facias </em>may issue ge\u00bb nerally, and be served on whom you please.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-7\">\n<em>Call.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alo7\"><em>Prec. in Ch. </em>131. 1 <em>Ch. Cas. </em>204. and 11 <em>Vin. </em>20. are cases showing that courts will entertain general suits, where, otherwise, difficulties would multiply, and abatements be frequent. This is often done in equity when parties would be excessively numerous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3u\">If the suit was regularly brought, the service on <em>M'-Rae </em>was sufficient. In a suit against two <em>executors, </em>service on one is enough. It has also been frequently decided, that one partner may appear for the whole; and, jf he does, the whole will be concluded.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> Does not this ' prove that he represents the suit for all ? Does his being an active or passive agent make any difference ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AI2\">Ii has been settled in this court that, where several defendants are sued, and the writ is served on part, judgment may be entered against those on whom it is served. Judgment, then, might be entered in this case against <em>M'-Rae, </em>if the court should be of opinion that it could not, with propriety, be against the other defendants. The defect in the declaration was only a ground of special demurrer, and could not be taken advantage of after judgment by default.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-14\">It may be said, that this is one of the inconveniences, arising from partnerships; but, in fact, there is no inconvenience ; for any person aggrieved may have his rerpedy by <em>audita querela, </em>or writ of error <em>coram. vobis.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-15\">As to the obligatory effect of this bill <em>penal; </em>all the, company, their heirs, &amp;c. are bound, in which respect the case does not resemble that of <em>Shelton v. Pollock </em>&amp; <em>Co., </em>1 <em>H. </em>&amp; <em>M. </em>423. which makes against Mr. Hay. <em>Walker </em>in that case did not bind the company, but him \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>self only. The plain innuendo is, that he might have worded the bond so as to bind the company; but the point is not expressly decided. Apply, then, the principles which governed the case of <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Campbell &amp; </em>Wheeler, 2 Call, 421. to this case, and they appear conclusive. Shall a man who has sold a hundred hogsheads of tobacco to a company have no remedy but against their factor ? Transactions in the usual course of business by individual partners are surely binding on the companies they represent; and I think it has so been decided in the federal circuit court of <em>North Carolina.</em></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b370-14\"> <em>Ball </em>v. <em>Dunsterville, 4 T.

The reports of the cases cited as examples, do not state the manner in which the suits respectively were brought. The style of each mercantile company is mentioned in the heading of each case; and that is all. Does Mr.' <em>Call </em>himself ever bring a suit, in the name <em>of </em>a company, without specifying the partners ? But if this were the practice of a few lawyers, it could not make the law of the land. So, in England, the practice of merchants, as to suits against endorsors of bills of exchange, did not fix the law. They wished to sue endorsors in the first place, but Lord <em>Holt </em>arrested all their judgments, and an act of parliament was at length passed at their instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">None of the authorities adduced by Mr. <em>Call </em>justify the conclusions he attempts to draw from them. 4 <em>II. </em>\u00a3s? <em>31. </em>200. proves the reverse of the proposition intended to be established by it. As, in that case, the suit would have abated by the death of <em>William </em>Cuninghame, (had it been suggested on the record,) it shows that the word <em>Co. </em>was not sufficient to keep it on the docket. According to Mr. <em>Call's </em>argument that all parties are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>properly before the court, though not named, a <em>scire facias </em>to revive (in case of the death of a party not named) would be unnecessary, though expressly required by the act of assembly.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Yet he cannot deny that, in consequence of the death of only one named on the record, there must be a <em>scire facias; </em>from which it is evident this suit is improperly brought.-</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\"><em>Henriques </em>v. <em>The Dutch West-India </em>Company, 2 <em>Ld. Raym. </em>1532. is a case of a corporation, and does not resemble this. If the doctrine laid down in 1 <em>Com. </em>Dig. 38. be law, it must be considered as an'exception to the general rule; but the practice of the court of chancery, and of this court, is not to award process of revivor until the names of executors are furnished to' the clerk. The passage quoted from 11 <em>Finer, </em>20. maybe law; on the ground, perhaps, that the plaintiff has no opportunity of knowing who the <em>terretenants </em>are; but it is only another exception to the general rule. <em>Hill et al </em>v. <em>Ross, 3 Dall. 331. </em>so far as it applies to the subject now in question, is pointedly in my favour; showing that \u201c partners cannot compel each other to appear to suits, nor undertake to represent each other in courts of law.\u201d But if the service of a writ upon one partner were service upon all, an appearance of one would be an appearance for all.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">Mr. <em>Call </em>thought proper to take no notice of the authorities cited by me from <em>Chitty </em>and 8 T. <em>R. </em>To these I will add 1 <em>Dall. </em>119. <em>Gerard </em>v. <em>Basse et al., </em>in which it was decided that the course of trade does not authorize one partner to execute a deed for another. 10 <em>East, </em>419. and 3 <em>Esp. Rep. 107. Abel </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>are to the same effect. He contends there is no inconvenience in the practice of suing persons without naming them. But is there no inconvenience in entering judgment against a man who has had no opportunity of defence ?</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">The writ of <em>audita querela </em>is now obsolete; but it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>lay only for matter of discharge arising after the judgment. The writ of error <em>coram vobis </em>could give no relief. If the defendant, on whose property execution was served, was a partner, he could not, by that writ, get relief on the ground that the debt had been paid before the suit was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\">As to its being too late, after judgment by default, to take advantage of the defect in the declaration, the rule applies to persons only who have had it in their power to make defence, and failed to do so.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b375-4\">Monday, <em>April 22d.</em></decisiondate>\n<p id=\"A96\">The judges pronounced their opinions.</p>\n<author id=\"AzaZ\">Judge Brooke.</author>\n<p id=\"AtU\">(After stating the case and the points made by counsel.) I shall not notice all these points in the opinion which I am to <em>deliver; </em>except to remark that I know of no practice in the courts of this country of sufficient authority to contravene the <em>English </em>decisions referred to and relied upon by the counsel for the appellants; nor have I been able to perceive any force in the objections of the counsel of the appellees to the application of them to cases here, either founded on the necessity of such a practice, or on reasonings drawn from the decisions of this court, to which he <em>referred; </em>none of which, in iny opinion, contradict the <em>English </em>adjudications.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Upon the first point, I am very clear that no case han been produced to warrant a judgment against a person, not alleged to be a party in the declaration, nor named as a defendant in the writ; the reasoning from the supposed analogy between such a case and the case of executors upon a scire facias to revive a judgment against them, or the case of <em>terretenants </em>after a judgment against the land, can have no force. In the first, (if, indeed, it be law, which I very much doubt,) there is less necessity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>for naming the executors in the process, than in the one under consideration; their names are of record, and there is less difficulty in identifying them by the officer serving the process; and less injury would result from mistakes, since they are not held to bail by the writ. The same remarks apply to the case of suing out the <em>scire facias </em>against the tenants; though not named in the record, they must be found on the land against which the judgment has been rendered; names which are said by the counsel for the appellees to be the <em>indicia </em>of persons, are not necessarily so in these cases; but great inconvenience and often great injury would result from extending this doctrine to original process. Any person, however ignorant of the demand of the plaintiff, and though totally unconnected with the concern against whom it might exist, would be liable to be arrested either by the mistake of the officer, or of the party pointing him out; he might not be able to give bail, and the law will not subject an individual to injury on the ground that he may afterwards be relieved in an action against the party injuring him; nor am I of opinion that the defendant <em>M'-Rae </em>is concluded, by the judgment rendered against him in this case, from objecting tq the irregularity of the proceedings; he cannot be said to have admitted (by not defending himself) any thing not alleged in the writ or declaration; nor can his admission, as far as it goes, affect the other defendants. For this doctrine, see 1 <em>Dall. </em>p. 119. and 3 <em>Dall. </em>p. 331. I am therefore of opinion the judgment must be reversed,</p>\n<author id=\"b376-9\">Judge Roahe</author>\n<p id=\"A1Yk\">was, also, for reversing the judgment, upon the ground that <em>M^Rae </em>was not alleged to be a partner. But he gaye no opinion relative to the other points.</p>\n<author id=\"b376-10\">Judge F|,EM?Nq.</author>\n<p id=\"As5\">Without considering minutely the several points made in the cause, I am also of opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>that the judgment be reversed. <em>Archibald </em>M\u00edRae, the only person on whom the writ was executed, was not alleged to have been a partner of the firm, nor even named in either the writ or declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\">Judgment unanimously reversed, and entered that the plaintiffs take nothing, See.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
