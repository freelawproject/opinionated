In <em>June, </em>1801, the suit abated, as to <em>Joseph Roberts, </em>by his death\u00bb Subpoena? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>to. revive were awarded against his widow and executrix, and eight children his heirs at law; which being returned executed, the cause came on to be heard, <em>September </em>27, 1804, on the bills, answers and exhibits; whereupon the court decreed that the injunction be dissolved; that the defendants, <em>Sarah </em>Roberts,resign to the plaintiff possession of the land in question, \u201c and account for the profits from the time the said <em>Joseph Roberts </em>came to the possession thereofto state and report which account certain commissioners were appointed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6S\">From this decree an appeal was prayed by counsel, on behalf of the representatives of <em>Roberts, </em>and allowed; but, during the same term, a petition for a rehearing, in nature of a bill of review, (for it is called a <em>bill,) </em>was presented to-the chancellor; stating, among other things, that many of them were <em>infants, </em>and incapable of conducting their cause; and that, owing to circumstances stated in the affidavit of <em>John Strode, </em>which is annexed to, and prayed to be taken as part of their bill, they were completely surprised at the trial. The court (observing that the former decree was interlocutory) awarded commissions to the parties for taking examinations of witnesses, to be read at the final hearing; saving to the plaintiff exceptions to that order. Commissions were accordingly issued, and several depositions taken, in the presence of <em>John Strode, </em>who is styled \u201c agent for the representatives and heirs of <em>Joseph Roberts </em>and, at the final hearing, <em>(March </em>26, 1805,) the court affirmed its former decree. But it nowhere appears in the record which of the children, of <em>Roberts </em>(if any) were infants at the time of the decree ; nor is there any person named, either as their testamentary, or statutory guardian, in the proceedings; nor was any guardian, <em>ad litem, </em>appointed by the court to defend them; nor is there any day given them, after they come of age, to show cause against the decree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>The defendants, representatives of <em>Roberts, </em>appealed to this court. *\u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b153-4\">The general effect of the exhibits and depositions suffieiently appears in the following opinions, pronounced on <em>Monday, April 1, </em>1811. But it is proper to mention that <em>Roberts </em>was proved, by sundry depositions, to have been informed, (before he made his entry,) by neighbourhood report, and a person, though not a party interested in the title,) who told him he had seen it, of the existence of <em>Fairfax's </em>patent. Many years possession and cultivation by tenants of the patentee was also proved^ which must have been known to Roberts, who lived, in the neighbourhood.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b153-5\">Botts, for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b153-6\"><em>Williams </em>and <em>Warden, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b153-7\">Judge Tucker,</author>\n<p id=\"AqI\">after stating the case. The suggestion in the bill of review, that the defendants in the original suit were infants, and incapable of defending their cause judicially, was, I conceive, a sufficient ground for the court to have inquired into that <em>fact; </em>and, if they had no guardian already appointed, a guardian, <em>ad </em>litem, ought to have been assigned them by the court. I therefore think the cause ought to be remanded to the court of chancery, that a guardian may be there assigned to the infants, (if such there are now,) and such further proceedings had, as may be thought necessary and proper for their full defence, as in the case of <em>Lees </em>v. <em>Braxton.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">If it be necessary at this time to say any thing on the merits of this cause, I would observe a circumstance not noticed by the counsel in the cause, which occurs upon, inspection of Lord <em>Fairfax's </em>grant or patent to <em>George W. Fairfax. </em>From some cause or other, it hath an impossible date, for it bears date on the eleventh day of Decern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>in the thirty-third year of the reign of <em>George </em>II. <em>anno domini </em>one thousand seven hundred and forty-seven. This latter year corresponds with the twenty-first year of tkat king\u20193 reign, and not with the thirty-third. The patent is alleged not to have been recorded in Lord <em>Fair-fax\u2019s </em>office, but that there is a blank leaf referred to at the foot of the patent, as the place pf registration. On this circumstance great stress was laid in the argument, as creating a presumption of fraud, in respect to this patent. The two circumstances of the date, and of the omission to record it, make it proper, in my opinion, (if the chancellor should entertain any doubt upon the subject,) that a jury should be empannelled at the bar of the court of chancery, to try an issue, to be made up between the parties, whether this grant or patent, be the deed of Lord <em>Fairfax, </em>or not. Perhaps it may be found to have been recorded in the record books corresponding with the 33d year of <em>George </em>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">With regard to the exception taken by a member of the court to the conveyance from <em>Wilson Miles Cary </em>to <em>Stanton </em>the complainant in the original bill; (he being only one of three trustees, named in the will of <em>George W. Fair-fax ; </em>the other two (though long since dead) not appearing by the record to have renounced the trust, nor, indeed, to be dead;) I conceive that a court of equity ought to supply any defect in the execution of the power given by the will, as far as circumstances will permit; it not being controverted that the conveyance to <em>Stanton </em>was for a good and valuable consideration, and (in all other respects) conformable to the intention of the testator, in creating the trust.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> For this purpose, I think, the proper course will be to direct the residuary devisee of the real estate of <em>George W. Fairfax, </em>in <em>Virginia, to </em>ke made a party defendant in this suit, to show cause, if r _ <em>1 7 </em>any he can against the validity of that conveyance. <em>J </em>\u00b0</p>\n<author id=\"b154-12\">Judge Roane.</author>\n<p id=\"AQD\">In this case several objections as^ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>taken on the part of the appellants; some of which go to the merits of the case, and others to the form of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"A5S\">As to the merits, it is first objected that the evidence of the grant to <em>George William Fairfax </em>was inadmissible, and not <em>sufficient; </em>the witness having never seen Lord <em>Fairfax </em>write, and only judging of his signature by com - parison of the hand-writing. It is unnecessary to go into the general doctrine upon this point, as it is held,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> that a deed or above thirty years\u2019 standing requires no further proof of its execution than the bare production, where the possession has gone according to the provisions thereof, and there is no apparent erasure or alteration upon the face of it. In the case before us, this possession is pioved, to my satisfaction, by several witnesses, to have existed in favour of <em>George William </em>Fairfax, under whom the appellee claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">2dly. It is said that, if the unregistered patent of <em>George William Fairfax </em>can prevail against the patent of Roberts, the question is purely legal, and cannot be relieved on by a court of equity. The answer is, on the contrary, that, admitting that <em>George William Fairfax's </em>deed cannot avail him at law for want of registration, it must avail him in equity, on the ground, which is fully proved, that <em>Roberts </em>knew of the existence of that patent, and of the possession of <em>George William Fairfax </em>by his tenants, before he made his entry ; that, therefore, a registration was, as to him, unnecessary, and he proceeded, consequently, against conscience, to locate granted land which he knew belonged to another.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AE1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>3dly. It is said that this omission to register the deed from the act of <em>George William </em>Fairfax, who himse^ was a principal clerk in Lord <em>Fairfax\u2019s </em>office <em>; </em>that ** was a fraud in him, and, therefore, the patent should not avail him. The answer is that it is not proved that <em>George William Fairfax </em>was the clerk. It is only stated (hy <em>D. </em>Field) that <em>William </em>Fairfax, who was probably the father of <em>George William </em>Fairfax, was the principal clerk about the time of the emanation of the patent in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">4thly. It is objected that the sale by <em>Cary </em>alone, without the concurrence of the other executors, (or, to this purpose, trustees,) was not valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">As to this point, the doctrine seems to be that there is a distinction between powers given to executors in their official characters, and to <em>A., B. </em>and C., who are also made executors; that, in the first case, all the executors who qualify answer the description, and may execute the power; but that, in the last case, a part of them cannot act, because a personal confidence was reposed in them, only in conjunction with the others. This point seems to have been taken by counsel, arguendo, in 1 <em>Wash. </em>340. <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Alexander; </em>and in the case ot <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Thomson,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was decided in this court, that a sale by . <em>3 </em>one executor under a power m a will was not-good; it not being found that the other executor was dead or refused to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">In the case before us, the power to sell is granted, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>true, in the original will of <em>George William </em>Fairfax, to his executors, and then he goes on to name seven persons as Ms executors ; but in his codicil the testator revokes and makes void the devise last mentioned, and devises the same land to <em>George Washington, George Nicholas, </em>and <em>Wilson Miles Cary, by </em>name, as trustees to sell, &amp;c. and also appointed these three gentlemen his executors in the <em>United States. Wilson Miles Cary </em>only conveyed the land in question, and only qualified as executor in <em>America ; </em>and it is not shown that the others were dead, or had refused to take upon them the execution of the will of the testator. If, therefore, Mr. <em>Cary </em>had acted, in this case merely under a general power to executors to sell, it would be at least doubtful whether, under the decision in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Thomson, </em>it ought not at least to have been shown that the other .executors were dead, .or had refused to act <em>% </em>but, in this case, Mr. <em>Cary </em>was emphatically one of the trustees under the codicil of <em>George William Fairfax. </em>As to trustees, it is said, 2 <em>Fonb. </em>184. that \u201c there is a difference between them and executors; for that trustees have ail equal power, interest and authority, and cannot act separately, as executors may, but must join, both in conveyances and receipts,\u201d &amp;c. Or the general principle, therefore, the law is clear against the validity of this conveyance ; and that principle is greatly strengthened, in the present case, by the consideration that .the testator has taken unusual pains in his codicil to provide, that, if one or more of his trustees should d.ie before the trust is fully accomplished, then others should be appointed by the survivors, who jointly with them should finish the execution of the trust. This,, then, is emphatically a case in which one of the trustees only was not competent to act; and I am sorry to be obliged to be of opinion to reverse the decree on this ground, as the merits seem dearly, in other respects, with the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>As to the power of a court of chancery to aid a defective execution of a power <em>; </em>while that is readily admitted, I do not think it extends to a case like the present, where there is a want of competency in the person acting, to execute the power, except in conjunction with others.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Some minor objections were made, which I will now briefly notice ; though my opinion on the point just mentioned renders it unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">It is objected that the decree is erroneous in decreeing the -heirs and widow of <em>Roberts </em>to account for the profits of the land in the lifetime of the husband and ancestor. When it is recollected that his widow stood also in the relation of an executrix to him, I should incline to understand this decree distributively, and that each of the appellants are decreed <em>pro ut </em>their several and respective characters.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Again, it is objected that the decree is erroneous in directing commissioners, instead of a jury, to state an account of. the profits of the land, and report it to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">It is true, that in the case of <em>Eustace </em>v. Gaskins, 1 <em>Wash. 188. </em>it is said that the profits, of the land, being in the nature of damages, should have been ascertained by a jury, and not by commissioners. But in <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Baylor, (ibid. </em>162.) a decree of the court of chancery, affirming one of the county court of <em>Berkeley, </em>was affirmed by this court, although it was objected by counsel, and admitted to be' the fact in the report of the case, that damage and injury done to the land while in the possession of the plaintiff was valued by commissioners instead of a jury. This is a much stronger case, against the solidity of the objection \u00f1ow taken, than either the case of <em>Eustace </em>v. <em>Gaskins, </em>or the case now before us: and, upon the whole, I am inclined to think that, if the general practice and usage of, the court does not in general go. the length of the principle decided in <em>Kennedy </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>v. Baylor, (and, I think, ought not,) yet that that usage and practice is in conflict with the principle decided in <em>Eustace </em>v. <em>Gaskins : </em>such practice, too, is attended with great convenience and utility. I can see no difference, \u00ae . as to this point, between the profits or land, and o\u00ed negroes ; and the profits of the latter are always estimated, and reported upon, by commissioners, and not by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">As to what is said respecting the proceeding against such of these defendants as are infants, without appointing them a guardian; I concur that it was irregular. Had their interests been attended to in this particular, the whole testimony and merits of the case might have been varied in their favour.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">On these grounds, I am of opinion that the decree should be reversed, and the bill dismissed; but without prejudice to any other suit which the appellee may be advised to institute to perfect his title ; as his case is probably' a hard one, and probably the consideration he paid has enured to the benefit of <em>George William Fairfax\u2019s </em>representatives.</p>\n<author id=\"b159-11\">Judge Fleming.</author>\n<p id=\"AM7o\">In giving my opinion in this case, I must premise that, with respect to the patent of <em>George W. Fairfax </em>bearing an impossible date, to wit, the 33d year of the reign of <em>Geo. </em>II. <em>anno domini 1747, </em>I think it immaterial, as the date with respect to the day of month and year of the <em>Christian ara </em>is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">A number of authorities have been cited to show that, although equity will not supply the non-execution of a power, yet it will supply any defect in the execution of a power, provided the same be for a good or valuable consideration. In the case before us, the trust or power was imperfectly executed; the conveyance of the land in question having been executed by one trustee only, instead of three; but it being for a valuable consideration, <em>\u25a0x </em>court of equity may, I conceive, with propriety, supply the defect; so far, at least, as respects the appellants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>wh0 (we all agree) have no right to the land in contro* versy. The title, then, must either be in the appellee <em>Stanton, </em>or in the residuary legatees of <em>George W. Fair-fax \u2019 </em>ancb by making them parties to the suit, neither injustice nor inconvenience can, in my apprehension, arise to any person or persons interested in the decision of the cause.'</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u00d3n th\u00e9se grounds, a majority \u00f3f the court have agreed that the fallowing decree shall be entered :</p>\n<p id=\"Axe\">' \u201c The court, is! df opinion that the said decrees are erroneous, in this, that it appears, by the bill for the rehearing of the cause, that some of the defendants, representatives of the said <em>Joseph Roberts, </em>deceased, were infants, and against whom the said decree, of the twenty-seventh day of September, 1804, Was final \u00e1s to the merits, and no guardian <em>ad litem </em>had been appointed to defend them: therefore, it is decreed afid, ordered, that the same be reversed and annulled, and that the appellee pay to the appellants their costs by them expended in the prosecution of their appeal aforesaid here. And it is .ordered that the cause be remanded to the said court of chancery, that a guardian <em>ad litem </em>may be assigned to such of the defendants as may now appear to be infants; and that the residuary legatee, or legatees, under the will of the said <em>George W.
