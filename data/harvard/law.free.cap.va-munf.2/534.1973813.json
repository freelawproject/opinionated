He therefore demanded the same, (amounting, with nineteen years\u2019 interest, to 54/. 12s.) and threatened to institute an action of ejectment for the land, if payment were refused. Upon this, the complainant gave the said <em>Robert Price </em>a written notice, that, unless <em>he </em>would pay the money so demanded by Williamson, the complainant would be obliged to pay it, and to claim a discount for it; whereupon, <em>Robert Price </em>having refused, or neglected, to make the payment, or to settle foe business in any other way, the complainant paid to <em>Williamson </em>the 54/.- 12s. and took a special receipt, stating the circumstances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-17\">A suit at taw was afterwards brought by <em>William </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Price, administrator of <em>Charles </em>Price, upon the complainant\u2019s note for 40/.; and judgment obtained; to enjoin which, and to recover the difference between that sum and the 54/. 12s. w,ere the chief objects of the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-4\">The ground relied upon, for relief <em>in equity </em>against the judgment was, that the complainant was unable to set off, at common law, against his note, the sum he had paid as aforesaid; to reimbursement of which he was justly entitled, either from the estate of <em>Charles </em>Price, or from <em>Robert </em>Price, for whom the said <em>Charles </em>was agent; the mill-seat having been sold to the complainant without notice of the encumbrance, and he having been compelled to pay this money to avoid an ejectment, which must: have been successful against him, since he had nothing to show to maintain a title; the records of <em>Henrico </em>court being destroyed by the <em>British </em>troops in the late war.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-5\">The defendants were severally called upon to answer and say, \u201c whether the said Robert, or <em>Charles </em>Price, ever paid to the said <em>Williamson </em>the damages assessed by the jury on <em>Robert Price\u2019s, </em>petitioning <em>Henrico </em>court, for an acre of <em>S. Williamson\u2019s </em>land ? The defendant <em>Williamson </em>was particularly required to say whether he did not <em>compel </em>the complainant to pay the 54/. 12s. as aforesaid?\u201d A decree was also prayed against <em>hims </em>that, \u201c if he had received more than he ought, he should be directed to refund the money with interest.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-6\"><em>William Price, </em>in his answer, averred that he always understood, and verily believed, that <em>Robert Price </em>had paid <em>(without taking a </em>receipt) the whole of the damages assessed to <em>Thomas Williamson ; (saying nothing of damages allowed to Samuel Williamson </em>/) that <em>Charles Price </em>was applied to <em>by the complainant </em>to purchase the mill-seat ; that the complainant was well acquainted with th\u00e9 circumstance that a part of the land had been condemned by a jury, and insisted that the difficulties relative, thereto should be removed before he would make the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>purchase; \u201c whereupon the said <em>Charles Price </em>applied <em>tit </em>the said <em>Thomas, Williamson, </em>in whose favour the damages had been assessed as aforesaid, <em>paid him the amount thereof, </em>and took a receipt for the same; as the respondent thinks he shall be able to <em>provebut of this no proof tvas adduced. </em>The respondent contended that the payment by the complainant to <em>Samuel Williamson </em>was in his own wrong, and ought not to operate to the prejudice of <em>Robert Price, </em>or of the estate of <em>Charles Price.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AmKN\">The answer of <em>Robert Price said nothing about damages assessed to Thomas Williamson, </em>but alleged that \u201c when this respondent obtained an order of court for building said mill, the said <em>Samuel Williamson </em>promised to remit to him whatever damages the jury might assess, for the injury by him sustained by the erection of the said mill: but this defendant, not satisfied with his said promise, tendered him the whole amount of the said damages., which this defendant does not believe exceeded three pounds; but the said <em>Samuel Williamson </em>being, or pretending to be, mindful of his said promise, <em>refused the money when tendered by this defendant. </em>And, further, this defendant conceives that, as the said <em>Charles Pric.e </em>was only authorized to sell the said mill, <em>as she stood, without any clause of warranty to bind this defendant, </em>and as the complainant may have paid the said sum of 54/. 12s. improperly and in his own wrong, this defendant should not be thereby aggrieved.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b556-7\">\n<em>Samuel Williamson</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALT\">having departed this life, without answering the bill, a bill of revivor was filed against <em>Dabney Williamson, </em>his executor, who appeared and pleaded to the court\u2019s jurisdiction, on the ground that if the plaintiff had any right against his testator on the subject matter of the said bill, he had his remedy in the most ample manner at common law.\u201d He, also, <em>answering, </em>said, \u201c that his testator was justly entitled to the money received by him from the complainant, for the damages in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>\u00edhe bill mentioned, which had not been paid or discharged to his testator, in any shape, before the complainant paid them, as far as this defendant knows, has heard, or believes \u00bb that, on the contrary, his testator, until payment aforesaid, always asserted his right thereto ; and the payment of those damages was in consideration of his testator\u2019s relinquishing his right (which was unquestionable) to the ground which the pond of the mill then covered.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-3\"><em>No </em>depositions were taken on either side. The deed from <em>Robert </em>Price, to the complainant, for the mill-seat in question, (which deed was among the exhibits,) <em>contained a clause of general 'warranty,,</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-4\">The late chancellor, Wytiie, on the 18th of May, 1801, overruled the plea to the jurisdiction, and directed \u201c a jury to be empannelled and charged, before the oou\u2019.ty court of <em>Men: ico, </em>to inquire what damages the said court, upon hearing the petition of the defendant <em>Robert </em>Price, for leave to build the mill in the bill mentioned, did adjudge that the said defendant should pay to owners of lands which would be overflowed? and <em>who were those owners P </em>(which inquiry, by <em>loss of the record </em>of proceeding upon the said petition, (as is suggested,) hath become necessary;) and <em>whether that defendant paid those damages P </em>and that the verdict of the jury be certified,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-5\">No step appears to have been taken to carry this order into effect. And on the 8th of September, 1808, the present chancellor set it aside, and dismissed the bill, as to all the defendants, with costs; from which decree the plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The following was pronounced as the opinion of thin i-.ourt.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>&lt;s The court is of opinion that, under the'actual circumstances of this case, and especially, the great lapse of time which has occurred since the assessment of the damages under which the claim of <em>Samuel Williamson to </em>the sum in controversy is founded, and the acquiescence of the said <em>Samuel Williamson </em>(who probably resided in the neighbourhood) in the' building the mill, (for which these damages were given,) without claim or objection on his part, the damages aforesaid ought to he presumed to have been paid; and that, therefore, the bill of the appellant as to the appellees, <em>William Price </em>and <em>Robert </em>Pxice, was properly dismissed by the decree now in question j but, inasmuch as the payment of the sum of fifty-four pounds twelve shillings, by the appellant to the said Williamson, was coerced by representations, on the part of the latter, which made it proper for the former to come into a court of equity to have the questions resulting from the claim aforesaid adjusted, if not, to pay the said sum to the said <em>Williamson </em>in the first instance, and, (as the matter now appears,) the said sum being so paid to him without consideration; the court is of opinion that the said bill ought to have been sustained as to the appellee <em>Dabney Williamson, </em>and he decreed to repay the sum aforesaid, with interest and costs, to the appellant. Therefore, it is decreed and ordered that the said decree, so far as it dismisses the bill as to the last-mentioned appellee, be reversed and annulled ; that the residue thereof be <em>affirmed; </em>and that the appellee <em>Dabney Williamson, </em>out of the estate of his testator in his hands to be administered, if so much thereof he hath, but, if not, then out of his own estate, pay to the appellant his costs by him expended in the prosecution of his appeal afore-' said here. And this court, proceeding, &amp;c. it is further decreed aqd ordered, that the appellee <em>Dabney Williamson, </em>out of the estate of his testator in his hands to be administered, if sp much thereofhe hath, pay to the ap\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>pellant the said sum of 54/. 125. with interest thereon, to be computed, after the rate of five <em>per centum, per </em>from the 19th day of August, 1795, till paid, and his costs by him expended in prosecuting his suit in the said court of chancery <em>\u00a1 </em>but, if not, then the costs aforesaid to be levied of his proper goods and chattels.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
