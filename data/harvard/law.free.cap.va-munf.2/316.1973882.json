Littlepage, founded upon an account against the testator. At the trial upon the general issue, the plaintiff adduced evidence to prove sundry items bearing date prior to the year 1^85. In that year, the testator made his will, and it was proved by witnesses that he acknowledged a power r <em>J </em>01 . of attorney at the same time, authorizing the plaintiff to sell his reversionary interest in sundry slaves, which his mother held for life; and, out of the proceeds of such sa*e\u2019t0 Pay kimself the amount of an unsettled <em>account; </em>The mother was living at without mentioning the sum ~ \u2022\u2022 the time of the trial. After those items of <em>debit </em>had accrued, the testator went to Europe, and did not return until 1801. He died in 1802, and this suit was brought in the following year; no suit having been before instituted. The defendant moved the court to instruct the jury to disregard all the testimony offered by the plaintiff, in support of such items of the said account as were due five years before the testator\u2019s death, and to consider such items as expunged, according to the 56th section of the act concerning executors, &amp;c.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> but the court instructed the jury that that act was inapplicable to this case: to which opinion the defendant excepted, \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Abtl\">The plaintiff moreover offered m evidence the deposi- . , tion of <em>Francis </em>Irvine, stating, among other things, that, in a.conversation with Mr. <em>Haywood, </em>the owner, and. Captain <em>Meridith, </em>the master of the ship in which the testator went to <em>Europe, </em>they both said that the plaintiff had paid the said <em>Lewis's </em>passage. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Inoved for an instruction that this part of the deposition was inadmissible testimony; but the court refused to give such instruction, \u201c the captain being dead whereupon a second bill of exception was filed. A verdict was found, and judgment rendered, for the plaintiff; from, which the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-6\"><em>Bolts </em>and <em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-7\"><em>Williams </em>and <em>Wirt, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-8\"><em>For the appellant </em>it was insisted,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVX\">1. That the district court erred in the opinion that the 56th section of the law concerning executors was inapplicable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-9\"><em>2. </em>That even the act of limitations would have been a fear; for, having begun to run, it could not stop upon the embarkation of <em>Lewis Littlepage </em>for <em>Europe. </em>The absence of a defendant is not within the saving of the. statute, where he goes away openly, and with the knowledge of the plaintiff, but only where he absconds or conceals himself, or, by removal out of the country, &amp;c. when the cause of action accrued, defeats or obstructs the plaintiff from bringing his action.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> A debt<em>o</em>r\u2019s going away publicly, after giving notice to his creditor, does not obstruct his suing him, but gives full opportunity and warning to stop him by a writ.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-14\">The power of attorney from <em>Le-wis Littlepage </em>to the plaintiff could not operate upon the cause. I\u00cd it was a reacknowledgment of the debt, it ought to have been declared upon, if under <em>seal; </em>and if not, the act of limitations runs against it. Neither is its existence legally proved, since it is not produced ; and there is no proof of its loss, nor that it ever was delivered. But if it were properly authenticated, it would afford a presumption that the debt has been paid; as the plaintiff, by virtue of the power, had sufficient funds in his hands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-15\">8. There was error in the instruction respecting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>payment of the passage-money. The court admitted hearsay evidence of what the captain of the vessel had said; and this on the ground that the captain was dead. But the witness said he heard the owner say the same thing, and he was alive. Hearsay evidence is admissible only as to questions of boundary, pedigree, and the like, but not as to substantive facts which may be proved by the oath of the person whose words are relied upon. Even a receipt of a third person to one of the parties to a suit, is not as satisfactory as the testimony of the person who signed it; because he may, in fact, have received no money. But a receipt is better evidence than a mere hearsay declaration; and that, at least, ought to have been produced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8u\"><em>On the other </em>side, the case of <em>Brooke's Administrators </em>v. Shelly, 4 <em>H. &amp; M. </em>266. was relied upon to show that, imperative as the language of the 56th section of the law concerning executors is, there may be exceptions to it, so as to let in the circumstances of the case, and prevent the court from expunging. The circumstances here are that, when <em>Lewis Littlepage </em>was on the wing for <em>Europe </em>he executed a power of attorney, acknowledging the debt to the plaintiff. This was equivalent to a new assumpsit, and took away all the preceding years. It looked also, prospectively, to the whole time during which the plaintiff was to be his agent, that is, until the death of his mother; and, therefore, prevented the act of limitations from running during all that time. The court ought not to look merely at the letter of the expunging act, but at its intention and spirit. These apply to cases only where the plaintiff had it in his power to sue; but here, the agreement certainly was, that <em>Lewis Littlepage </em>was to be permitted to leave the country without molestation. The power of attorney was executed at the moment of his departure, to take effect afterwards, and while he was gone, the suit could not have, been brought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>As to the point that the power should have been produced ; the exception was not taken on that ground. For any thing that appears, the instrument itself may have been before the court and jury; for it is not said, in the bill of exceptions, that <em>all </em>the evidence is inserted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-4\">2. The testimony relative to the declarations of the captain and owner was properly admitted, as part of the chain of proof, though not sufficient, in itself, if standing alone. The captain being dead, his receipt would have been good to prove payment of the passage-money, and his confession is equivalent to his receipt.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-5\">\n<em>Argument in reply.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4CG\">According to the argument on the other side, the act of limitations is to be moulded according to the court\u2019s ideas of equity! Such latitude of construction is not admissible. It has repeatedly been decided in <em>England </em>that the courts cannot make exceptions to the act; and that, if the saving in favour of infants, <em>femes </em>coverts, &amp;c. had not been inserted, the courts could not have supplied it. There never was a stronger case for applying the act than this. When <em>Lewis </em>Lit<em>tlepage </em>was going to <em>Europe, </em>why did not <em>John Carter Littlepage </em>(his brother) get his obligation for the money ? No demand is made after his return. There is every presumption, therefore, that this business was settled. A bond was given, perhaps, and afterwards taken in and destroyed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-6\">The decision in <em>Brooke's Administrators </em>v. <em>Shelly, </em>only shows that where a new <em>assumpsit, </em>sufficient of itself to bear an action, is proved, the account is out of the question. But the new <em>assumpsit </em>must be complete, and sufficient to bear an action. Here, the power of attorney acknowledged only an <em>unliquidated balance, </em>and moreover does not appear to have been delivered. If it was, it ought to have been produced ; for corroborative testimony is not proper until the principal voucher is exhibited- Its non-production is plain proof that it never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>was delivered. The inference is, that it was only an inchoate act, and that the debt was settled in some other way.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-8\">The district court erred in another respect. It took upon itself to determine the weight of evidence, and decided on factsj without leaving it to the jury to judge of the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Keel &amp; Roberts </em>v. Herbert, 1 <em>Wash. </em>203. is exactly the case at bar.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-9\">\n<em>Wirt.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APt\">That case is not applicable to this. The act requiring the court to expunge the items, necessarily confers on the court the power of judging of fact as well as law, for the purpose of determining whether each particular case comes within its scope j and, <em>to form this </em>judgment, they must weigh the evidente.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b340-10\"><em>April </em>6th.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AbS\">The president pronounced the following opinion of the court:</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"A_s\"> <em>Rev.
