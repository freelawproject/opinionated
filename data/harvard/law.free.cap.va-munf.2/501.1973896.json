The will contained a devise to the defendant of the plantation the testator lived on with six negr'oes, (by name,) being different from those now in question, two feather b.eds and furniture, two horses, twelve head of cattle, twelve head of sheep, and fifteen head of hogs, also the use of his tables and kitchen furniture, d tiring her life, and at her death to be equally divided among his daughters. All the residue of his estate, real and! personal, (in general terms,) was directed to be equally divided between his two sons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-11\">The county court gave judgment, for the plaintiff, for the slaves in the declaration mentioned, if to be had ; if not, for their respective values, found by the jury. Upon an appeal, that judgment was reversed by the district court; whereupon the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b522-12\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXEV\">Before the revolution, it was argued by some gentlemen, from a supposed similitude .between slaves and chattels <em>real, </em>that if the husband did not, during the coverture, <em>sell </em>his wife\u2019s dower slaves, they survived to her. But <em>now </em>slaves are <em>personal </em>estate; and all the wife\u2019s interest in them belongs to the husband and his representatives. Besides, in <em>this </em>case, the widow has a provision under the will, and therefore cannot claim against it.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b522-13\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgG\">The uniform practice before the revolution was for the widow to hold her dower slaves for <em>life, </em>notwithstanding her second marriage. The act of 1727, c. 4. s. 4.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> applied only to slaves <em>conveyed, given, bequeathed., </em>or <em>'descended </em>to a <em>feme covert; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>but not to <em>dower slaves, </em>in which the widow holds an \u00e9state of a peculiar character, vesting by <em>act of law only. </em>The words of the last section of that act expressly gave her an estate for <em>life </em>in such slaves; They were not vested in her, in her own right, but only in a qualified manner, for the support and maintenance of children, in case the other estate of the decedent should be insufficient for that purpose; and she was not permitted to carry them out of the colony.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhJ\">Neither is the law altered in that respect. The act of 1792, c. 103. s. 44, 45.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> prohibits the widow, and, in like manner, her second husband, from carrying her dower slaves out of the slate. This circumstance is conclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-6\">Mr. <em>Call's </em>second point does not occur in the case.. There is no evidence that <em>James Callicott, </em>the second husband, ever claimed the slaves now in question. They are not <em>\u2018mentioned </em>in the will. She does not claim dower out of <em>his </em>estate, but only endeavours to retain her dower ' of the estate of her first husband. There is, therefore, no repugnancy between her doing this and her holding under the will.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b523-8\">\n<em>Call.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abd\">Mr. <em>Wickham's </em>argument is a perfect <em>felo de </em>se; because it proves too much. The full effect of the word <em>\u201cconvey\" </em>takes in <em>every </em>species of acquisition. Was it ever doubted, if the husband <em>sold </em>his wife\u2019s dower slaves, that the purchaser had a good right ? Mr. <em>Wickham's </em>argument amounts to this j that the husband has <em>no </em>right to such slaves. If so, he has no right to sell them 5 neither can his creditors take them by execution ; which is done every day. Can there be any reason for the wife\u2019s losing to the husband an <em>absolute </em>estate in personals, and yet not an estate <em>for life? Chases in action </em>do, indeed, according to <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Taliaferro, </em>2 <em>Call, </em>447, survive to the wife. But the evident intention of the law is to give t\u00a9 the husband all her personal property <em>in fsssessim\u00bb </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>It does not follow, from the prohibition to carry the slaves out of the state, that the wife shall have them at his death. That provision is only for the benefit of those in remainder. The husband has either his wife\u2019s rights or none at all; and if he has <em>her </em>right, it must be an estate <em>for her life.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b524-13\">\n<em>Wickham.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ag5C\">I do consider dower in slaves as a very <em>anomalous </em>property; slaves, in some respects, resembling <em>real, </em>and, in others, <em>personal </em>estate. <em>Dower slaves </em>are of the nature of <em>real </em>estate. The husband is entitled to their profits <em>during the coverture. </em>They may be sold, under execution, for the <em>joint lives </em>of the wife and husband; but not for a longer time. Her dower is a continuation of her first husband\u2019s estate. Of what use would her dower <em>lands </em>(which, it is admitted, survive to her on her second husband\u2019s death) be, without slaves to work them ? If the legislature had considered the slaves as belonging to the husband for the <em>wife's </em>life, it would have made the forfeiture imposed upon him for carrying them out of the state coextensive with <em>her life f </em>but it is extended only to <em>his death. </em>This shows plainly the sense of the legislature. The wife has not the <em>property </em>in the slaves, but only the <em>use </em>for her life.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b524-14\">\n<em>Call'.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aby\">Since the act declaring slaves to be <em>personal estate,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>they are not, properly speaking, held as <em>dower. </em>The legislature has cautiously avoided using that word; instead of which its language is, that the wife shall have \u201c the use, for her life, of such slaves as shall be in her share.\u201d This does not prevent her disposing of such use to her second husband ; which she does <em>hy the marriage.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b524-15\">The words of the law, imposing the forfeiture on the husband for carrying the slaves out of the state,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> are, not merely that he \u201c shall forfeit <em>them </em>for his life,\u201d but \u201c all the estate which he holds in right of his wife\u2019s dower for and during the life of the said husband.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b525-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>No conclusion, therefore, in favour of the point contended for by Mr. <em>Wickham, </em>can be drawn from this clause.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b525-6\"><em>Monday, February </em>3d, 1812,</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b522-7\"> <em>Ambler and Wife </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>4 H. &amp; <em>M. </em>23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b522-8\"> <em>Virginia Laws, </em>(edit. <em>of </em>1769,) p. 81.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AsJ\"> 1 Rev.
