The respondents further answering jointly, objected against the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the length of time which had elapsed before it was exhibited. They relied also upon the decree in the suit <em>Hite and others </em>against <em>Fairfaxs </em>contending that, since that decree had been duly served upon the tenant in possession, <em>(Giles </em>Cook, tenant to <em>George Wo </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Fairfax,) who stated his; claim which, upon a hearing\u2019, was dismissed, the plaintiff ought not now to be at liberty to proceed against the respondents j all persons, who did not state their claim within a reasonable time, being bound by the decree.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AFG_\">To this answer the plaintiiF replied generally; sundry depositions and exhibits were filed, by which the plaintiff\u2019s title to the land claimed by the bill was established, and it was proved that she had always resided in the state of <em>Pennsylvania. </em>There was no evidence, however, on either side, as to possession of the land by the defendants. The cause came on to be heard, the 12th of September, 1797, when the court of chancery was of opinion that the plaintiff\u2019s remedy to assert her title was not precluded by the decree in the case of <em>Hite and others </em>against <em>Fairfax; </em>because that decree was not served upon her; nor by the length of time; because the plaintiff, when her title accrued, was, and ever since had been, not resident within the limits of this commonwealth. The court, therefore, decreed, .that the defendants do convey to the plaintiff, at her costs, the two hundred acres of land part of thirteen hundred acres, on <em>Elk </em>Branch, sold by <em>foist Hite </em>to <em>Thomas </em>Hart, and surveyed for the said <em>Thomas </em>Hart, which two hundred acres of land were sold by the said <em>Thomas Hart </em>to <em>John </em>Miles, father of the plaintiff; that the defendants resign to the plaintiff possession of the said two hundred acres of land, to be ascertained by a survey, and pay unto the plaintiff the profits of the same from the 4th of <em>Fe</em>bruary, 1791, when the subpeena in this cause was sued forth. Upon an appeal to the court of appeals this decree was affirmed; after which, the orders of survey and account of profits were carried into effect, and reports made thereupon to the superior court of chancery for the <em>Staunton </em>district. The commissioners who took the account were of opinion, that the rents and profits rrere worth 189 dollars annually, since the year 1791 s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>but, \u201c at the request of the defendants\u2019 counsel, they stated that thev had understood from hearsay, or com\u00bb mon rep0rt? that <em>Giles </em>Cook, sen. held the said land, by ^ease from <em>George W- </em>Fairfax, a number of years prior to the year 1791, and continued in possession until the year 1799, and then sold his lease to <em>folin </em>Dixon, Esq. who held it until the year 1801, when General <em>William Darke </em>got possession of it under purchase from <em>Margaret Paul </em>the plaintiff. They farther stated, upon the knowledge and information of <em>Abraham </em>Shephard, one of their body, that neither the defendants, nor any one claiming under the defendants, ever had possession of said land.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A_A\">The suit abated, as to the defendant <em>Isaac Hite </em>and the plaintiff, by their deaths, and was revived, on the motion of <em>Thomas Paul </em>and <em>Margaret </em>Paul, heirs of the plaintiff, against <em>Isaac </em>Hite, executor of that defendant, and against the other defendants by consent. It after-wards abated as to the defendant <em>Andrew MiCoy </em>by his death, and a <em>scire facias </em>against his executors and heirs was awarded, but does not appear to have been executed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ah7D\">On the 8th day of April, 1805, the cause came on to be heard as to the other defendants, on the bill, answer, exhibits, depositions, report of the commissioners and exceptions thereto, filed by the counsel for the defendants, on two grounds;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-9\">1. \u201c Because the rents and profits were valued too high(in support of which exception, however, no testimony was exhibited ;) and, 2d. \u201c Because the report Was uncertain, in not clearly expressing whether the year 1791 was to be included or excluded in the aggregate estimate, and it did not appear when <em>Pauls </em>right ceased, so as to ascertain when the profits were to cease.\u201d The court of chancery overruled the exceptions ; and, \u201c Being of opinion that the defendants were severally, as well as jointly liable to the plaintiffs for the rents and profits of the lands decreed to be conveyed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>by the order of <em>September </em>12,1797, adjudged, ordered and decreed that the defendant do pay to the complainants the sum of 1,872 dollars; that being, according to the valuation of the commissioners, the amount of the rents and profits of the land from the 4th of February, 1791, to the 1st of January, 1801, about which time, as appears, the possession of the said land was yielded to a purchaser under the plaintiff\u2019s ancestor: but the court suspended the pronouncing of any final decree as to the conveyance of the land until the cause should be re&gt;vived against the representatives of <em>Andrew </em>3FCoy.\u201d</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b179-3\">From this decree the defendants appealed.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b179-4\"><em>Williams, for </em>the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARh\">among other points, made the following:</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-5\">1. That the chancellor should not have proceeded to a hearing until all the parties who represent the rights of <em>Joist </em>Hite, <em>Robert </em>MiCoy, <em>William Duff </em>and <em>Robert </em>Green, (the original plaintiffs against Fairfax, &amp;c.) Were before the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-6\">2. That a decree for rents and profits ought not to have been entered against <em>Isaac Hite </em>alone, but the other defendants also.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-7\">3. That he should not have been compelled to pay the rents out of his own estate, but <em>de bonis </em>testutoris.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-8\">4. That, as <em>Isaac Hite </em>and others never were in pos session of the lands in controversy, no rents and profits ought to have been decreed against them, or any of them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b179-9\">\n<em>Hay,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-k\">on the other side, relied on the decree of the court of appeals affirming that of the chancellor dated. <em>September </em>12th, 1797, as precluding the 1st and 4lh objections now taken. There were 15 or 20 defendants originally; only three of whom answered. No notice was taken of the rest. Yet this court affirmed the decree, and thereby declared that all proper parties were before the court. In like manner the defendants must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>have been considered as having been in possession of the land ; otherwise, the decree making them liable for ,'thc profits would have been reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-3\">As to the 2d point, the very principle, according to which the chancellor has decided, was assumed in the case of <em>Yancey </em>v. Hopkins, 1 <em>Munf. </em>425. and sanctioned by this court; no discrimination being made between the defendants <em>Hopkins </em>and Faris, but both considered responsible for all the profits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-4\">The only question in the cause is, whether the decree, against <em>Isaac Hite, </em>the executor, (being general, that he should pay so much money,) is to be satisfied out of his own goods, or out of the goods of his testator. In one breath, the suit was revived against him as executor, and it was decreed that he should pay. The decree, then, must be understood to be against him as executor, and payable out of the assets in his hands. This is a mere formal error, and not sufficient to <em>set </em>aside a decision substantially right.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b180-5\">Williams, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQSi\">I do not understand any of my objections to be precluded by the opinion of this court. The decree of September, 1797, declared the plaintiff\u2019s right to two hundred acres of land, but did not say where situated. This court, then, never passed upon the location of the 200 <em>acres; </em>but considered that as proper to be ascertained by survey. Upon the survey\u2019s coming in, and not until then, could this court know that the boundaries claimed by the plaintiff might interfere with the rights of persons not before the court; which lias turned out to be the case. The same observation applies to the question concerning the rents and profits. That subject was not before this court. It did not appear that the land which should be laid off to <em>Margaret Paul </em>might not be in the possession of these defendants. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>report of the commissioners has since shown that they never were in possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-4\">The case of <em>Yancey </em>v. <em>Hopkins </em>is an authority directly against Mr. <em>Hay. </em>In that case <em>Paris </em>was the tenant in possession, and was decreed to pay the profits, together with Yancey, with whom he was <em>particeps criminis. </em>But here <em>Isaac HHe </em>(who never was in possession) is alone decreed against, exempting all the other defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-5\">To determine the 3d point, the record alone must be consulted; and it does not appear that <em>Isaac Hite </em>had received a cent of assets. He was brought before the court, merely by a <em>scire </em>facias, to show cause why the suit should not be revived against him as executor ; not by a subpoena to answer the bill. He might think the chancellor would not decree against him, when it appeared that his testator had never been in possession of the land. He, therefore, made no defence.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b181-6\">Monday, <em>April </em>29th.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Ai7\">Judge Roane</author>\n<p id=\"AND\">pronounced the following opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\"><em>a </em>The court is of opinion, that the said decree is erroneous in this, that the court below, being of opinion that the defendants are severally, as well as jointly, liable to the plaintiffs for the rents and profit? of the land ordered to be conveyed by the decree of the 12th of <em>Sep</em>tember, 1797, ordered that the defendant <em>Isaac </em>Hite, executor of <em>Isaac </em>Hite, who was executor of <em>Joist </em>Hite, deceased, do pay to the complainants the sum of 1,872 dollars, the amount of the rents and profits of the said land from the 4th day of February, 1791, until the 1st day of January, 1801; whereas, by the said decree of the 12th of September, 1797, which was affirmed on an appeal to this court, the defendants are, jointly, and not jointly and severally, ordered to pay to the plaintiff the said rents and profits. The decree is also erroneous 5\u00abi ordering the said rents and profits to be paid by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>said <em>Isaac Hits, </em>instead of ordering them to be paid by the said defendant <em>de bonis </em>testatoris.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Decree reversed with costs, and suit remanded to the court of chancery, \u201c for proper parties to be made, and for further proceedings to be had therein agreeable to the principles of this decree.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
