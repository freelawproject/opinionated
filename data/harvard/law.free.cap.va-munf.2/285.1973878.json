So much, therefore, only need be reported as comes within the decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-19\">The suit was brought in the county court of Pittsylva<em>nia, </em>by <em>Johnson </em>and others, legatees of <em>Jeremiah White, </em>against <em>William Clarke </em>and <em>William White, </em>his executors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>for a settlement of their administration account, and to recover a balance alleged to be due to the plaintiffs. The county court referred the account to commissioners, wh\u00b0 made a report, in which, after charging no interest, either for or against <em>William</em>Clarke, the acting executor, they stated a balance to be due him of seventeen shillings and seven pence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-6\">Whether notice was given to the plaintiffs did not appear ; but the cause was regularly set for hearing, and no exception to the report appeared in the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-7\">The county court dismissed the bill with costs. Upon an appeal to the superior court of chancery for the <em>Richmond </em>district, the present chancellor, <em>by an order </em>in vacation, directed Master Commissioner <em>Greenhow </em>to state the account anew, upon the exhibits contained in the record ; which being accordingly done, and interest charged upon each item of debit and credit, from the date of such item,,a balance appeared due, from the executor, of 116/. <em>3s. 8d.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b306-8\">Exceptions were filed to this report, but overruled by the chancellor, who reversed the decree of the county court, and decreed to the plaintiffs the last-mentioned sum with costs.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> The defendants thereupon appealed,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b306-9\">Wickham, for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aaz\">contended that the county court decree was correct, since no exception was taken to the report of the commissioners 5 the rule being, that whenever a report is not necessarily wrong upon its face, an exception must be taken. In support of this position, he relied upon the cases of <em>Brewer </em>v. Hastie, 3 <em>Call, </em>22. and <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Saunders and </em>Wade, 2 <em>Hen. Munf. </em>420.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-10\">The refusal to allow interest might have been proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>upon the circumstances of the case, which, it is to be presumed, appeared in evidence to the commissioners.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b307-6\">Munford, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALR\">The not allowing interest was an error upon the face of the report; for, generally, interest ought to be charged both for and against the executor j according to <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>2 <em>Call, </em>106. and <em>Granberry\u2019s Ex\u2019r </em>v. Granberrys, 1 <em>Wash. </em>246. If any special circumstances existed to vary this rule, they should have been stated, and cannot be presumed: for, in suits in chancery, the whole evidence being always spread upon the record, the court can presume nothing that is not proved: neither can the appellate court presume any thing in favour of the decree; in which respect it is not like a general verdict.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> v <em>'</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-8\">Another error appears on the face of the report. Notice of the meeting of the commissioners should have -been given to the <em>plaintiffs,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and this ought to have been 111 \u2022 . ... _ , - stated by the commissioners in their report. It is always the practice of the superior courts of chancery (to which the county courts are bound to conform) for the commissioners to set forth in their reports the notice, and proof of its service. The commissioners in the county court not having done so, their report was radically defective, and no decree should have been made upon it, though no written exception was fded.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b307-12\"><em>Wickham, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APY\">The objection for want of notice should have been made in the county court. Can there be a different rule as to reports of commissioners from that which prevails with respect to depositions ? If the exception to a deposition, for want of notice, be not taken before the hearing, it may be read.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>It is not necessary, neither is it the practice,<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> for the commissioners to set forth the notice in their reports.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ace\">The vouchers before the commissioners are never pare _ \u2018 of the record. Is not a document proving the propriety of an exemption from interest as much a voucher as any other ? I admit the <em>onus probandi </em>lay upon <em>us ; </em>but the duty was to be performed before the commissioners\u00bb Th\u00e9 sole place to produce evidence of circumstances was there.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b308-10\">Wednesday, <em>June 12th.</em></decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ANni\">The following opinion of the court was delivered by Judge Roane :</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b306-11\"> Note.
