Martin, </em>executors of <em>Jesse Carter, </em>deceased, against <em>John </em>Childers, upon a bond which a certain <em>Reuben Gar-nett, </em>as agent for Carter, in his lifetime, took of <em>Childers </em>for the twice of a negro sold him: he filed a bill of in-1 \u00b0 junction in the late high court of chancery, on the ground ' . . \u00b0 . / that the transaction was usurious; making the executors of <em>Carter </em>and <em>Reuben Garnett </em>both defendants in equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A0JF\">The defendant Garnett, in his answer, after denying the charge of usury, said, that \u201c he had no farther purchased the debt than that he <em>lent </em>money to the said <em>Carter, </em>and there were <em>other </em>things unsettled between them, and this money, now demanded of the complainant, would be applied, when received, to the credit of the said <em>Carter, </em>pound for pound, after deducting the commission and expenses of collection.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-13\"><em>James </em>Webb, one of <em>Carter\u2019s </em>executors, by his answer, claimed the debt as belonging to the' estate of his testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-14\">The complainant replied generally to both the <em>answers; </em>and, after depositions were taken, the cause was set for hearing, as to the defendant Garnett, upon his motion by counsel; but does not appear to have been set for hearing as to the other defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-15\">Upon the evidence, the late chancellor made the injunction perpetual, to stay execution of so much of the judgment as exceeded the principal sum of money stated in the bill, and decreed that the defendants pay the complainant his costs in this court; from which decree the defendant <em>Garnett </em>was allowed an appeal, in the next vacation after the term when it was rendered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AsC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Williams, for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3c\">contended that the complainant must have considered <em>Garnett </em>interested in the controversy; otherwise he would not have made him a party. He is bound to <em>Cartels </em>representatives, and responsible if they lose the debt. This court, in <em>Armistead </em>v. <em>Marks, </em>1 <em>Wash. </em>325. decided that an appeal by <em>one </em>party brings up the whole record, and the reversal may be as to all.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AFp\">\n<em>Wickham.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AL7\">We made <em>Garnett </em>a defendant to obtain a discovery of. the usury; and though his answer denies it, we had a right to go on to establish it by proof; for we sued for relief as well as discovery.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApzV\">The case of <em>Armistead </em>v. <em>Marks </em>applies only to a <em>joint </em>judgment. Here <em>Webb </em>does not complain of the decree. The decree against him perpetuates the injunction to stay proceedings on his judgment; but that against <em>Gar-nett </em>is for costs only. He therefore had no right to appeal, having no interest in the debt in controversy. In <em>Craddock </em>v. Ellzey,<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> the court would not touch the . case as it respected the other parties, <em>Craddock </em>only having appealed: Judge Roane was inclined to reverse the decree <em>in </em>toto, considering it as an <em>entire </em>decree; but Fleming and Tucker were of a different opinion. It was therefore reversed as to <em>Craddock </em>only.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b298-10\">Friday, <em>May 10th.</em></decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"Aza\"> <em>Chichester's Executrix </em>v. <em>Vass\u2019s Administrator, </em>1 Munf. 98</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b298-7\"><em> May, 1810, </em>not reported.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AvoX\">The president pronounced the opinion of the court, that the appeal be dismissed, having been improvidently granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
