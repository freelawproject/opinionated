D. </em>Johnson, setting forth (though not distinctly, or particularly, as to items) the .proportions in value, or thereabouts, of real and personal estate by them respectively received. From <em>Sarah Johnson\u2019s </em>answer it appeared, that <em>John L. D. Johnson </em>was insolvent, having wasted the property belonging to her, and had left the commonwealth. <em>Nicholas Bourden </em>and <em>Jane </em>his wife, failed to answer, and a decree <em>nisi </em>was entered, but does not appear' to have been served upon them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-9\">From a copy of the will, it appeared that all the real and personal estate was given to the wife for life, (after payment of the testator\u2019s debts,) and afterwards to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>divided equally among the children, except some unimportant specific legacies. The personal property was of itself sufficient to satisfy the claim of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-3\">The chancellor decreed, \u201c that the defendant <em>John L. D. </em>Johnson, and <em>Sarah </em>his wife, pay to <em>James </em>Hopkirk, the surviving plaintiff, 19/. <em>3s. Sd. </em>and one eighth of the costs, unless the said <em>John L. D. </em>Johnson, on or before the tenth day of the term next after he shall have been served with a copy of this decree, show cause to the contrary; that the defendant <em>Richard Dennis </em>pay 28/. 15s. and one eighth of the said costs, unless he, being in like manner served with a copy of this decree, show cause to the contrary; that the defendants, <em>Edward </em>and <em>John Dennis, </em>each pay the like sum of money and proportion of costs ; and that the defendants <em>Owen Haskins </em>and <em>Catharine </em>his wife, <em>Lucy Dennis, Thomas Dennis </em>and <em>Nicholas Bourden, </em>and <em>Jane </em>his wife, each pay 19/. 3s. <em>Sd. </em>and the same proportion of costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-4\">From this decree the plaintiff <em>Hopkirk </em>appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b347-5\">Williams, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AM0\">If the decree stands, the plaintiff must lose the sum for which <em>John L. D. Johnson, </em>the insolvent legatee^ is made responsible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-6\">Our claim is against the whole estate. The decree ought, therefore, to be joint. One legatee\u2019s having dissipated his share is no reason for the creditor\u2019s losing any part of his claim. If the estate had been distributed among them by an executor, he would have taken their joint bond to refund for payment of debts.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> Their dividing the estate among themselves cannot exempt them from this responsibility. Their own act of inter-meddling with the estate should not diminish the credit- or\u2019s security. Even if the general principle were, that, where the legatees are all solvent, the court will hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>them responsible <em>pro rata, </em>it ought to be otherwise in a case like this. The other legatees ought not to have permitted <em>Johnson </em>to go out of the state without giving security for his proportion. The decree should be, in general terms, that they pay the debt; leaving them to settle their proportions among themselves.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b348-10\">\n<em>Williams.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyH\">I do not understand by this that the decree must always be <em>pro rata; </em>but that all the legatees must be parties, in order that, after the recovery against them all collectively, such as pay may have remedy against the rest for contribution.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b348-11\">No counsel for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b348-12\">Monday, <em>September </em>23d.</decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b347-7\"> Note. <em>Quaere, </em>if this doctrine be correct ?

D. Johnson </em>and <em>Sarah </em>his wife, in and by the said decree, and who appear to be insolvent, is not made payable by the other appellees, in due and ratable pro*portions; therefore it is decreed and ordered that the same be reversed and annulled, and that the appellees pay to the appellant his costs by him expended in the prosecution of his appeal aforesaid here: and it is ordered that the cause be remanded to the said court of chancery for further proceedings to be had therein, agreeably to the principles of this decree ; reserving also to the appellant the right to resort to the other appellees for similar contribution for the quota which may be found due by <em>Nicholas Bourden </em>and wife, in the event of their not having received an adequate proportion of the testator\u2019s estate, or being found insolvente\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b348-14\"> Note.
