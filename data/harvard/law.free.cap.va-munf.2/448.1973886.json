John Cockrill </em>and <em>Joseph Rogers, being fully apprized of the mistake, </em>from information given them by the sheriff who served the writ, and from <em>Morrison\u2019s </em>acknowledging, in their presence an&lt;I hearing, that the debt he owed <em>Carter </em>was one hundred became, nevertheless, his appearance bail, and gave their bond (in the usual form) for <em>dollars </em>in- \u201e , <em>. </em>. <em>r </em>t * _ , stead or pounds. On the evening or the same day, the sheriff informed <em>Cockrill </em>that the clerk had issued anpther writ, but that <em>Morrison had gone off, and would not svJFur ^ t0 be served. </em>The plaintiff\u2019s attorney filed his declaration conformably with the bill penal; and <em>no de- % fence being made, </em>judgment was entered against the an(j jjaj2 for two hundred <em>pounds, </em>(the penal sum,) to be discharged by the payment of one hundred pounds, with interest and costs,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>Cockrill </em>and <em>Rogers </em>then applied to the county court, sitting in chancery, for an injunction to stay proceedings on so much of the judgment as exceeded one hundred dollars, with interest thereupon, and the costs at law ; alleging in their bill that they were not informed that the claim was for more than that sum until the judgment had been obtained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-4\">The county court granted the injunction, and, after-wards, made it perpetual; notwithstanding the circumstances above mentioned were averred in the answer, and proved by the affidavit of the sheriff, which was read (by consent of parties) as a deposition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-5\">Upon an appeal to the superior court of chancery, holden at Williamsburg, this decree being affirmed, an appeal was taken to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b469-6\">Wickham, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Adlj\">The appellees are not entitled to relief in equity, having neglected to make defence at law. They might have moved the court to correct the error committed in the clerk\u2019s office ; or they might have been relieved upon an appeal or writ of error; for, the judgment having been entered by default, the <em>capias </em>and the bail bond were part of the record.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Besides, it does not appear that the plaintiff, or his attorney, knew of the error. It is in evidence that the defendant and the bail knew of it. If the objection had been made, the plaintiff might have had the mistake corrected, and the defendant held to other <em>bail; </em>or he might have made the clerk responsible in the first instance. The appellees were guilty of bad faith in not informing the plaintiff or his attorney. At any rate, they were guilty of gross neglect, and ought to have been left to their remedy at law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b469-7\">Wirt, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdfG\">There was no neglect on the part of the bail. They were willing to pay the amount of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>bond, and could not anticipate a judgment against them for more. <em>Morrison </em>was insolvent. The bail looked forward to a certain responsibility, to the extent of thetr bond. They thought it unnecessary, therefore, to make defence, supposing that no more was claimed of them. If there was any fraud, the plaintiff was guilty of it, in stealing a judgment for two hundred <em>pounds, </em>on a writ for two hundred <em>dollars.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b470-5\">Wickham, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuB\">The insolvency of <em>Morrison </em>does not appear in the record; but would make no difference in the case. The plaintiff was guilty of no fraud; for he knew nothing of the mistake; but there is direct evidence that the appellees knew of it before they signed the bond as bail.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b470-6\">Thursday, <em>November 21,</em></decisiondate>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b469-13\"> <em>Shelton </em>v.
