that the said <em>Thomas Taylor </em>applied to the complainant to know how much he would take In cash as the consideration for binding himself to discharge the said 1,200/. at the periods aforesaid, in the <em>\u00b0 </em>. r \u2019 bonds of the said <em>Harry Heth ; </em>meaning that he should be <em>at liberty </em>to discharge the same by discounts arising from the said <em>Harry Het/ps </em>bonds; that the complainant thereupon agreed to pay the said 1,200/. in manner aforesafo for the sum of 800/. in cash: that, in pursuance of <em>1 </em>1 this agreement, he purchased a bond given by the said hacl been due a considerable time, and amounted to 300/.; which bond he delivered to the said Taylor, who accepted the same as a partial satisfaction of the Contract: that (at the instance of the said Taylor) the complainant, with <em>William Mewbum </em>as his surety, executed, to the said <em>Harry </em>Heth, three bonds for the sum of 300/. each, payable, on the 6th day of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>September, in the years 1799, 1800 and 1801; that, at the like instance of the said Taylor, he delivered to him the three last-mentioned bonds, to be delivered to the said <em>Heth; </em>that these bonds appear to have been in the said <em>Heth\u2019s </em>possession, inasmuch as he has assigned the same; that the said <em>Taylor </em>informed the complainant, when he executed the said three bonds, that the agreement between <em>Heth </em>and himself was, that they were not to be assigned away, or passed off, until they became due; which circumstance operated as an inducement of convenience in the estimation of the complainant, since it afforded him an opportunity of procuring bonds of the said <em>Harry </em>Heth, with which the said <em>Thomas Taylor </em>stipulated that his own bonds aforesaid should be redeemed ; that; from some cause or other, a difference took place between the said <em>Taylor </em>and Heth, in consequence whereof, the said <em>Taylor </em>refused to receive, from the complainant, in discharge of his said three bonds, any thing but <em>money: </em>that <em>two </em>of them, to wit, those payable in the years 1799 and 1801, have been <em>discharged by the complainant to the said Thomas </em>Taylor, <em>as assignee of the said Harry Heth, in actual cash ; </em>that, upon the third bond, due in the year 1800, the said <em>Taylor </em>brought suit, in the <em>Richmond Hustings </em>court, against the said Mewburn, and obtained a judgment by default ; owing to the complainant\u2019s having written to an attorney to defend the same, who, contrary to his expectation, did not practise in that court; that <em>Mewburn </em>thereupon gave the complainant notice, and obtained a judgment against him, by motion, for the sum of 331/. 7*. <em>6d. </em>including costs and sheriff\u2019s commissions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-4\">The bill proceeded to charge that the demand of the full sum of 1,200/. <em>of </em>principal, for 800/. <em>only, of principal, </em>under the circumstances aforesaid, was <em>usurious; </em>and, if not usurious, <em>unconscionable; </em>that <em>Mezvburn </em>had informed the complainant, that, although he had procured a receipt from Taylor, it was merely to enable him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>to proceed by motion against the complainant j the said <em>Mewburn </em>having, in fact, paid no money to the said Taylor, but having deposited in his hands merchandise to be sold for the discharge of the judgment against the said Mewburn, in case the execution sued out by the latter upon his judgment against the complainant should not produce the amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-10\">The <em>prayer </em>of the bill was, therefore, that <em>Mewburn\u2019s </em>judgment against the complainant be perpetually enjoined; that his merchandise be restored to him, and the judgment aforesaid against him vacated; or that the complainant might receive any further, or other relief, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-11\">The <em>injunction </em>was awarded, on the usual terms, the 12th of <em>November, </em>1802.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-12\">The <em>answer </em>of <em>Thomas Taylor </em>admitted his purchase of a tenement, of <em>Harry Heth, </em>at the price mentioned in the bill, payable by instalments of 300/. each, without interest; denying that he applied to the complainant to know how much cash he would take for binding himself to pay the said interest; on the contrary, averring that the proposal came from the complainant, who repeatedly applied to him on the subject, and informed him that he had an opportunity of making an advantageous contract with the said <em>Heth, </em>who was willing to receive, in satisfaction of the said bonds, some tobacco, which the complainant wished to dispose of, and would allow a very high price ; that this proposal was not agreed to by the respondent, until repeated applications had- been made to him by the said <em>Watkins, </em>seconded by the said <em>Heth, </em>who also informed him that he and the complainant were about making an agreement concerning the said tobacco; that the respondent, accordingly, paid the complainant the sum of 800/.; that there was no conversation between them relative to a <em>loan </em>of that sum of money; that he had, on his part, no idea of a <em>loan, </em>nor any expectation that the complainant wished to become a bor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>rower of money by means of the said agreement, but supposed his object was to make an advantageous contract with the said <em>Heth ; </em>that the money was not raised without difficulty, and his object in raising it was not to lend it to the complainant, but to pay off a debt due from himself, payable at future periods.; that he would not have lent to the complainant such a sum of money, on the terms aforesaid; indeed, a considerable part of the said sum was actually <em>borrowed </em>by the respondent; that, when the said contract was made, and the 800/. paid, he understood that the complainant and the said <em>Heth </em>had come to an agreement, and considered <em>himself exonerated </em>from the debt to the said <em>Heth; </em>that, some time afterwards, the respondent was informed that <em>Heth </em>and the complainant had disagreed about the price of the tobacco, and that the debt originally due from the respondent was still unpaid; and the said <em>Heth </em>informed him that he still looked to him for the said debt: this defendant thought himself in equity discharged therefrom, as the said <em>Heth </em>had urged him to make the agreement with the complainant, and he understood that <em>Heth </em>was to look <em>solely to the </em>complainant, and not to him for payment; but, in order to avoid a dispute, he thought it best to urge the complainant to fulfil his contract by paying off the debt to <em>Heth; </em>that the complainant lodged with this defendant a bond, due from the said <em>Heth, </em>(which he the complainant had purchased at a very large discount,) and the three bonds executed by the complainant, with the said <em>Mewburn </em>as his surety, in order that they might be given to the said <em>Heth </em>in satisfaction of the debt; that the said <em>Heth </em>was willing to take the bonds of the complainant and Mewburn, but objected to taking in his own bond, (which he did not admit to be justly due,) and, moreover, insisted on retaining the legal title to the said tenement as a security for his debt; that this defendant became justly alarmed at his situation; he had not been sufficiently careful, at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>his contract with the complainant, with respect to the exoneration which he understood he was to have from the said <em>Heth; </em>and it was doubtful whether he could compel the said <em>Heth </em>to look <em>to the </em>complainant, only, for his money; and if this defendant should be obliged to pay it, the inconvenience would be a very serious one: at length, it was agreed, between him and the said <em>Heth, </em>that the latter should receive the said bonds, and assign them to this defendant, and that he should redeliver the said <em>Heth </em>possession of the tenement aforesaid, which was accordingly done; and the said Heth, some time afterward, took in his own bond. The respondent further said that, during the time that he was possessed of the said tenement, he laid out a considerable sum in improvements, part of which, to the value, he believed, of at least 100/. had been lost to him; and that he had also lost the benefit of the rise in the value of the said tenement, which was very considerable. <em>He acknowledged having received full satisfaction of the judgment against Mewburn, </em>and declared that he had no interest <em>'wx Mewburtds </em>judgment against the complainant, which he believed was not the property of the said Mewburn, but of a. certain \u2014\u2014\u2014- <em>Compston, </em>or his trustee; the said <em>Mewburn </em>having made an assignment of his effects for the benefit of his creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-9\">No answer was filed by <em>Mewburn, </em>and no proceedings against <em>him </em>appear in the record; but <em>John Richard, </em>agent and attorney for <em>Thomas </em>Compston, of <em>Philadelphia., </em>(though not made a defendant by the bill,) filed an answer, claiming the benefit of the judgment, against the complainant, by virtue of the assignment of <em>MewburrCs </em>effects.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-10\">Two depositions were taken, which did not materially affect the case; except that one witness deposed that he understood the agreement between <em>Watkins </em>and <em>Taylor </em>to be, that <em>Watkins, </em>in consideration &lt; of 800/. cash, was to pay for the tenement, <em>with bonds; </em>\u201c but with <em>what </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>bonds the witness could not certainly say; though (as well as he remembered) it was understood between them that <em>Heth\u2019s bonds would be good in </em>payment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-4\">Chancellor Taylor, on the 12th of <em>May, </em>1807, dismissed the bill with costs; whereupon the complainant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b449-5\">After argument by <em>Peyton Randolph </em>and Hay, for the appellant, and <em>Wickham, </em>for the appellees, the President</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ag0\"><em>(Friday, November </em>29th)</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ATEs\">pronounced the following opinion of the <em>majority </em>of the court.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b444-19\"> Note. If the agreement, in this case, had been, that <em>W. </em>was to pay the debt <em>in the bonds of ft. if to be had, and not otherwises </em>it seems that, since the <em>principal sum of </em>800/. would have been <em>in jeopardy, </em>the contract would not have been usurious. See <em>Gibson v. Fristoe, </em>2 <em>Call, 73.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-22\">But here, it appeared that, though <em>W. </em>was to be <em>at liberty </em>to pay the debt <em>in the bonds of H., </em>yet he was to be <em>responsible, at all events, -whether he could procure such bonds, or not. </em>This important circumstance made the contract usurious. See <em>{post) </em>the opinion of the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The principal question in this case is, whether the contract before us be usurious or not ?</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Let us consider what acts of the parties to a contract constitute usury, and apply the law to the case under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">The general legal principles on which questions of usury are to be decided, seem to be well settled. An agreement, by which a higher premium than legal interest for the loan of money, is directly, or indirectly, secured to the lender, or a forbearance of a debt due, in consideration of receiving, at a future day, a higher premium, or greater emolument than legal interest, is clearly usury, within the statute, unless attended with <em>some peculiar contingent circumstance, </em>(not existing in the case before us,) by which the <em>money lent, or the debt forborne, be put in evident hazard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">The forbearance of a debt due, being, in the present case, out of the question; let us see whether there was a <em>loan of money, </em>with a view of receiving a higher premium than legal interest? And, in my conception, we need only advert to the <em>answer </em>of the appellee, to establish the fact; and whether the first proposition came from the appellant, or was made by himself, seems quite immaterial. We must consider the contract as we find it stated in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>The appellee, indeed, says, in his answer, that \u201c there was no conversation between him and the complainant, relative to a <em>loan </em>of money. That he had, on his part, no idea of a loan, nor any expectations that the complainant wished to become a borrower of money by-means of the said agreement; but supposed that the object of the complainant was to make an advantageous contract with <em>Harry </em>HethAnd what, let me ask, was to enable him to make the advantageous contract With Heth, but the 800/. advanced him by the appellee, for which he agreed to pay, and has actually paid, a most exorbitant premium ?</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">The appellee acknowledges that he <em>paid </em>the appellant the sum of 800/. in consideration of his agreeing to exonerate him from a debt of 1,200/. which he owed the said <em>Heth </em>for a tenement purchased of him in the city of Richmond, to be paid by annual instalments. Let it be called a <em>payment, </em>a supply, an advance, or what it may j and whatever attempt may be made to cover, or disguise the transaction, it was, in <em>substance </em>and effect, according to my apprehension, a borrowing and lending of money, with a view of receiving a higher premium than legal interest for the loan; and whether that premium was to have been paid, immediately, to the appellee, or to Mr. <em>Heth </em>on his account, makes no difference in principle; as, in either case, it is clearly within the mischief intended to be guarded against by the statute of usury.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">The original contract appearing, on the face of it, as stated by both the parties, to have been usurious, no after transactions of theirs could, I conceive, take it out of the <em>statute; </em>and the cancelling the contract between the appellee and Heth, respecting the purchase of the tenement in the city of <em>Richmond, </em>cannot affect the merits of this case. It appears, however, by an exhibit in the record, that the appellee had, in March, 1801, received from the appellant the sum of 30/. 16s. <em>4d. </em>over and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>above the principal sum of 800/. loaned in the year 1798, with the legal interest thereon; and he confesses in his answer, that he has also received full satisfaction of the judgment he obtained against <em>William Mewburn </em>in the proceedings mentioned, amounting to 300/. with interest from the 6th day of September, 1800; and that he hath no interest in the judgment, obtained by <em>Mewburn </em>against the complainant, as his security in the bond, on which the judgment against <em>Mewburn </em>was rendered, and which, by the bill before us, is sought to be enjoined.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">It has been observed that the appellee, when he advanced the money to <em>Watkins, </em>put it in <em>hazard; </em>and the extraordinary <em>premium </em>contracted for, was a compensation, or recompense, for the risk he ran, and therefore no usury; but it was not such a risk as the law contemplates to take the case out of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">If such slight pretences were to be admitted, every usurer, who lends money at an exorbitant interest, payable at a distant day, might allege that he ran the risk of the borrower\u2019s dying insolvent before the day of payment, and thereby evade the statute, and render it nugatory, and a dead letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">On every view I have been able to take of this case, <em>\u25a0usury </em>appears conspicuous; and I have no hesitation in saying, that I think the appellant entitled, at least, to the relief prayed for by his bill; and am, consequently, of opinion that the decree is erroneous, and ought to be reversed; and that is the opinion of a majority of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Whereupon, the following decree was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\"><em>\u201c </em>The Court is of opinion that the said decree is erroneous, the appellant having, in the opinion of the court, just grounds of relief against the appellee, Taylor, and having also a right to proceed, finally, against the appellee, <em>Mewburn; </em>against whom, as yet, the appellant has not so proceeded, and who, therefore, ought not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>be bound by the admission of the appellee, <em>Taylor, or </em>by the allegation contained in the other answer filed in this cause, that the debt in question has been regularly transferred by him to <em>John Richard; </em>(if he ought to be bound by the decision, upon the question of usury, rendered between the <em>now </em>parties; as to which this court gives no opinion;) therefore, it is decreed and ordered, that the same be reversed and annulled, and that the appellees pay to the appellant his costs by him expended in the prosecution of his appeal aforesaid here; and this court proceeding to make such decree as the said superior court of chancery ought to have pronounced, it is further decreed and ordered, that the appellee, Taylor, do pay to the clerk of the said superior court of chancery, or to such other person, or persons, as the said court may order and direct, the sum of three hundred pounds, with lawful interest thereon from the 6th day of <em>September, </em>1800, and also the costs of a suit, recovered by the appellee, Taylor, against the said <em>Mewburn, </em>in the <em>Hustings </em>court of the city of <em>Richmond, </em>in the month of <em>May, </em>1802, with legal interest on such costs, until payment thereof, and also the costs incurred by the said <em>Mewburn </em>in obtaining a judgment against the appellant in the said court of <em>Hustings; </em>to be, by the said clerk, or receiver, as the case'may be, paid over to <em>John Richard, </em>the agent in the proceedings <em>mentioned; </em>unless the said <em>Mewburn </em>shall, within ninety days after this decree shall be certified to the said court of chancery, and served upon him, satisfy the judge of the said court that the debt now in question has not been duly transferred to the said <em>Richard, </em>but is retained by himself, or is owned by some other person, claiming by assignment from him: in which case, the money aforesaid shall, under the order of the said court, be paid to the said <em>Mew-burn, </em>or other person his assignee as aforesaid; saving, however, to the said <em>Richard, </em>or those claiming under him, the right of appeal from such decision. And the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>cause is remanded to the said superior court of chancery, in order to be finally proceeded in, pursuant to the princi,ples of this decree, and for the further purpose, after such payment shall have been made, of perpetually enjoining the judgment obtained, by the said Merwburn, against the appellant, as aforesaid. But, it being now suggested by the appellant\u2019s counsel, that, since the exhibition of the bill, in this case, the sum due by the appellant to the said Mewburn, under his judgment aforesaid, has been paid by him, the appellant, to the said Mexvburn, or those claiming under him, whereby, while, on the one hand, the said Mexvburn, or those claiming under him, may be more than indemnified for his undertaking as security for the appellant, the latter may be a loser by the amount of the sum aforesaid, notwithstanding the opinion of this court that the contract in the proceedings mentioned is <em>usurious </em>and void; it is, therefore, further decreed and ordered, that nothing herein contained shall affect the right of the appellant to resort to the said court of chancery for relief against the payment in the case aforesaid; but that he be as free to pursue the same, as if this decree had not been made.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b453-6\">Judge Co alter</author>\n<p id=\"Amk\">(dissenting from the other judges) pronounced the following opinion :</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">If the <em>xvhole </em>answer is to be taken as responsive to the bill, and as evidence, <em>uncontradicted </em>by the competent number of witnesses to destroy it, this case, on the point of usury, would, to my mind, be a very clear one.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">It would be simply this; that the appellee, Taylor, being in debt to Seth, payable at a future day, the appellant applies to him to take in his debt immediately, for that he and said <em>Seth </em>had made an arrangement in a tobacco contract, by which it would be agreeable to both of them that the appellee should purchase in his debt; that this proposition was seconded by <em>Seth </em>himself, and that the appellee, in making the payment, believed he was paying oil' his debt to Seth, who had made his ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>rangements with the appellant; that, when he advanced the 800/. it was in discharge of his debt; and that a loan of money was never spoken of, or contemplated\u00bb If this was the real transaction, I presume it would not be contended that a man, paying off his debt, due at a future day, to his creditor, or to his creditor\u2019s friend and agent, and at the request and solicitation of his creditor, may not do it on terms with which all parties are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">But it is said, this part of the answer, setting up a new case, is not responsive to the bill, which charges the transaction to have been something different, and that, therefore, it must be proved by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">I shall not stop to decide this question, as I do not think it important in the final decision, according to the view I have taken of the subject; and shall, therefore, content myself by stating this case as if is made out by the bill, such parts of the answer as are responsive to the bill, and therefore .evidence, and the deposition of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">I will here remark, though, that, there being an express charge of usury in the bill, though it does not state in what way, or by what devices, the parties had contrived to evade the law, the general answer, stating that there was no communication for a loan of money, and that the appellee had no idea that the appellant wished to borrow money, must be taken as responsive to that general charge of usury, and, if not contradicted by evidence, will leave the case as one in which usury is to be established, when the party, to be found guilty thereof, had no idea, or expectation, that a loan was intended, but believed he was making a contract by which he was to be discharged from a debt he owed!</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">The case, then, made out in this way, I take to be this; <em>Taylor </em>being indebted to <em>Heth, </em>.whose circumstances were somewhat embarrassed, and whose paper, to a .considerable amount, was standing out against him, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>appellant applied to him to know what sum he would give him to pay off said debt to Heth, in the bonds of the latter; in other words, to deliver, to <em>Taylor, Heth\u2019s </em>bonds, to the amount of his debt due to <em>Heth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">After frequent applications, it was agreed that, for 800/. the appellant would pay off the debt due to <em>Heth, </em>in his bonds ; which debt was 1,200/. payable in three annual instalments, without interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">This agreement was not reduced to writing; but, some time after it was entered into, the appellant, having purchased up a bond of <em>Heth\u2019s </em>for 300/. gave it to <em>Taylor, </em>and, at the same time, gave his bonds, with security, <em>payable to Heth, </em>for the balance, payable in three annual payments, but with this understanding, that <em>Heth </em>was not to assign them, so as to deprive the appellant of the privilege of discharging them in <em>Heth\u2019s </em>paper. It was no part of the original agreement that the appellant was to give such bonds: but it took place, afterwards, in consequence of the appellant\u2019s only delivering one bond of 300/. instead of the whole amount. Heth, afterwards, assigned these bonds to the appellee, <em>Taylor, </em>who told the appellant that he would receive nothing but the money for them: the appellant accordingly paid him the first and last of those bonds in money; but refusing to pay the second bond, suit was brought and judgment recovered against the security, without defence ; the attorney, to whom the appellant wrote to defend the suit, not practising in the court where it was brought. The security, against whom the judgment was obtained, not having paid the money to <em>Taylor, </em>but having obtained his receipt to enable him to make his motion, had got a judgment on motion against the appellant, who prays for an injunction, and general relief; relying, first, on the statute against usury; and, secondly, that, if the transaction was not usurious, it was an unconscionable bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The charge of usury, in the bill, is a general charge\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"Ae_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>The answer expressly states that there was no communication for, or idea of, a <em>loan ; </em>and there is no testimony contradicting this. It appears that the security had. paid the money, and that, therefore, the case, as an injunction, is at an end; and then the only question is, whether the appellant ought to have had a decree against <em>Taylor </em>for the excess of his payments beyond 800/. and interest; or whether the chancellor was correct in dismissing his bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">1st. The first question, then, is, was the transaction usurious ?</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">2d. If not, was it an unconscionable bargain ?</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">As to the first. Before a transaction can be pronounced usurious, which is not so on the <em>very face </em>of the bond, or contract, several things must be made to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"AE9D\">First, it must appear that a <em>loan </em>was intended, and that <em>both parties </em>were assenting thereto <em>:</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the statute . , . , , <em>r </em>, ... , is highly penal; and, although <em>one </em>or the parties may wish to raise money by the transaction, and may hold oui great gain to the other, as by offering him an extravagant price for property, &amp;c. yet, if there was no communication for a <em>loan, </em>or a <em>knowledge, </em>in the party sell- \u2019 f \u2019 . . <em>jng </em>that a <em>loan, </em>or <em>borrozving, </em>was intended, it will not ^ be <em>usury; </em>whatever the court might do with the case, as a hard and unconscionable bargain*</p>\n<p id=\"ASsv\">Secondly; if it was not usury <em>at the time </em>when the contract was entered into, no <em>after </em>circumstance can <em>J </em>make it so ;<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> and any argument, therefore, drawn from . after circumstances, would be improper.</p>\n<p id=\"AHmQ\"><em>\u25a0 </em>Thirdly; the court will <em>not presume </em>a contract to be usurious; but it must be <em>proved </em>to be so.</p>\n<p id=\"Afy\">Fourthly; where this proof is not on <em>the face </em>of the bond, or contract, itself, as where <em>A., </em>in consideration of 100/. received, binds himself to pay 120/. at the end of a year, it must be collected from a view of all the circumstances attending the case; <footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> as where there is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>bargain for great gain, and <em>this upon a previous communication for the loan of money; </em>or where there is a bargain which, on the face of it, will authorize the party to discharge himself by repayment of the money and interest, yet, by a secret understanding, he was bound not to avail himself of this privilege, but to subject himself to the penalty; all these, and a thousand other devices, would not avail, if the <em>real object was a loan of money.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Fifthly; it is the <em>intent </em>that makes the usury: but, if there was no such <em>intent, </em>then the sale of property for double its real value, the discounting of notes, buying in securities, purchasing annuities, &amp;c. however advantageous the contract may be, is not <em>usury.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">I.et us examine the case by these principles, which I consider to be settled principles of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Was it a <em>loan, </em>and did the parties intend to evade the statute ? To this it <em>may </em>be answered, that though the <em>bond, </em>in this case, is simply for the payment of money, and nothing unfair on the face of it, yet the <em>original contract, in the very terms of it, is usurious.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">I admit this is the fair and proper ground to put the question on; for the subsequent execution of the bonds will neither make that usury which was not so originally, nor legalize the original transaction, if it was unlawful and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Suppose, then, the original contract had been reduced to writing; it would have been to this effect:</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">The appellant, for 800/. received, would have bound himself to procure <em>Heth's </em>bonds, either then due, or, at least, payable in one, two and three years, to the amount of 1,200/. so as to cover and operate a discharge of a debt, to that amount, due in one, two and three years, from the appellee to said <em>Heth. </em>Would such agreement, <em>upon the very face of it, </em>be void ?</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">Suppose the appellant had produced <em>Heth's </em>bonds to the amount of 1,200/. and for which he had paid i,000/. and had offered them to the appellee for 800/. would the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>purchase by him, <em>for the express purpose of applying those bonds to the discharge of his own </em>debt, have been an usurjous transaction ? Or, suppose <em>Taylor </em>had not been in debt to Heth, but hearing that his paper was in market, at a large discount, and wishing to procure it, as an advantageous speculation; believing <em>Heth </em>to be ultimately sure; and this wish being known to the appellant ; he inquires what he will agree to give him for <em>Heth's </em>paper, payable in one, two and three years; and he says, 13s. <em>4d. </em>for 20s.; a bargain is struck; 800/. is paid, and a bond given for the delivery of <em>Heth\u2019s </em>bonds, to the amount of 1,200/.: would such contract, <em>necessarily, and on the face of it, </em>be usurious ? There is no doubt but such a contract, made under particular circumstances, or accompanied with particular private understandings, (as, not to purchase the bonds of Heth, &amp;c.) might be used as a device to cover an usurious contract s but the question now put is, whether such contract is, <em>on the face of it, </em>and without further averment, plainly usurious'; as where the party for the consideration of 100/. received, agrees to pay 120/.- at the end of the year.</p>\n<p id=\"AQS\"><em>Heth </em>may, or may not, have paper in market: if he has paper out, it m\u00e1y, or may not, be to be had at a great discount. But, if his paper is in market, and may be purchased at 10s. or 12s. for 20s. then the appellant would have made an advantageous contract; so that, unless it be said that bonds shall not be a subject of trade and speculation, I do not see that a contract, relative to them, even where they are contracted for at a considerable discount, <em>must necessarily </em>be <em>usurious.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Where are all the contracts for the notes of <em>Morris </em>and <em>Nicholson ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">If it be true, then, that the contract is not <em>necessarily, and from the very terms of it, </em>usurious and void, the next question will be, whether this contract, although it bus a fair and legal exterior, is not rotten at the cores <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>and used merely as a cover and device to avoid the statute ?</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">If this was the <em>secret </em>intent of the parties, they themselves must know it: the court will not, and cannot, <em>presume </em>that such was their intention: it must be <em>proved; </em>and, I presume, in the usual way, to wit, by an allegation to that effect, and the corresponding proof.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The appellant, however, does not allege that a loan was intended; or that the paper of <em>Heth </em>was not in market; or that it had unexpectedly appreciated; or that there was any private agreement not to purchase it, but to subject himself to the penalty; or any other kind of shift, or device: on the contrary, he makes no other complaint in his bill, except that the appellee said he would receive nothing but the money: indeed, by the question he asks the witness, viz. \u201c whether <em>Heth\u2019s </em>paper could not have been procured at a large discount,\u201d he seems to admit that he could have discharged himself by a sum equal to the 800/. and interest, but that the appellee said he would have nothing but the money* As to the usury, he seems to rest <em>that </em>on the ground, that the contract, <em>in the very terms of it, </em>was usurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">As before stated, 1 think it was not so; and, as to any shift, or device, to make it so, I also think that the court cannot make out a case, for the appellant, which lie has not made for himself; but that, if it was intended to show the case to be a shift to evade the statute, the appellant must have set out his case, so that the appellee could have had the benefit of his answer, and an opportunity to take depositions. No such allegation being made, the appellee, I presume, was not bound to prove that <em>Ileth\u2019s </em>paper was in market, and could, at any time, have been procured at 13s. <em>4d. </em>for 20s.; or at any other discount; (no complaint being made as to that;) or that he was not guilty of any other shift, or device* The only complaint is, that the appellee, afterwards, refused to take any thing but money. This, however* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>being </em>an after circumstance, would not make the original contract usurious. The most that could be said of it would be, that it was a breach of contract, and to be redressed, either by a court of law, or equity, as the case should appear. But on this point the party makes no case: he does not show that he procured and offered the bonds agreeably to his contract; because, if he had done that, and in proper time, so as to enable the appellee to set them off against his debt due to Heth; he might have had redress, even at law, perhaps. Nothing, however, of this kind is shown, or suggested; and if it was, this <em>after </em>circumstance would not make the <em>original </em>contract usurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">I do not think this so strong a case as that of Price, &amp;c. v. Campbell, 2 <em>Call, </em>110. and perhaps not as much so as the case of <em>Kenner </em>v. <em>Hord, </em>2 <em>H. &amp; M. </em>14.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">But what will the court do, in this case, as to the 300/. ? Suppose the appellant (as is highly probable} got that bond for 200/. If he recovers 400/. of the appellee, he then puts 100/. clear gain in his pocket. But, suppose he had purchased <em>Heth\u2019s </em>bonds to the amount of 1,150/. and had got them for 750l.: the appellee must have taken them at the nominal sum. The appellant would then have paid 1,150/. of the debt due <em>Heth. </em>He has received, though, but 800/. He must, therefore, recover 350/. from the appellee, and has already made 400/. by the speculation in the bonds; so that, in the whole, he would put a clear gain in his pocket of <em>7501.1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">Does not this serve to show that this bargain, in the very terms of it, was not necessarily usurious, or even hard; but that it would depend on testimony aliunde, to prove either the one or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">' Suppose the appellant, in this case, had proved, <em>by one witness only, </em>that, although the terms of this contract were that he was to deliver bonds of Heth, yet it was priv\u00e1tely understood that he was not to have this privilege, but that it was merely used as a cover and device <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>ic* evade the statute ,* would such evidence have been proper ? If it would, then the party, by not stating his case, would deprive the other party of the legal weight of his answer, which would have been greater than the deposition of a single witness. This case, then, is not usurious <em>on the face </em>of it, and no other case is made out, or pretended.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Courts of <em>equity </em>may be disposed to go farther than courts of law, in deciding cases to be usurious; because <em>they </em>do not inflict such severe <em>penalties; </em>yet I am not prepared to say that a different rule of decision should obtain on the equity side, from what should obtain on the law side of this <em>court; </em>and this, I apprehend, would be a very naked case, <em>at law, </em>on which to recover the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">I am also inclined to think that there must be a great difference between setting aside hard and unconscionable contracts, on the ground of hardship and undue advantage, and setting aside <em>even such </em>contracts, on the ground of <em>usury. </em>The statute is highly penal; and if the distinctions, between <em>hard </em>bargains and <em>usurious </em>ones, are done away, parties may be subject to severe penalties who never intended to violate the law. For these reasons, I apprehend, it is, that the rules which I have before stated are laid down, and, particularly, the rule that, the courts will not <em>presume, </em>but <em>require proof, </em>of usury, and that it was the <em>intention </em>of <em>both parties </em>to violate the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">2. As to the second ground, that this is an unconscionable bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">I can see no evidence of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The appellant does not pretend to say that he could not have procured <em>Hethls </em>paper at a great discount; but, in fact, states the reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">The contract, therefore, might, originally, have been an advantageous one to him, had he purchased and delivered the bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>He states, though, that the appellee refused to receive any thing but the money. This, though, does not prove the original contract hard.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">If the appellee has broken his contract, then the appellant ought to have made out his case, to wit, that he had performed his part of the agreement, by procuring and tendering the bonds, in due time, to enable the appellee to use them as a set-off against <em>Heth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">But he does not pretend to say this 5 on the contrary, says that he paid off the first and last bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">After this confirmation of the transaction^ and in the absence, of every allegation and evidence of hardship, I cannot give relief on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">I therefore think, with great deference to the opinions of my more learned brethren, that there is no error in the decree of the chancellor dismissing the bill of the appellant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b456-9\"><em> Floyer </em>v. <em>Edwards, Cowp. </em>151. <em>Skipwith </em>v. <em>Gibson and </em>Jefferson, 4 H. &amp; M. 490.
