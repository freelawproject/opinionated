Chapman </em>Hunter, was reversed by the district court held at <em>Hay-Market, </em>and the motion dismissed with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AF7\">The judgment (which corresponded with the notice) was for 73/, 19,?, <em>3d. \u201c </em>being the amount of the assesg0 t ment imposed on the property of the aforesaid <em>John C'. Hunter, </em>in <em>Alexandria, </em>for paving the streets of the said \u201e town.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-18\">A bill of exceptions was filed in the county court, setting forth all the evidence exhibited; from which it appeared that the sum assessed on the property of the defendant for paving the streets was only 70/. 19s. <em>3d. </em>the farther sum of 3/. being charged against him for tax on his ground.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AAd\">exception was taken to the jurisdiction of the court. neither did it appear in evidence that the defend- ; <em>1 </em>r ant resided <em>out </em>of the county of <em>Fairfax.</em></summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b248-25\"><em>Thursday, April </em>18th.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Apz\">The judges pronounced their opinions.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b248-26\">Judge Cabell.</author>\n<p id=\"AFQ5\">The evidence contained in the bill exceP^ons proves, incontestably, that the county court gave iudvment, not only for the amount of taxes or as-J . - r , sessments for paving the streets, but also for the common town tax; and, in this view of the subject, this case comes completely within the principle decreed in the case of <em>The Mayor and Commonalty of Alexandria v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Chapman.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> But there are two other additional grounds on which I think the judgment of the county court should be reversed; 1st. The act of assembly<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> gives the right to this summary remedy only in the county where the \u201e , , ./ \u201e . / , defendant resides. But it is neither stated nor proved that the defendant resided in the county of <em>Fairfax, </em>where this motion was made. The plaintiffs, therefore, have not shown themselves entitled to the benefit of the act, and this court cannot presume it for them; 2d. The evidence of the plaintiffs did not entitle them to recover under the notice they had given. The act of assembly requires that the defendant shall have notice, not only of the motion intended to be made, but also of the \u201c amount of the taxes or assessments due from him,\u201d which, in my opinion, prevents the proof or recovery of any sum different from that stated in the notice. The judgment of the district court, therefore, reversing that of the county court, should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-22\">Judges Roane and Fleming assented; and the judgment of the district court was unanimously affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AJs1\"> <em>4 H &amp; M. 270.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"ABM\"><em> Sess.Acts, </em>c\u2018 3U</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
