The verdict was, \u201c that the defendant doth detain the negro woman slaves in the declara- . tion mentioned, to wit, <em>Amy </em>and Rachel, and the issue of the said <em>Amy </em>named Alaria, and the issue of the said <em>Rachel </em>named Dixon, in manner and form, <em>&amp;c.; </em>that the said <em>Amy </em>is of the price of 100/. the said <em>Rachel </em>of the price of 100/. the said <em>Maria </em>of the price of <em>SOI. </em>and the said <em>Dixon </em>of the price of 50/. and that the action of the plaintiff did accrue within five years next before the suing out the original writ,\u20195 &amp;c. and damages were assessed to forty shillings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AZlf\">A motion was made in arrest of judgment, Oh the ground that the declaration was <em>vasrite </em>and uncertain, in <em>\u00b0 a </em>\u2019 demanding the <em>issue </em>of the two negro women therein mentioned; that the jury erred in finding for the plaintiff the two negroes <em>Alaria </em>and Dixon, whose names were not mentioned in\" the declaration ; and that the jury found <em>general </em>damages, which applied, as well to the detention of the negroes not named in the declaration, as \u25a0. , _ , . of those who were named therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AfO\">The district court was of opinion that the said errors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>were sufficient in law to arrest the judgment. It was* therefore considered, \u201c that the plaintiff take nothing by p[s bill, &amp;c. and that the defendant go thereof without day, and recover his <em>costs,\u201d </em>&amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b560-3\">From which judgment the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b560-7\">Botts, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALqR\">The names of the slaves are not indispensably necessary in the declaration. If the reverse of this position were established, a child <em>not yet named </em>could not be recovered: and it is not certain that the issue in this case (being <em>infants') </em>had names at the time the declaration was filed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-8\"><em>Reasonable </em>certainty is all that the law requires in an action of detinue. The not naming a <em>horse </em>is no defect in the declaratiqn, notwithstanding he has a name of notoriety. If a negro has a <em>common </em>name, (such as <em>John </em>or <em>Tom,) </em>the description is by no means certain. The words \u201c issue of a mother,\u201d who is named, describes, the individual more positively.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-9\">2. If this declaration be defective, it is cured by the act of jeofails ; according to which judgment is not to be arrested \u201c for omitting the averment of any matter, without proving which the jury ought not to have given such verdict.\u201d Besides, <em>txvo </em>negroes were well named, and well found. Judgment ought to have been entered <em>for those two, </em>at any rate. .Yet the court arrested it altogether. The only objection is, that <em>general </em>damages 'were assessed for all four. This, then, was error in the <em>verdict; </em>not in the <em>pleadings; </em>and, at utmost, a <em>venire de novo </em>should,have been awarded.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b560-10\">3. <em>Costs </em>were improperly given against the plaintiff; the rule being,-that \u201cwhere judgment is arrested, each party pays his own costs.\u2019<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b561-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number><em>The Attorney General, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATuC\">relied chiefly on the doctrine that, in detinue, a greater degree of certainty is required than in ordinary actions, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AEhI\">\n<em>Tuesday, November 5th,</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A2gP\">the president pronounced the following opinion of the court.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><em> Higgenbotham </em>v.
