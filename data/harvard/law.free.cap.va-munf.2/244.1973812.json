And it is further agreed upon, and understood, that the said <em>Fenwick </em>shall retain quiet and peaceable possession of the before-mentioned property, for and during the full term of ten years, from the first day of <em>October </em>next, during which it shall be subject to his exclusive management and control, and shall be worked or used by him, his heirs or assigns, during that period, for his or their exclusive interest or emolument: <em>Provided, </em>(and the proviso is introduced by the trustees, in perfect confidence of its full and proper influence on the said Fenwick,) that, in all the repairs and improvements thus left to his discretion, the said <em>Fenwick </em>will not consider his own temporary accommodation <em>only, </em>but the real and permanent advantage of the property also, and proportion the expenditures accordingly. And the said <em>Fen-wick </em>doth hereby engage, bind and oblige himself to ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>tain the necessary workmen and labourers as speedily <em>ss </em>possible, and on the most advantageous terms he can, and to complete the work before particularized with all the despatch which shall appear to him to consist with the durability thereof j that the completion of the mills shall be the first object, and shall not be impeded by any other ; that when the mills shall be completed the year shall commence; at the' termination whereof, he will pay to the said <em>FtMurdo </em>and Fisher, or to whoever else shall be duly authorized to receive the same, the sum of six hundred dollars at the end of each of the next succeeding two years the like sum at the end of each of the next succeeding three years, the sum of one thousand dollars; and (should he, his heirs or assigns, choose so long to retain said property) at the end of each of the next succeeding three years, the sum of twelve hundred dollars: at that time (which will include a term of nine years from the completion of the mills) this lease shall terminate.

Plea, \u201ccovenants performed,\u201d and issue. The jury found a general verdict for the plaintiff, for 2,341/. 11s. 11 <em>d. </em>damages; and judgment was entered accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-5\">To this judgment <em>M1-Mur do </em>and <em>Fisher </em>obtained an injunction from the superior court of chancery for the <em>Richmond </em>district, chiefly on the grounds that <em>Fenwick's </em>expenditures on the mills were extravagant and excessive, and not for the real and permanent advantage of the estate; that, availing himself of that clause of the contract which authorized him to make such alterations in the construction of the mills as should, in his opinion, be best calculated to give them their full power and effect, he proceeded, not only to repair the old machinery, but to construct new machinery throughout, and on a new plan; which was not the intention of the contract; that, at the trial at law, it having been admitted by <em>if Mur do </em>and <em>Fisher </em>that the money charged in the ao <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>count had been paid, \u201c the denial that it was properly chargeable to the defendants at law seemed to have but little influence on the jury,\u201d and they sanctioned every charge made by <em>Fenwick; </em>that the jury had not time for a full and deliberate investigation of an account so lengthy and important, and taking the words of the contract as their guide, and (not considering (perhaps correctly avoiding to consider) the trust reposed in the plaintiff at law) they thought he had a right to make any alterations he might deem expedient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-8\">The answer fully and particularly denied the equity of the bill; averring that all the improvements were <em>bona fide </em>made, being such as were indispensably necessary to embrace the objects and provisions of the contract, and to promote the permanent advantage of the property j and that this was shown to the satisfaction of the jury, and of the plaintiffs themselves, by the testimony of the millwright summoned by them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-9\">A great number of depositions were taken on both sides; among which were those of Jive of the jurors who rendered the verdict at common law; one of whom swore that the jury did not inquire whether any particular article in the account was too high or too low, or i\u00a3 there was more than was <em>necessary; </em>as they considered <em>Fenwick </em>not limited by the contract as to the repairs or improvements which he might think calculated to give the mills their full power and effect; but that juror heard no testimony tending to show any money was used improperly, or that more was expended than was necessary. Three of them deposed that the trial was full; that the jury gave their verdict upon complete proof of the plaintiff\u2019s demand, after every objection \u201c which the counsel for the defendants made\u201d had been considered; being of opinion that the money was properly expended in erecting necessary works, completed upon the most economical terms, and according to the spirit of the contract between the parties. The fifth Was in general of the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>opinion, but said there was some unnecessary expense which appeared to proceed from error in judgment, for which <em>Fenwick </em>was not thought responsible by the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-4\">The depositions contained a variety of testimony concerning the comparative expediency of repairing the old works, or of resorting to the new plan adopted by <em>Fen-wick ; </em>taking into view the quantity of water in the stream, and value of custom to the mill, compared with the expense incurred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-6\">It appeared in evidence, that the machinery in the mills, when he took possession, was of little or no value; but that the expense of repairing the old machinery would have been much less than that of erecting the new j which, however, was better calculated to make the most of the wheat, and more advantageous to the lessee. A witness was of opinion that the mills could have been repaired upon the old plan for 1,710/. 3s. 11 3-4d.; but as to this, the testimony was doubtful. The money paid by <em>MiMurdo </em>and Fisher, and credited by <em>Fenwick </em>in his account, rendered before the district court, amounted to 1,825/. <em>4s. </em>6d.; adding to which, <em>2,0861. </em>19s. <em>9d. </em>(the sum he recovered, exclusive of interest,) the cost of the new works appeared to be, at least, 3,912/. 4s. <em>Sd.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-7\">The late chancellor, on the 28th of March, 1806, made the injunction perpetual; from which decree <em>Fenwick </em>appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-8\">The case was very elaborately argued upon the merits, as well as the question of jurisdiction ; by</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b269-9\"><em>Williams </em>and Warden, for the appellant, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b269-10\"><em>Call </em>and Hay, for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-16\">Upon the last point, the counsel for the appellees contended that effectual defence could not have been made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>at law, under the plea that was filed, or any other plea that could have been filed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-11\">1. The plea was \u201c covenants performed,\u201d which covers only the ground occupied by the declaration, and amounts, in substance, to the plea of payment. Under this plea no matter of defence could be introduced by the defendants, but such as tended to support their plea. They could not avail themselves of a precedent covenant to be performed by the plaintiff, and could not have held him to prove performance on his part of such precedent covenant. All the plaintiff was bound to prove was the amount of the sums expended, and that proper vouchers \u25a0were produced. \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-12\">But, in this case, the proviso was not even a precedent, but a collateral and independent covenant. The general averment of \u201c performance, on the part of the plaintiff, according to the true intent and meaning of the contract,\u201d does not, in this case, refer to the proviso, but to the preceding part of the declaration, in which the plaintiff, after reciting the words of the contract, has introduced the novelty of undertaking to set forth the intent and meaning of those words. In this declaration there is no averment relating to the proviso. The question concerning it, therefore, could not have been tried by the jury. The plaintiff is not bound to aver performance on his part, except where, by his own showing, there is a covenant to be performed by him before performance can be exacted of the defendant.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> Where he makes an unnecessary averment of performance, he is not required to prove it, but it is rejected as surplusage.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> Even .then, if the plaintiff had averred that he made the' repairs in conformity with the proviso, he would not have been bound to prove <em>it; </em>Tor it would have been surplus-age ; since the proviso was not a preliminary covenant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-13\">2. It was not possible at law to put in such a plea as would have given the defendants the benefit of the proviso.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>The only way in which a special plea could have been drawn was, \u201c that the plaintiff was not entitled to his action, because, in the repairs made by him, he had not consulted the permanent interest of the estate.\u201d But Shis plea might have been demurred to, because the covenant on which it relied was not a precedent, but an independent covenant; and the demurrer would have been rightly sustained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-4\">The only question is, whether the proviso was a precedent or independent covenant ? And this depends on sio general rule, but the nature of the contract, and real intention of the parties.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> According to the contract, <em>Fenwick </em>was to begin immediately; <em>M'Murdo &amp; Fisher </em>were to be immediately responsible for the expenditures, and to pay the money on the production of vouchers. The cotemporaneous exposition of the contract by the parties was such; as their conduct proved. Surely, then, the proviso could not have been a precedent condition. They could not have withheld the first payments on the ground of their being not certain that he was consulting the permanent interest of the estate. This could not have been ascertained, until very great progress had been made in the work. Even if the proviso had been an express preliminary covenant, <em>Fenwick\u2019s </em>part performance would have prevented the defendants from availing themselves of the defence; because their maintaining such plea would have occasioned a loss to the plaintiff of the money actually paid by him, and properly paid. Suppose he had advanced all the money out of his own pocket, before calling on them ; they had refused payment ; suit had been brought, and they had thereupon filed a special plea, relying on the proviso <em>; it' </em>the plaintiff, instead of demurring, had joined issue, justice could not have been done to either party; because Fenwick, if defeated by such plea in bar, would not have recovered even as much of the money as he had rightfully paid. There was, therefore, no. adequate remedy at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>In support of this point, the counsel cited also, 6 T. <em>R. 573. </em>Lord <em>Mansfield\u2019s </em>opinion in the case of <em>Boone v. Eyre, </em>reported in 1 <em>H. Bl. 273. </em>note (a). 1 <em>Saund. </em>319. <em>Pordage </em>v. <em>Cole. Ib. </em>320. note (4), and the cases there referred to. 1 <em>Esp. N. P. </em>281. <em>Gilb. Law of Evidence, </em>194. &amp;c. and 1 <em>Chitty, </em>313.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVk\">In opposition to an allegation on the other side, that the subject was fully before the jury, they contended that the only light in which the court should regard the case, should be to look at the record and pleadings, and consider no point as investigated but what the pleadings warranted. The inconvenience would be very great of adopting a practice of proving, by witnesses, what was said by counsel before the jury. Even in a case clearly proper for a court of equity, it might be contended that a question, which ought not tq have been presented to the jury* was, in fact, argued before them. For exam-pie, where a bond has been given for payment of purchase-money, and a title not made, a witness might be called to prove that, in debt on the bond, the defend* ant\u2019s counsel, in argument, objected to the action on, the ground of the defect of title; and, though the objection was overruled, or (very properly) disregarded, it might be said that, because the point was before the jury, the defendant should have no remedy in equity,</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AK8r\"><em>On the other side, </em>it was said that <em>Fenwick </em>could not' have recovered at law, without showing that the expenditures incurred were in conformity with the contract, of which the proviso was an essential part, but not an in dependent covenant; for, a proviso does not make a coveqant.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The contract was, that they would pay the money, provided that, in all the repairs and improvenaents, he would not consider his own temporary accommodatiqn only, but the real and permanent advantage o\u00a3 the property also, and proportion the expenditures accordingly. They were to pay, provided he did this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>but if otherwise, they were not to pay. This inquiry, then, was proper for the jury ; and they have decided that he has done so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-4\">The plaintiff, in support of the averment in his declaration that he had performed on his part all that was incumbent upon him to perform, was bound to prove that he made the repairs and improvements agreeably to the proviso. In like manner, in a case where a party purchases an estate, and agrees to pay a certain sum, provided particular counsel shall approve the title, the vendor must prove that his title was approved by that counsel, before he can recover of the purchaser, <em>(a) </em>Under the plea of covenants performed, to this declaration and agreement, the whole subject was, therefore, properly before the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-5\">A court of equity can, upon no principle, make contracts for parties. It can relieve from a hard or unconscionable bargain, only by making the plaintiff accept compensation <em>; </em>and that must be his actual advances of money, with lawful <em>interest; </em>which is all the court of law has given in this case.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b273-6\">Thursday, <em>May </em>2d, 1811.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AIb\">The president pronounced the opinion of the court in the following terms :</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u0430) 1 <em>Saund. </em>235. note (5) 1 Chitty, 232.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b270-9\"> <em>Bristow </em>v.

This court, without deciding on its merits, is unanimously of opinion that the court of chancery had no jurisdiction of the case.
