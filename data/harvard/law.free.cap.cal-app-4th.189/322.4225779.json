(Pen. Code, \u00a7 243.1.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A two strikes offender, he was sentenced to eight years in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Defendant appeals, arguing (1) there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction, (2) the trial court erred in failing to give supplemental instructions to the jury on the definition of the term \u201ccustodial officer,\u201d and (3) the court erred in failing to instruct on the lesser included offense of battery. We reject each of these contentions and shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">On the day of the incident, defendant was in custody as a \u201ccivil committee\u201d in Shasta County jail.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Civil committees are housed separately from the general inmate population and have a different classification than criminal inmates. Due to defendant\u2019s classification, he was confined to the medical ward of the jail. Nevertheless, defendant was required to follow all the same rules as other jail inmates, including the requirement that he wear an identification wristband at all times.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">On April 17, 2009, Shasta County Correctional Officer John Westmoreland, who was in charge of the medical ward, noticed that defendant was not wearing his identification wristband. Westmoreland told defendant he needed to wear the wristband. Defendant replied that he was allergic to the wristband\u2019s metal clasp. The officer responded that since defendant did not have a doctor\u2019s note, he would still have to wear the wristband. Defendant complied with the order and put his wristband on.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">Later in the day, when Officer Westmoreland returned defendant to his cell, defendant took off his wristband. When Westmoreland again advised defendant that he needed to wear the wristband, defendant responded that he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>have to follow the rules. Since defendant was already in his cell and would remain there for the rest of the day, Westmoreland let the matter drop.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The next day, Officer Westmoreland noticed that defendant had items of contraband in his cell. Westmoreland ordered defendant out of his cell so he could conduct a search. When defendant reentered his cell after the search, Westmoreland again noticed that he was not wearing his wristband. \"Westmoreland told defendant several times that he needed to wear his wristband, but defendant ignored him. Westmoreland then asked whether defendant had heard his directions. Defendant said he had, but that he did not have to follow the rules. Westmoreland then decided to take defendant down to the sergeant\u2019s office to resolve the wristband issue, so he ordered defendant to turn around and put his hands on the wall, intending to place him in handcuffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">When defendant refused to comply with the officer\u2019s commands, Officer Westmoreland reached for defendant\u2019s right hand. Defendant pulled away, shouting, \u201cdon\u2019t fuckin\u2019 touch me. I\u2019m a civilian. I don\u2019t have to follow your rules.\u201d When Westmoreland reached for defendant\u2019s hand a second time, defendant knocked the officer\u2019s arm away and slapped him in the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">A struggle ensued on defendant\u2019s bed, after which defendant ran out of his cell and down the hall. Officer Westmoreland gave chase and when he reached defendant in front of the nurse\u2019s station, defendant punched him in the chest three or four times. Westmoreland finally gained control over defendant and immobilized him until other officers arrived on the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">I. Sufficiency of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">Defendant argues there was insufficient evidence to prove that Officer Westmoreland was a \u201ccustodial officer\u201d for purposes of section 243.1 and, thus, his conviction for battery upon a custodial officer must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">On appeal \u201cthe court must review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment below to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence\u2014that is, evidence which is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\u2014such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(People v. Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 578 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>[162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738].) Substantial evidence includes circumstantial evidence and the reasonable inferences flowing therefrom. <em>(In re James D. </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 810, 813 [172 Cal.Rptr. 321].)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Section 243.1 states: \u201cWhen a battery is committed against the person of a <em>custodial officer as defined in Section 831 of the Penal Code, </em>and the person committing the offense knows or reasonably should know that the victim is a custodial officer engaged in the performance of his or her duties, and the custodial officer is engaged in the performance of his or her duties, the offense shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\u201cUnder section 831, a custodial officer is (1) a public officer, not a peace officer; (2) employed by a law enforcement agency of a city or county; (3) who has the authority and responsibility for maintaining custody of prisoners and performing tasks related to the operation of a local detention facility used for the detention of persons usually pending arraignment or upon court order either for their own safekeeping or the specific purpose of serving a sentence.\u201d <em>(People v. Garcia </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 887, 894 [223 Cal.Rptr. 884] <em>(Garcia).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Officer Westmoreland clearly satisfied the first element. Under the California Constitution, \u201c \u2018Public officer and employee\u2019 includes every officer and employee of the State, including the University of California, every county, city, city and county, district, and authority, including any department, division, bureau, board, commission, agency, or instrumentality of any of the foregoing.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 3.) Since Westmoreland was an employee of the Shasta County Sheriff\u2019s Office, he was a \u201cpublic officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Furthermore, Officer Westmoreland was not a \u201cpeace officer.\u201d Section 830 states, in relevant part, \u201cno person other than those designated in this chapter is a peace officer.\u201d It is undisputed that Westmoreland did not fit within any of the definitions of peace officers listed in section 830 et seq. <em>(Garcia, supra, </em>178 Cal.App.3d at pp. 894\u2014896.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Because Officer Westmoreland was employed by the Shasta County Sheriff\u2019s Office, he also satisfied the second element, i.e., employment by a law enforcement agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">The last requirement is that the officer have \u201cthe authority and responsibility for maintaining custody of prisoners and performs tasks related to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>operation of a local detention facility used for the detention of persons usually pending arraignment or upon court order either for their own safekeeping or for the specific purpose of serving a sentence therein.\u201d (\u00a7831, subd. (a).) This element \u201crelates to the officer\u2019s tasks and responsibilities.\u201d <em>(Garcia, supra, </em>178 Cal.App.3d at p. 896.) Officer Westmoreland was a correctional officer in a county jail. During the incident at issue, Westmoreland was in charge of the medical ward of the jail, where defendant was confined in a holding cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Based on the foregoing, a reasonable jury could find that Officer Westmoreland satisfied all three elements necessary to qualify him as a \u201ccustodial officer\u201d within the meaning of section 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Defendant insists, however, that because he was a civil committee rather than a prisoner, Officer Westmoreland could not have been a \u201ccustodial officer\u201d within the meaning of the statute. The argument lacks merit because, instead of focusing on the class of victims the statute seeks to protect, defendant focuses on his own status. As stated in <em>In re Rochelle B. </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1212, 1217-1218 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 851] <em>(Rochelle B.), </em>\u201cthe Legislature has created . . . laws enhancing punishment for different <em>classes of victims, </em>including \u2018custodial officers,\u2019 with the apparent purpose of giving <em>added protection to such potential </em>victims.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Were we to accept defendant\u2019s suggestion that the classification of the <em>attacker </em>is dispositive, this legislative goal could be defeated. For example, suppose a visitor at the jail physically attacked Officer Westmoreland while he was escorting defendant to his cell. No one could seriously claim that because the visitor was not a \u201cprisoner,\u201d he could not be found guilty of battery upon a custodial officer in the performance of his duties within the meaning of section 243.1. Likewise, regardless of the technical fine points of defendant\u2019s inmate status, there is no question Westmoreland was performing supervisory duties as a custodial officer in a detention facility when the attack occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Defendant relies on <em>Rochelle B. </em>to argue that a person who is not a <em>criminal </em>detainee cannot be convicted under section 243.1. Specifically, he zeroes in on the appellate court\u2019s statement that \u201cappellant was not a \u2018prisoner.\u2019 Therefore, the victim in this case was not a \u2018custodial officer\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>under section 831.\u201d <em>(Rochelle B., supra, </em>49 Cal.App.4th at p. 1222.) However, this quote is taken out of context and distorts the true holding of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">In <em>Rochelle B., </em>the minor, a juvenile ward held in juvenile hall, was convicted under section 243.1 for attacking a juvenile probation counselor. <em>(Rochelle B., supra, </em>49 Cal.App.4th at p. 1214.) The court addressed the issue of whether a probation counselor employed in a juvenile hall should be considered a \u201ccustodial officer\u201d for purposes of section 243.1. <em>(Rochelle B., </em>at p. 1215.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">In reaching its decision, the court in <em>Rochelle B. </em>sought to determine whether \u201cjuvenile wards\u201d are considered \u201cprisoners\u201d when held in a juvenile facility. The court concluded that because juvenile halls were not penal institutions and the counselor did not have authority or responsibility for maintaining \u201cprisoners,\u201d she was not a \u201ccustodial officer\u201d within the meaning of section 243.1. <em>(Rochelle B., supra, </em>49 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1221, 1222.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">There are two important distinctions between <em>Rochelle B. </em>and this case. First, in <em>Rochelle B., </em>the minor was held at a juvenile detention facility, not an adult penal institution. The <em>Rochelle B. </em>court noted that while section 831 does not refer to \u201c \u2018juveniles\u2019 or \u2018juvenile detention facilities,\u2019 \u201d both the statute and its legislative history make reference to jails and prisoners. <em>(Rochelle B., supra, </em>49 Cal.App.4th at p. 1217.) Here, defendant was in custody in a <em>jail </em>which held <em>prisoners.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Second, the victim in <em>Rochelle B. </em>was a juvenile probation counselor. There was no evidence that her responsibilities included \u201cmaintaining custody of prisoners,\u201d as section 831 requires. By contrast, Officer Westmoreland was employed as a correctional officer at a county jail and his duties included \u201cmaintaining custody of prisoners and performing] tasks related to the operation of a local detention facility ....\u201d(\u00a7 831, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">For all these reasons, we reject defendant\u2019s challenge to the jury\u2019s implied finding that Officer Westmoreland was a \u201ccustodial officer\u201d within the meaning of sections 243.1 and 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">II., III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Sims, Acting P.

Instead, the jury was read the following stipulation: \u201cOn or about April 18, 2009, defendant was lawfully in custody as a civil committee relating to another matter and was required to follow jail rules and procedures pertinent to civil committeefs].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-10\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 322.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
