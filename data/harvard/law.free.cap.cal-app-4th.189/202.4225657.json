INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">Defendant Raelene Elvera Jahansson was charged by information with one felony, possession of a controlled substance (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11377, subd. (a)), and two misdemeanors, using or being under the influence of methamphetamine (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11550, subd. (a)) and possession of a hypodermic needle or syringe (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 4140). The trial court subsequently granted defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence pursuant to Penal Code section 1538.5.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The People challenged the trial court\u2019s order by filing a petition for writ of mandate in this court. After the writ petition was summarily denied, the People advised the trial court that they were unable to proceed due to the suppression of the evidence. The trial court then dismissed the case under section 1385.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">In the published portion of the opinion, we determine that the People\u2019s appeal is not barred by their prior petition for a writ of mandate. In the unpublished portion of the opinion, following the direction of <em>People v. Glaser </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 354 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 425, 902 P.2d 729], we conclude that under the circumstances of this case, the defendant\u2019s initial detention outside the premises to be searched was lawful incident to the probation search of the premises, but her continued detention in handcuffs was not reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. <em>(People v. Stier </em>(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 21 [85 Cal.Rptr.3d 77] <em>(Stier).) </em>We will therefore affirm the dismissal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">Our summary of the relevant facts, which are essentially undisputed, is taken from the transcript of the April 21, 2009 evidentiary hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>The sole witness at the hearing on the motion to suppress evidence was Bret Moiseff, a police officer for the City of San Jose. At the time of the search and seizure at issue in this case, Officer Moiseff was assigned to the Santa Clara County Specialized Enforcement Team, which investigates drug sale offenses. On September 9, 2008, Officer Moiseff was involved in the surveillance of a house at 105 Morrow Court in San Jose. The police surveillance was being conducted because Officer Moiseff had received information that the resident, Bob Hatzenpiller, was selling methamphetamine to \u201cpersons that would come and go from the [Morrow Court house].\u201d Officer Moiseff was also aware that Hatzenpiller was on probation with a search condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">While Officer Moiseff was surveilling the house at 105 Morrow Court about 3:00 p.m. he observed \u201ca Hispanic male\u201d park several houses away, then walk towards the house while making a cell phone call. The man \u201cstayed a short time at the [Morrow Court house], and then walked back to his car, looking around in an excited and/or determined manner as he walked, paused, and ultimately returned to his car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Officer Moiseff then observed defendant and a male companion park their car in front of the house at 105 Morrow Court. One or both of them got out of the car, walked towards the front door of the house, and did not return to their car for about 20 to 30 minutes. Although Officer Moiseff did not see defendant and her male companion go into the house, because he did not have a view of the front door, he testified that \u201cboth went to . . . what appeared to be into the residence, or at least to the front of the residence out of my sight. It was over the course of the next 20 to 30 minutes where one, if not both, to the best of my recollection, went to and from the car, appearing to be either bringing items to or from the vehicle back to the house, before ultimately both departed.\u201d Officer Moiseff also observed that either defendant or her companion was carrying a duffelbag or backpack.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">After defendant and her companion drove away, Officer Moiseff continued his surveillance of 105 Morrow Court. Shortly after 4:00 p.m., Officer Moiseff saw Hatzenpiller leave the house and walk towards a nearby strip mall. As he was walking, Hatzenpiller was detained by other agents working with Officer Moiseff. While Hatzenpiller was detained, Officer Moiseff spoke with him in preparation for the probation search that was about to be conducted at 105 Morrow Court. Based on his experience in the investigation of methamphetamine possession and sale, Officer Moiseff wanted to know whether the officers would confront any persons in the house who could arm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>themselves, destroy evidence, or interfere with the search. He was also concerned that persons outside the residence might have access to a cell phone and alert persons inside the house. Hatzenpiller told Officer Moiseff that there was at least one other person in the house and volunteered the information that \u201cthere was methamphetamine in his residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">After learning from Hatzenpiller that there was methamphetamine in the house at 105 Morrow Court, Officer Moiseff and the other officers decided to walk back to secure the house for the probation search. At that time, Officer Moiseff was particularly concerned about officer safety while conducting the probation search at 105 Morrow Court because he \u201chad seen persons come and go, and it was clear that several persons had been visiting him and/or staying there . . . .\u201d His officer safety concerns were also based on Hatzenpiller telling him that there was at one least other person and methamphetamine in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">While they were approaching the house on foot, Officer Moiseff saw defendant and her male companion return, about 40 or 50 minutes after they had left, and park \u201cin front of the residence, slight offset from the residence, but still in the same area of the house with the same persons in the vehicle.\u201d Officer Moiseff and the other officers, who were wearing police jerseys, decided that they needed to \u201cpick up the pace\u201d because defendant and her companion could see them and the officers did not know who they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Officer Moiseff had several concerns after seeing defendant and her companion return to the vicinity of 105 Morrow Court. In addition to his concerns about the other person and the methamphetamine in the house, he was now also concerned about defendant and her companion, whom he described as \u201cpersons who I believe were associated with the residence, whether they are tenants, co-conspirators, customers, or friends, whatever they may be, were now in a position to see [us] and be in contact with the residence; whether it\u2019s via cell phone, or simply walking to the residence, because they were closer than we were .... They had a head start, if you will, if they wanted to run, which they didn\u2019t. They stayed at the car.\u201d Also, Officer Moiseff noticed that defendant\u2019s car did not have any license plates.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Because Officer Moiseff believed that defendant and her companion \u201cwere involved and/or could thwart our investigation and subsequent search,\u201d he walked directly to defendant\u2019s car with the other officers, identified himself as a police officer, and told defendant and her companion that he and the other officers were conducting a probation search and they would be detained until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>the officers could secure the residence. Next, Officer Moiseff \u201casked both of them out of the vehicle and directed their detention at the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">During Officer Moiseff s initial one-minute contact with defendant, she was cooperative and he did not notice any symptoms indicating that she was under the influence of drugs. Nevertheless, defendant and her companion were immediately put in handcuffs. The reason for the handcuffing was \u201cto prevent them from doing anything that could thwart the safety of [the officers] making contact at the residence, [ft] [Officer Moiseff] didn\u2019t know their association to the house; whether they were tenants, occupants, co-conspirators, friends, associates, [ft] [He] didn\u2019t know if either one had cellular phones on them, which people normally do these days.\u201d Officer Moiseff then asked another officer to stand by defendant and her companion as he and the other officers continued walking towards the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">After detaining defendant and her companion in handcuffs, Officer Moiseff knocked on the front door of the two-story house and with the other officers entered and conducted a protective sweep that lasted \u201cbetween five and ten minutes.\u201d They found a woman lying on a couch and a loft containing a \u201cmakeshift marijuana cultivation area.\u201d After completing the protective sweep, Officer Moiseff returned to defendant and her companion, who were then being detained in handcuffs \u201ccloser towards the patio area of the front door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">At that point, Officer Moiseff had a second conversation with defendant and her companion, in which he was \u201ctrying to determine their involvement with the house.\u201d During that conversation, Officer Moiseff observed that defendant displayed symptoms consistent with being under the influence of a controlled substance, including a nervous and excited demeanor, a fragmented speech pattern, and a dry mouth. Another officer found that defendant also had a rapid pulse.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Having determined that defendant was under the influence of a controlled substance, Officer Moiseff arrested her for violating Health and Safety Code section 11550, subdivision (a). He also asked her if he could search her vehicle and defendant said, \u201cYes.\u201d The items found during the search of defendant\u2019s car included a Kleenex box containing syringes. Defendant admitted that she had methamphetamine in her possession, which was found during a subsequent search of her person by female officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">IH. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">The felony complaint filed on September 15, 2008, charged defendant with a felony, possession of methamphetamine (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11377, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>subd. (a); count 1) and two misdemeanors, using or being under the influence of methamphetamine (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11550, subd. (a); count 2) and possession of a hypodermic needle or syringe (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 4140; count 3). After a preliminary hearing, defendant was held to answer on all charges. The information was filed on January 15, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">On April 6, 2009, defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence under section 1538.5 that sought an order suppressing all evidence obtained as a result of the search and seizure on September 9, 2008, including any statements by defendant, any officer observations, the results of any chemical or laboratory analysis, and any item found in defendant\u2019s possession. Defendant generally asserted that the warrantless search and seizure violated the Fourth Amendment, under the procedure set forth in <em>People v. Williams </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 119, 130 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 275, 973 P.2d 52].</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">In their opposition to the motion to suppress evidence, the People argued that the warrantless search of defendant\u2019s person and car did not violate the Fourth Amendment because defendant\u2019s initial detention was lawful. The People explained that the police officers had a reasonable suspicion that defendant was involved in criminal activity, since she had been observed walking to and from a house where, the officers had been informed, several customers came daily to purchase methamphetamine. The People also pointed to the absence of license plates on defendant\u2019s car as an additional reason to detain and investigate defendant. Alternatively, the People argued that defendant\u2019s initial detention was justified on the ground of officer safety during a protective sweep. The continued detention of defendant after Officer Moiseff observed that she was under the influence of a controlled substance was also lawful, the People argued, because at that point probable cause existed to place defendant under a warrantless custodial arrest. Finally, the People maintained that defendant had consented to the search of her car.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">In her reply, defendant contended that Officer Moiseff could not have had a reasonable suspicion that she was involved in criminal activity, or any reason to handcuff her, because he only had a \u201cgeneralized suspicion that anyone associating with Mr. Hatzenpiller may be doing something illegal\u201d and other officers were aware that her car had a temporary registration. Defendant also rejected the People\u2019s claim that her detention was lawful as incident to a protective sweep, on the ground that she had given the officers no reason to believe that she posed a danger or would interfere with their investigation. Moreover, defendant denied that she had voluntarily consented to the search of her car, since she had been placed in handcuffs before the officer requested her consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The trial court granted the motion to suppress evidence on April 28, 2009. The court also ordered that the evidence to be suppressed included the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>methamphetamine found on defendant\u2019s person, the observations of defendant after her detention, the results of intoxication and laboratory tests, and the syringes found in defendant\u2019s car. After granting the motion and ordering the suppression of evidence, the trial court noted that, as of April 28, 2009, the matter remained on the master trial calendar \u201cto allow the People to evaluate their case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">The trial court\u2019s ruling from the bench also included the court\u2019s finding that defendant\u2019s detention was unlawful: \u201c[W]hat troubles me is, there was no warrant in this case. It was a probationary search. So there was just some information the officers had that the resident of the home was selling methamphetamine. So we don\u2019t even know the quality of the information. We don\u2019t need to know the quality of the information, because it was a probationary search. The officers didn\u2019t really even need a reason to go in. And I think that your argument would be valid about the defendant being tied to the home if there had been a stronger evidence of drug sales, had there been a search warrant, or even an arrest warrant. But I think that it breaks down just because ... of the purpose of the officer\u2019s entry into the home. And that\u2019s what troubles me.\u201d The court noted, however, that \u201c[tjhis is a close one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">On May 27, 2009, the People filed a petition for writ of mandate in this court, in which they sought a writ vacating the trial court\u2019s order granting defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence and directing the court to enter a new order denying the motion. This court summarily denied the People\u2019s writ petition on June 15, 2009.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">After their writ petition was denied, the People announced in open court on June 22, 2009, that they were unable to proceed in this matter \u201c[bjased upon the motion to suppress and the ultimate suppression of the evidence.\u201d The trial court immediately dismissed the case. The People subsequently filed a notice of appeal from the dismissal order on July 8, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">A. <em>Appealability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">We will first consider the threshold issue of appealability. Defendant contends that the People\u2019s appeal is procedurally barred because this court summarily denied the People\u2019s petition for writ of mandate that had previously challenged the trial court\u2019s order granting the motion to suppress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>evidence. According to defendant, the plain language of section 1538.5, subdivision (j) (hereafter, section 1538.5(j)), authorizes the People to seek appellate review of an order granting a suppression motion, but requires the People to elect review either by writ or by appeal and does not allow \u201ctwo bites of the appellate apple.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Our analysis begins with an overview of the People\u2019s right to appeal. It is well established that \u201c[t]he prosecution\u2019s right to appeal in a criminal case is strictly limited by statute. [Citation.] Long-standing authority requires adherence to these limits even though \u2018the People may thereby suffer a wrong without a remedy.\u2019 [Citation]. The circumstances allowing a People\u2019s appeal are enumerated in section 1238.\u201d <em>(People v. Chacon </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 558, 564 [53 Cal.Rptr.3d 876, 150 P.3d 755]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 817, 823-824 [28 Cal.Rptr.3d 29, 110 P.3d 1239].) Relevant to this case, section 1238, subdivision (a)(7) authorizes the People\u2019s appeal from \u201c[a]n order dismissing a case prior to trial made upon motion of the court pursuant to Section 1385 whenever such order is based upon an order granting the defendant\u2019s motion to return or suppress property or evidence made at a special hearing as provided in this code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The Penal Code also allows the People to seek writ review of an order granting a motion to suppress evidence. Section 1538.5, subdivision <em>(o) </em>provides, \u201cWithin 30 days after a defendant\u2019s motion is granted at a special hearing in a felony case, the people may file a petition for writ of mandate or prohibition in the court of appeal, seeking appellate review of the ruling regarding the search or seizure motion.\u201d The California Supreme Court has stated that section 1538.5 \u201cnow provides multiple opportunities for immediate review by both parties of rulings on motions to suppress. ... In felony cases, the People can petition for writ if the prosecution has not been dismissed on motion of the superior court pursuant to section 1385 (\u00a7 1538.5, subd. <em>(o)), </em>and can appeal if it has (\u00a7 1238, subd. (a)(7)) . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Laiwa </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 711, 717 [195 Cal.Rptr. 503, 669 P.2d 1278], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The issue of whether the People may seek appellate review of an order granting a motion to suppress evidence by both appeal and writ\u2014first by a writ petition that is summarily denied, followed by an appeal from the dismissal order based upon the same suppression order\u2014arises from the following language in section 1538.5(j): \u201cIf the [P]eople prosecute review by appeal or writ to decision, or any review thereof, in a felony or misdemeanor case, it shall be binding upon them.\u201d We observe that there is a split of authority as to the meaning of the word \u201cdecision\u201d in section 1538.5(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">In <em>People v. Carrington </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 647 [115 Cal.Rptr. 294] <em>(Carrington), </em>the appellate court determined that the People were required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>elect between writ review and review on appeal. The court reasoned that \u201c[a] denial of a writ petition, without an opinion, is a decision for other purposes specified in the Rules on Appeal ([former] rule 24, Cal. Rules of Court). The denial of the People\u2019s petition for a writ contesting a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion to suppress evidence means resolution of the issue based on a full record of the evidence presented at the hearing on the motion. Appellate courts do not deny such petitions without consideration. Therefore, a denial by minute order of a petition by the People constitutes review by \u2018writ to decision\u2019 within the meaning of section 1538.5, subdivision (j); the result is binding on the People.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 650.) The <em>Carrington </em>court further stated, \u201cIf the People desire a written opinion, they may appeal after a dismissal instead of petitioning for a writ. But they may not exercise both remedies.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 651.)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">However, no published decision has followed <em>Carrington </em>since its publication in 1974. We find that <em>Carrington </em>represents the minority view in light of subsequent appellate court decisions that have rejected the <em>Carrington </em>court\u2019s reasoning. The majority view is set forth in <em>People </em>v. <em>Allison </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1084 [249 Cal.Rptr. 218] <em>(Allison), </em>where the court determined that denial of a writ petition without opinion does not constitute a decision on the merits unless there is an affirmative indication that the denial was on the merits. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1087.) The <em>Allison </em>court therefore ruled that its prior denial by minute order of the People\u2019s writ petition challenging an order suppressing evidence did not preclude review of the same suppression order on appeal. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1086.) The court concluded, \u201cHere we denied the People\u2019s petition for writ of mandate without opinion and as an act of discretionary denial. That appellate order does not conclusively evidence that denial was upon the merits and so, it neither bars nor governs this decision [on appeal]. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1088; accord, <em>People v. Amaya </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 424, 427, fn. 1 [155 Cal.Rptr. 783] [appeal decided on the merits after summary denial of People\u2019s writ petition challenging suppression order]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Schmidt </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 968, 973 [148 Cal.Rptr. 426] [denial of People\u2019s writ petition without opinion does not preclude a subsequent appeal challenging suppression order]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Paris </em>(1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 766, 769-770 [122 Cal.Rptr. 272] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">We agree with the majority view that summary denial of the People\u2019s writ petition challenging a suppression order does not preclude a subsequent appeal from a dismissal order based on that suppression order. Our determination is supported by the California Supreme Court\u2019s rulings regarding the procedural effect of summary denial of a writ petition. In <em>People v. Medina </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 484 [99 Cal.Rptr. 630, 492 P.2d 686] <em>(Medina), </em>the court determined, in the context of a defendant\u2019s appeal, that because \u201cthe appellate court\u2019s denial without opinion of defendant\u2019s . . . pretrial writ [petition] cannot properly be deemed a conclusive decision on the merits, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>defendant is entitled to an appellate court\u2019s determination of his [or her] search and seizure contention \u2018in writing with reasons stated\u2019 (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 14), we must now decide the merits of that contention.\u201d <em>(Medina, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 493.)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The California Supreme Court subsequently cited that ruling in <em>Medina </em>with approval in <em>Kowis v. Howard </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 888 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 728, 838 P.2d 250] <em>(Kowis), </em>which addressed the issue of \u201cwhen, if ever, summary denial of a pretrial petition for extraordinary relief establishes law of the case precluding reconsideration of the issue on appeal following final judgment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 891.) The court stated, \u201cIn <em>[Medina], supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at page 490, we expressed concern that if a summary denial of a writ petition established law of the case precluding consideration of the issue on appeal, then such \u2018pretrial writ review would become useless for no well-advised defendant would invoke that provision at the risk of losing the right to be heard at oral argument and to have the merits of his [or her] constitutional contention decided by a written opinion.\u2019 The same concern applies here. The parties should not be penalized for seeking pretrial review. If a writ petition is given full review by issuance of an alternative writ, the opportunity for oral argument, and a written opinion, the parties have received all of the rights and consideration accorded a normal appeal. Granting the resulting opinion law of the case status as if it had been an appellate decision is appropriate. But if the denial followed a less rigorous procedure, it should not establish law of the case.\u201c <em>(Id. </em>at p. 899.)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The <em>Kowis </em>court therefore ruled that \u201c[a] summary denial of a writ petition does not establish law of the case whether or not that denial is intended to be on the merits or is based on some other reason.\u201d <em>(Kowis, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 899.) Our Supreme Court affirmed its ruling in <em>Kowis </em>in <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1999) 19 Cal.4th 1232 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 85, 970 P.2d 872], noting that \u201c[o]ne of the policy reasons supporting our holding was that a contrary rule would prevent the losing party from having an opportunity for oral argument on the issues raised in the [writ] petition.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1259.)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">It is therefore well established under California Supreme Court authority that summary denial of a party\u2019s writ petition does not constitute law of the case and therefore does not preclude that party from seeking review on appeal, with the opportunity for oral argument and a written opinion, of the issues that were raised in the writ petition. <em>(Medina, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 493; <em>Kowis, supra, </em>3 Cal.4th at p. 891; <em>Lewis v. Superior Court, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 1259.) This rule is consistent with the majority view that summary denial of the People\u2019s writ petition challenging an order granting a motion to suppress evidence does not constitute a \u201cdecision\u201d within the meaning of section 1538.5(j) and therefore does not preclude a subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>appeal of the dismissal order based on the suppression order. We therefore determine that the People\u2019s appeal in the instant case is not barred by the summary denial of their writ petition, and we will decide the appeal on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">For the guidance of the parties and the trial court, we will review the options for appellate review that are available to the People where the order granting the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence has resulted in the People\u2019s inability to proceed with the prosecution. As one appellate court has stated, the \u201ctwo methods for seeking appellate review are tailored to fit the two postures in which the People might find themselves following a successful motion to suppress evidence. In the first posture, the People have sufficient evidence to go forward despite the suppression of some evidence. Writ review would then be the preferable form of appellate review because it permits a speedy inspection of the trial court\u2019s ruling. ...[][] In the second posture, the People are unable to go forward without the suppressed evidence. In this situation, the People announce this fact to the trial court with the expectation that the matter will be dismissed on the court\u2019s own motion under section 1385. The People may then bring an appeal (although they are not required to)____\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bonds </em>(1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 732, 738-739 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 10].)</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Writ relief is rarely granted where appellate remedies are adequate. (See, e.g., <em>In re Antilia </em>(2009) 176 Cal.App.4th 622, 630 [97 Cal.Rptr.3d 849] [writ will not be issued if the challenged order is directly appealable or if appeal from a final judgment provides an adequate remedy].) Therefore, a writ petition challenging a trial court\u2019s suppression order, where that order has resulted in the People\u2019s inability to go forward without the suppressed evidence and the trial court may issue an appealable dismissal order under section 1385, is unlikely to succeed because there is an adequate appellate remedy. In those circumstances, a writ petition may unnecessarily consume the resources of both the court and the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">Having determined, however, that the People\u2019s appeal in this case is not procedurally barred, we will turn to the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">B. <em>The Motion to Suppress </em>Evidence<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>V.
