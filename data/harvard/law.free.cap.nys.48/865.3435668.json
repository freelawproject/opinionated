Proe. \u00a7 2401, to review a subsequent order of the surrogate\u2019s court, denying, in the exercise of its discretion, a motion by the executor to vacate and set aside the original order.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b883-11\">Appeal from order of surrogate, Kockland county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b883-12\">In the matter of Erastus Van Houten, as executor of Edward G-.

The executor appeals from an order of the surrogate.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b884-4\">On the 4th day of January, 1897, a decree was made by the surrogate\u2019s court of Rockand county settling and adjusting the accounts of the appellant, as executor. On the 18th day of January, 1897, order was made by the surrogate\u2019s court revoking the letters testamentary of the appellant, and directing him to turn over certain assets to his co-executors. On the 3d day of February, 1897, an order was made by the surrogate adjudging the appellant executor to be in contempt for not complying with the directions of the preceding order, and fining him the sum of 33,144.94. Appeals were taken from each of said orders, and the appellate division reversed the decree upon the accounting (46 N. Y. Supp. 190), reversed the order of January 18th so far as it revoked the letters of the executor (45 N. Y. Supp. 836), and affirmed the contempt order (46 N. Y. Supp. 350). After such affirmance the appellant moved before the surrogate, upon the papers in the contempt matter and the determination of the appellate division upon the said appeals, for an order vacating the contempt order. The surrogate denied this application, his written opinion stating that, \u201cif the order is to be modified, * * * I think it should be done by the appellate tribunal which has affirmed it.\u201d From the order then made, this appeal was taken.</headnotes>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AR2\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b884-6\">Argued before GOODRICH, P.

The provisions of section 2481 of the Code of Civil Procedure do not provide for a review by this court of the order of the surrogate in such a case as the present. In re Tilden, 98 N. Y. 434; In re Hawley, 100 N. Y. 206, 3 N. E. 68; Matter of Hodgman\u2019s Estate, 82 Hun, 419, 31 N. Y. Supp. 263. The power is wholly with the surrogate\u2019s court. There does not appear to have been any abuse of discretion by the surrogate\u2019s court in the denial of the motion, and a review of his order is not provided for by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-10\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
