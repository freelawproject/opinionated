We agree, with the learned court as to the first and third \"grounds of demurrer. This question was presented to this court in th\u00e9 case of Bischoff v. Engel, 10 App. Div, 243, 41 N. Y. Supp, 817. Mr.,Justice Barrett, in delivering \u00a1the opinion of the court there, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">\u201cThe general rule is now .undoubtedly, well -Settled that the, sureties-.upon the bond of .an ,executor-or administrator are notifiable until -the default;o\u00a3 their .principal has .been established, before the, surrogate.. But exceptional circumstances may exist,, sufficient .to warrant-the .interposition \u00abf a court of equity without the prior: establishment of this default, and to secure there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the establi&amp;hhfeiit; of such' default .with, as a \u2019sequence/ an appropriate judgment -against the sureties.\u201d ;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">It was there held that in a case where the administrator has converted' the estate to, his own use,\"has;squandered the\" proceeds of his conversion in a foreign state, has died there penniless, and has no personal representatives subject :to our jurisdiction, an action may \"b\u00e9\" maintained in the supreme court without a preliminary accounting before the surrogate, and that a judgment directing an accounting to ascertain for what part of the Sum he was liable, after 'allowing all just credits, and directing judgment for the sureties of the plaintiff against the sureties of the administrator for his share of the balance found to be chargeable against the administrator, was 'proper, and should tie affirmed. The fdcts alleged in the complaint and admitted by the answer are brought directly within the principle of,this case'. \" Here it is alleged that the administratrix collected the moneys of the estate, and appropriated them to her own use, and ha's either absconded from the state, or keeps' herself so concealed \u2018within tins state that the plaintiff is unable to serve her with process issuing tint of any of the courts of this state, of in any other way get jurisdiction over the said Sophia Froschle for the purpose of compelling her to account as such administratrix, These facts being admitted, no accounting before the surrogate was possible, except by reinoving the administratrix, and appointing another in her place; and as such administrator de bonis non would only be responsible for the property coming, into \"Ms hands, \"and as the complaint alleges that the administratrix collected all of the property of the deceased, such administrator de bonis non would receive no property of the deceased, and an accounting against Mm would be a mere idle ceremony. Upon\" these allegations of the complaint, admitted by the demurrer,, the. surrogate\u2019s court \"could obtain no jurisdiction of the person .of the administratrix, to compel an accounting. The allegation, \"whibh is admitted, is that, in consequence of the disappearance of the, said administratrix, the plaintiff is unable, by diligence of reasonable\" effect, t,o serve upon, her process issuing out of any of the\" courts of this state, or in any other way to get jurisdiction over the said Sophia FroscMe for the purpose of compelling her,.td acc.ohrit ad ,su,ch\",administratrix. .This is. a fact.allege^ and admitted, and, in the absence of any property upon which a judgment of this,court.could act, it is quite.clear that no judgment against the administratrix, after service, of. process', upon her by, publica-, tipil,, or by substituted service, would tie of anv advantage to the plaintiff, In the case of Schwinger v. Hickok, 53 N. Y. 285, Andrews, J., in delivering \"the opinion of the court, says: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">\u201cThe \u00a1jurisdiction to proceed by publication against a nonresident citizen attaches pnly..wh\u00e9j\u00f1 he, <em>pfis </em>.property,in the state, .or .the suit- has relation to property'therein in Which he has \"or cl\u00e1ims an interest. The \"legislature .could perhaps have declared that judgment obt\u00e1i\u00edi\u00e9d-' ug\u00e1i\u00fast a h\u00f3nresident upon Service'by\"pUhli\u00f1\u00e1tioii -niight &gt;be!!enforced against '\u00ab11 property 'Of the defendant within The state.\u2019 i Brito ti judgment would' -be' in'.rein, and= wbnld inipose no personal liability''upon thei'defendanti The' 'statute undei which \u25a0 publica-* fion &gt;in this case-\u2019Xvasj'made does not undertake, to. make the judgment, oht\u00e1i\u00fced'. in The (pr\u00f3needtogs'i ai 'general, lien- upori tbe'propertyi.'of thfeidef cridante</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>\u25a0 See, also,. McKinney v. Collins, 88 1ST. Y. 220, and Bank v. Parent, 13-4 N. Y. 530, 31 N. EL 976. In Bryan v. Publishing Co., 112 N. Y. 385,19 N, E, 825, the court say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">\u201cUnless a cause of action arises witliin the state, or the defendant has property therein, and the court has jurisdiction over the subject of the action, neither the person nor property of a defendant could be affected by any judgment the court might, render. He could neither be punished for contempt in failing to obey its order, nor his estate he sold by reason of it. The jurisdiction of the court is limited by the boundaries of the state, and its process could not go beyond them. * * The court can give no relief,, and the impropriety of issuing an order, which, if it leads to a judgment, \u2018would, operate on nothing in the state, and be regarded by nobody out of it/ becomes apparent. It offends every principle by which the jurisdiction of a court can be vindicated, and should not be allowed to stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">While here the cause of action arose within the state; the appropriation by the administratrix of all the property of the deceased, and her absconding from the state, or keeping herself so concealed therein that no service of process can be made upon her personally, would prevent the plaintiff from recovering a judgment against her which could be enforced in any way that would aid the defendants. Making her a party to such an action, and serving a summons upon her, by substituted service, could result in no judgment that could be of any practical use, and would seem to be an idle ceremony.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">We think, therefore, that the judgment sustaining the demurrer should be reversed, and judgment entered overruling the demurrer, with leave to the defendant to answer within 20 days, upon payment of the costs in the court below and in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">VAN BRUNT, P. J., and WILLIAMS, J., concur. . PATTERSON, J., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b327-9\">O\u2019BRIEN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqd9\">(concurring). One of the essential facts upon which the action must be predicated is the inability to serve the administrator or administratrix. If it should be held that the administratrix here was a necessary party, then this action could not be maintained; for it would presuppose that she could be brought within the jurisdiction of the court by some kind of service; and, if she could, then an accounting could be compelled, and a direct action against the bondsmen in the first instance would not lie. To repeat, therefore, it is because she \"cannot he brought within the jurisdiction and compelled to account that this action is permissible, and it would defeat such an action to hold that she was a necessary party. I therefore concur in the conclusion reached by Mr. Justice IN-GRAHAM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
