The claim was filed within six months, as provided by the act. The findings of the commissioners, so far as material, are: \u201cFirst. * * * That said claimants have satisfactorily established before us ownership of said premises; that a motion was \u25a0duly made by claimants to amend the notice of claim herein so as to read, \u2018Henry Zubiller and Louis Schaefer, as administrators with the will annexed of the estate of John F. Koeher, deceased,\u2019 instead of \u2018Henry Zubiller and Louis Schaefer, executors,\u2019 which motion was duly granted. * * * Fourth. That, upon the evidence presented, we award, as just and equitable damages, under the circumstances of this case, to the said Henry Zubiller and Louis Schaefer, as administrators with the will annexed of the estate of John F. Koeher, deceased, the sum of,\u201d etc. It is conceded with respect to the title of this property that John F. Koeher died seised in fee of the same on January 6, 1891. He devised the property to his wife, Blargaret Koeher, for life, with remainder to his children, who were minors. Blargaret ICocher, the wife, died in April, 1892, and the life estate thus terminated. But she nominated Henry Zubiller, George Koeher, and Louis Schaefer as her executors, and also guardians of the persons and estates of her infant children; and they subsequently qualified as testamentary guardians under her will. Thus, before the passage of the act of 1893 the title to this property was vested in fee in the children, as tenants in common. The children are still living.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1084-6\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

It is certain that the \u25a0claim, as filed, did not conform to the act, because the claimants, Henry Zubiller and Louis Schaefer, must be regarded, legally, as \u2022strangers to the title. They were administrators with the will annexed of the original owner, executors of the will of the life tenant, .and guardians, under the will of the mother, of the infant children remaining. But in neither of these capacities did they take any title to, or become owners of, the property. It is admitted by the return that these claimants never had title to the property in question, \u201cexcept as guardians as aforesaid.\u201d But the guardians have not title to the infants\u2019 property. Furthermore, the commissioners made the award to the claimants as administrators, instead of as guardians;- and, if that determination is to stand, their rights as guardians are not strictly involved. It was said in the case of People v. Lord, 9 App. Div. 460, 41 N. Y. Supp. 343, which involved a claim before these same commissioners, and a construction of the acts in question upon another point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-10\">\u201cThe acts are themselves remedial, and should be liberally construed People v. Fitch, 147 N. Y. 355, 41 N. E. 695. Such legislation, as was said in People v. Zoll, 97 N. Y. 203, \u2018should receive a just and liberal construction which will tend to advance the remedy.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1084-11\">The difficulty here, however, is that no construction, however lib\u2022eral, which would stop short of an attempt on our part to make new -legislation, could aid the respondents. The act expressly limits the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>right to file a claim, and to prove and recover damages, to \u201cpersons owning land\u201d; and it is admitted by the return that these claimants never had any title to the property in question, \u201cexcept as guardians as aforesaid.\u201d But the guardians, as such, have no title to the infants\u2019 property. Apart from this, as the commissioners have made the award to the claimants as administrators, instead of as guardians, their rights as guardians are not involved. Whether we regard the claimants as administrators with the will annexed of the original owner, as executors of the will of the life tenant, or as guardians under that will of the two infant children as remainder-men, in none of these capacities have they title to the property. Legally, their claim is in a capacity adverse to the children, who, as remainder-men under the will of their father, were at the time of the passage of the act, and now are, vested with the fee, as tenants in common. It is clear that the award to the claimants as administrators of the original owner cannot be sustained, because it would be in derogation of the title to the true owners of the property. The testator of the claimants died before the passage of the act, at a time when no right to recover damages for change of grade existed. At common law, no such right was given, and it has been obtained purely by force of the statute; and only the persons upon whom the statute conferred the right to such awards are entitled to file a claim therefor, or to receive it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">It appearing, then, as said, that these claimants, at the time of the filing of the claim and the malting of the award, were strangers to the title, the judgment of the commissioners must be reversed, and the claim dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
