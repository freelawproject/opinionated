He was conversant with the business carried on by his wife, and paid the rent for the property occupied by her to the landlord. He knew that the consideration for the Nicol mortgage was the past-due rents, the payment of which was essential to prevent dispossess proceedings threatened by the landlord, and it was his proposition t\u00f3 procure the Nicol mortgage to be executed. We think this state of facts sufficient to call for the application of two principles of law, either of which is sufficient in answer to the appellants\u2019 contention: The promise of Muxlow was to make the Nicol mortgage a second lien upon the property. This he could only do by a discharge of his mortgage, or by subordinating the lien thereof to the Nicol mortgage. The latter was the course he chose to adopt, and when he executed the instrument which accomplished that purpose he simply executed the agreement which he had made. Nothing more remained to be done, and from that instant the defendants\u2019 mortgage became subordinate to the lien of the Nicol mortgage. The question of a consideration was therefore immaterial. Railroad Co. v. Forrest, 128 N. Y. 83, 28 N. E. 137; Bunn v. Winthrop, 1 Johns. Ch. 329. The debt of Muxlow\u2019s wife furnished a sufficient consideration for the Nicol mortgage. Demarest v. Wynkoop, 3 Johns. Ch. 129; Bank v. Penfield, 69 N. Y. 502. As we have seen, Muxlow had full knowledge of the matters, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>agreed that the mortgage should be a second lien, and thereby secured; the continued possession of the premises occupied by his wife, and led* the plaintiffs to rely upon the security he obtained as a second mortgage. This condition presents all the elements upon which to base an estoppel, and, if a consideration for the defendants\u2019 agreement was an essential element, he should be held estopped from denying the same. Banking Co. v. Duncan, 86 N. Y. 221; Conrow v. Little, 115 N. Y. 387, 22 N. E. 346. No other question is presented for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
