The action is. brought to recover for professional services alleged to have been ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>dered by the plaintiff\u2019s assignors, to wit, the law firm of Gumbleton &amp; Hottenroth, to the defendants, at an agreed price, in the matter of effecting a lease to the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty of the city of New York of premises in the city of New York, for the temporary bridge over the Harlem river, near Third avenue. The lease was made for the term of three years from June 19, 1893, with the privilege of two renewals of one year each, upon the same terms and conditions therein contained, at the option of the city authorities, at the yearly rental of the sum of $13,000. It appears that, after the expiration of the three years\u2019 term in said lease provided for, another lease was entered into between the defendant and the city authorities of the same property, at the same rental, and for the term of 1 year 10 months and 11 days from June 19, 1896.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Gumbleton &amp; Hottenroth maintain in this action that the agreement for their professional services was for 10 per cent, on the amount of the rental that the defendants were to receive from any lease the city might make with them. The defendants admit that they were to pay said law firm 10 per cent, of all rents they were to receive from the city from any lease that might be made. The only contention between the parties is that the defendants claim that they understood the agreement to be that they were to pay 10 per cent, on the first lease, for the term of three years only; while the law firm maintain that they are entitled also to the 10 per cent, on the rental reserved in the lease, and received by the defendants, in the second lease. It is true that the first lease was for the term of three years,.and no more, and that it contained merely a covenant for a renewal at the city\u2019s option. The second lease amounts to substantially a renewal under that covenant. Gumbleton &amp; Hottenroth were the attorneys for the defendants. The relations of attorney and client existed between them, and the rule of law is that the attorney, in regard to a subject-matter intrusted to him by his client, must act fairly and justly, and take no undue advantage of his client\u2019s confidence, ignorance, or misconception. The client, however, is bound by an agreement with his attorney, when it appears from all the evidence, in the absence of any unfairness or injustice on his attorney\u2019s part, that he was fully informed of all the material circumstances, and acted understandingly on them. - Place v. Hayward, 117 N. Y. 487, at page 497, 23 N. E. 25. The contention whether the defendants understood their agreement with their attorneys, whether they were to pay 10 per cent, on the three years, the term reserved in the first lease only, or whether they were to pay on any renewal thereof, was fairly submitted by the trial judge to the jury, by a charge very favorable to the defendants, to which no exception was taken; and the only request to charge submitted by the defendants, and stating particularly their contention, was complied with by the court and the jury finding a verdict for the plaintiff. That finding is conclusive, and cannot be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">We have examined the exceptions at folios 64 and 74, and also at folio 114, and do not think that the evidence to which they relate influenced the jury\u2019s verdict in any way, or inured in any way to the defendants\u2019 injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
