J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1h\">Henry Offerman died April 28, 1896, leaving a last will, which was admitted to probate on May 8, 1896. The will made a number of specific bequests, and devised and bequeathed all the rest of the estate, real and personal, to his five children, share and share alike. The fourth clause of the will reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-18\">\u201cI hereby direct my executors, hereinafter named, as soon as practicable after my decease, out of my personal estate, to pay off, and procure to be canceled, satisfied, and discharged of record, any and all mortgages which shall be a lien upon the real property of which I shall be seised at the time of my decease, or upon any part thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1011-19\">An appraiser was appointed by the surrogate, and the estate was appraised and assessed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-20\">Total value of personal estate............................... $1,533,181 60</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-21\">Less debts ..................................... $421,740 27</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-22\">Mortgages payable on real estate................. 108,000 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2Z\">529,740 27</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-24\">$1,003,441 33</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1011-25\">The surrogate made an order confirming the report, and assessing the amount of the transfer tax upon the last-named sum, thus \u00e1ssessing no tax on the amount of the mortgages; and from this order the county treasurer applied to the surrogate, who ordered the matter of the appraisal to be remitted to the appraiser to amend his report, by taxing the $108,000 of mortgages. This being done, the surrogate entered a decree confirming the report, and from this decree the legatees and devisees appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>This court had occasion to pass upon a similar question in Re Sutton\u2019s Estate, 3 App. Div. 208, 38 N. Y. Supp. 277, and held that the transfer tax should be imposed upon the property in the form in which it stood when the testator died; and this was in accord with the decision of the appellate division in the first department in Re Livingston, 1 App. Div. 568, 37 N. Y. Supp. 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">The decree must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
