The note was protested, and demand made of defendant, and notice of dishonor giver, him, on September 5, 1895.

The note was protested for nonpayment September 5, 1895, and notice given upon the same day to the defendant. The not\u00a9 was made in April, 1895, and antedated as of September 2, 1893, because of a former note for the same amount indorsed by the defendant, which fell due upon that date, and was not. paid. The defendant had not been charged ah--, indorser upon the former note.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b999-12\">Argued before PARKER, P.

The defendant\u2019s cobtention is that as the note was actually made in April, 1895, after-chapter 607, Laws 1894, took effect, no grace, according to the custom of merchants, should be allowed thereon, and, therefore, that the notice of dishonor was not duly served upon him. Although the-note had no inception until it was made and delivered, in April, 1895,. yet, when it was delivered, it took effect according to its terms and' of its date, unless the equities between the parties require that the* date of its inception shall prevail. Here there are no such equities. The defendant has no equity that the date of the note shall be changed? in order to give to him a technical defense which the terms of the note exclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-16\">As said in Bank v. Davis, 2 Hill, 457:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-17\">\u201cThe face of the paper should be made to govern the question, rather tirara the particular character that must he given to it as between the parties by extrinsic evidence. Every exception made to the general commercial rate concerning negotiable paper, which enters so extensively into the business transactions of the country, is calculated to embarrass -its circulation, amfi endanger its security and usefulness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b999-18\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
