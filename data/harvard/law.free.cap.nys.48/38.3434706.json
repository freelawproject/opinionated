The accident occurred at night The plaintiff was crossing the defendant\u2019s track in the line of an intersecting street. At such an intersection the defendant\u2019s car had no paramount right of way. Buhrens v. Railroad Co., 53 Hun, 571, 6 N. Y. Supp. 224, affirmed by the court of appeals, 125 N. Y. 702, 26 N. E. 752; Bresky v. Railroad Co., 16 App. Div. 83, 45 N. Y. Supp. 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">The case was one for the jury, and the motion to dismiss the complaint was properly denied; but we are of opinion that the learned trial court erred in its charge. The defendant asked the court to charge \u201cthat the defendant was not guilty of negligence by reason of any failure to ring a gong at the point in question.\u201d This the court refused, and left the question of negligence for such failure to the jury. The plaintiff testified that he saw the car 300 feet away. The only object of ringing a gong or bell is to apprise travelers of the approach of the car. As the plaintiff was already aware of the approach of the car, we cannot see that a failure to ring the gong was a material element in the case, and the jury should have been so instructed. Daniels v. Rapid Transit Co., 125 N. Y. 407, 26 N. E. 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">The judgment appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
