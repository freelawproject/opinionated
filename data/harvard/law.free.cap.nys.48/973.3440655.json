ONGLEY ELECTRIC CO.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b991-5\">(Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Afb1\">December 31, 1897.)</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b991-6\">1. Foreign Corporations\u2014Action Against.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b991-7\">Where the right of the receiver of a foreign corporation, who is himself a nonresident, to maintain an action against the corporation, and the necessity for bringing such an action, arise out of the fact that its books, papers, and property, to which he is entitled, are withheld from him in this state, his cause of action arises within the state, and the action is therefore maintainable under Code Civ. Froc. \u00a7 1780.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b991-8\">2. Same\u2014Demurrer.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b991-9\">Even if this proposition were in doubt, the question cannot properly be raised on a motion to set aside the service of summons, where the only questions ordinarily to be considered are the legality or regularity of the service, but it should be raised by demurrer or answer.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b991-10\">Appeal from special term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b991-11\">Action by John S.

Frothingham, for appellant</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b991-14\">Rufus Peckham, Jr., for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b991-15\">WILLIAMS, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxN3\">The grounds upon which this order was made setting aside the summons were apparently that the court had acquired no jurisdiction of the person of the defendant nor of the subject of the action. The defendant was personally served with a summons, and subsequently made a general appearance in the action. The court therefore acquired jurisdiction of the defendant, unless it may be said that this is one of the actions which could not be brought against a foreign corporation by a nonresident plaintiff, under section 1780 of the Code of Civil Procedure. We think, however, that the cause of action arose in this state, for the reasons stated in the opinion upon appeal from the judgment sustaining a demurrer. But, even if this were in doubt, the question does not properly arise on a motion to set aside service of a summons. It should be raised by demurrer or answer. The only questions to be considered on such a motion ordinarily are the legality or regularity of the service. Atlantic &amp; P. Tel. Co. v. Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co., 87 N. Y. 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-16\">The only ground, apparently, upon which this part of the order was made, was that the complaint was demurrable, and should be dismissed. This order appealed from should therefore be reversed, with costs of appeal to the appellant, and the motion denied, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-17\">The appeal from the order denying motion to resettle the former order should be dismissed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
