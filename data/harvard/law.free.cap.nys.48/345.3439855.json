It is sufficient if one is, in effect, a continuation of the other.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-21\">The action was brought to recover damages for injuries resulting in the death of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate. At the time of the accident he had been driving westerly on Jackson avenue, on the north side of defendant\u2019s tracks, until he reached Honeywell street, into which he proceeded to turn southerly. In crossing the tracks, one of the hind wheels of his wagon was struck by a car approaching from the east, which, when he first turned to cross the street, had been from 40 to 50 feet distant. He was in a covered wagon, and was looking to the west. It did not appear that he saw the approaching car. Honeywell street runs off diagonally from the southerly side of Jackson avenue, and, according to a survey in evidence, a line drawn along the middle of the street would strike the north side of the avenue about halfway between Bartow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>and Blackwell streets, which are about 200 feet apart, and which enter the avenue at a similar angle.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b363-19\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Appeal from special term, Kings county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-20\">Action by Barbara Brozek, as administratrix of Alois Brozek, deceased, against the Steinway Railway Company of Long Island City.

Railway Co., 10 App. Div. 360, 41 N. Y. Supp. 1017. The case has been tried anew in accordance with the rules of law laid down in that opinion, and we find no reason to disturb the verdict. It is argued that our previous decision was based upon the erroneous, assumption that the accident happened at a street crossing, whereas the fact is that the street into which the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was trying to drive was not a continuation of any street on the opposite side of Jackson avenue. We think, however, that Honeywell street may be regarded as, in effect, a continuation of Blackwell street, though Honeywell street leaves Jackson avenue at a point some distance to the west of the point where Blackwell street enters it. The case is not unlike Bresky v. Railroad Co., 16 App. Div. 83, 45 N. Y. Supp. 108, where Roosevelt street in New York was held to be practically a continuation of Baxter street, although there is no street directly opposite Baxter street, but Roosevelt street is 50 or 60 feet further north. The present case differs radically from. Meyer v. Railroad Co., 9 App. Div. 79, 41 N. Y. Supp. 92. There the wagon which collided with the car was being driven diagonally towards the approaching car at the time of the accident, while here the wagon was being driven diagonally away from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
