H. Huffman did, on or about the 26th day of March, 1896, at the town of Friendship, in the county of Allegany, aforesaid, willfully sell, and cause, suffer, and permit to be sold, liquor in quantities less than five gallons at a time, to James Whaleu and C.

H. Robinson; second, that the indictment does not conform to the requirements of sections 275 and 276 of the Criminal Code.\u201d The demurrer was overruled, and the defendant pleaded not guilty, and a trial was had on the 5th of December, 1896, in the county court of Allegany county.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Appeal from Allegany county court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-13\">William H.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJA9\">It is provided in section 275 of the Code of Criminal Procedure that the indictment must contain \u201ca plain and concise statement of the act constituting the crime, without unnecessary repetition.\u201d In section 278 of the Code of Criminal Procedure it is provided, viz.: \u201cThe indictment must charge but one crime and in one form except as in the next section provided.\u201d Section 279 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides, viz.: \u201cThe crime may be charged in separate counts to have been committed in a different manner or by different means; and where the acts complained of may constitute different crimes, such crimes may be charged in separate counts.\u201d These sections have lately been construed by the court of appeals in People v. Wilson, 151 N. Y. 403, 45 N. E. 862. In the case cited it has been held that the effect of the provision of section 279 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, that, \u201cwhere the acts complained of may constitute different crimes, such crimes may be charged in separate counts, constituting an exception to the provision of section 278, that \u2018the indictment must charge but one crime,\u2019 is to permit a continuance of the former practice of joining different crimes by separate counts, where they all relate to the same transaction.\u201d \u201cThe act\u201d constituting the crime alleged in the indictment against the defendant is that he \u201cdid, on or about the 26th day of March, 1896, * * * sell, and cause, suffer, and permit to be sold, liquor in quantities less than five gallons, * * and did then and there unlawfully deliver, and cause to be delivered, in pursuance of such sale, to the said James Whalen and O. H. Robinson, and to said divers other persons, and to said divers persons to the jury aforesaid unknown, liquor, to wit, one pint distilled spirits [and other enumerated kinds of liquor], without having paid a tax therefor, and obtained and posted a liquor-tax certificate, as required by the provisions of chapter 112 of the Laws of 1896.\u201d In People v. Adams, 17 Wend. 475, it was held, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-13\">\u201cIn an indictment for selling spirituous liquors without license, it is not necessary to specify the names of the persons to whom the sales were made. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>count in such an indictment charging the sale of divers quantities of different sorts of liquors, to divers citizens of the state, and to divers persons unknown, cannot be objected to on error as a count embracing more than one offense; the whole will be deemed a single transaction. The public prosecutor, however, on such a count, may, on the trial, be confined to the proof of a single offense. An indictment charging an offense on a particular day, and also on divers other days, is good. A day certain being alleged, the 'residue will be rejected as surplusage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In the indictment before us only one day is mentioned, to wit, the 26th of March, 1896.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">In the course of the opinion delivered in People v. Adams, supra, Nelson, C. J., said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">\u201cIt is to be remarked that the offense upon the statute consists in the act of selling the spirituous liquors without a license, and therefore the designation of the persons to whom sold is in no way material to constitute it. The question is simply one of pleading,\u2014whether certainty to a common intent requires the names of the persons to be given to whom the liquor was sold.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Although the indictment in that case averred that the defendant sold by retail, \u201cto divers citizens of this state, and to divers persons to the jurors aforesaid unknown, and did deliver, in pursuance of such sale, to the said divers citizens, and the said divers persons to the jurors aforesaid unknown, strong and spirituous liquors,\u201d to be drank in the house of John Adams at the city of Utica, the learned judge in that case observed that the claim that the count contained more than one offense could not be sustained, and he adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">\u201cUpon our view of the time when the offense is laid in the indictment,\u2014 that is, upon the day given,\u2014but one sale by retail is to be deemed charged in the count. The three gills of brandy, three gills of rum, etc., are to be viewed as having been sold at one and the same time, and as constituting but one transaction. * * * If we strike out the words, \u2018divers days and times,\u2019 etc., as we have seen may be done, or, in other words, as the defendant may require the prosecutor to confine his proof on the trial the same as if they were expunged, then but one offense is charged in the count, and the conviction cannot, of course, extend beyond it,\u2014a single sale of the quantity of liquor mentioned, to divers citizens of the state, and to divers persons unknown,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">That case was referred to with approval in Osgood v. People, 39 N. Y. 451, which latter case was decided in 1868, before the passage of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The indictment is quite unlike the one under consideration in People v. O\u2019Donnell, 46 Hun, 360. In that case the indictment alleged sales on four different days, naming them. We are of the opinion that no error was committed in overruling the demurrer to the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">2. Upon the trial the people called as a witness James Whalen, who testified that he went into the defendant\u2019s hotel on the 26th of March, 1896, and that the bartender was behind the bar in the barroom at the time. The witness adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-13\">\u201cI told him I wanted a half pint of whisky. He passed it right out, and I paid him twenty-five cents. That was the first I was in that house that day. I had two half pints. That was about two o\u2019clock; the other time, about half past three the same day. I again went into the hotel. I went to the barroom. I saw the same person behind the bar. I got a half pint of whisky. I took it, and put it in my pocket. I got it of Mr. Coleman [the bartender], and paid twenty-five cents for it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>In the course of his cross-examination the witness stated that he was acquainted with C. H. Robinson, and he adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">\u201cI did not see him the day I got the whisky. He had nothing to do with the purchase of that whisky.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">It appears by the evidence that Archie \"Worden participated in drinking the whisky that was. purchased by Whalen, and that he was placed in the lockup, and that certain proceedings were instituted before one W. H. Scott, a justice of the peace, on the day after the alleged sale of the whisky, or the day thereafter; and an affidavit was made before the justice by Whalen which was received in evidence, without objection, before the trial closed, and in that affidavit Whalen says, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">\u201cOn the 26th day of March, 1866. I went into the said hotel, to wit, the American House, at the town and village of Friendship, Allegany county, and then and there bought of the bartender in the said house two one-half pint bottles of whisky. I know it was whisky, as I drank a large portion of it myself. I was somewhat intoxicated at the time I got this whisky. I bought it of a man behind the bar in said hotel whose name I do not know, but he was a short, thick-set man. I paid twenty-five cents for each half pint I got there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">The testimony of Whalen, coupled with the affidavit, which was received without objection, clearly established, if credited, a violation \u2022 of the statute, and that it occurred on the 26th day of March, 1896, as alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">In section 31 of chapter 112 of the Laws of 1896 it is provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-10\">\u201cIt shall not be lawful for any corporation * * * or person which, or who, has not paid a tax as provided in section eleven of this act and obtained and posted the liquor tax certificate as provided in this act to sell, offer or expose for sale, or give away liquors in any quantity less than five wine gallons at a time; nor, without having paid such tax and complied with the. provisions of this act, to sell, offer or expose for sale, or give away liquor in any quantity whatever, any part of which is to be drunk on the premises of such vendor. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">In section 33 of that act it is provided that any person engaged in the traffic of liquors\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-13\">\u201cShall upon conviction of a violation of any .of the provisions of this act be liable for and suffer the penalties imposed therein; * * * and each violation of any of the. provisions of this act shall be construed to constitute a separate and complete offence, and for each violation on the same day, or on different days, the person or persons offending shall be liable to the penalties and forfeitures imposed by this act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-15\">The evidence given as to the purchase made by Whalen, if credited, was sufficient \u201cto constitute a separate and complete offence,\u201d as declared in the language of the statute which has just been quoted..</p>\n<p id=\"b503-16\">The people put upon the stand 0. H. Robinson, as a witness, who&gt; testiiied that in the latter part of March he had occasion to go to his-hotel, and he was then asked: \u201cQ. Did you have anything to drink there?\u201d The defendant objected to the question on the ground that it was \u201cincompetent, and seeks to prove another and distinct crime from the one already sought to be proved.\u201d The witness then added:. \u201cI cannot tell you what day it was. Have not very much recollection of the time. Have no means of telling when it was. I was sworn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>before Mr. Scott.\u201d Thereupon the following question was propounded to him: \u201cQ. Did you in that affidavit state when it was you had something to drink in that hotel?\u201d This was objected to again, on the ground that it was incompetent, immaterial, and irrelevant. The objections were overruled, and the defendant took an exception. The witness answered: \u201cI think the affidavit would .refresh my mind as to what I did say.\u201d Thereupon the district attorney put in the hands of the witness a paper, and asked him to read it, and then propounded to the witness the following question: \u201cQ. Can you state to the jury when it was you had anything to drink in Huffman\u2019s Hotel, the latter part of March?\u201d This was objected to by the defendant as \u201cincompetent; (2) seeks to prove a separate and distinct crime from the one already sought to be proved; (3) inadmissible under the indictment.\u201d The objections were overruled, and the defendant took an exception. The witness answered: \u201cSome time in March. -It was previous to the prosecution, but cannot tell how long before. I guess I did swear how long it was. I guess I can tell what I swore to. It says so in that affidavit. The affidavit was made on the 28th day of March.\u201d The following question was then propounded to him: \u201cQ. What was it you did on the occasion referred to?\u201d The defendant objected to the question on the ground that it was \u201cimmaterial, irrelevant, seeking to prove a distinct crime from the one already sought to be proved. Inadmissible under the indictment.\u201d The objections were overruled, and an exception taken. The witness answered: \u201cI drank at the bar there; drank beer and I drank whisky there. I bought the whisky of this young man Coleman. I bought one drink of him, and I guess I paid ten cents. Paid it to Coleman. I was in the habit of going in and out of there, sometimes three or four times a day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The language used in the indictment would warrant the construction apparently given to it by the county judge, that the averment was that the sale was to Whalen and Robinson jointly, which was doubtless the view taken by the county judge in order to overcome the objections made by the defendant to the indictment. People v. Harmon, 49 Hun, 558, 2 N. Y. Supp. 421, affirmed 112 N. Y. 666, 20 N. E. 414. The people, however, in producing evidence, gave testimony to the effect of the independent sale made to Whalen of the whisky on two different occasions (there being no objection to the second occasion), and, when the attempt was made by the evidence of Eobinson to prove another violation, if was apparently to prove a violation not specifically mentioned in the indictment. As we have seen, the statute provides that each violation shall be a complete offense. If the evidence which was offered and received from the witness Eobinson is received and considered, then the people are in the attitude of proving an additional offense to the one alleged in the indictment. The refusal of the defendant\u2019s counsel to concede that the people had proved one offense by the testimony of Whalen does not seem to be an adequate excuse for allowing evidence from Eobinson of a distinct, separate, independent violation of the law. Section 33 of chapter 112 of the Laws of 1896 provides that \u201ceach violation on the same day, or on different days,\u201d shall' subject the person offending \u201cto the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>penalties and forfeitures imposed by this act.\u201d If the evidence of Robinson was competent, then we have an anomalous situation of an indictment alleging a sale to Whalen and Robinson as a sale to them jointly, proof of sale to Whalen under that indictment, and then proof of sale on another occasion to Robinson in the absence of Whalen. As already stated, section 275 of the Code of Criminal Procedure prescribes that the indictment \u201cshall contain a plain and concise statement of the act constituting the crime.\u201d It will hardly do to allege an act in violation of law by a sale to two persons jointly, and then prove the sale to one independent of the other, and, after having given such proof of the act constituting the crime, then permit a party to prove another additional act, especially under a statute which declares that each and every violation of any of its provisions \u201cshall be construed -to constitute a separate and complete offence,\u201d and subject the party accused of a violation, \u201cfor each violation on the same day, or on different days,\u201d to a penalty. People v. Krank, 110 N. Y. 488, 18 N. E. 242; People v. Charbineau, 115 N. Y. 433, 22 N. E. 271, which was commented upon in People v. Wilson, 151 N. Y. 409, 45 N. E. 862. If the foregoing views prevail, it will lead to a reversal of the judgment and order and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Judgment upon the verdict and order denying a new trial reversed, and a new trial directed in the county court of Allegany county, to which county, after entry of judgment in pursuance of section 547 et seq., Code Or. Proc., the proceedings are remitted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
