At the trial the plaintiff testified that he was suing for $95.71, and that he had sold the defendant goods. He was then asked what kind of goods, and the justice\u2019s return shows the following :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-5\">\u201cObjected to by counsel for the defendant, who moves that the plaintiff be precluded from giving any evidence, on the ground that a motion for a bill of particulars was made, but no bill has been furnished. Motion denied. Exception.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The defendant apparently relies on this exception. There is nothing in the return which indicates that the court,\u00abwhen issue was joined, required the plaintiff to exhibit his account or demand, or to state the nature thereof, further than he had in his oral complaint; and the fact that the justice refused to preclude the plaintiff from giving evidence of his account would imply that no such direction had been made. We think that this provision was intended to entitle either party to make application to the court upon joinder of issue \u201cto require the adverse party to exhibit his account or demand, or to state the nature thereof as far as it is in his power so to do,\u201d that the court may determine whether it is a proper case for such a direction, and specify in the direction when and in what manner such account should be exhibited. Upon making such direction, the justice, to preserve evidence thereof, may cause such entry to be made as he deems proper; or he may reduce the direction to the form of an order, to be filed or served, as he may direct. Good practice requires this, that neither party may be surprised by objections at the trial. Gebhard v. Parker, 120 N. Y. 33, 23 N. E. 982. The Code (section 531) provides, in regard to courts of record, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-7\">\u201cIt is not necessary for a party to set forth, in a pleading, the items of an account therein alleged; but in that case, he must deliver to the adverse party, within ten days after a written demand thereof, a copy of the account, which, if the pleading is verified, must be verified by his affidavit, to the effect that he believes it to be true. * * * If he fails so to do, he is precluded from giving evidence of the account,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">It will be readily seen that the demand provided for by section 531 (which is not applicable to district courts) is essentially different from the provision of section 2942, which authorizes the court to require the adverse party to exhibit his account, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">The action was originally brought against the defendant as \u201cSamuel Rosenthal,\u201d but by consent the record was amended so that his name should read \u201cNathan S. Rosenthal.\u201d The question litigated at the trial was whether the goods were sold to the defendant or to his father, Abraham Rosenthal; and the justice, upon conflicting evidence, found that they were sold to the defendant. We find no reason to differ from the conclusion reached, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>48 NEW YORK SUPPLEMENT and 82 New York State Reporter.
