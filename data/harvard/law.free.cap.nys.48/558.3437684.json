Later, in May, it filed a verified statement, claiming exemption, on the ground that its New York business was a mere sales agency. <em>Held, </em>that the determination of the commissioners in accepting and acting upon the earlier statements should not be disturbed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b576-9\">Ingraham, J., dissenting.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b576-10\">Appeal from special term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-11\">Certiorari by the people, on the relation of the McShane Manufacturing Company, against Edward Barker and others, commissioners of taxes.

The first is similar to that considered in the Yellow Pine Co. Case (decided herewith) 48 N. Y. Supp. 553, and the same disposition is made of it as in that case. The other question relates to the right of the commissioners to- make any assessment of the relator\u2019s property within this state, and it is claimed that the facts appearing before the commissioners bring the relator within the rule laid down by this court in the case of People v. Barker, 5 App. Div. 246, 39 N. Y. Supp. 151. This case does not fall within that rule. The petition indicates that the only ground of complaint is that of overvaluation. But it is further made to appear that there were in the possession of the commissioners statements and returns submitted by the relator which are entirely inconsistent with its claim that it was not doing business in the state of New York in</p>\n<p id=\"b577-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>such a manner as to render its property within the state liable to taxation. On the 17th of March, 1896, the relator made a statement in writing that it had invested in its business in the state of New York, including the value of its office furniture, safe, samples, and fixtures, money in bank and otherwise used in its business, the sum of $79,504.13. This is specifically stated to be \u201ctotal sum invested in business in this state.\u201d On the 16th day of May, 1896, it made a supplementary statement, in which it declared \u201cthat this company heretofore, on or about April 7, 1896, made and delivered to the said commissioners of taxes and assessments a statement of its liability to taxation, to which statement this is supplementary.\u201d On the 25th of May, the relator filed with the commissioners a verified statement, in which it claimed to be exempt from taxation, for the reason that its business in the state of New York was simply an agency for the sale of goods. All the statements submitted were verified, and it was the duty of the commissioners to act judicially upon them all; and, in so doing, they have accepted the sworn statements first put in-, as they had the right to do, and with their determination in that matter we are not disposed to interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\">The order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">VAN BRUNT, P.
