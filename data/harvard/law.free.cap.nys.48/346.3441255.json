The answer contained a general denial, and an affirmative defense to the effect that the parties had negotiated for the building of certain stoops, but were unable to come to an agreement in regard to the same, and that no work was performed or material furnished by the plaintiffs under any such agreement. Upon these issues the case went to trial. The proof was conflicting, but there is sufficient evidence in the record to sustain a verdict for the plaintiffs in some amount. The measure of damages, however, should have been confined to the profits of which the plaintiffs were deprived in consequence of having been prevented from carrying out the contract. The profits thus lost were estimated by one of the plaintiffs at $125 for each stoop; or $625 in all. But the learned trial judge instructed the jury that, if any work was done upon the stone for the stoops, and the stone was rendered useless, the plaintiffs were also entitled to recover damages on that account, in addition to the amount of profits which they might have made upon the execution of the contract. To this instruction an exception was taken in behalf of the defendant, and his counsel expressly called the attention of the court to the point that there was no evidence to show that the stone had been rendered worthless, or lessened in value, and hence insisted that there was no question to be submitted on that branch of the case. The learned court nevertheless left the matter to the jury. I think this was an error for which we must reverse the judgment. The proof in behalf of the plaintiffs undoubtedly did tend to show that the sides of all five stoops and a few steps were cut, and that a part of the work was delivered at the defendant\u2019s houses, and subsequently taken back again to the plaintiffs\u2019 premises. I am unable to find any testimony, however, sufficient to sustain a finding that this stone, or any of it, had been rendered useless. The strongest statement on the subject is that of one of the plaintiffs, who, when asked upon cross-examination whether the materials had not been used for other stoops and other buildings, responded, \u201cNo, sir; the stone is there to-day, covered up, rotted, worn, weather worn and beaten.\u201d While this indicates, of course, that the stone had deteriorated since it was prepared for the stoops, it is very far from showing that it had been rendered valueless. In the brief for the respondents it is argued that the counsel for the defendant was precluded from objecting, at the end of the case that there was no evidence to show that the stone had been rendered worthless because he himself had stated, in the course of the trial, that he was not going to offer any evidence as to the value of stoop ashlar. It is not perceived how this statement had any bearing upon the question whether the stone, after the plaintiffs\u2019 labor had been expended upon it in preparing it for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>stoops, had become useless for any other purpose. If we were able to say that the jury allowed nothing to the plaintiffs on account of the loss of the stone, and that their award represented only the plaintiffs\u2019 loss of profits, it might be possible to sustain the verdict. But we cannot be sure of this, and the emphasis given to this branch of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim just before the case was submitted to the jury renders it exceedingly probable that the damages were augmented, because the jury were allowed to act upon the erroneous assumption that there was proof that the stone had been rendered useless.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The judgment should be reversed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
