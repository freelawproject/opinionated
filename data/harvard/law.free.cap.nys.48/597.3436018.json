While seeking to alight from the car he fell and was injured. He testified that, having signaled the conductor his desire to alight, the signal was recognized and the car slowed down. He thereupon arose and stood on the platform, when, as he expresses it, \u201cthe car went right from under me,\u2014went forward,\u201d\u2014and he fell into the street, alighting upon his feet, but subsequently sinking down. No testimony was given to show that the car started suddenly or accelerated its motion, or that there was any jerk or jolt, other than may be inferred from the plaintiff\u2019s statement that \u201cthe car went right from under me.\u201d For the defendant two witnesses testified that the plaintiff fell while stepping off the car, which was in. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>motion at the time, and that there was no change in the movement of the car. The defendant insists that the testimony of the plaintiff was insufficient to support the charge of negligence on its part, and in this we agree. Though interrogated several times on the subject, the plaintiff would say nothing more or else\u2018of the movement of the car than that \u201cit went from under me.\u201d Of course, the car did not go from under him. This is in reality not the statement of a fact, but a statement of the sensation the plaintiff experienced at the time. It might have been due to his neglect to properly maintain his balance or secure himself from the jolt or oscillation which the movement of a car at all times will occasion, either to a greater or less extent. The probability that it resulted from his own fault was just as great as that it resulted from the fault of the defendant, and the jury were not justified in ascribing it to the latter cause, in the absence of proof to establish that there was any jerk or change in the motion of the car, and in the face of positive evidence to the contrary. In fact, it is difficult to see how the accident could have occurred as plaintiff states it, assuming that his testimony as to his position was correct. He says that he was not on the step; that he was standing on the back platform of the car (as we infer from the record before us), in front of the seat from which he had arisen. If the motion of the car had been suddenly accelerated, it would seem as if the plaintiff should have been thrown over or against the back dashboard, and not sidewise into the street. The motion for a non-suit should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
