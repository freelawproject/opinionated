Proc. \u00a7 1013), it must be shown that so many distinct items will be litigated that the jury could not keep the evidence in mind, and give it proper weight and application; and the mere fact that the services relate to one action, four mandamus proceedings, two street openings, and for drawing sundry contracts or documents, does not necessarily make out such a case.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-11\">Appeal\" from special term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Action <em>by </em>Job E.

The action is to recover the value of attorney\u2019s services. It appears that the plaintiff was employed and rendered service for the defendant in one action, four mandamus proceedings, two street openings, and that he prepared certain documents and contracts for the defendant. The only ground upon which an action of this character can be referred is that it necessarily inyolves the examination of a long account. . Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1013. Every charge that may be dissected and distributed over a great number of items does not necessarily make a long account, within the meaning of the section of the Code controlling that subject. Thus, in the c\u00e1se of Spence v. Simis, 137 N. Y. 616, 33 N. E. 554, there was a claim made by an attorney for services in four suits, his bill of particulars containing 125 items. It was held that a compulsory reference could not be ordered, reversing the court below. In Feeter v. Arkenburgh, 147 N. Y. 237, 41 N. E. 518, in an action upon an attorney\u2019s bill containing 150 items and three separate subjects of employment, it was held that the action was not referable, reversing the court below. The real test is that defined in Spence v. Simis, supra, namely, that, to justify an order of reference in a case of this character, \u201cfacts must be disclosed, either by affidavit or upon the face of the pleadings, from which the conclusion can fairly be drawn that so many separate and distinct items of account will be litigated on the trial that the jury cannot keep the evidence in mind in regard to each of the items, and give it the proper weight and application when they retire to deliberate upon their verdict.\u201d There is nothing in the papers in this case which would indicate that an average jury could not fully bear in mind and appreciate the evidence relating to the nature and value of an attorney\u2019s services in one action, four mandamus proceedings, two street openings, and for drawing contracts or documents. All mandamus proceedings are in their general formal character alike, as are also street-opening proceedings, and an action such as this is so simple in its structure, and the evidence required to establish the plaintiff\u2019s claim so easily comprehended, that no reason exists for any other method of trial than that to which a defendant is ordinarily entitled in common-law cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The order should be reversed, with costs, and the motion for a reference denied, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
