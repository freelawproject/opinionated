LAMB et al.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b241-8\">(Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department.</court>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aiqh\">December 10, 1897.)</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A7lA\">Pleading\u2014Amendment of Answer.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b241-9\">Where, in an action on a promissory note, by an indorsee, facts set up in the answer by way of counterclaim might constitute a good defense, except for defendant\u2019s failure to allege that plaintiff took the note with knowledge of them, or after maturity, the court, in sustaining a demurrer to the counterclaim, should permit the service of an amended answer.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-12\">The action was upon a promissory note made by defendant Lamb to the order of defendant Brown, and indorsed by Brown and defendant Bryan. The complaint alleged delivery of the note, so made and indorsed, to the Sprague Electric Elevator. Company; that that company indorsed and delivered it to the Western National Bank, and the bank transferred it to plaintiff. The defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Lane, Brown, and Bryan denied that plaintiff was the owner of the note, and set up in their answer, on information and belief, \u201cthat the plaintiff herein is trustee for, or acting in behalf of, the Sprague Electric Elevator Company, in the prosecution of this action, and while, in form, the said plaintiff is the \u2022ostensible plaintiff in this action, he has brought and prosecutes the same in behalf and for the benefit of Sprague Electric Elevator Company, the party to whom said note was originally delivered, and that no right of action exists thereon.\u201d And they also set up that Lane, Brown, and Bryan were actually partners in erecting the Syndicate Building; that the Sprague Electric Elevator Company had a contract with Lamb to construct an elevator in the building, for a certain agreed price; that it neglected and refused to carry out that contract; that the note in question was given as part of the consideration of the contract price, in anticipation of the Sprague Electric Elevator Company\u2019s performance of their contract.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b241-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Appeal from special term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-11\">Action by William N. Coler, Jr., against Hugh Lamb and others. From a judgment sustaining a demurrer to a counterclaim contained in an amended answer of the defendants, they appeal.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AC0\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b242-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Argued before VAN BRUNT, P. J., and WILLIAMS, PATTERSON, O\u2019BRIEN, and INGRAHAM, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-6\">Albridge C. Smith, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-7\">Frederick T. Hill, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"pAWj\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"A1A\">The views expressed by the learned judge at special term\u2014that he was not prepared to say that the facts set up in the answer as a counterclaim, if true, might not be a good defense to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, if the plaintiff took the note sued on with knowledge of the facts, or after maturity\u2014should, we think, have led him to extend to the defendants leave to answer over upon payment of costs. The interlocutory judgment should be affirmed, with this modification, viz. that the defendants should be permitted to serve an amended answer, upon payment of costs below, and without costs in this court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
