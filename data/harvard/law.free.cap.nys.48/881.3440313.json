Since then it has carried on its mining operations there, and o\u00fat of its so-called \u201cprofits\u201d has yearly paid dividends, and also invested $300,000 in the bonds of the United-Verde &amp; Pacific Railway Company, a corporation organized in Arizona, in the interest of the relator, to construct a railroad from the relator\u2019s mines to another railroad about 25 miles distant, ibis railroad has been constructed. Its main business is to take away the product of the relator, and bring to it its supplies. The relator furnished the money to build and equip the railroad, and the bonds in question represent most of the money thus furnished. These bonds were in the possession of the relator in New York when the comptroller imposed the tax in question. All of the relator\u2019s business is done without this state, except some of its financial business, and such as pertains to its official residence in the city of New York/ In that city it has an office, some furniture, and a bank account, employing capital for these purposes to the amount of $180,000, as fixed and taxed by the comptroller, of which the relator does not complain. The question upon which our decision depends is whether the $300,000 of bonds above mentioned were part of the capital stock of the company, or its surplus earnings. If capital stock, the tax was properly imposed. People ex rel. Edison Electric Light Co. v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>Campbell, 138 N. Y. 543, 34 N. E. 370; People v. Campbell, 88 Hun, 544, 34 N. Y. Supp. 801. If surplus, the tax was erroneous. People ex rel. Singer Mfg. Co. v. Wemple, 150 N. Y. 46, 44 N. E. 787. The relator did not use these bonds in its business, otherwise than as-securities, or as evidence of the indebtedness of the obligor to it. It did not borrow money upon them to use in its business. The comptroller held that these bonds were capital stock, and not surplus, upon the assumption that, as the relator took mineral from its mines, it decreased their value, and thus impaired its capital stock. No-sales of the relator\u2019s capital stock have been made. Its treasurer\u2019s-statement is in evidence, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-5\">\u201cAs to the value of the mine and works, I could, of course, only furnish you an opinion, as the value of a mine is extremely problematical, and if the-mine was exhausted the works would be useless.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">The fact that the capital stock was paid for in mines and mining-property probably eliminated the danger of an underestimate of the value of the stock in the first instance, and suggests that the earnings would be needed to hold the stock at par. The operation of a mine for a dozen years may decrease its value by exhaustion, or increase it by development. How it is in this case, we do not know. The relator ought to show that the comptroller was wrong in his valuation. People ex rel. American Concentrating &amp; Dredging Co. v. Wemple, 129 N. Y. 562, 29 N. E. 812; People ex rel. Western Electric Co. v. Campbell, 145 N. Y. 587, 40 N. E. 239. We do not think it has shown this.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">Determination of the comptroller confirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
