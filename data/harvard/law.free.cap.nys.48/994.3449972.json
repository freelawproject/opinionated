A copy of the will of James Smillie is attached to the complaint, and made a part thereof. By the first article the testator devises and bequeaths all his estate to his executors in trust for the uses and purposes subsequently mentioned in the will. By the second article he orders and directs that the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>trustees apply the rents and profits of the lot of land known as \u201cNo. 25 Garfield Place,\u201d in the city of Poughkeepsie, together with the rents and profits of all the buildings thereon, to the use of his daughter, Mary S. Throop, during her lifetime. Upon her decease the trustees are directed to grant and convey the said premises to the lineal descendants of the daughter, or to certain other persons if she leaves no lineal descendants. The further provisions of the will are not material to the present controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">The learned judge at special term thought that the facts set out in the complaint were sufficient to render the estate of James Smillie liable for the value of the plaintiff\u2019s services, because the defendants, as executors and trustees, were legally bound to keep the premises in repair. He therefore directed judgment for the plaintiff upon the demurrer. In common-law actions, it has repeatedly been decided that a debt contracted by an executor or administrator, as such, and for the benefit of the estate which he represents, only binds him individually, and does not bind the estate. Ferrin v. Myrick, 41 N. Y. 315; Austin v. Munro, 47 N. Y. 360; Willis v. Sharp, 113 N. Y. 586, 591, 21 N. E. 705; Van Slooten v. Dodge, 145 N. Y. 327, 332, 39 N. E. 950, 951. In the case last cited it is said, \u201cAn executor cannot subject the estate in his hands for administration to some new liability, either by his contract or by his wrongful act.\u201d This is a statement of the general rule. On the other hand, a testator may give such directions in his will in reference to the management of his estate as to render it liable in equity for debts contracted by his executors. Willis v. Sharp, supra. A similar general rule, subject to a like exception, has been held to apply to trustees of real estate. New v. Nicoll, 73 N. Y. 127. In the case last cited, the defendant was the trustee of certain premises, to receive the rents, issues, and profits thereof, and, \u201cafter paying therefrom all taxes, assessments, and other charges thereon,\u201d to apply the rest and residue to the use of a beneficiary named in the instrument creating the trust, during her life, and upon her death to convey it in accordance with the testamentary directions of such beneficiary. The plaintiff sued to recover the agreed value of work done and materials furnished in the repair of buildings upon the property held by the defendant in trust. He succeeded upon the trial, but the judgment in Ms favor was reversed at the general term, and the reversal was sustained in the court of appeals. The opinion of the general term was written by Mr. Justice Gilbert, who held that the duty of the trustee to pay taxes, assessments, \u201cand other charges\u201d upon the premises related to liens or incumbrances which were paramount to the trust, and not to expenditures for repairs upon the property. \u201cA trustee cannot bind the trust estate by an executory contract,\u201d he said, and \u201cthe facts that the plaintiff made the repairs, relying on the authority of the trustee and on the trust estate, and that the repairs were necessary for the preservation of the subject of the trust, and that the trustee had no trust funds, we think, do not take the case out of the principle stated. The reliance of the plaintiff was simply a mistaken one on his part. The law does not justify it.\u201d New v. Nicoll, 12 Hun, 431. To the same effect is the opinion in the court of appeals, which was written by Earl, J., who said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>\u201cThe general rule, undoubtedly, is that a trustee cannot charge the trust estate by his executory contracts unless authorized to do so by the terms of the instrument creating the trust. Upon such contracts he is personally liable, and the remedy is against him personally. But there are exceptions to this general rule. When a trustee is authorized to make an expenditure, and he has no trust funds, and the expenditure is necessary for the protection, reparation, or safety of the trust estate, and he is not willing to make himself personally liable, he may, by express agreement, make the expenditure a charge upon the trust estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">The proof there, however, did not bring the case within the exception mentioned; nor do the allegations of the complaint in the present action suffice to show that there was any agreement between the parties to the effect that the expense of the plumbing to be done by the plaintiff should be a charge upon the trust estate. The existence of some such agreement being essential to the successful prosecution of his claim against the defendants as executors and trustees, the plaintiff was bound to plead it, and his failure to do so makes his complaint fatally defective. The demurrer of the defendants should therefore have been sustained. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
