Eichhold &amp; Miller the payment of all goods purchased by Mes. B. O. Young &amp; Co., St. Louis, Mo., to the extent of one thousand (1,000) dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-14\">\u201cJ. A. Williams.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-15\">\u201cO. L. Tiffany.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-16\">It appears from the evidence that the plaintiffs sold and delivered goods between April 20th and September 30th, in the first instance to \u201cB. C. Young &amp; Co.,\u201d but after the middle of July to \u201cYoung &amp; Bruns\u201d; and, since the claim in suit was based upon an indebtedness of something over $1,000 for all the goods thus sold, it became a question as to whether \u201cB. C. Young &amp; Co.\u201d and \u201cYoung &amp; Bruns\u201d were in fact identical, according to the understanding of the parties to the guaranty. So far as the merits of the case are presented by the exceptions taken to the denial of the appellants\u2019 motion for the dismissal of the complaint, it appears that the submission of the issues to the jury was not error. It was shown that, about the time when the guaranty was delivered, B. C. Young and O. F. Bruns came to the plaintiffs\u2019 place of business, and stated that they were going into partnership for the purpose of selling hats in St. Louis, under the firm name of B. C. Young &lt;&amp; Co.; that the defendant Williams then came in and said to the plaintiff Eichhold, in the presence of both Young and Bruns, \u201cThe boys say they can use your line of goods in that market, and that they wish to establish a credit.\u201d Williams told Eichhold at the time \u201cto write out a guaranty and that Charles L. Tiffany and he would sign it for whatever amount was sufficient to protect our account with them.\u201d Here was sufficient evidence to support a finding by the jury that Young and Bruns were intended as the principals in the guaranty, as given, and the motion for dismissal of the complaint upon the ground that some of the goods had been delivered to \u2018Young &amp; Bruns,\u201d instead of to \u201cB. C. Young <em>&amp; </em>Co.,\u201d was properly denied. Moreover, it appeared from the account of the dealings between the parties in question that there was a substantial balance due to the plaintiffs for goods billed to \u201cB. C. Young &amp; Co.\u201d in accordance with the express terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>of the guaranty, and, in this aspect, there \"was an apparent right of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The motion for dismissal proceeded upon the further ground that the plaintiffs had extended the time of the principals\u2019 credit,- it being contended that the uncontradicted evidence showed the fact of such extension. The evidence upon the point is found in the testimony of Young, taken upon commission, that the credit was extended \u201cfor several months, by verbal agreement between Mr. Bruns and Mr. Eichhold.\u201d To contradict this, the plaintiff Eichhold was called as a witness, and testified: \u201cIn the summer of 1887 I had a conversation with Mr. Bruns or Mr. Young in reference to their indebtedness to us. Nothing was said then about giving them further time.\u201d It is true that this was not a direct contradiction of the existence of an agreement which might have' been made at some other interview, but the burden of proving the fact of the extension of credit was upon the defendants, and, so far as the evidence shows, Young\u2019s testimony was not to an agreement of which he knew, but only to one of which he had heard. In view of the inconclusive nature of this testimony, its value as proof was to be determined by the jury rather than by the court, and they could properly take into consideration the defendants\u2019 failure to show, by cross-examination of Eichhold or otherwise, the fact that there had been an interview, touching the question of extending the credit, at some time other than that testified to by Eichhold in his denial of the fact that an extension was then given. Our inquiry has not to do with the weight of the evidence, but only with regard to whether or not there was evidence sufficient to take the case to the jury (Kraus v. J. H. Mohlman Co., 18 Misc. Rep. 430, 42 N. Y. Supp. 23); and here, it appears, there was no ground for the dismissal of the complaint, as contended.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The appellants claim, further, that error was committed in the admission of evidence of statements made by Young and Bruns to the plaintiffs, prior to the time when the guaranty was given, to the effect that they were to constitute the firm of B. O. Young &amp; Co.; these statements having been made in the absence of the defendants. While prior to the giving of the guaranty, the statements were made in the course of the selection of goods by Young and Bruns at the plaintiffs\u2019 place of business, in full and expressed contemplation of the guaranty being furnished as a basis for their dealings. The evidence shows that this selection of goods took place in the month of April, and the guaranty was delivered on the loth of that month. Therefore such interval of time as there was could not have been great, and, at all events, nothing intervened to affect the nature of these earlier acts as a part of one complete transaction, to which the defendants\u2019 obligations extended. We think that the statements in question were properly admitted as a part of the res gestee, and so competent as against the defendants. Fox v. Parker, 44 Barb. 541, 547; Oppenheim v. Waterbury, 86 Hun, 122, 33 N. Y. Supp. 183; Bank v. Myles, 73 N. Y. 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Error is also assigned to the admission of the testimony of the plaintiff Miller that Young had stated to him, while this action was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>pending, that the firm of B. C. Young <em>Sc </em>Co. consisted of himself and Bruns. If offered as a declaration of the fact, this evidence was incompetent, since the statement testified to was made at a time when the whole transaction under the guaranty had been concluded, and Young\u2019s admissions could in no manner affect the defendants after that time, but the evidence was admitted for the limited purpose of contradicting Young\u2019s testimony, as taken by commission, that Bruns was not a member of the firm. It is true that the proper foundation for this evidence was not laid, in that Young had not been asked, so far as appears, whether he had made such a statement to Miller in the manner and at the time and place specified by the latter (Meyer v. Campbell, 1 Misc. Rep. 283, 20 N. Y. Supp. 705); but the objection to the question, as made, failed to point out this defect, which might otherwise have been obviated by proof at the trial, and a reversal of the judgment cannot be asked, therefore, upon this ground (Mead v. Shea, 92 N. Y. 122, 127). It may be that the necessary foundation for this question was contained in the deposition of Young, since it does not appear that the whole of such deposition was read in evidence at the trial, and, if it was not to be thus furnished, we cannot say that the respondents would have failed to obtain the required proof had their attention been called to the point, or, in the absence of an opportunity to obtain it, have withdrawn the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The remaining exception relied upon has to do with the propriety of an instruction given to the jury. A portion of the proof given by the plaintiffs to support the sale and delivery of goods to \u201cB. C. Young <em>&amp; </em>Co.\u201d or to \u201cYoung &amp; Bruns\u201d was found in a statement of account between these parties as buyers and sellers, which account was in evidence, supported by Young\u2019s admission of its correctness. In the course of the charge the following language was used by the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">\u201cA surety is not bound by the statement of a principal. If you procure a party to become your guarantor or surety,- the mere admission that you are indebted to the seller of goods in so much money would not bind the guarantor for such, but such evidence goes to make up what is called a prima \"facie case for the seller. He may rest upon that admission, and the burden then is upon the guarantor to show that the admission is not true.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The appellants\u2019 position is that the' admission of the principal was of no value, as proof against the suretv, and that the charge was in this respect erroneous; the contention being based upon the rule which is stated in Greenleaf on Evidence (volume 1, \u00a7 187) thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\">\u201cThe surety is considered as bound only for the actual conduct of the party, and not for whatever he might say he had done, and therefore is entitled to proof of his conduct by original evidence, when it can be had, excluding all declarations of the principal made subsequent to the acts to which they relate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">This rule, to obtain, was to be invoked when the evidence of Young\u2019s admission was offered; but that evidence was in fact received without objection, and was, accordingly, to be considered together with the other proof in the case. Crane v. Powell, 139 N. Y 379, 34 N. E. 911. As received in the case, the evidence was prima facie proof of the fact in question, and the jury were quite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>authorized to accept that proof as sufficient, in the absence of any controversion of it by the defendants. Had any evidence whatever been given for the defense, upon the issue of the alleged sale and delivery of the goods, it might be said that prejudice would have resulted to the defendants (appellants) from this instruction, since then the jury might have been led to give no effect to such evidence unless it was found to outweigh the plaintiffs\u2019 proof on the subject; but the defendants did not attempt to meet the plaintiffs\u2019 case in this aspect, and the jury were further instructed, without objection, that no such proof had been given. We think it may fairly be said, therefore, that the appellants had no substantial ground for objection to that part of the charge which we have noted, and, as a whole, the charge most fully set forth the obligation which rested upon the plaintiffs to prove all their allegations by the fair preponderance of the evidence. The recovery appears to be meritorious, and we find no ground for disturbing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
