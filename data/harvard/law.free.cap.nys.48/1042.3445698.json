The action is on a promissory note made by the defendants. On the 12th May, 1896, a summons in the ordinary form was issued by a justice of the peace of the town of Vestal, inBroome county, directed to any constable of Broome county, returnable on 20th May, 1896. This was duly returned personally served, on the defendants Ellen Baker and Charles J. Baker on May 13, 1896, by Floyd Warrick, constable of said towm. The return is in writing, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1060-16\">\u201cBroome County\u2014ss.: I hereby certify that on the 13th day of May, 1896,. I served the within summons on the within-named defendants, Charles J. Baker and Ellen Baker, by delivering to and leaving with them personally a true copy thereof. Floyd Warrick, Constable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1060-17\">On the return day the defendant Charles J. Baker appeared in person, for himself and for defendant Ellen Baker, and put in an answer for the defendants, which he subsequently withdrew.. His authority to appear for Ellen Baker was not shown. The plaintiff was called as a witness in his own behalf, and it appeared that he resided at Apalachin, in Tioga county. The defendant Charles J. Baker was-also called as a witness, and it appeared that Ellen Baker was his wife, but it did not appear where they resided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-18\">The return of the constable did not state the place where the summons was served. Presumptively it was served within the county of\" Broome. Potter v. Whittaker, 27 How. Prac. 10. The return complied with the statute. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2885. The section cited does not require the place of service to be stated. The general rule is-that the territorial limits of a justice\u2019s jurisdiction are co-extensive with the limits of the county in which he resides. 2 Wait, Law &amp;- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>Prac. 6. The ordinary process issued by him in a civil case may be served at any place within his county. Proof of such personal service gives the justice jurisdiction of the person of the defendant. Hoffman v. Barton, 47 Hun, 409. In Sperry v. Moore, 1 E. D. Smith, 361, it was said that when a suit is commenced in a justice\u2019s court by a long summons, personally served upon the defendant within the county, the residence of the defendant and jurisdiction of the court will be presumed. In Barnes v. Harris, 4 N. Y. 375, it is said that a court having authority to issue process prima facie acquires jurisdiction of the defendant by a personal service of such process in the manner required by law. In that case it was held that, in declaring upon a judgment rendered by a justice in a suit commenced by long summons, it is not necessary to allege that the defendant was a resident of the county; that, the summons having been duly issued and served by a constable of the county, the defendant is prima facie amenable to the jurisdiction. There are other cases that support the same view. Foster v. Hazen, 12 Barb. 547; Tiffany v. Gilbert, 4 Barb. 320, 324; Wilkinson v. Vorce, 41 Barb. 370, 374; Griffin v. Norton, 5 N. Y. St. Rep. 812. In the Tiffany Case it was said by Judge Gridley that the fact that the case was not tried in the proper town did not render the judgment void, but erroneous, and liable to be reversed on certiorari upon an assignment of error in fact. The office of justice of the peace is a constitutional one, and stands on a different basis from inferior local courts established under the provisions of section 14, art. 6, of the constitution of 1846, or section 18, art. 6, of present constitution. See Geraty v. Reid, 78 N. Y. 67. The doctrine of the Barnes Case has not, I think, been overruled. It was therefore the duty of the appellant, if any fact as to residence existed that deprived the justice of jurisdiction, to have shown such fact before the justice, or upon the appeal to the county court, as an error in fact. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 3057. Not having done this, the county court correctly affirmed the judgment. All concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">Judgment of the county court affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
