This application was made -on an affidavit by him, stating the nature and extent of the services rendered. The board of trustees fixed the relator\u2019s compensation at the sum of $20. The relator thereupon procured a writ of certiorari to review such action.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-16\">We think that the action of the board in fixing the relator\u2019s compensation was not judicial, as in the case of the audit of a claim against the village, but legislative or administrative. The direction that the board of trustees shall fix the compensation of the members of the board of health is, in effect and in intent, a direction that it shall fix their salaries. The action -of public officers or .local or other authorities, in determining the. amount of salaries that shall be paid to their subordinates or to other public officials, though requiring the exercise of judgment and discretion, is not judicial, in the proper and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>accurate sense of the term in which it is employed when we say that the judicial determinations or decisions by subordinate tribunals are subject to review by this court. Such action is administrative or legislative, and certiorari will not lie to review it. People v. Board of Sup\u2019rs of Queens Co., 131 N. Y. 468, 30 N. E. 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The writ should be dismissed, with \u00a710 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
