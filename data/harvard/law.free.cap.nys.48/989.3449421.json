Otherwise he may assume that only questions of law are to be raised, and the record need only contain sufficient evidence to support the rulings of the court below. But in this ease the respondent concedes that in fact the case does contain all the evidence; and therefore we think that, as matter of favor, the appellant ought to have been given the privilege of amending his proposed case so as to contain such a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-14\">The order appealed from should be reversed, and the motion granted, on payment by appellant of $10 costs, and inserting the exhibits to be designated by the respondent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
