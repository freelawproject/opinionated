Hart, Texas prisoner #769108, appeals from the district court\u2019s order granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. We granted Hart leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) after the district court had certified that his appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-20\">Hart asserted that the defendants retaliated against him for exercising his First Amendment right to file a grievance and to complain to a prison administrator about the alleged misconduct of defendant Hair-ston. He alleged that, only days after making such complaints, Hairston filed a disciplinary report against Hart charging him with \u201cknowingly making false statements for the purpose of harming another person.\u201d Hart maintained that defendant Thomas accepted the disciplinary charge, that he was convicted in a disciplinary proceeding over which defendant Craig presided, and that he was punished with 27 days of commissary and cell restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-21\">Section 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), Title 28, permits a district court to dismiss a prisoner\u2019s IFP complaint \u201cat any time if the court determines that \u2014 (B) the action or appeal \u2014 ... (ii) fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted!)]\u201d We review a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) dismissal <em>de novo, </em>applying the standard used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>for Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.Sd 732, 734 (5th Cir.1998); <em>see Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 718 n. 3 (5th Cir.1999). \u201cTo test whether the district court\u2019s dismissal under \u00a7 1915[ (e)(2)(B)(ii) ] was proper, this Court must assume that all of the plaintiffs factual allegations are true.\u201d <em>Bradley v. Puckett, </em>157 F.3d 1022, 1025 (5th Cir.1998). \u201cThe district court\u2019s dismissal may be upheld, \u2018only if it appears that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proven consistent with the allegations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">To the extent that the district court\u2019s order was based on the evidentiary submissions of the parties, we review <em>de novo </em>that court\u2019s order granting a party\u2019s summary-judgment motion. <em>Whittaker v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., </em>206 F.3d 532, 534 (5th Cir.2000). Summary judgment is proper if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with any affidavits filed in support of the motion, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The moving party bears the burden of showing the district court that there is an absence of evidence to support the non-moving party\u2019s case. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). If the moving party meets the initial burden of showing that there is no genuine issue, the burden shifts to the nonmovant to set forth specific facts showing the existence of a genuine issue for trial. Rule 56(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">\u201cTo state a valid claim for retaliation under section 1983, a prisoner must allege (1) a specific constitutional right, (2) the defendant\u2019s intent to retaliate against the prisoner for his or her exercise of that right, (3) a retaliatory adverse act, and (4) causation.\u201d <em>Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 324-25 (5th Cir.1999). \u201cThe law of this circuit is clearly established ... that a prison official may not retaliate against ... an inmate ... for complaining to a supervisor about a guard\u2019s misconduct.\u201d <em>Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1164 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Jackson v. Cain, </em>864 F.2d 1235, 1248 (5th Cir.1989). Hart established a \u201cchronology of events\u201d showing retaliatory motive on the part of defendant Hairston, as the disciplinary charge filed by Hair-ston was accompanied by Hart\u2019s \u201cletter of resolution\u201d in which he accused Hairston of misconduct and lying. <em>See Woods, </em>60 F.3d at 1166. The 27 days of commissary and cell restrictions that directly resulted constituted an \u201cadverse act,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and causation was shown by the direct link between Hart\u2019s complaints and the punishment he received. <em>See McDonald v. Steward, </em>132 F.3d 225, 231 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">The defendants argue that the \u201cadverse act\u201d suffered by Hart was <em>de minimis. </em>Although we have not specifically addressed the quantum of injury necessary to constitute an \u201cadverse act\u201d for purposes of a retaliation claim, the penalties imposed on Hart do not qualify as <em>\u201cde min-imis </em>\u201d under various standards cited by other circuits. <em>See, e.g., Thaddeus-X v. Blatter, </em>175 F.3d 378, 396 (6th Cir.1999) (\u201caction comparable to transfer to administrative segregation would certainly be adverse\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>The defendants also argue that Hart failed to produce \u201ccompetent summary judgment evidence\u201d showing that his accusations against Hairston were not in fact false, which allegedly negated any \u201cbut for\u201d causation with respect to Hairston\u2019s filing of the disciplinary report. It is true that a disciplinary report, like that filed against Hart, may be \u201cprobative and potent summary judgment evidence\u201d to prove the allegations contained in it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Woods, </em>60 F.3d at 1166. Hart, however, attached to his original complaint a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that \u201cthe foregoing is true and correct.\u201d On summary judgment, factual allegations set forth in a verified complaint may be treated the same as when they are contained in an affidavit. <em>See Huckabay v. Moore, </em>142 F.3d 233, 240 n. 6 (5th Cir.1998); <em>King v. Dogan, </em>31 F.3d 344, 346 (5th Cir.1994); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746. In his verified complaint, Hart explicitly alleged that, on February 14, 2001, Hairston told him to lie to inspectors about the sanitization of pots and pans at the prison. It was this same allegation, as set forth in a February 15, 2001, \u201cletter of resolution\u201d to the prison\u2019s Food Service Director, that resulted in the filing of a disciplinary report against Hart. The verified allegation in Hart\u2019s complaint was competent summary-judgment evidence to counter the disciplinary report, and it created a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the issue of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">As Hart stated a cognizable retaliation claim against defendant Hairston, and genuine issues of material fact remain as to the various elements of this court\u2019s retaliation standard, the district court erred in granting the defendants\u2019 summary-judgment motion with respect to defendant Hairston. Furthermore, Hairston was not entitled to qualified immunity because, as noted above, the right to be free from retaliation of the sort alleged by Hart was \u201cclearly established\u201d by the 1980s, <em>see Woods, </em>60 F.3d at 1164 &amp; n. 12, and defendant Hairston\u2019s conduct, as alleged by Hart, was not objectively reasonable. <em>See Petta v. Rivera, </em>143 F.3d 895, 899 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 819, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). Accordingly, with respect to Hart\u2019s retaliation claim against Hairston, we vacate and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Hart did not sufficiently establish the elements of a retaliation claim with respect to defendants Thomas and Craig. Their mere involvement in the disciplinary proceedings against him, without more, does not establish either retaliatory motive or causation. <em>See Jones, </em>188 F.3d at 324-25. We affirm the granting of summary judgment with respect to defendants Thomas and Craig.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">To the extent that the district court\u2019s order denied Hart\u2019s own motion for partial summary judgment, we likewise affirm, in that genuine issues of material fact remain.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b766-7\">. The district court concluded that Hart had produced \"no competent summary judgment evidence\u201d to show that he actually suffered these sanctions. This was error. Hart submitted a declaration, sworn to \"under penalty of perjury\u201d in which he asserted that he in fact served the 27 days of commissary and cell restrictions. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, this is competent sworn testimony for summary-judgment purposes. <em>See Nissho-Iwai American Corp. v. Kline, </em>845 F.2d 1300, 1306 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b767-5\">. As neither Hart nor the appellees have addressed whether the subsequent overturning of the disciplinary conviction in this case rendered the disciplinary report ineffectual as summary-judgment evidence, we do not address this legal issue at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
