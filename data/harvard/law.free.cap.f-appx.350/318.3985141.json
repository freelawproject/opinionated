(CSXT) appeals the one-page order of the district court dated December 16, 2008, dissolving its preliminary injunction from the imposition of Alabama\u2019s sales and use tax on diesel fuel. The district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed CSXT\u2019s case on the basis that <em>Norfolk Southern Railway Co. v. Alabama Dept. of Rev., </em>550 F.3d 1306 (11th Cir.2008) was dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-16\">CSXT asserts that the sales and use tax on diesel fuel discriminates against railroad companies in violation of Section 306(l)(d) of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11501(b)(4) (Section 306). CSXT concedes that the <em>Norfolk Southern </em>panel considered an identical challenge by the Norfolk Southern railroad to the sales and use tax on railroad diesel fuel under Section 306, and ruled in favor of the Alabama revenue department.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-17\">CSXT further concedes that the three-judge panel assigned to hear this appeal is bound by the panel\u2019s decision in <em>Norfolk </em>Southern<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree. We affirm the judgment of the district court. See <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number><em>States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-10\">. CSXT filed a petition for hearing <em>en banc </em>of this case, pursuant to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. No judge in regular service in this court requested that the court be polled on hearing <em>en banc; </em>the petition for hearing <em>en banc </em>has been denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
