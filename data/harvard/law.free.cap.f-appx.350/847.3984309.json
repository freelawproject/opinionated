He also moves this court for the appointment of counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-22\">Bryant\u2019s motion for leave to appeal IFP is construed as a challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that the appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>court\u2019s inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves \u2018legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1988) (citation omitted). If the court upholds the district court\u2019s certification that the appeal is not taken in good faith, Bryant must pay the appellate filing fee or the appeal will be dismissed for want of prosecution. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. However, if the appeal is frivolous, this court may dismiss it sua sponte under 5th Cir. R. 42.2. <em>Id. </em>at n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">To the extent that Bryant has not waived the argument by failing to properly brief it, the record before this court supports the district court\u2019s determination that Bryant\u2019s excessive-force claim properly was dismissed for failure to exhaust. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e. Because the appeal does not present any legal points arguable on their merits, Bryant\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied and the appeal dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24. Bryant\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel also is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b871-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
