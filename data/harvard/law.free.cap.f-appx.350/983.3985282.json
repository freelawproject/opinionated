Dettman, </em>No. 7:94-CV-149 (W.D.Tex. Sept. 21, 1994) (dismissed as frivolous); <em>Dedrick v. Hyde, </em>No. 7:95-CV-221 (W.D.Tex. Mar. 11, 1996) (dismissed as frivolous); <em>Dedrick v. Painter, </em>No. 7:95-CV-93 (W.D.Tex. July 27,1995) (dismissed as frivolous); <em>Dedrick v. Painter, </em>No. 7:96-CV-37 (W.D.Tex. Mar. 6, 1997) (dismissed as frivolous). The district court improvidently granted Dedrick leave to proceed IFP on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-20\">Accordingly, Dedrick\u2019s IFP status is decertified, and the appeal is dismissed. Dedrick has 15 days from the date of this opinion to pay the full appellate filing fee to the clerk of the district court, should he wish to reinstate his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-21\">IFP DECERTIFIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1007-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
