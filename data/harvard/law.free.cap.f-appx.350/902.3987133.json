Kates was convicted by a jury of posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>sion with intent to distribute cocaine base. Kates argues that he is entitled to have his sentence reduced pursuant to Amendment 709, which addressed two areas of the Guidelines\u2019 criminal history rules. Kates does not dispute that the amendment went into effect after he was sentenced and that it is not listed by the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 as a guideline amendment that applies retroactively. He argues, however, that the district court was not limited by the Guidelines\u2019 list of retroactively applicable amendments because, after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Guidelines are advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of Kates\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 28-29 (5th Cir.1994). Amendment 709, on which Kates relies for his \u00a7 3582(c) motion, is not listed as an amendment covered by the policy statement in \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(c). Therefore, the plain language of \u00a7 3582(c) dictated that the district court was not authorized to reduce a sentence based on Amendment 709 because that would be inconsistent with Sentencing Commission policy. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B.10, comment, (n. 1); \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Moreover, this court has held that <em>\u201cBooker </em>does not alter the mandatory character of \u00a7 lBl.lO\u2019s limitations on sentence reductions.\u201d <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.2009). Kates has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b926-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
