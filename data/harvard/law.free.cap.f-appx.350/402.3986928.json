There are two issues presented on appeal, which we address in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-20\">Ortiz asserts the sentence imposed was substantively unreasonable under the factors stated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Specifically, Ortiz claims he should have been given a downward variance from the Sentencing Guidelines range because of the hardships he endured during his voyage from the Dominican Republic to Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-21\">A defendant\u2019s sentence is reviewed for substantive reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence is substantively unreasonable \u201cif it does not achieve the purposes of sentencing stated in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations omitted). The analysis \u201cinvolves examining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2848, 174 L.Ed.2d 568 (2009). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Ortiz has not met his burden of demonstrating the district court abused its discretion. Ortiz fails to identify how his argument, regarding the hardships he endured during his voyage from the Dominican Republic to Florida, addresses the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a) and why the district court\u2019s decision fails to achieve those purposes. Ortiz merely asserts, through conclusory statements, that his trauma entitles him to a downward variance without citing any precedent or policy arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a sentence at the low end of the Sentencing Guidelines range. The district court\u2019s sentence was reasonable in light of both the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court\u2019s sentence of 57 months fell within the applicable Guidelines range of 57 to 71 months and was less than half the statutory maximum of ten years. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788 (stating \u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one\u201d), <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005) (emphasizing the fact the defendant\u2019s sentence was only one-tenth the length of the statutory maximum sentence). Ortiz\u2019s sentence is reasonable, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Although neither party raises the issue, we may raise the issue of clerical errors in the judgment <em>sua sponte </em>and remand with instructions for the district court correct the errors. <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>190 F.3d 1247, 1252 (11th Cir.1999) (noting because a judgment listing an incorrect statute could not stand as entered, the judgment should be vacated and remanded to the district court for correction of the clerical error); <em>United States v. Anderton, </em>136 F.3d 747, 751 (11th Cir.1998) (remanding to the district court with directions to correct clerical error where the statute cited in judgment was incorrect). Remanding to the district court is essential because \u201c[i]t is fundamental error for a court to enter a judgment of conviction against a defendant who has not been charged, tried, or found guilty of the crimes recited in the judgment.\u201d <em>Diaz, </em>190 F.3d at 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">Ortiz was indicted for violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(1). This statute penalizes the l-eentry of removed aliens. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. During Ortiz\u2019s guilty plea, the district court identified the charge as \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(1), and Ortiz pled guilty to that charge. Nevertheless, when the district court issued the judgment, the applicable statutes were listed as 6 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 202(3), 202(4), and 557. Section 202 references the responsibilities of the Secretary for Border and Transportation Security. On the other hand, section 557 regards the process of the transition into the Department of Homeland Security. These statutes do not contain any criminal provisions, and are inapplicable. <em>See </em>6 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 202, 557. Lastly, as further evidence of the error, the judgment lists the nature of the offense as \u201calien, having previously been removed, was found to be in U.S. without lawful authority.\u201d This description of the offense demonstrates the district court intended to list \u00a7 1326 as the applicable statute. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 (\u201cReentry of removed aliens\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>There is no apparent reason why the correction would harm Ortiz. <em>See Diaz, </em>190 F.3d at 1252 (stating the only limitation upon correcting the errors is that correction of the judgment must \u201cnot prejudice the defendant in any reversible way\u201d)- If anything, having accurate records will be to Ortiz\u2019s benefit. Consequently, remand is appropriate because the judgment lists the incorrect statutes and we vacate and remand for the limited purpose of the correcting the clerical error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
