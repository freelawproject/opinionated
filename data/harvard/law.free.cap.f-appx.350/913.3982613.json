He asserts that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because counsel failed to move to suppress the fruits of an unconstitutional search and seizure. We review an ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal \u201conly when it was raised before the district court and the record provides sufficient details for review.\u201d <em>United States v. Puckett, </em>505 F.3d 377, 387 (5th Cir.2007), <em>aff'd in part on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1428, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Because Banda did not raise his claim in the district court, we decline to review it. <em>See id. </em>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b937-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
