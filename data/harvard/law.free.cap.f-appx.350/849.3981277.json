Cornett sought the writ to challenge sentences imposed in 1998 on offenses related to drug trafficking. Cornett has also moved to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-19\">A COA is not required for Cornett to appeal the denial of a writ of audita querela. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). Accordingly, Cornett\u2019s request for a COA is denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-20\">Cornett contends that his sentences, imposed prior to the decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), violate the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments because the district court, rather than the jury, determined facts that resulted in a sentence of life imprisonment. He asserts that, at the time of his direct appeal, there was no existing legal basis to challenge the constitutionality of the Sentencing Guidelines. Cornett, who has previously litigated a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, argues that he may pursue relief through the writ of audita querela.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-21\">The district court correctly denied Cornett\u2019s petition for a writ of audita querela because Cornett may pursue relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Banda, </em>1 F.3d 354, 356 (5th Cir.1993). Cornett\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-22\">COA DENIED AS UNNECESSARY; IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b874-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
