The district court dismissed Simkins\u2019s complaint because he failed to exhaust administrative remedies. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-24\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b976-25\">Simkins was incarcerated in the Hays County Jail from April 7, 2008, through June 12, 2008, on charges of forgery and theft for which counsel, Kelly Higgins, was appointed on April 10, 2008. On April 16, 2008, Simkins filed a grievance against the Hays County Sheriffs Office, contending that his due process rights were being violated because jail officials were denying him access to law library research material. In his grievance submission, Simkins failed to indicate that he was proceeding <em>pro se </em>in cases other than the criminal matters for which he was being held in the Hays County Jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-26\">The next day, the jail\u2019s Grievance Board issued a decision finding that Simkins was not entitled to use of a law library so long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>as he was represented by counsel. Instead of appealing the Grievance Board\u2019s decision, Simkins filed suit on May 6, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">We review a district court\u2019s dismissal of a civil rights claim for failure to exhaust administrative remedies <em>de novo. Carbe v. Lappin, </em>492 F.3d 325, 327 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">B. The District Court\u2019s Dismissal</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">On appeal, Simkins challenges the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to exhaust his administrative claims against Sheriff Bridges. Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, inmates must exhaust \u201csuch administrative remedies as are available\u201d prior to bringing a civil action. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Regardless of the relief sought, a prisoner must pursue the prison grievance procedure to its conclusion before filing a \u00a7 1983 suit. <em>Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 739, 741 n. 6, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001). The \u201cexhaustion requirement applies to all inmate suits about prison life, whether they involve general circumstances or particular episodes, and whether they allege excessive force or some other wrong.\u201d <em>Porter v. Nussle, </em>534 U.S. 516, 532, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">There is a dispute as to which grievance process was in effect when Simkins filed his grievance. Sheriff Bridges contends that the Hays County grievance process in effect when Simkins filed his grievance provided a three-step procedure for presenting a grievance. First, the inmate must deliver a written statement to the Grievance Officer, who then consults with the Grievance Board on which action to follow within ten working days. Second, if the inmate is not satisfied with the grievance response, he must submit to the Jail Lieutenant or Captain a written appeal within five working days. Upon receipt of the appeal, a Grievance Review Board will review the response within ten working days. Finally, the inmate can appeal the decision of the Grievance Review Board to the Sheriff, who must respond within fifteen working days. In contrast, Simkins contends that the Hays County grievance procedure in effect at the time he filed his grievance provided no grievance appeal process and as result the district court erred when it concluded that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before filing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">The district court found that \u201cregardless of which plan was in effect, plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies.\u201d We disagree -with this finding. Under the grievance plan that Simkins claims was in effect at the time that he filed his grievance, there was no grievance appeal process available. That grievance plan only provided inmates an appeal for disciplinary matters, not for grievances. A careful review of the record, however, indicates that the Hays County grievance process which afforded inmates appeals during the grievance process was in effect since at least July 26, 2002, well before Simkins arrived at the Hays County Jail. Therefore, Simkins\u2019s claims are governed by the grievance process relied upon by Sheriff Bridges.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-13\">As detailed above, that grievance process required Simkins to file an appeal to the Grievance Review Board and to Sheriff Bridges prior to instituting his \u00a7 1983 suit. The record reveals that he failed to do both. Simkins\u2019s alleged ignorance of the proper procedure is not an excuse. <em>Thomas v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, </em>No. CIYA CV05-1222, 2006 WL 3861962, at <em>*2 </em>(W.D.La. Dec.13, 2006) (holding that a prisoner\u2019s \u201calleged ignorance [of the grievance process] is not an excuse [for failure to follow the grievance process] as no exceptions have been read into \u00a7 1997e(a)\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>Therefore, Simkins\u2019s failure to pursue his grievance remedy to conclusion constitutes a failure to exhaust his administrative remedies and his lawsuit is barred under \u00a7 1997e(a). <em>Wright v. Hollingsworth, </em>260 F.3d 357, 358 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"A5k\">Having determined that Simkins failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b976-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
