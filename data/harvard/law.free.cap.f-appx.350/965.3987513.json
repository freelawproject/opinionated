The magistrate judge ruled that no condition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure Bruteyn\u2019s presence at trial. The district court ruled that the rebuttable presumption of detention set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142(e) is applicable and had not been rebutted, that Bruteyn will be a danger to the community if he were released pending trial, and that no condition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure his presence at judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-26\">A judicial officer may order a defendant detained pending trial if the officer finds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>by a preponderance of the evidence, that \u201cno condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person,\u201d or, by clear and convincing evidence, that \u201cno condition of combination of conditions will reasonably assure ... the safety of any other person and the community.\u201d \u00a7 3142(e), (f); <em>see United States v. Fortna, </em>769 F.2d 243, 250 (5th Cir.1985). Absent an error of law, we will uphold a district court\u2019s pretrial detention order if it is supported by the proceedings in that court. <em>United States v. Rueben, </em>974 F.2d 580, 586 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">The determination of the magistrate judge and the district court that the government had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or combination of conditions could reasonably assure Bruteyn\u2019s presence at judicial proceedings is supported by the record. <em>See United States v. Westbrook, </em>780 F.2d 1185, 1189-90 (5th Cir.1986); <em>Fortna, </em>769 F.2d at 250. Although Bruteyn argues that the ruling that the rebuttable presumption was applicable is erroneous and that the determination that he is a danger to the community is not supported by written factual findings or legal analysis, we do not reach those issues.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Instead, we affirm the detention order on the district court\u2019s alternative finding that no condition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure Bruteyn\u2019s presence at future judicial proceedings. <em>See United States v.
