On appeal, Alvarez-Sanchez argues that the district court erred by denying his motion without holding an evidentiary hearing. He also argues that the district court erred by denying his claims that his guilty plea was unknowing and, thus, invalid because: (1) no one informed him of his right to contact the Mexican Consulate after his arrest, pursuant to Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (\u201cVCCR\u201d); and (2) his attorney did not inform him that he could be deported after serving his term of imprisonment. For the reasons set forth below, we vacate and remand in part, and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Alvarez-Sanchez alleged, among other things, that he received ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) because his attorney failed to communicate a plea offer that the government had extended to him in November 2004. He explained that he did not learn of this plea offer until his appellate attorney sent him documents from his case. During Alvarez-Sanchez\u2019s review of these documents, he discovered the written November 2004 plea offer. Had he known of this plea offer, he would have accepted it because it would have permitted him to plead guilty only to Count 1 of the indictment, while the offer he ultimately accepted required him to plead guilty to two of the counts in the indictment. Alvarez-Sanchez submitted a copy of the November 2004 plea offer in support of his \u00a7 2255 motion. In his motion, Alvarez-Sanchez also claimed that his guilty plea was unknowing and, therefore, invalid because no one informed him of his rights under Article 36 of the VCCR, or of the fact that he could be deported after completing his term of imprisonment. He requested that the court hold an evidentiary hearing regarding his \u00a7 2255 motion. Also in his motion, Alvarez-Sanchez signed a statement in which he swore under penalty of perjury that all of the statements that he made therein were true.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-15\">The government responded, asserting that Alvarez-Sanehez\u2019s ineffectiveness claim lacked merit because his attorney, Patrick D. Deering, had communicated the November 2004 plea offer to him. The government attached Deering\u2019s affidavit to its response. In his affidavit, Deering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>averred that he had communicated the November 2004 plea offer to Alvarez-Sanchez, but Alvarez-Sanehez had rejected the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The district court denied Alvarez-Sanchez\u2019s ineffectiveness claim based solely on Deering\u2019s affidavit. The court also denied all of Alvarez-Sanchez\u2019s remaining claims, as well as his request for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">We issued a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) as to the following issue only: Whether the district court abused its discretion by relying on an affidavit submitted by the government that contradicted Alvarez-Sanchez\u2019s allegations?</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">As an initial matter, it is noted that the COA does not specify which of the claims that Alvarez-Sanehez raised in his \u00a7 2255 motion was erroneously decided based solely on an affidavit. The district court, however, relied solely on Deering\u2019s affidavit only in denying Alvarez-Sanchez\u2019s claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel due to his attorney\u2019s failure to communicate a plea offer. The court did not rely solely on Deering\u2019s affidavit in denying Alvarez-Sanchez\u2019s additional claims. Accordingly, we discuss whether the district court abused its discretion in connection with only Alvarez-Sanchez\u2019s claim regarding the plea offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">Where a petitioner challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his request for an evidentiary hearing regarding his habeas petition, we review the district court\u2019s ruling for abuse of discretion. <em>See Aron v. United States, </em>291 F.3d 708, 714-15 n. 5 (11th Cir.2002). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9CE\">Unless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the United States attorney, grant a prompt hearing thereon, determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(b). \u201c[I]f the petitioner alleges facts that, if true, would entitle him to relief, then the district court should order an evidentiary hearing and rule on the merits of his claim.\u201d <em>Aron, </em>291 F.3d at 714-15 (quotation omitted). In addition, a court is required to liberally construe a <em>pro se </em>petitioner\u2019s claim. <em>Diaz v. United States, </em>930 F.2d 832, 834 (11th Cir.1991). In <em>Aron, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-12\">The law is clear that, in order to be entitled to an evidentiary hearing, a petitioner need only allege-not prove-reasonably specific, non-conclusory facts that, if true, would entitle him to relief. If the allegations are not affirmatively contradicted by the record and the claims are not patently frivolous, the district court is required to hold an evidentiary hearing. It is in such a hearing that the petitioner must offer proof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">291 F.3d at 715 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">Ordinarily, contested factual issues in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding may not be determined based only on affidavits. <em>Owens v. United States, </em>551 F.2d 1053, 1054 (5th Cir.1977) (affirming the district court\u2019s denial of the petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and noting that, although a disputed factual issue ordinarily cannot be decided based only on an affidavit, the affidavit that the district court had relied on was corroborated by other record evidence); <em>see also Jordan v. Estelle, </em>594 F.2d 144, 145-46 (5th Cir.1979) (holding that the district court erred in denying a \u00a7 2254 petition because it had improperly resolved a disputed factual issue based solely on an affidavit filed by the petitioner\u2019s attorney, and there was no record evidence that corroborated the attorney\u2019s affidavit); <em>Montgomery v. United States, </em>469 F.2d 148, 150 (5th Cir.1972) (holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>that \u201ccontested fact[ual] issues in \u00a7 2255 cases must be decided on the basis of an evidentiary hearing, not affidavits\u201d). A district court is not required to hold a hearing, however, where the petitioner\u2019s claims are clearly contradicted by the record or are patently frivolous. <em>Aron, </em>291 F.3d at 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Here, although the government produced Deering\u2019s sworn affidavit, in which he averred that he communicated the November 2004 plea offer to Alvarez-Sanchez, Alvarez-Sanchez made a sworn statement that Deering did not communicate this plea offer. The district court, however, relied solely on Deering\u2019s affidavit in denying Alvarez-Sanchez\u2019s claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel due to his attorney\u2019s failure to communicate a plea offer. The record does not include any documents that corroborate Deering\u2019s affidavit, or any documents that affirmatively contradict Alvarez-Sanchez\u2019s claim that his attorney did not inform him of the November 2004 plea offer. Moreover, as discussed below, Alvarez-Sanchez\u2019s ineffective assistance claim concerning the plea offer is not patently frivolous. Thus, because a district court ordinarily should not resolve a disputed factual issue in a habeas proceeding based solely on an affidavit, the district court abused its discretion in denying Alvarez-Sanchez\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing as long as he alleged facts that, if true, would have entitled him to relief. Accordingly, it is necessary to consider whether the facts Alvarez-Sanchez alleged in his \u00a7 2255 motion would, if true, permit him to prevail on his ineffective assistance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">In <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>the Supreme Court set forth a two-part inquiry for ineffective assistance of counsel claims: \u201cFirst, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). A habeas petitioner claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must succeed on both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>Butcher v. United States, </em>368 F.3d 1290, 1293 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The Supreme Court has provided the following explanation regarding <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>application in the guilty plea context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">In the context of guilty pleas, the first half of the <em>Strickland </em>[ ] test is nothing more than a restatement of the standard of attorney competence .... [t]he second, or \u2018prejudice,\u2019 requirement, on the other hand, focuses on whether counsel\u2019s constitutionally ineffective performance affected the outcome of the plea process. In other words, in order to satisfy the \u201cprejudice\u201d requirement, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AmZ\"><em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 58-59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 370, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">We have held that \u201cCounsel has an obligation to consult with his client on important decisions and to keep him informed of important developments in the course of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Diaz, </em>930 F.2d at 834. This obligation includes the duty to inform a defendant of any plea offers. <em>See id. </em>at 834-35; <em>see also Beckham v. Wainwright, </em>639 F.2d 262, 267 (5th Cir. Unit B Mar. 1981) (holding that, where a defendant pleads guilty or withdraws a guilty plea, his attorney must inform him of all of the available options and possible consequences, and the failure to do so can fall outside the range of competence required by attorneys in criminal cases); <em>Stano v. Dugger, </em>921 F.2d 1125, 1146 (11th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>1991) (holding that, \u201c[t]he defendant remains the master of his case, particularly with respect to the entry of a guilty plea\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Alvarez-Sanchez\u2019s assertion that Deering did not communicate a plea offer to him, if true, would establish that his attorney rendered a constitutionally deficient performance. In addition, if Alvarez-Sanchez\u2019s assertion that he would have accepted the November 2004 plea offer is true, he would satisfy <em>Strickland's </em>prejudice prong. Thus, Alvarez-Sanchez alleged facts in his \u00a7 2255 motion that, if true, would have entitled him to relief, and the district court abused its discretion by rejecting Alvarez-Sanchez\u2019s claim based solely on Deering\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Accordingly, we vacate and remand as to this issue so that the district court may conduct an evidentiary hearing. At the hearing, the district court should determine whether Alvarez-Sanchez\u2019s attorney communicated the November 2004 plea offer, and whether Alvarez-Sanchez\u2019s claim that he would have accepted this offer is credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), a petitioner must obtain a COA before he can appeal the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). We have jurisdiction to review only those issues specified in the COA. <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998); <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 335-36, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1039, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (\u00a7 2254 context).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">As noted above, the COA specified only the following issue for review: \u201cWhether the district court abused its discretion by relying on an affidavit submitted by the government that contradicted Alvarez-Sanchez\u2019s allegations?\u201d The district court did not rely solely on an affidavit in denying Alvarez-Sanchez\u2019s claims regarding Article 36 of the VCCR or his attorney\u2019s failure to inform him that he could be deported after completing his sentence. Thus, these claims do not fall within the scope of the COA, and we lack jurisdiction to consider Alvarez-Sanchez\u2019s arguments concerning these claims on appeal. Accordingly, we dismiss these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">Because Alvarez-Sanchez alleged facts in his \u00a7 2255 motion that, if true, would have entitled him to relief, the district court abused its discretion by relying solely on his trial attorney\u2019s affidavit to deny his ineffectiveness claim regarding the November 2004 plea offer. Accordingly, we vacate and remand so that the district court may hold an evidentiary hearing as to the issue. We dismiss the remaining arguments that Alvarez-Sanchez raises on appeal because they fall outside the scope of the COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
