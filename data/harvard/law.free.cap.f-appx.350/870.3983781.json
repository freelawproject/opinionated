Rogers, Texas prisoner # 1348848 proceeding <em>pro se </em>and <em>in forma pauperis, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims, in which he alleged that Judge Sim Lake violated his civil rights by deciding not to review his original civil rights claims and in transferring his case to the Galveston district court. At the district court, Rogers also alleged that several other parties, including the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, a warden, a lieutenant, and Major Castillo violated his rights. The district court dismissed all of Rogers\u2019s claims as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-14\">On appeal, Rogers only addresses the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims against Judge Lake, and he does not address his claims against the other parties. Because Rogers does not brief the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims against these parties, he has abandoned any appellate argument on these claims. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-15\">In his brief, Rogers does not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that the claim against Judge Lake is barred by absolute immunity because Judge Lake\u2019s actions were within his role as a federal judge and his jurisdictional powers. Instead, Rogers merely repeats his earlier allegations that the judge violated his rights, and he only cites authority that generally addresses judicial immunity without any application of this law to the facts of his case. As such, Rogers has failed to brief any argument challenging the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissal and has abandoned his only grounds for appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"ABu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>Rogers\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983) (per curiam). Because the appeal is frivolous it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cm. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Rogers\u2019s complaint and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Rogers has previously accumulated two strikes in <em>Rogers v. Police Chief Wooldridge, </em>255 Fed.Appx. 862, 863 (5th Cir.2007). Because Rogers has now accumulated more than three strikes, he is barred from proceeding <em>informa pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b895-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
