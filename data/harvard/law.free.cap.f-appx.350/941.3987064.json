Bishop appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his retaliation, Eighth Amendment, and Due Process claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b966-16\">Bishop, a state inmate, alleges that he suffers from a psychological disorder that causes him to cut himself with razor blades. Because of the disorder, Bishop was admitted to the Program for the Aggressive Mentally 111 Offender (PAMIO) at the Bill Clements Unit in 2000. He was discharged from the program in 2002 and subsequently sued the PAMIO medical officials on deliberate indifference and retaliation grounds. The district court dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous in 2005. In January 2005, Bishop was again transferred to the Clements Unit. A few days later, however, Dr. David Karney recommended that Bishop be transferred out of the Clements Unit, citing Bishop\u2019s previous litigation and conflict between Bishop and Clements Unit staff as the reasons for withdrawal. Vanessa Jones, Vice Chairman of Classification and Records for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, finalized Bishop\u2019s transfer out of the unit based on this recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-17\">In August 2005, Bishop submitted a Step 1 grievance seeking a transfer back to the Clements Unit, where he would not have access to razors. Lindsay Lewis, a grievance investigator at the Wynne Unit, rejected his grievance as untimely. Bishop then submitted a Step 2 grievance. Bobbie Barnett, the Assistant Director of Offender Grievances for the Wynne Unit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>rejected the Step 2 grievance. Barnett signed the rejection on behalf of Brian Clendennen, the Director of Offender Grievances for the Wynne Unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Bishop, proceeding pro se and <em>in forma pauperis, </em>filed suit against Jones, Clendennen, Barnett, and Lewis in their individual capacities. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants and dismissed Bishop\u2019s claims. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">We review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Summary judgment is appropriate where the competent summary judgment evidence demonstrates that there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">Bishop contends that defendants\u2019 actions in transferring him out of the Clements Unit and denying his grievances exhibited deliberate indifference to his health and safety. The district court found that no deliberate indifference was shown since the uncontroverted evidence showed that defendants lacked authority to override Dr. Harney\u2019s recommendation that Bishop be transferred out of the Clements Unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-16\">To sustain an Eighth Amendment claim based on the denial of medical treatment, a prisoner must show that prison officials \u201cacted with deliberate indifference to his health or safety.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To act with deliberate indifference, a prison official must know that an inmate faces \u201ca substantial risk of serious harm and disregard[ ] that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mere negligent treatment of a medical condition does not rise to the level of deliberate indifference.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A prisoner\u2019s \u201c[disagreement with medical treatment does not state a claim for Eighth Amendment indifference to medical needs.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rather, the prisoner must show \u201cthat prison officials refused to treat him, ignored his complaints, intentionally treated him incorrectly, or engaged in any similar conduct.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-17\">We conclude that there is no record evidence to support a showing that defendants acted with deliberate indifference. Jones provided an affidavit explaining that she did not have authority to deny transfer requests that were based on the medical recommendations of licensed medical providers. Her decision, based on a doctor\u2019s advice, does not \u201cclearly evince a wanton disregard for [Bishop\u2019s] serious medical needs.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Similarly, the employees reviewing Bishop\u2019s grievance did not act with deliberate indifference, as their actions were based on Dr. Ramey\u2019s recommendation and the untimeliness of Bishop\u2019s grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>Moreover, Bishop\u2019s transfer from the Clements Unit did not result in a denial of medical treatment. The record reflects that Bishop received numerous medical visits and ongoing mental health treatment for his self-mutilation. As such, Bishop has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to his deliberate indifference claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Bishop next asserts that Jones transferred him out of the Clements Unit in retaliation for his previous litigation against the medical staff in that unit. The district court found that Bishop had failed to establish any evidence of a retaliatory motive and granted summary judgment for Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">To establish a claim of retaliation, a prisoner must show: \u201c(1) a specific constitutional right, (2) the defendant\u2019s intent to retaliate against the prisoner for his or her exercise of that right, (3) a retaliatory adverse act, and (4) causation.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cMere conclusory allegations of retaliation\u201d are insufficient.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> A prisoner must either \u201cproduce direct evidence of motivation\u201d or \u201callege a chronology of events from which retaliation may plausibly be inferred.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Arn-\">We agree that Bishop has failed to provide any evidence that Jones had a retaliatory motive in her authorization of his transfer. While Karney\u2019s recommendation may provide evidence of a retaliatory motive on his part, it does not follow that Jones\u2019s decision to follow his medical recommendation was similarly based on a retaliatory motive. The district court correctly granted summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">Lastly, Bishop avers that the district court erred in dismissing his claim that Lewis, Barnett, and Clendennen wrongfully denied his Step 1 and Step 2 grievances. Inmates do not have a federally protected liberty interest in having grievances resolved to their satisfaction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Thus, the district court correctly granted summary judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b968-12\">In sum, the record reflects that Bishop has failed to raise genuine issues of material fact as to his deliberate indifference, retaliation, and Due Process claims. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED, and Bishop\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b966-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
