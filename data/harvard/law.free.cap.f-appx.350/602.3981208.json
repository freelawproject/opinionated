For the following reasons, we will dismiss McCain\u2019s appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">On May 26, 2009, McCain, acting as \u201cAdministrator of the Estate of Deceased Juanita Felder and a/k/a John McCain, An-Nisa McCain, Individually in his own Right,\u201d filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against Episcopal Hospital and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. McCain\u2019s complaint alleged that the hospitals, acting under color of state law, violated his constitutional rights by refusing to turn over biological, toxicological, and DNA tests that McCain believes would justify further criminal or civil actions against the hospitals in connection with the deaths of Juanita Felder and McCain\u2019s unborn son.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">On June 5, 2009, McCain moved to proceed with his claims <em>in forma pauperis. </em>On July 1, 2009, the District Court granted <em>in forma pauperis </em>status to appellant, and dismissed his complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because McCain is proceeding <em>in forma pauperis, </em>we must dismiss the appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if it lacks an arguable basis in fact or law. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 <em>(1989).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">This is McCain\u2019s second attempt, as a pro se litigant, to bring a \u00a7 1983 action on behalf on Juanita Felder. <em>See McCain v. Abraham, </em>337 Fed.Appx. 141 (3d Cir.2009). We reiterate that \u201ca pro se litigant who is not an attorney may not represent someone else in federal court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142; <em>see also Osei-Afriyie v. Med. Coll. of Penn., </em>937 F.2d 876, 882 (3d Cir.1991) (holding that a non-attorney parent could not proceed pro se on behalf of his or her children in federal court). Furthermore, as we explained to McCain in dismissing his previous appeal, \u00a7 1983 \u201cdoes not provide a cause of action on behalf of a deceased based upon alleged violation of the deceased\u2019s civil rights which occurred after his death.\u201d <em>McCain, </em>337 Fed.Appx. at 142 (quoting <em>Guyton v. Phillips, </em>606 F.2d 248, 250 (9th Cir.1979)). For these reasons, McCain lacks standing to litigate claims on behalf of Felder or her estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">To the extent that McCain also seeks redress for alleged violations of his own civil rights, McCain\u2019s claims are without merit. To state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, McCain must show that the Episcopal Hospital and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (1) violated his federal or Constitutional rights, and (2) that they did so while acting under color of state law. <em>Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks, </em>436 U.S. 149, 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 1729, 56 L.Ed.2d 185 (1978); <em>Groman v. Twp. of Manalapan, </em>47 F.3d 628, 638 (3d Cir.1995). McCain has failed to articulate how the hospitals\u2019 alleged actions-in essence, withholding information that could potentially form the basis of a hypothetical future criminal or civil action \u2014 violated a right that either the Constitution or federal law protects.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">Furthermore, even assuming that withholding information under these circumstances somehow violated a cognizable federal right, McCain makes no allegations to support his claim that the hospitals were acting under color of state law. \u201c[TJhere is no liability under \u00a7 1983 for those not acting under color of law.\u201d <em>Groman, </em>47 F.3d at 638. Although McCain asserts that the hospitals were acting under color of state law, there is no allegation that the Episcopal Hospital or the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania are state actors, that they have \u201cacted together with\u201d or have \u201cobtained significant aid from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>state officials,\u201d or that their conduct is \u201cotherwise chargeable to the State.\u201d <em>Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., Inc., </em>457 U.S. 922, 923, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982); <em>Jordan v. Fox, Rothschild, O\u2019Brien &amp; Frankel, </em>20 F.3d 1250, 1264-65 (3d Cir.1994). Other than McCain\u2019s bare assertion, there is nothing in the complaint to suggest that either defendant was acting under color of state law. <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1951, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (holding that conclusory allegations are not entitled to the assumption of truth).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">After conducting an independent review, we conclude that McCain\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit. We will dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
