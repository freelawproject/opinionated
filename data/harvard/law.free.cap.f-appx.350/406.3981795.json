After conducting a hearing on the appellants\u2019 motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, the district court found that appellants\u2019 counsels\u2019 billing rates were reasonable, but that the number of hours spent on the litigation was unreasonable. In making this finding, the district court considered the numerous requests by appellants for extensions of time to respond to discovery, the appellants\u2019 filing of unnecessary/frivolous motions, appellants\u2019 failure to file a motion for summary judgment for which they sought fees, and the lack of complex legal issues presented. Accordingly, the district court found that the number of hours spent on the litigation should be reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-16\">\u201cThe determination of a reasonable fee pursuant to \u00a7 216(b) of the [FLSA] is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be set aside absent a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Kreager v. Solomon &amp; Flanagan, P.A., </em>775 F.2d 1541, 1543 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-17\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the appellants have failed to demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion in its order awarding attorneys\u2019 fees. Moreover, we conclude that appellants have failed to establish that the district court erred in denying appellants\u2019 supplemental motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. The district court\u2019s denial of the supplemental motion was supported by detailed findings of fact and applicable principles of law. We do conclude from the record, however, that the district court made one error. The district court abused its discretion by failing to award post-judgment interest and in failing to include explicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>execution language in its order. It is appropriate to impose post-judgment interest on awards of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in an FLSA case. <em>See Saglimbene v. Venture Indus. Corp., </em>739 F.Supp. 1100, 1102 (E.D.Mich.1990). Further, we conclude that the district court erred in failing to include language in its order which would permit execution on the judgment. <em>See DuBreuil v. Regnvall, </em>527 So.2d 249, 250 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Finally, we conclude appellants\u2019 claim of bias is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order in part, vacate it in part, and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
