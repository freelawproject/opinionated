For the reasons that follow, we will dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-22\">Fleming filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on April 14, 2009. The District Court construed it as seeking relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and issued an order explaining the defects in Fleming\u2019s complaint, setting out the information required to state a claim under \u00a7 1983, and ordering Fleming to amend his complaint to comply with those requirements. Fleming filed an amended complaint, the substance of which is described in great detail in the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report &amp; Recommendation. The amended complaint named Lackawanna County Courthouse and Lackawanna County as the defendants. As the Magistrate Judge explained, Fleming failed to specify any conduct, wrongful or otherwise, of any properly named defendant. A fair reading of Fleming\u2019s complaint does not indicate what specific wrongs he seeks to remedy or who committed them. Additionally, the Magistrate Judge recommended that Fleming not be permitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>amend his complaint for a second time, as it appeared that any such amendment would be futile. By order entered June 9, 2009, the District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report &amp; Recommendation and dismissed the action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because Appellant has been granted <em>informa pauperis </em>status pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915, we review this appeal for possible dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). An appeal must be dismissed under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if it has no arguable basis in fact or law. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). For all of the reasons given by the Magistrate Judge, we agree that Fleming failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and, accordingly, conclude that this appeal must be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
