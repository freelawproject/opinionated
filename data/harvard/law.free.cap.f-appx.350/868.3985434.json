Newsome, Texas prisoner # 1291626, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his in forma pauperis (IFP) civil rights complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and 1915A(b)(l). New-some sued the defendants for their actions (or inaction) before, during, and after his second state trial, conviction, and 20 year-sentence for aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-20\">Newsome asserts that there is no immunity for the police department. However, the court dismissed the claims against the police chief and the detectives as barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), and, alternatively, as barred by the statute of limitations. Because Newsome does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that his claims were barred by <em>Heck, </em>he has abandoned that issue. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-21\">Newsome asserts that he did not know about the \u00a7 1983 claims until about two years ago and that the district court said that there was no statute of limitations for \u00a7 1983 suits. The district court stated correctly that there is no federal statute of limitations and that the Texas\u2019s two-year general personal injury limitations period applied. <em>See Moore v. McDonald, </em>30 F.3d 616, 620 (5th Cir.1994). Newsome\u2019s assertion that he did not know about his \u00a7 1983 claims until about two years ago does not show that the district court erred in determining that New-some\u2019s complaint was untimely. The district court did not err by dismissing these claims as frivolous. <em>See Moore, </em>30 F.3d at 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-22\">Newsome asserts that the (unspecified) attorney in this suit was appointed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>the state court. \u201c[P]rivate attorneys, even court-appointed attorneys, are not official state actors, and generally are not subject to suit under section 1983.\u201d <em>Mills v. Criminal Dist. Court No. 3, </em>837 F.2d 677, 679 (5th Cir.1988). The district court did not err in dismissing the \u00a7 1983 claims against his attorneys as lacking an arguable basis in law and failing to state a claim. <em>See Geiger, </em>404 F.3d at 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Newsome also asserts that all of the defendants were working under color of state law and should not be immune from suit for their misconduct. New-some\u2019s conclusional assertion fails to show that the district court erred in finding that the judge and the prosecutors were absolutely immune from suit. Because these defendants were absolutely immune from suit, Newsome\u2019s claims against them lacked an arguable basis in law and the district court did not err in dismissing the claims against them as frivolous. <em>See Krueger v. Reimer, </em>66 F.3d 75, 76-77 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Newsome asserts that \u201cthe standard for review by the 5th Cri. [sic] Rules should be look[ed] at under state law.\u201d Even liberally construing the brief, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), we cannot divine an argument from this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">The appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district courts dismissal of Newsome\u2019s complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Newsome is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b893-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
