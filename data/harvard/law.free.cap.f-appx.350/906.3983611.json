The district court dismissed the suit as frivolous and for failure to state a claim. The court denied Lard\u2019s motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d) on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. Lard seeks this court\u2019s leave to proceed IFP and appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-15\">Lard does not discuss the issues that will be raised in his appeal or challenge the determination that his complaint is frivolous. Because he fails to show that his appeal \u201cinvolves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous),\u201d the motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524-25 &amp; n. 2 (5th Cir.1995) (stating that even a <em>pro se </em>brief must include argument in support of relief sought). The appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-18\">Lard asserts that we should appoint counsel because he is legally blind. The claims in Lard\u2019s complaint are straightforward and uncomplicated, and he fails to explain how his blindness has impeded his legal efforts, if at all. The motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED. <em>See Cooper v. Sheriff, </em>929 F.2d 1078, 1084 (5th Cir.1991) (stating that counsel can be appointed in exceptional circumstances).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b930-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
