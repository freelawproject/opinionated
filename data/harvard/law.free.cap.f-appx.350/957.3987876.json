Based on the financial affidavit submitted by Castillo, he was granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in the district court. The district court subsequently rescinded the IFP order based on the factual finding that Castillo was not a pauper.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-17\">Castillo now moves this court for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. Under Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5), this court may entertain a motion to proceed IFP when the district court has denied a litigant leave to proceed IFP. To proceed IFP on appeal, a movant must demonstrate that he is a pauper and that he will raise nonfrivolous issues on appeal. <em>Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir. 1982). Castillo has not shown that he is a pauper or that he can present a nonfrivolous issue that the district court erred by revoking his pauper status. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b982-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
