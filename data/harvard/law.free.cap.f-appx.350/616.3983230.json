We will summarily affirm. <em>See </em>I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">In 1995 the United Stated District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin sentenced Garcia to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 360 months for various drug charges. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed his conviction. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>89 F.3d 362 (7th Cir.1996). Garcia then filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The trial court denied the motion and the Seventh Circuit denied his request for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">On February 18, 2009, Garcia filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. In the petition, Garcia challenged his classification as a career offender, arguing that a 1972 conviction should not have counted as a predicate offense. The District Court denied his petition and Garcia filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a). We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its factual findings. <em>See Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002). Upon review, we agree with the District Court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-15\">A \u00a7 2255 motion is the presumptive means by which a federal prisoner can challenge his conviction or sentence. <em>See Davis v. United States, </em>417 U.S. 333, 343, 94 S.Ct. 2298, 41 L.Ed.2d 109 (1974). A federal prisoner may proceed under \u00a7 2241 only if the remedy provided by \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 249-51 (3d Cir.1997). \u201cA \u00a7 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective only where the petitioner demonstrates that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent a \u00a7 2255 proceeding from affording him a full hearing and adjudication of his wrongful detention claim.\u201d <em>Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-16\">Here, as the District Court held, Garcia has not established that a \u00a7 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. Garcia raised the career offender claim on direct appeal. <em>See Garcia, </em>89 F.3d at 366. Further, he apparently raised the claim in his \u00a7 2255 motion but he alleges that the Wisconsin District Court \u201cunreasonably held his \u00a7 2255 motion to the strict compliance with its procedural rules.\u201d (Petition at 12.) However, \u201c[i]t is the inefficacy of the remedy, not the personal inability to use it, that is determinative.\u201d <em>Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 539. Neither the Seventh Circuit\u2019s rejection of that claim on direct appeal nor the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the claim for procedural violations renders \u00a7 2255 inadequate. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b641-17\">Therefore, the District Court properly determined that it lacked jurisdiction un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>der \u00a7 2241 to hear Garcia\u2019s claim. Further, the District Court also correctly-construed his petition as a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion and held that it also lacked jurisdiction over such a motion. We agree that the interests of justice did not require the District Court to transfer the petition to the Seventh Circuit. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
