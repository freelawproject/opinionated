The district court ruled that Mims\u2019s complaint was barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-14\">Mims complained that Anderson violated his right to due process by \u201csabotaging]\u201d the direct appeal of his state criminal conviction. Mims alleged that Anderson failed to attach exhibits to the transcript for his direct appeal and deprived Mims of a \u201cfull and fair review of [his] claim of actual innocence.\u201d Mims argued in an attachment to his complaint that Anderson\u2019s \u201cmisconduct\u201d was \u201ca true fundamental defect that [could not] be corrected on appeal.\u201d Mims requested as relief that the district court \u201cvacate [his] judgement[][sic] on appeal and remand for [a] new trial\u201d; reimburse him for the \u201ccost of [his] appeal\u201d; and award \u201cmonetary damages\u201d of $80,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-15\">Mims moved for the appointment of counsel. After the magistrate judge denied the motion as premature, Mims moved for reconsideration. Anderson moved to dismiss Mims\u2019s complaint and for a stay of discovery. Mims served interrogatories on Anderson and, four days later, moved to compel Anderson to proceed with discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-16\">A magistrate judge recommended that the district court dismiss Mims\u2019s complaint. The magistrate judge found that \u201cMims is actually seeking habeas corpus relief, inasmuch as his claims address his state criminal and habeas corpus proceedings as well as his appellate rights\u201d and recommended the district court deny the complaint as barred under <em>Heck. </em>The magistrate judge also recommended that the district court deny as moot Mims\u2019s motions to reconsider his request for appointed counsel and to compel discovery. Mims objected to the recommendation, argued that his petition was not barred by <em>Heck, </em>and moved to amend his complaint to withdraw his request for a new trial. The district court \u201cmade a de novo determination of the portion of the [report and rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>ommendation] to which [Mims] objected]\u201d and dismissed Mims\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Mims challenges the ruling of the district court on three grounds, all of which fail. First, Mims\u2019s argument that the mistake of Anderson caused the state courts to deny Mims relief on direct appeal fails because a judgment in his favor \u201cwould necessarily imply the invalidity of [his] eonviction[.]\u201d <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. Second, Mims argues that he was entitled to amend his complaint as a matter of right, <em>see </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2), but any amendment would have been futile. <em>See Cockrell v. Sparks, </em>510 F.3d 1307, 1310 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cLeave to amend a complaint is futile when the complaint as amended would still be properly dismissedf.]\u201d). Third, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Mims\u2019s requests for appointed counsel and to compel discovery because those motions were moot. <em>See Connell v. Bowen, </em>797 F.2d 927, 929 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The dismissal of Mims\u2019s complaint against Anderson is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
