Narvaez, </em>285 Fed.Appx. 720 (11th Cir.2008) <em>(\u201cNarvaez </em>/\u201d). After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-25\">Narvaez pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while aboard a vessel subject to United States jurisdiction, in violation of 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 1903(a), (g), (j) (2006) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1)(B); and one count of the underlying substantive offense, in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 1903(a), (g) (2006) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At Narvaez\u2019s initial sentencing, the district court imposed a 210-month sentence, at the low end of the advisory guidelines range of 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. In <em>Narvaez I, </em>we affirmed Narvaez's convictions and sentence, but remanded for the limited purpose of permitting the district court to comply with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(c)(1) and give an explanation in open court for the 210-month sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1) (providing that, if the court imposes a sentence within the applicable guidelines range that is greater than 24 months, it must state \u201cthe reason for imposing a sentence at a particular point within the range\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">At resentencing, the district court explained that it found the advisory guidelines range \u201cadequately reflected]\u201d the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201cparticularly the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of this defendant.\u201d The district court further stated that Narvaez:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">was a Captain of a ship. This was significant amounts of drugs that were found on this boat. I believe the quantity of the narcotics, his leadership role in this, all are contained in the nature of the offense which is 3553, which is why I sentenced the defendant to the 210 month sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Given that the district court sentenced Narvaez within the advisory guidelines range, its explanation for Narvaez\u2019s sentence was sufficient to comply with \u00a7 3553(c)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that a simple statement by the court explicitly acknowledging the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) is sufficient); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (\u201c[W]hen a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation.\u201d). The district court referenced the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explained that Narvaez\u2019s \u201cleadership role\u201d and the \u201cquantity of the narcotics\u201d formed the basis for his particular sentence. Thus, the district court tailored its comments to show the particular sentence imposed was appropriate in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d at 1181.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\">.
