The district court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to review a decision of the Department that a public housing authority took \u201cappropriate actions\u201d when it terminated Copeland\u2019s benefits under Section 8 of the Housing Choice Voucher Program. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437f(a). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The district court did not err by dismissing Copeland\u2019s complaint. Under the Administrative Procedure Act, a district court may not review the decision of an agency if \u201cagency action is committed to agency discretion by law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(2). A decision is \u201ccommitted to agency discretion\u201d and barred from judicial review if the governing statute \u201cis drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency\u2019s exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Heckler v. Chaney, </em>470 U.S. 821, 830, 105 S.Ct. 1649, 1655, 84 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985). The Supreme Court has stated that there is no \u201cprocedure by which tenants c[an] complain to [the Department] about the alleged failures of [public housing authorities] to abide by ... HUD regulations.\u201d <em>Wright v. Roanoke Redev. &amp; Hous. Auth., </em>479 U.S. 418, 426, 107 S.Ct. 766, 772, 93 L.Ed.2d 781 (1987). Because the district court had no meaningful standard to apply, the decision of the Department was immune from review.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The dismissal of Copeland\u2019s complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
