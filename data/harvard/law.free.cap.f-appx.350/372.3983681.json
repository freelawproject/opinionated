Parra-Reina\u2019s real name is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Christian Andres Tofino Morillo, and he fled to the United States under an assumed name after receiving death threats from a paramilitary organization known as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Parra-Reina testified before the IJ that he had been the victim of identity theft perpetrated by AUC. AUC had used Parra-Reina\u2019s real name to open bank accounts and extort money from people. In 2003 Parra-Reina was arrested in Colombia on charges of extortion. He defended himself from those charges based on the fact that his fingerprints and handwriting samples did not match those used to open the bank account. He was temporarily released from prison, and then he and his mother received threatening phone calls. He testified that charges were still pending against him in Colombia, and he feared that if he returned there, he would be arrested and then killed by AUC members in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The IJ found Parra-Reina\u2019s testimony credible. The IJ also found, however, that Parra-Reina was not being targeted because of his political opinion or any other immutable characteristic. Even though he claimed to have been witness to a crime, he admitted that he did not know anything about the crime or about who had used his identity. The IJ also found that Parra-Reina failed to meet the requirements for withholding of removal and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">In his appeal to the BIA, Parra-Reina contended that \u201cthe nexus of this case is not so much membership in a particular group as a \u201cwitness to a crime,\u2019 as it would be as a \u2018victim of a crime.\u2019 \u201d He asserted that he had a fear of persecution on account of political opinion, or in the alternative, imputed political opinion. The BIA held that Parra-Reina had failed to establish a nexus between any persecution and a protected ground, and it affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">\u201cWe review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review <em>de novo </em>the BIA\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir.2001). We review the BIA and IJ\u2019s factual findings under the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d test. <em>Forgue v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). That test is \u201chighly deferential,\u201d and we must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">Parra-Reina contends that he is entitled to relief as a witness to a crime because: (1) being a witness is immutable and the crime was publicized and thus socially visible; (2) the theft of his identity was a \u201cparamilitary crime\u201d; and (3) he had information to exonerate himself and to implicate AUC. Parra-Reina did not raise this \u201cwitness to a crime\u201d argument before the BIA. In fact, he argued to the BIA that his membership in a protected group was based on being a victim of a crime rather than being a witness to one. Therefore, we lack subject matter jurisdiction to review that argument. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that we lack jurisdiction to consider claims raised in a petition unless the petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies by raising the claim on appeal before the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">As for Parra-Reina\u2019s other grounds for seeking relief, being a victim of the crime of identity theft does not make him a member of a particular social group. Evidence that \u201cmerely shows a person has been the victim of criminal activity ... does not constitute evidence based on a statutorily protected ground.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number><em>United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1258 (11th Cir.2006). Parra-Reina has not shown that he was victimized because of his political opinion. Persecution on account of political opinion must be on account of the victim\u2019s political opinion, not the persecutors\u2019. <em>Sanchez v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437-38 (11th Cir.2004). Evidence that AUC harassed Parra-Reina because he refused to cooperate with them is not enough to qualify for relief under the INA. <em>See id. </em>at 438. The BIA\u2019s denial of asylum is supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>See Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1286. Because Parra-Reina \u201chas failed to establish a claim of asylum on the merits, he necessarily fails to establish eligibility for withholding of removal or protection under CAT.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1288 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
