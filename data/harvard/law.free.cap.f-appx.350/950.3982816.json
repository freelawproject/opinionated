Crittenden challenges the use of an Illinois conviction to enhance the sentence for his 1993 Texas conviction of possession of a deadly weapon in a penal institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-17\">A COA may be issued only if the applicant has \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). However, Crittenden\u2019s COA motion is denied because this court lacks jurisdiction to consider it. The latest date on which Crittenden could have filed a timely notice of appeal was January 16, 2009, 30 days from the district court\u2019s December 17, 2008, order denying Crittenden\u2019s first postjudgment motion for relief. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), (a)(4)(A)(iv). Crittenden\u2019s second postjudgment motion had no tolling effect on the period for filing a timely notice of appeal. <em>See Charles L.M. v. Northeast Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>884 F.2d 869, 870 (5th Cir.1989). Crittenden\u2019s January 26, 2009, notice of appeal was untimely, and this court lacks jurisdiction to address his COA motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-18\">COA DENIED. APPEAL DISMISSED. MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b975-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
