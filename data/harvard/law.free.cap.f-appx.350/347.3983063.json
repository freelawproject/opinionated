BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Smith, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed suit against APCU seeking $10 million in damages for alleged employment discrimination in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112. After Smith refused to sign a form authorizing the release of her medical records and provided inadequate responses to APCU\u2019s initial discovery requests, APCU moved the court for an order to show cause or, in the alternative, an award of attorney\u2019s fees associated with bringing the motion. The court declined to issue an order to show cause, but it did order Smith to sign the medical release form, respond fully to APCU\u2019s discovery requests, and reimburse APCU for expenses reasonably incurred in making the motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In its order, dated July 1, 2008, the court found Smith\u2019s repeated noncompliance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the applicable Local Rules to be without substantial justification, and it warned her that failure to comply with the order would result in sanctions that could include the dismissal of her lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-13\">Four weeks later, APCU filed a motion to dismiss the action with prejudice pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 37(b)(2) and 41(b). APCU alleged that although Smith had finally authorized the release of her medical records, she had not properly responded to its discovery requests by the deadlines established in the district court\u2019s July 1 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-14\">While APCU\u2019s motion to dismiss was pending, Smith filed a motion to \u201cremove\u201d the judge from her case. She argued that the judge\u2019s previous rulings in APCU\u2019s favor and the court\u2019s delays in responding to her motions demonstrated bias against her and warranted the assignment of a new judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-15\">The district court issued its final order on March 19, 2009. The court construed Smith\u2019s motion to remove the judge as a motion for recusal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455 and denied it on the ground that adverse rulings and delays did not constitute bias. The court also awarded APCU $3,880 for attorney\u2019s fees it had incurred in bringing its motion to show cause. Finally, after finding that Smith had willfully failed to comply with her discovery obligations, the procedural rules applicable to her case, and the district court\u2019s order of July 1, 2008, the court granted APCU\u2019s motion to dismiss with prejudice. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>II. RECUSAL</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">We review the district court\u2019s refusal to recuse for abuse of discretion. <em>Gwynn v. Walker (In re Walker), </em>532 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2008). A \u201cjudge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). Generally, only personal bias stemming from extrajudicial sources is sufficient to disqualify a judge. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 144, 455(b)(1); <em>Hamm v. Members of Bd. of Regents, </em>708 F.2d 647, 651 (11th Cir.1983). An exception exists for judicial conduct demonstrating \u201csuch pervasive bias and prejudice that it constitutes bias against a party,\u201d but neither \u201crulings adverse to a party, nor friction between the court and counsel constitute[s] pervasive bias.\u201d <em>Hamm, </em>708 F.2d at 651 (citations omitted). On the contrary, \u201cthe standard is whether an objective, fully informed lay observer would entertain significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Christo v. Padgett, </em>223 F.3d 1324, 1333 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Smith argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying her motion for recusal. She alleges that the judge acted as an attorney for the defense when he granted APCU\u2019s motions and denied hers. She also claims that the judge acted maliciously in refusing to recuse himself and in dismissing her case after she questioned his impartiality. She has failed, however, to state specific facts that would establish personal or pervasive bias. Rulings against one party in favor of another, without more, do not require a judge to disqualify himself, <em>Hamm, </em>708 F.2d at 651, and Smith has not alleged any facts that would lead a reasonable and objective observer to question the district court judge\u2019s impartiality. The district court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for recusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">III. ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">We review the imposition of sanctions under Rule 37 for an abuse of discretion. <em>Serra Chevrolet, Inc. v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>446 F.3d 1137, 1146-47 (11th Cir.2006). We likewise review an award of attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion. <em>Bivins v. Wrap It Up, Inc., </em>548 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Smith contests the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees on the grounds that they were excessive and that the associate who worked on APCU\u2019s motion to show cause did not enter an appearance in the ease until after the motion had been filed. She also argues that the district court should have made a finding of bad faith before imposing sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">The district court in this case calculated APCU\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees using the lodestar method, multiplying defense counsel\u2019s reasonable hours by a reasonable hourly rate. In determining the reasonable rate, the district court properly considered \u201cthe prevailing market rate in the relevant legal community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skills, experience, and reputation.\u201d <em>Norman v. Housing Authority, </em>836 F.2d 1292, 1299 (11th Cir.1988). The court also excluded from APCU\u2019s initial fee calculation any \u201chours that were not reasonably expended,\u201d <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 434, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983) (citation and quotation marks omitted), subtracting 2.5 hours from the time entries submitted by defense counsel. There is a \u201cstrong presumption that the lodestar figure ... represents a \u2018reasonable\u2019 fee,\u201d <em>Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens\u2019 Council for Clean Air, </em>478 U.S. 546, 565, 106 S.Ct. 3088, 92 L.Ed.2d 439 (1986), and nothing in the record before us indicates that the district eourt abused its discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>in calculating and adhering to the lodestar in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Smith\u2019s argument that the district court should not have awarded fees for time expended by the associate because he had not yet entered an appearance is similarly unavailing. Neither the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure nor the district court\u2019s Local Rules require every attorney working on a case to enter an appearance before the court. <em>Cf. </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(a) (\u201cEvery pleading, written motion, and other paper must be signed by at least <em>one </em>attorney of record in the attorney\u2019s name ....\u201d (emphasis added)); N.D. Ga. R. 83.1(D)(1) (\u201cAny other attorney who <em>signs </em>a subsequent pleading or paper on behalf of a party must file a notice of appearance with the clerk.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">With respect to Smith\u2019s contention that the imposition of sanctions required a finding of bad faith, Rule 37 fee awards, unlike sanctions imposed pursuant to the court\u2019s inherent powers, do not require such a finding. <em>Compare DeVaney v. Continental Am. Ins. Co., </em>989 F.2d 1154, 1162 (11th Cir.1993) (\u201c[T]he 1970 amendments [to Rule 37] were specifically enacted to eliminate the possibility that a bad faith requirement would be read into the rule ....\u201d), <em>with Thomas v. Tenneco Packaging Co., </em>293 F.3d 1306, 1320 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201c[B]efore a court can impose sanctions against a lawyer under its inherent power, it must find that the lawyer\u2019s conduct constituted or was tantamount to bad faith.\u201d (citation and quotations marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">District courts granting motions to compel discovery shall \u201crequire the party or deponent whose conduct necessitated the motion ... to pay the movant\u2019s reasonable expenses incurred in making the motion, including attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d unless the \u201ccircumstances make an award of expenses unjust.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(a)(5); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b)(2)(C). <em>Pro se </em>litigants are \u201csubject to sanctions like any other litigant,\u201d <em>Moon v. Newsome, </em>863 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir.1989), and the district court here found no substantial justification for Smith\u2019s resistance to discovery. It therefore did not abuse its discretion by ordering her to pay APCU\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">IV. DISMISSAL WITH PREJUDICE</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">\u201cThis Court reviews dismissals under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41 and 37 for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Gratton v. Great Am. Commc\u2019ns, </em>178 F.3d 1373, 1374 (11th Cir.1999). Rule 37 permits the district court to dismiss an action for failure to cooperate during discovery or failure to comply with a court order. Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)-(d). Rule 41 similarly allows the dismissal of an action when \u201cthe plaintiff fails to ... comply with these rules or a court order.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 41(b). \u201cDismissal under Rule 41(b) is appropriate where there is a clear record of \u2018willful\u2019 contempt and an implicit or explicit finding that lesser sanctions would not suffice.\u201d <em>Gratton, </em>178 F.3d at 1374.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">In this case, Smith repeatedly failed to comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and refused to cooperate during the discovery process. For instance, she filed several improper and legally insufficient motions to compel discovery without first making any good faith attempt to confer with opposing counsel. While APCU\u2019s motion to dismiss was pending, Smith also refused to answer any questions during her deposition that she deemed \u201cpersonal,\u201d including routine inquiries about her employment, marital status, medical history, and involvement in other litigation. Moreover, the district court found her \u201cwillful\u201d failure to make adequate, timely responses to APCU\u2019s initial discovery requests a sign of \u201cbad faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>and blatant disregard\u201d of the court\u2019s July 1, 2008 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">A district court does not abuse its discretion by dismissing an action with prejudice \u201c[w]hen a party demonstrates a flagrant disregard for the court and the discovery process.\u201d <em>Aztec Steel Co. v. Florida Steel Corp., </em>691 F.2d 480, 481 (11th Cir.1982). Smith\u2019s conduct during the course of this litigation evinced a flagrant disregard for both her obligations as a litigant and the procedural rules governing her case. In light of her recalcitrance, the district court made an explicit finding that no lesser sanction than dismissal was appropriate. Having already warned the plaintiff and attempted to deter future abuses of the discovery process by imposing the lesser sanction of attorney\u2019s fees, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Smith\u2019s action with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Smith\u2019s motion for recusal, awarding APCU attorney\u2019s fees, and dismissing the action with prejudice. The district court\u2019s order of March 19, 2009, is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-10\">. Smith also raises arguments concerning the case's underlying merits, which were not pertinent to the district court\u2019s order and are irrelevant to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b372-16\">. APCU filed a petition showing the amount of attorney's fees requested on July 10, 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
