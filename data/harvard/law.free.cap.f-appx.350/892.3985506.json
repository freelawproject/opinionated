Noble argues that he sustained a head contusion after he slipped and fell in standing water in the prison shower area at his place of incarceration. He contends that the defendants were aware of the dangerous conditions in the shower area but nonetheless failed to take any preventative measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-18\">Noble\u2019s allegations are insufficient to show that the defendants were deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of serious harm. <em>See Palmer v. Johnson, </em>193 F.3d 346, 352 (5th Cir.1999). Noble\u2019s allegations specifically do not permit a finding that the defendants either (a) had sufficient information to infer that the conditions in the shower area presented a substantial risk of harm to prisoners\u2019 health and safety or (b) actually drew an inference that inmates faced a risk of harm from the conditions in the shower area. <em>See id. </em>Instead, Noble\u2019s complaint, at most, alleges a claim of negligence, which is not actionable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 332-36, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986); <em>Marsh v. Jones, </em>53 F.3d 707, 711-12 (5th Cir.1995). Accordingly, the district court did not err when it dismissed Noble\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim for which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-19\">The district court\u2019s dismissal counts as a strike against Noble. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Noble is hereby CAUTIONED that, if he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-20\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b917-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
