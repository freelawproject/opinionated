On appeal, Khanali argues that: (1) the district court erred in denying an acceptance of responsibility sentence reduction; and (2) his sentence is unreasonable. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings concerning a reduction for acceptance of responsibility for clear error. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>408 F.3d 745, 756 (11th Cir.2005). We review the ultimate sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">First, we reject Khanali\u2019s claim that the district court erred in denying him an acceptance of responsibility sentence reduction. Section 3E1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines permits a district court to give a defendant a sentence reduction if \u201cthe defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). However, \u201c[a] defendant who enters a guilty plea is not entitled to an adjustment ... as a matter of right.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 3. While a guilty plea constitutes significant evidence of acceptance of responsibility, that evidence may be outweighed by conduct that is inconsistent with acceptance. <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>115 F.3d 1531, 1537 (11th Cir.1997). Appropriate considerations include the defendant\u2019s \u201cvoluntary termination or withdrawal from criminal conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 1(b). We previously have held that subsequent criminal activity may be considered, even if unrelated to the offense of conviction. <em>United States v. Pace, </em>17 F.3d 341, 343 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">Like the defendant in <em>Pace, </em>Khanali tested positive for marijuana in violation of his bond terms, and although this criminal conduct was unrelated to the offense of conviction, it nonetheless could be considered. <em>Id. </em>The district court thus did not clearly err in denying Khanali an acceptance of responsibility reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">We also find no merit in Khanali\u2019s argument that his sentence was unreasonable. In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>elude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation omitted). We ordinarily expect that a sentence within the advisory guidelines range will be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). While the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it is not required to discuss each individually. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). The district court must merely acknowledge \u201cthat it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the [\u00a7 3553(a) ] factors.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">As applied here, Khanali has not shown that his 60-month sentence is procedurally reasonable. Regarding Khanali\u2019s argument that the loss amount calculated in the PSI was unsupported, Khanali agreed to the loss amount below, and his argument on appeal therefore must be rejected as invited error. <em>See United States v. Ross, </em>131 F.3d 970, 988 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cIt is a cardinal rule of appellate review that a party may not challenge as error a ruling or other trial proceeding invited by that party.\u201d) (quotations omitted). Moreover, contrary to Khanali\u2019s claim, the district court did not consider Hernandez\u2019s PSI when it imposed Khanali\u2019s sentence; it stated that it was \u201cnot including facts necessarily\u201d and did not mention any such facts while imposing the sentence. Lastly, the district court acknowledged the nature of the offense, the sentencing Guidelines, the statements by Khanali and his family, and the seriousness of the crime. The record thus shows that the district court considered the factors in \u00a7 3553(a), and its failure to explicitly discuss each factor does not render the sentence procedurally unreasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">Similarly, Khanali has not shown that his sentence, within the Guidelines range, is substantively unreasonable. As the district court found, the offense in question is a serious offense involving over a million dollars in healthcare fraud. The district court discussed the impact of such fraud on society. The district court also took into account Khanali\u2019s background and character, as well as his family. And while it chose to give more weight to the seriousness of the offense, which is within the district court\u2019s discretion, we will not substitute our own judgment in weighing the factors. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-10\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with edu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>cational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
