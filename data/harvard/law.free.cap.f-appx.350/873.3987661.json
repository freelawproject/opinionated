The district court determined that Esquivel Cabrera could not proceed under \u00a7 2241 because his claims did not satisfy the requirements of the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). Esquivel Cabrera\u2019s brief is entirely devoted to the merits of his claims for relief. Esquivel Cabrera has not argued, much less shown, that he is entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2241 based on the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e). <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 900-01, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Esquivel Cabrera has waived the issue by failing to brief it. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Esquivel Cabrera\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED. <em>See Schwander v. Blackburn, </em>750 F.2d 494, 502 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b898-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
