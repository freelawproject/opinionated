Straker also implicitly challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen. Straker argues that his convictions under N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 221.40 for sale of marijuana in the fourth degree do not constitute aggravated felonies that rendered him ineligible for cancellation of removal. Straker has abandoned any challenge to the denial of his applications for withholding of removal and for protection under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-21\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), federal courts lack jurisdiction to review a final order of removal against an alien who is removable because he was convicted of an aggravated felony. <em>Nehme v. INS, </em>252 F.3d 415, 420 (5th Cir.2001). Furthermore, to the extent that Straker challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen, we lack jurisdiction to consider those arguments because Straker did not file a separate petition for review. <em>See Guevara v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 173, 176 (5th Cir.2006). However, we retain jurisdiction to consider constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 263, 265 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for ceR. filed </em>(July 15, 2009) (No. 09-60). Because the question whether Straker\u2019s conviction is an aggravated felony is a legal one, this court has jurisdiction to review his petition. <em>See Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>570 F.3d at 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-22\">Straker previously was convicted of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree and criminal sale of marijuana in the fourth degree. This court recently held that a recidivist state misdemeanor conviction for drug possession will render an alien ineligible for cancellation of removal because the offense qualifies as an aggravated felony under the recidivist enhancement provision of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a). <em>Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>570 F.3d at 264, 266-67. Thus, Straker\u2019s conviction of criminal sale of marijuana in the fourth degree, which followed his prior state misdemeanor drug conviction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>was punishable as a federal felony under the recidivist provision of \u00a7 844(a). Straker therefore committed an \u201caggravated felony\u201d that rendered him removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-3\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b971-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
