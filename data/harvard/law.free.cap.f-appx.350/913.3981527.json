Lyndon Taylor and Barbara L. Taylor (\u201cthe Taylors\u201d), <em>pro se, </em>appeal the Tax Court\u2019s dismissal of their petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The Taylors also appeal the Tax Court\u2019s order establishing their tax deficiency for 2005 and 2006. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (\u201cthe Commissioner\u201d) answers this appeal and further requests sanctions against the Taylors for maintaining a frivolous appeal, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912 and Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM the tax court\u2019s orders and sanction the Taylors $16,000, double the amount sought by the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-15\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b938-16\">The Commissioner gave notice to the Taylors in June 2008 that they owed more than $240,000 in deficient federal income tax, as well as some $84,000 in penalties. The Taylors responded with a 332-page petition in the Tax Court, along with various attachments asserting the lack of any tax deficiencies on their part. The central allegation asserted repeatedly by the Taylors was that \u201c[t]he \u2018federal income tax\u2019 scam functions only where there are fiduciaries, a/k/a \u2018taxpayers\u2019 ... where there is no \u2018income\u2019, there is no \u2018income tax\u2019.... Only a fiduciary has \u2018income\u2019.... There is no fiduciary, here.... Hence, there is no \u2018income\u2019.... Hence, no discussion of \u2018income tax\u2019 is relevant.\u201d Each page of the Taylors\u2019 pleadings, including the appeal with this court, includes the footer <em>\u201cEXPOSING THE SCAM: </em>\u2018TAXPAYER MEANS FIDUCIARY\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b938-18\">The above is only one example of a wide variety of arguments the Tax Court described as \u201cfrivolous and groundless.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b939-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>When Tax Court Chief Judge John O. Colvin ordered the Taylors to amend their petition to include \u201cwith specificity\u2019 the errors they alleged in the notices of deficiency, the Taylors filed a \u201cresponse\u201d to that order, declaring: \u201cCOLVIN\u2019s \u2018order\u2019 to amend not only makes him a party, which simultaneously negates his signature authority as a \u2018judge,\u2019 and not only perpetuates an illegal policy on its face, but also constitutes numerous crimes against us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AVM\">On March 18, 2009, the Tax Court granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss, but declined to impose sanctions under 1.R.C. \u00a7 6673(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Taylors appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">II.STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal for failure to state a claim. <em>Stearman v. Comm\u2019r, </em>436 F.3d 533, 535 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">III.ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">The tax court was correct in its finding that the Taylors\u2019 original pleading failed to raise any justiciable issue. <em>Pro se </em>litigants are entitled to some additional latitude in pleading. <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). But no amount of latitude could allow a court to glean any justiciable issue from the rambling rhetoric and disjointed statements in the Taylors\u2019 pleadings. In a similar income tax case, we wrote that \u201c[w]e perceive no need to refute these arguments with somber reasoning and <em>co-pins </em>citation of precedent; to do so might suggest that these arguments have some colorable merit.\u201d <em>Crain v. Comm\u2019r, </em>737 F.2d 1417 (5th Cir.1984). The Tax Court gave the Taylors ample opportunity to amend their pleading. They responded instead with more nonsense, accusations and frivolous arguments. We affirm the Tax Court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-14\">The Commissioner asks this court to sanction the Taylors for maintaining this frivolous appeal. Although we are generous in giving considerations to <em>pro se </em>taxpayers who misunderstand the nature of tax law, <em>pro se </em>status is not a license to litter the dockets of the federal courts with patently baseless suits. <em>Parker v. Comm\u2019r, </em>117 F.3d 785 (5th Cir.1997). Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure authorizes an appellate court to impose sanctions against an appellant who prosecutes a \u201cfrivolous appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b939-15\">A party who continues to advance long-rejected arguments invites sanctions. <em>Telo v. Comm\u2019r, </em>410 F.3d 743, 745 (5th Cir.2005). Sanctions on <em>pro se </em>litigants are appropriate if they were warned that their claims are frivolous and they were aware of \u201cample legal authority holding squarely against them.\u201d <em>Stelly v. Comm\u2019r, </em>761 F.2d 1113, 1116 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-16\">In its order dismissing the Taylors\u2019 petition, the Tax Court found the Taylors\u2019 arguments frivolous and groundless, and warned the Taylors that continuing to advance those arguments could invite sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-17\">The Taylors\u2019 appeal to this court is in substance a self-styled criminal indictment against Tax Court officers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Taylors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>identify themselves as part of a \u201cgroup\u201d of pro se\u2019s\u201d who \u201cknow more about this than all of the \u2018tax court,\u2019 comm\u2019r\u2019s legal staff, doj, and certain federal appellate courts.\u201d The Taylors are apparently aware that others have advanced the \u201ctaxpayer means fiduciary\u201d argument.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Taylors also acknowledge several times in their appellate brief that others who have advanced the same \u201ctaxpayer means fiduciary\u201d have had petitions dismissed and been sanctioned.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Indeed, this is not the first time the Taylors have been in this court. In 2008, this court affirmed a Tax Court order dismissing the Taylors\u2019 petition for failure to prosecute. <em>Taylor v. Comm\u2019r, </em>271 Fed.Appx. 414 (5th Cir.2008). We agreed then with the Tax Court that the Taylors\u2019 filings consisted of \u201coutrageous and preposterous documents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416. That opinion should have put the Taylors on notice of the futility of their arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">The Taylors have been warned several times that their claims are frivolous, that legal authority is squarely against them and that similar claims have resulted in sanctions, yet the Taylors continue to insist on littering the dockets with them specious allegations of criminal conduct by court officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-11\">Because the Taylors were given clear notice of the frivolous nature of their argument and the scandalous allegations in their pleadings we double the sanction requested by the Commissioner to $16,000. The Taylors may be <em>pro se </em>petitioners, but even <em>pro se </em>petitioners are required to be respectful in judicial proceedings. <em>Stearman, </em>436 F.3d at 540.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Wasteful and dilatory appeals unjustifiably consume the limited resources of the judicial system. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe doors of this courthouse are of course open to good faith appeals.... But we can no longer tolerate abuse of the judicial process by irresponsible taxpayers who press stale and frivolous arguments, without hope of success on the merits, in order to delay or harass the collection of public revenues or for other nonworthy purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-12\">A frivolous appeal is an appeal in which the result is obvious or the arguments of error are wholly without merit. <em>Buck v. United States, </em>967 F.2d 1060, 1062 (5th Cir.1992). As in <em>Stearman, </em>rather than explaining why the Tax Court was in error, the Taylors restated them frivolous claims, then proceeded to insult the court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number><em>Stearman, </em>436 F.3d at 539. The Taylors\u2019 did not prosecute this appeal in good faith, but instead sought to harass the collection of public revenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">We therefore AFFIRM the order of the Tax Court, and grant the Commissioner\u2019s motion to impose sanctions against the Taylors for pursuing a frivolous appeal, which we set at $16,000.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">AFFIRMED. MOTION FOR SANCTIONS GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b938-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b938-21\">. Other arguments included that: 1) the Internal Revenue Service is not licensed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>practice law or accounting; 2) the Commissioner\u2019s documents constituted fraud, and; 3) the Commissioner has no factual or legal basis for any collections activity at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b939-11\">. I.R.C. \u00a7 6673(a) permits Tax Court, at its discretion, to impose a penalty not exceeding $25,000, when the court finds the taxpayer's position is \u201cfrivolous and groundless,\u201d or instituted and maintained primarily for delay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b939-18\">. The Taylors also accuse this court of aiding and abetting in crimes against taxpayers. We note that in 2006 the Taylors filed suit against officers of the Tax Court for \u201cRICO-level criminal Record Tampering,\u201d and sought $10 million in damages. The suit was dismissed with prejudice. <em>H. Lyndon Taylor and Barbara L. Taylor, </em>No. 3:06-CV-2118B (N.D.Tex., August 14, 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b940-6\">. In their appellate brief, the Taylors attach a copy of a district court pleading from <em>Braquet v. Comm\u2019r, </em>336 Fed.Appx. 432 (5th Cir.2009) in which the tax-protester made similar \u201ctaxpayer means fiduciary\" arguments \u2014 with the same distinctive footer on each page as the Taylors' pleadings \u2014 and was sanctioned by this court for a frivolous appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b940-7\">. \u201c[Tax Court Chief Judge John O.] COLVIN has repeatedly 'ordered' amendment of the 'taxpayer' means 'fiduciary' petitions, including ours ... [n]one of it has worked as a practical matter. I have never changed my mind or my position or my testimony about the understanding that 'taxpayer' means 'fiduciary'.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b940-8\">. In <em>Stearman, </em>we affirmed a $25,000 Tax Court sanction against a tax-protesting plaintiff, then sanctioned the plaintiff an additional $12,000 for calling the Tax Court a \"kangaroo court\u201d and describing the judge as \u201ccompletely in the dark\u201d and exhibiting \"maniacal\u201d conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b940-14\">.The insults include: (1) describing this court as a place where \"RICO-level extortion is published policy, witnesses are tampered with and retaliated against, consent is compelled as a matter of course, and the judicial structure is altered by force\u201d; (2) calling the Tax Court judges \"criminally insane\u201d and judges of this court \u201cmental pygmies\u201d; (3) and describing the Commissioner's motion to dismiss as \"clinically insane, lawless, or both. WE ARE LAUGHING AT YOU! ALL OF YOU!\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b941-16\">. The Commissioner in his separate motion for sanctions writes that during 2004 and 2005 the average expense for attorney salaries and other costs incurred in a typical frivolous taxpayer appeal is more than $11,000. Thus, $16,000 is not more than the \"double costs\u201d allowed by Rule 38. In addition, the sanctions are \"just damages\" in that they would vindicate the integrity of the judicial proceeding and deter future misconduct. <em>See Stearman, </em>436 F.3d at 540 n. 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
