They seek review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 decision affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of their applications for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158, 1231; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16. They also seek review of the BIA\u2019s order denying their motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">The Pereiras fear that their social and economic status will make them attractive targets for violent criminals in Brazil. They contend the IJ and the BIA erred in finding that the high risk of criminal violence in that country did not constitute \u201cpersecution\u201d based on a statutorily protected ground. Because their appeal from the initial BIA decision was untimely, we lack jurisdiction to review the Pereiras\u2019 claims on their merits. The Pereiras also failed to show that the BIA erred in denying their motion for reconsideration. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition in part and deny the petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-15\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether we have subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>482 F.3d 1281, 1283 (11th Cir.2007). An alien seeking judicial review of an order of removal must file a petition for review not later than 30 days after the order becomes final. INA \u00a7 242(b)(1); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). A removal order becomes final upon the dismissal of an appeal by the BIA. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(a). \u201c[T]he statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 [and, therefore,] it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)). The finality of a removal order is not affected by the filing of a motion to reopen or reconsider. <em>Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405, 115 S.Ct. at 1549.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-16\">Here, the removal order became final on October 17, 2008, when the BIA issued its order affirming the IJ\u2019s decision. To seek timely review in this Court, therefore, the Pereiras needed to file their petition by November 17, 2008. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(b)(1); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). They failed to do so. The Pereiras instead filed a motion asking the BIA to reconsider. Unfortunately for them, that motion did not toll the deadline for appealing the original BIA decision. <em>See Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1272 n. 3. Because the Pereiras\u2019 petition was not timely, we lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of their arguments for asylum, withholding, and CAT relief. <em>See id. </em>To the extent that the petition challenges the BIA\u2019s October 17, 2008 decision, we dismiss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The Pereiras\u2019 petition, filed on February 25, 2009, was timely as to the BIA\u2019s January 27, 2009 denial of their motion to reconsider. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). After the BIA has affirmed an IJ\u2019s order of removal, an alien may seek reconsideration on the ground that the BIA has made a legal or factual error. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(6); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). A motion for reconsideration must specify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and be supported by pertinent authority. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Despite the fact that their petition seeks review of the BIA\u2019s order denying reconsideration, the Pereiras do not address that order in their brief before this Court. Instead, the substance of the brief challenges the BIA\u2019s original decision, and offers argument only on the merits of the underlying claims-which, as discussed above, we are jurisdictionally barred from considering. The Pereiras make no attempt to show that the BIA abused its discretion in denying reconsideration. Thus, they have abandoned the issue. \u201cWhen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989) (mere assertion of error, without briefing specific arguments on the merits, waives the issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Even if the Pereiras had argued the point, they would not be able to show that the BIA abused its discretion in denying their motion for reconsideration. That motion did not identify any specific errors of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s original decision, and it contained nothing of substance that had not already been said in the Pereiras\u2019 initial appeal. \u201c[Mjerely reiterating arguments previously presented to the BIA does not' constitute \u2018specifying ... errors of fact or law\u2019 as required for a successful motion to reconsider.\u201d <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted) (omission in original). \u201cA motion that merely republishes the reasons that had failed to convince the tribunal in the first place gives the tribunal no reason to change its mind.\u201d <em>Ahmed v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 247, 249 (7th Cir.2004). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying a motion for reconsideration that offered no argument it had not already considered and rejected. To the extent that the petition challenges the denial of reconsideration, we deny it.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
