The circuit court admitted the exhibit in evidence over the defendant's objection. The defendant also asserted in the circuit court that the evidence was insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he had possession of cocaine and, thus, he could not be convicted of possession with intent to distribute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the conclusion of the bench trial, the court found the defendant guilty of evading and eluding a police officer in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-817 and fined him $100. The court convicted the defendant of possession with intent to distribute cocaine, possession of a firearm while possessing drugs, possession of a firearm by a felon, and possession of a concealed weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court fixed the defendant's punishment as follows: twelve years imprisonment for possession with intent to distribute cocaine; five years imprisonment for possession of a firearm while possessing drugs; five years imprisonment for possession of a firearm by a felon; and six months imprisonment for the possession of a concealed weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant appealed his convictions to the Court of Appeals. Among other things, the defendant contended that the circuit court erred by admitting in evidence the exhibit that purported to demonstrate that he had a prior felony conviction. The defendant also asserted that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he had actual or constructive possession of the cocaine. The Court of Appeals denied the defendant's petition,\n   <em>\n    McMillan v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   Record No. 1488-07-1 (January 16, 2008), and we awarded the defendant an appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Applying well-established principles of appellate review, we will state the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party in the circuit court.\n   <em>\n    Bishop v.

Officer Bowers observed a car traveling east on Interstate 64 and a license plate was not affixed to the front of the car. The officer, whose police cruiser was situated on the shoulder of the highway, drove his cruiser onto the interstate and followed the car. Lushawn Carolina was driving the car and the defendant was a passenger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Carolina drove the car to an exit on Interstate 64 and entered Rip Rap Road at a high rate of speed. Officer Bowers, who was following Carolina's car, activated his police cruiser's emergency lights in an attempt to stop Carolina's car. Carolina drove his car onto a residential street and he entered the driveway of a residence. Carolina got out of his car and began to walk to the front door of the residence. Officer Bowers parked his police cruiser, got out of his car, and directed Carolina to return to the car he had been driving. Carolina complied and sat in the driver's seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As Officer Bowers approached the driver's window of Carolina's car, he smelled an odor of \"burnt\" marijuana. After the officer asked Carolina for his driver's license and registration, Carolina responded that his license had been suspended, the car belonged to his brother, and Carolina did not have the vehicle registration card.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Bowers saw Carolina \"lean[] forward as if he were about to open [the glove compartment], but he leaned back straight up in his seat and he didn't open the glove compartment.\" Carolina presented Officer Bowers with a Virginia identification card, but he did not have a driver's license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Officer Bowers asked Carolina how did he know that the registration card was not in the glove compartment since he had not opened it to search for the card. Carolina opened the glove compartment and Officer Bowers saw the registration card on top of several traffic summonses. Officer Bowers also observed a \"Crown Royal bag.\" The Crown Royal bag was made of purple cloth and had been used to package a bottle of Crown Royal Canadian whiskey, which was not inside the bag.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Officer Bowers directed Carolina to exit his car and sit in the police cruiser so that the officer could separate Carolina from McMillan. Officer Bowers checked to be sure that Carolina had no weapons on his person. Officer Bowers and Carolina sat in the police car for about 15 minutes while the officer prepared traffic summonses and waited for another State police officer to arrive at the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As Officer Bowers conversed with Carolina in the police car, McMillan, who remained in the passenger seat of Carolina's car, began to move \"around in the seat and he was looking back in [the] direction\" of the police cruiser. Carolina told Bowers that he wanted McMillan to drive Carolina's car once Bowers had issued the traffic summonses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Bowers went to Carolina's car where McMillan remained seated. Bowers obtained McMillan's driver's license and returned to his police cruiser to ascertain the status of McMillan's driver's license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Officer Bowers told Carolina that Bowers had smelled marijuana in the car and he believed that Carolina and McMillan had \"something illegal.\" Carolina repeatedly told Officer Bowers that the officer had no reason to search the car and could not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Officer Bowers returned to Carolina's car and gave McMillan his driver's license. Officer Bowers repeatedly asked McMillan to open the glove compartment so that the officer could determine to whom the summonses had been issued. McMillan refused to open the glove compartment. McMillan told Officer Bowers that he should ask Carolina to open the glove compartment \"because it wasn't his [McMillan's] car and he [McMillan] didn't have anything to do with what was in the glove compartment.\" Subsequently, Officer Bowers opened the glove compartment, retrieved two traffic summonses and in the process removed the \"Crown Royal bag.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Officer Bowers opened the \"Crown Royal bag\" and saw what appeared to be \"chunks of ... rock cocaine.\" Officer Bowers, who was standing on the passenger side of Carolina's car, glanced at his police cruiser to watch Carolina. McMillan, who was in the front passenger seat, \"jumped out\" of the driver's door of Carolina's car and \"ran fast.\" The police officers were unable to apprehend\n   him. Carolina, however, was arrested and Officer Bowers conducted a search of the car. McMillan was arrested 12 days after he fled from Officer Bowers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   During the search of Carolina's car, Officer Bowers found a loaded Smith &amp; Wesson .40 caliber pistol under the driver's seat. He also found under the driver's seat a large plastic bag that contained a small baggie with crack cocaine residue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Officer Bowers found a \"loaded [G]lock\" .40 caliber pistol under the passenger seat where McMillan had been sitting. The pistol was \"fully loaded with 15 rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber.\" The officer also found, behind the gun under the passenger seat, a clear plastic baggie that contained \"four other balled up baggies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   After Officer Bowers had searched the car, he \"took a closer look inside of the Crown Royal bag that [he] had opened earlier.\" The \"Crown Royal bag\" contained a clear plastic baggie and 13 individually wrapped zip-lock baggies containing what appeared to be crack cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Officer Bowers also found a shoe box on the back floorboard area behind Carolina's seat. The shoe box contained sneakers that were the same size as the shoes that Carolina was wearing at that time. The shoe box contained 78 of the \"same type zip-lock baggies that [Officer Bowers] had found the crack cocaine in. They were all empty.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Betty Jane Blankenship, a forensic scientist with the Virginia Department of Forensic Science, testified that she conducted DNA profiles on swabs that she obtained from McMillan and swabs \"from the grip trigger\" of the pistol that was found under the passenger seat where McMillan had been seated. The DNA profile \"from the grip trigger matched perfectly the DNA profile of Willis McMillan.\" Blankenship gave the following testimony about the DNA profile:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"Question: And you said it was a match. And is there a certain ratio that you use in order to provide a Certificate of Analysis?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"Answer: Yes. We do a statistical analysis on the DNA profile from the grips and trigger and you would expect to find that profile once in the population of the world.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"Question: And that's 6 billion?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"Answer: 6 billion people at the time that I did this certificate anyway.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   McMillan asserts that the evidence was insufficient to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he possessed the cocaine. He contends that the Commonwealth failed to prove that he exercised dominion or control over the cocaine. Continuing, he argues that the Commonwealth failed to exclude the reasonable hypothesis of innocence that the cocaine belonged to Carolina alone. We disagree with McMillan's contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We have stated that \"[o]n appeal, great deference is given to the factfinder who, having seen and heard the witnesses, assesses their credibility and weighs their testimony. Thus, a [circuit] court's judgment will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\"\n   <em>\n    Young v.

The defendant was a passenger in the front seat of the car where the illegal drugs were found. A loaded pistol, that contained his DNA material, was hidden under the passenger seat where he was seated. Officer Bowers found packaging that could be used for distribution of illegal drugs immediately behind the defendant's pistol. The defendant refused to open the glove compartment where the \"Crown Royal bag\" containing crack cocaine was found because McMillan said \"he didn't have anything to do with what was in the glove compartment.\" When Officer Bowers opened the glove compartment, inspected the \"Crown Royal bag\" and saw \"chunks of ... rock cocaine,\" McMillan fled. These facts are sufficient to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that at a minimum, McMillan had constructive possession of the cocaine in the glove compartment, which was well within his reach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The trial court admitted in evidence, over McMillan's objection, an exhibit that included a petition filed in the Hampton Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court dated September 10, 2000, and a document captioned \"Office Contacts &amp; Court Proceedings\" that contained numerous notations made by an unknown scrivener. The Commonwealth introduced this exhibit in evidence to establish the defendant's prior felony conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   According to the petition, R.O. Wooden, presumably an employee of the Hampton Fire Department, stated under oath that McMillan, who was 14 years old, \"unlawfully and feloniously on or about 09/10/00 attempt[ed] to maliciously burn a dwelling house ... in Hampton, in violation of [\u00a7\u00a7] 18.2-77 and 18.2-26 of the 1950 Code of Virginia as amended.\" The petition contained the following case number: J036646-13-00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The document captioned \"Office Contacts &amp; Court Proceedings\" contains the following information:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \"J036646\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \"MCMILLAN, WILLIS ALEXANDER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"2-5-86 (age 14)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \"13-00 ATTEMPT ARSON\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   9-10-00 18.2-77/18.2-26\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \"WOODEN, R.O.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Below is the content of the document:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \"OFFICE CONTACTS &amp; COURT PROCEEDINGS / copy to: SUMMONS ISSUED: Willis McMillan IP Deborah Curry IP\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   9-11-00 Def. present w/Deborah Curry his legal custodian.

The defendant contends that the exhibit is not an order of conviction, but merely contains notes and that the exhibit does not show the crime to which McMillan tendered his plea of guilty.

Additionally, the Commonwealth contends that the defendant has not challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction of the charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon on the basis that the predicate offense had not been proven and, therefore, to the extent the defendant raises a claim of sufficiency of the evidence, that claim is procedurally defaulted pursuant to Rule 5:25.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \"It is a fundamental principle of jurisprudence that evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Even though our decisions in\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Overbey\n   </em>\n   relate to the sufficiency of the evidence to prove prior felony convictions that were necessary elements to sustain convictions, these cases are highly instructive for our resolution of the present appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Palmer,\n   </em>\n   this Court considered whether the evidence was sufficient to prove that a defendant's juvenile conviction was for an act felonious in nature. George Palmer was indicted by a grand jury for several charges, including two charges of possession of a firearm\n   when he was under the age of 29 after having been convicted of a delinquent act that would have been a felony if committed by an adult in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2.\n   <em>\n    Palmer,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632464\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/609/308/\">\n    269 Va. at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 609 S.E.2d at 308-09.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   During Palmer's trial, the Commonwealth presented four petitions and accompanying disposition orders from the Halifax County Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court as evidence to prove that Palmer had been convicted of a delinquent act felonious in nature. Two of the petitions contained allegations that Palmer committed the delinquent act of grand larceny in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-95 and two other petitions contained allegations that Palmer committed the delinquent act of burglary with the intent to commit larceny in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-91. The juvenile and domestic relations district court records did not contain any orders providing an adjudication of the four charges. The \"disposition order\" entered for each charge required Palmer to pay restitution to the victim and to be committed to jail for 12 months, six months suspended, subject to two years of good behavior.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 206, 609 S.E.2d at 309.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Palmer objected to the admission of the juvenile and domestic relations district court petitions and disposition orders. He also made a motion to strike the evidence at the end of the Commonwealth's case and at the conclusion of all the evidence. He argued that the juvenile and domestic relations district court records did not establish a prior conviction of a delinquent act felonious in nature.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 206, 609 S.E.2d at 309.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The circuit court acknowledged that the juvenile and domestic relations district court form \"is not good,\" but the court held that there was \"no question\" that Palmer had been convicted of the delinquent acts as charged. The court reasoned that Palmer could have only been committed to jail for a time period set forth in the court documents if he had been convicted of the delinquent acts that would have been a felony had those acts been committed by an adult.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Reversing the conviction, we stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \"When the fact of a prior conviction is an element of a charged offense, the burden is on the Commonwealth to prove that prior conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    See Moore v.

The litigants, the circuit court, and the Court of Appeals, did not consider what application, if any, Code \u00a7 8.01-389 has to the admissibility of the evidence at issue in this appeal. Thus, this Court need not, and does not, consider what effect, if any, Code \u00a7 8.01-389 has upon the admissibility of the challenged evidence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Senior Justice RUSSELL, with whom Justice KINSER and Justice LEMONS join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   I concur in the majority's holding that the evidence was sufficient to support McMillan's conviction of possession with intent to distribute cocaine. I respectfully dissent, however, from the majority's holding that the trial court erred in admitting in evidence the records of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court of the City of Hampton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   With respect to his conviction of possession of a firearm after having been previously convicted of a felony, McMillan presented two questions in his appeal to the Court of Appeals: (1) Did the trial court err in admitting in evidence the record of his 2001 conviction in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court (JDR court) of attempted arson of a dwelling house? (2) Was the evidence, consisting solely of that record, sufficient to support the firearm possession conviction? McMillan abandoned the second claim in his appeal to this Court, perhaps because he had not made that argument at trial. Here, with respect to the firearm possession conviction, he assigns as error only the trial court's admission of the JDR court\n   record in evidence. Consequently, our consideration is confined solely to the question of admissibility, not that of sufficiency. Rule 5:17(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Although evidence of prior crimes committed by the accused is inadmissible for the general purpose of showing bad character or a predisposition to commit the crime for which he is on trial, where a statute makes a prior conviction an element of the offense charged, the Commonwealth has the burden of proving the prior conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. The most efficient way of carrying this burden is by an attested copy of an order of conviction, but that is not the only method of proof available to the Commonwealth. For this purpose, we have held, as has the Court of Appeals, that \"[p]rior convictions may be proved by\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   competent evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Perez v.

As the majority opinion indicates, we have reiterated that principle in a long series of decisions extending to the present time. In one of these, we stated that the key to the admissibility of evidence is its relevance to a material issue in the case. There, we said: \"Relevance exists when the evidence has a logical tendency, however slight, to prove a fact at issue in a case.\"\n   <em>\n    Hodges v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=272%20Va.%20418\">\n    272 Va. 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 436,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12636679\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/634/680/#p690\">\n    634 S.E.2d 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 690 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Applying those principles, our inquiry must be whether the JDR court record had even a slight tendency to prove that McMillan had been previously found guilty, as a juvenile offender, of a crime that would have been a felony if committed by an adult. In that connection, it is noteworthy that McMillan does not dispute that he is the individual to whom the JDR record relates. He does not contend that he was convicted of any offense other than attempted arson, the single charge named in the petition. It is undisputed that attempted arson of a dwelling house, whether occupied or not, is a felony. Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-77 and 18.2-26. McMillan does not contend that the charge was reduced to a misdemeanor or a lesser included offense by plea bargaining or otherwise, and any surmise on our part that such a reduction might have occurred would be speculation unsupported by any evidence whatever. As the majority opinion points out, a court may not engage in conjecture or surmise in determining the offense for which a defendant was convicted. McMillan's sole contention on appeal is that a reader of the JDR record cannot determine of what offense he was convicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The JDR court record shows McMillan's name, the charged offense \"Attempt Arson,\" the citations of the Code sections making that crime a felony and the case number on every page. The record contains the court order appointing counsel for McMillan, which is signed \"Louis R. Lerner, Judge.\" The page of notes containing the entries \"Def. present w/guardian &amp; Atty. King. Def. offers a plea of guilty. Waiver and stipulation of the evid. Ct. accepts plea. Ct. finds def. guilty. Disposition 2-26-01\" bears the handwritten signature \"Louis R. Lerner.\" I find it difficult to say that those entries have not the slightest tendency to persuade a fact-finder that McMillan had a prior felony conviction and were therefore irrelevant to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The majority opinion stresses the fact that the notes in the JDR record were made by an \"unknown scrivener.\" The General Assembly has resolved any concern that may arise on that account. Code \u00a7 8.01-389 provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   A. The records of any judicial proceeding and any other official records of any court in this Commonwealth shall be received as\n   prima facie evidence provided that such records are authenticated and certified by the clerk of the court where preserved to be a true record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   D. \"Records\" as used in this article shall be deemed to include any memorandum, report, paper, data compilation, or other record in any form, or any combination thereof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Code \u00a7 8.01-391(C) provides that a copy of any record made by a court or clerk thereof in the performance of its official duties \"shall be admissible into evidence as the original\" if authenticated as a true copy by the clerk or deputy clerk of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The JDR court record to which McMillan objects bears the following certificate:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-122\">Eighth Judicial District, City of Hampton Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court 220 North King Street Hampton, VA 23669</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   I, the undersigned clerk or deputy clerk of the above-named court, authenticate pursuant to Va.Code \u00a7 8.01-391(C) on this date that the document to which this authentication is affixed is a true copy of a record in the above-named court, made in the performance of my official duties.\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-124\"><em>1-18-06</em> <em>M. H. Forrest</em> Date Deputy Clerk</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In my view, the JDR record was of the kind contemplated by the provision of Code \u00a7 8.01-389(A), mandating that it \"shall be received as prima facie evidence.\" The record may well not have been conclusive and may not have, in itself, amounted to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and it was surely subject to refutation by other evidence, but those questions are not before us. The JDR record was offered at the beginning of the trial, before the first witness testified. At that point, the trial court had no means of knowing what, if any, additional evidence might be forthcoming. The court was not, at that stage, called upon to decide the sufficiency of the Commonwealth's case, but was confronted with a pure question of admissibility. The trial court had no choice but to admit the record as prima facie evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The majority opinion relies on our recent decisions in\n   <em>\n    Palmer v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632464\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/609/308/\">\n    269 Va. 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12632464\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/609/308/\">\n    609 S.E.2d 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005), and\n   <em>\n    Overbey v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=271%20Va.%20231\">\n    271 Va. 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12634797\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/623/904/\">\n    623 S.E.2d 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). As the majority opinion candidly admits, however, the issue in both\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Overbey\n   </em>\n   was the sufficiency of the evidence of juvenile records to support a conviction of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. In neither case was the admissibility of evidence an issue. Those cases, accordingly, have no bearing on the sole question presented in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The majority opinion states a conclusion that those cases do not support: \"Simply stated, in\n   <em>\n    Overbey\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Palmer,\n   </em>\n   the admitted evidence did not tend to prove or disprove that the defendant had been convicted of a prior felony.\" That is an admissibility analysis. Because those were sufficiency cases, they did not touch upon the question whether the evidence \"tend[ed] to prove or disprove\" anything. Rather, they simply held that the evidence, taken as a whole, did not establish the issue beyond a reasonable doubt. In the circumstances of the present case, that analysis was entirely within the province of the fact-finder and is not subject to review on appeal. Rules 5:17(C) and 5:25. If sufficiency were the issue in the present case, my view would be quite different.\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Overbey\n   </em>\n   have settled that question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   My concern with the majority opinion is that by commingling the principles applicable to an admissibility analysis with those applicable to a sufficiency analysis, considerable confusion may be introduced into the law of evidence in Virginia. For that reason, I respectfully dissent in part, and would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in its entirety.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
