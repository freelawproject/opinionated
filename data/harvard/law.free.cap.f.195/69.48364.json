Max Isaac, Special Master, and the exceptions thereto, and the record in the cause: It is, upon consideration, adjudged and decreed that the findings of the master are in all respects in accordance with the law, and his conclusions are affirmed, and his report is adopted as the opinion, conclusions, and judgment of the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">Than this the record shows no further order or decree of the court, and from the same this appeal was taken. As the order is not one granting or refusing a discharge, and is in no sense final, the appeal is. dismissed. See Walter Scott &amp; Co. v. Wilson, 115 Fed. 284, 53 C. C. A. 76; Stratton v.
