Eastman, referee in bankruptcy herein, and the court being fully advised in the premises, it is therefore ordered, adjudged, and decreed that H. Stern, the petitioning creditor in the above-entitled cause, be and he is hereby ordered to pay to the American Trust &amp; Savings Bank, trustee, in the above-entitled cause, the sum of $700.55 within 10 days from this date.

It is further ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the report of the Honorable Sidney C. Eastman, referee in bankruptcy herein, filed in this matter on the 23d day of April, 1910, be and the same is hereby approved and affirmed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-9\">Thereupon the said Harris Stern brought his petition here to review and revise so much of said order as directs him to pay the said sum of $700.55.,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-10\">To this petition, John M. Clark, one of the respondents thereto, duly filed his cross-petition to review and revise so much of said order as authorizes and directs the trustee to pay the sum found to be doe to him \u201cout of the funds in his hands.\u201d To both of these petitions the respondent, the American Trust &amp; Savings Bank, trustee, has duly made answer. No question is raised as to the right of the cross-petitioner to have his said demand paid as a part of the expenses of administration of said bankrupt estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b241-11\">From the record it appears that the Metals Extraction &amp; Refining Company was duly declared a bankrupt on the petition of said Harris Stern on or about December 12, 1908. On the same day, the American Trust &amp; Savings Bank was appointed receiver and took possession of said estate, and afterwards in due course was chosen trustee thereof. The property of the bankrupt consisted mainly of a certain manufacturing plant composed of machinery, fixtures, ole., which had been on November 10, 1908, and within four months from the time the petition in bankruptcy was filed, mortgaged to one Frank Gottstein for an alleged indebtedness of $1,000. The mortgagee filed his petition to have the property turned over to him, to which petition the trustee made answer and vigorous defense. On hearing, the court on May 7, 1909, directed the trustee to turn the property covered by the mortgage over to Gottstein. No claim was made attacking the validity and bona tides of tbe proceedings resulting in the appointment of the receiver and trustee. It seems to have been done with a view to the setting aside of the mortgage lien, as being void against the rights of creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Moreover, the mortgaged property was valued at a sum largely in excess of the mortgage, and was in fact appraised at a sum much greater than the mortgage indebtedness. For reasons not here in question, the result of the litigation was such that the trustee found itself under a deficit amounting to the sum of $700.55. On the issuance of a rule, at the instance of the trustee, to show cause before the referee as special master why he should not be required to make good said sum, said Stern made answer setting out, among other matters, his good faith in' filing the original petition. The special master made report to the court in part as follows, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-4\">\u201cIt seems to me there has been considerable carelessness, and an absence of consideration shown in this matter. * * * It seems to' me that the trustee is liable for this loss, most of which could have been prevented by proper application to the court. It is very probable that negotiations could have been entered into with the mortgagee for the storing of the property, or some arrangement could have been made whereby these expenses could have been saved. However, it was not done, and I see no other way to adjust the matter than to order the trustee to pay the account.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-5\">On the coming in of the special master\u2019s said first report, the District Court referred the same back to him \u201cto ascertain whether or not the petitioning creditor should be held for said amount in lieu of the trustee.\u201d AVith that direction in mind, the special master made new findings of fact, as well as of law from the same record. He reported that the trustee retained the same counsel as were'employed by the petitioning creditor and the receiver; that it was the opinion of the petitioning creditor that the mortgage, having been given within the four months\u2019 period, could be set aside; that he filed his original petition with that in view; and that the trustee, being thereto advised by its attorneys, and believing that there would be, in any event, enough to pay all costs and other expenses of the proceeding, made answer to the petition of the mortgagee to have the mortgaged property turned over to him, based on statements furnished by the petitioning creditor, with the result that the same was ordered to be turned over to the mortgagee, subject to the payment of the sum of $200 toward the expenses of the trustee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-6\">The special master thereupon found and reported to the court that the petitioning creditor was the moving cause in the premises, and that, having made use of the bankruptcy proceedings to accomplish his ends, he' should be held liable for all resulting deficiencies, and that:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-7\">\u201cThe law makes him\u201d (the petitioning creditor) \u201cliable to the bankrupt for inadvisedly causing him damage. It would seem reasonable that he should also protect him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-8\">To this report exceptions were interposed and overruled, and Stern .was ordered to pay said sum of $700.55 as aforesaid.

Counsel fees, costs, expenses, and damages shall be fixed and allowed by the court, and paid by the obligors in such bond.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">This seems to be the only provision of the act providing for the protection of a receiver for his outlay in excess of the amount collected by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In Atlantic Trust Company v. Chapman, etc., 208 U. S. 360, 28 Sup. Ct. 406, 52 L. Ed. 528, 13 Ann. Cas. 1155, it is held that the receiver is the arm, and subject only to the control of the court; that the parties are without power to direct; him; that \u2018\u2018the court in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion, and looking to the interests of all who might be affected by its action, could, at the outset, have made it a condition of the appointment of a receiver that the plaintiff and those whom it represented should be liable for any deficiency in the funds required for the expenses of the receivership.\u201d In the same case, it is further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">\u201cIt is true that cases are cited in which the party bringing a suit, in which a receiver is appointed, has been held liable for expenses incurred by the receiver in excess of the processes arising from the sale of the property. But in most, if not in all, of those cases the circumstances were peculiar and were such as to make it right and equitable, in the opinion of the court, that that should he done\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\u2014citing Ephraim v. Pacific Bank, 129 Cal. 589, 62 Pac. 177, where the court held that if the receiver\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">\u201clias taken property into his custody .under an irregular, unauthorized appointment, he must look for his compensation to the parties at whose instance he was appointed, and the same rule applied if the property of which, he fakes possession is determined to belong to persons who are not parties to the action, and is taken from his possession by paramount authority. As to such property his appointment as receiver was unauthorized and conferred uiion him no right to charge it with any expenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">On page 375 of 208 U. S., 28 Sup. Ct. 406, 52 L. Ed. 528, 13 Ann. Cas. 1155 of said Chapman Case, it is stated by the Supreme r\\mrt that the mere insufficiency of the property or fund to meet the expenses of a receivership does not entitle a receiver to hold the plaintiff m the suit personally liable, if all that could be said was that lie instituted the suit and moved for the appointment of the receiver to take charge of the property and maintain and operate it pending the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">In Cutter v. Pollock, 7 N. D. 631, 76 N. W. 235, the court says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\">\u201cV&gt;'e do not believe that any case can be found to uphold the palpably unjust rule that one who is shown to have had no right to maintain the action, and no interest whatever in the property which he claims, can require that the defendant who had paid out of his own pocket the expenses of a receivership, shall not call upon him (the plaintiff in the action) for reimbursement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">To the same effect are High on Receivers (3d Ed.) \u00a7 796, and Beach on Receivers, \u00a7 774, and a number of other authorities having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>reference to cases where the receivership was wrongfully procured in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Knickerbocker v. McKindley Co., 67 Ill. App. 291, relied on by the Dakota court, is a case in which the receiver was appointed in a suit to settle up a partnership. The partners had previously given a mortgage which was foreclosed, leaving nothing in the receiver\u2019s hands. Whereupon the court ordered the complainant, the representative of one of the' partners, to pay the costs. The Illinois cases cited in support of this latter decision, i. e., Einstein et al. v. Lewis et al., 54 Ill. App. 520, and Myres v. Frankenthal et al., 55 Ill. App. 390, both deal with the appoir'ment of receivers appointed without lawful authority, and are not deemed in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">In re Lacov, 142 Fed. 960, 74 C. C. A. 130, cited by petitioner, is not authority for the proposition claimed by petitioner. There the petition was dismissed as having been brought without cause. The foregoing authorities, we think, lay down the law with sufficient clarity that only in cases where the proceedings resulting in a receivership have been instituted improvidently or without reasonable cause, or without good faith, or the like, can the moving party be held liable for the payment of the excess of the costs of the receivership over and above the assets of the same. Here there is no claim that there was any want of good faith or care in instituting the proceedings. The mortgage was justly under suspicion, having been given within the four months\u2019 period. The value of the property covered by it was estimated to be largely in excess of the sum secured by the incumbrance. The facts of the case are such as would lead any reasonably careful person to feel justified in acting as the petitioning creditor did.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\"><bracketnum>[3]'</bracketnum> The summary of debts and assets shows $4,000 secured claims and some $15,500 assets. The appraisement placed the value of the mortgaged property at $1,000 in excess of' the mortgage. In the original and supplemental inventories, other property is scheduled at a valuation of something like $2,500. Neither may we overlook the fact that the special master, on his first essay to place the blame for the deficiency, lighted upon the trustee. That he afterwards, upon suggestion, changed his mind upon the same evidence, detracts little from the weight to be given his first impression. A creditor might well decline to pursue a bankrupt were he to be held, under circumstances such as are here shown, to have instituted proceedings improvidently. That part of said order which decrees that H. Stern, the petitioning creditor and petitioner herein, pay to the trustee the said sum of $700.55, is therefore vacated and held for naught. It \u2022follows that the trustee has no funds in his hands belonging to said bankrupt\u2019s estate, and therefore nothing wherewith to comply with the order of the court in the payment of the $523.35 found to be due said cross-petitioner herein. From the first report of the referee above referred to, it appears that at the time of the appointment of the receiver, inquiry was made of it by the landlord in regard to whether it would be responsible for rent and whether it would be willing to surrender the possession speedily, as the landlord was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>negotiating for a new tenant, etc. The receiver made reply on December 19, 1908, to the agents of the landlord as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-3\">\u2018\u2022Referring to y\u00f3urs of the 18th instant, wo advise that this bank was appointed receiver in bankruptcy in the above matter on December 12th and the receiver's liability for rental commenced on that date. We cannot give you any definite information as to when we will vacate the premises, or how much time we would require, but we assure you that we shall he pleased to do all that lies in our power to accommodate you as far as this matter is concerned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">It further appears from the petition of cross-petitioner filed with referee, upon which the said order of the referee was based, that cross-petitioner had actually closed a contract with a new tenant for said premises, who was ready and anxious to take possession at once, and that cross-petitioner\u2019s agents made repeated inquiries of the receiver and later the trustee as to when possession would be surrendered, but could get no definite answer. As between the cross-petitioner and the trustee, the latter is, under the facts of this case, liable to the former for the amount of his said claim, whether it has funds in its hands to reimburse itself or not. It was consequently error on the part of the District Court to limit the trustee\u2019s liability to pay said claim to the funds of the bankrupt\u2019s estate in its hands. That part of said order, therefore, which does so limit the trustee\u2019s liability, to wit, the words \u201cout of the funds in his hands,\u201d and also that portion of said order which approves and affirms the report of the referee, in so far as the same is inconsistent with the foregoing opinion, are also vacated and held for naught.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
