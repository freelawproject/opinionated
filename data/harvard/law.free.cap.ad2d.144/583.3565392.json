The appeal brings up for review the denial, after a hearing, of those branches of the defendant\u2019s omnibus motion which were to suppress physical evidence and certain statements made by him to the police.</p><p id=\"b625-11\">Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p><p id=\"b625-12\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution <em>(see, People v Contes, </em>60 NY2d 620), we find that it was legally sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, upon the exercise of our factual review power, we are satisfied that the verdict of guilt was not against the weight of the evidence (CPL 470.15 [5]).</p><p id=\"b625-13\">The record establishes that the statements made by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>defendant to law enforcement officials were made after he was fully informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention there is no requirement that police officers permit the family members of a competent 19-year-old adult, in custody, to communicate with him <em>(see, People v Crimmins, </em>64 NY2d 1072; <em>People v Strawder, </em>134 AD2d 630; <em>People v Casiano, </em>123 AD2d 712, <em>Iv denied </em>69 NY2d 744).</p><p id=\"b626-4\">Moreover, since one of the People\u2019s witnesses gave testimony which affirmatively damaged their case, they were entitled to introduce evidence that the witness had made a sworn statement which was contrary to such testimony (CPL 60.35; <em>People v Fitzpatrick, </em>40 NY2d 44). It is of no moment that they may not have been surprised by such testimony <em>(People v Magee, </em>128 AD2d 811; <em>People v Davis, </em>118 AD2d 796; <em>People v De Jesus, </em>101 AD2d 111, <em>affd </em>64 NY2d 1126).</p><p id=\"b626-5\">Under the circumstances, the defendant\u2019s sentence was neither harsh nor excessive <em>(see, People v Suitte, </em>90 AD2d 80).</p><p id=\"b626-6\">The defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are either unpreserved for appellate review or without merit. Thompson, J. P., Lawrence, Rubin and Eiber, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
