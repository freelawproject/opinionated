Memorandum: Because no direct proof was presented that defendant knew of any false statements on the loan applications or that he benefited from the loans, the trial court erred in refusing defense counsel\u2019s request to give a circumstantial evidence charge <em>(see, People v Ford, </em>66 NY2d 428, 441-443; <em>People v Rodriquez, </em>134 AD2d 153).</p><p id=\"b989-4\">We have reviewed defendant\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit.
