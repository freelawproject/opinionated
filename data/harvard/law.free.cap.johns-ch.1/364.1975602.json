That, on the 20th of April, 1814, the defendant broke up housekeeping, though, for years before, his annual expenses for housekeeping were between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>4 and <em>5,000 </em>dollars. That the defendant abandoned the plaintiff without home or support, and had since treated her with great cruelty and persecution, and denied her all support: that she had no means of living: that the defendant was a man of large fortune, and threatened to leave the <em>United States. </em>And she prayed a writ of <em>ne exeat, </em>and a writ of <em>supplicavit, </em>to restrain the defendant from disturbing her retreat, and for security, and for money to prosecute the suit, and also for a weekly or monthly allowance. The bill for a divorce was filed, but no answer was yet put in.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-4\">The facts stated in the petition were supported by <em>affidavits, </em>from which it also appeared that the defendant was a man of fortune, and worth above 200,000 dollars.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-5\"><em>T.

It is as well for <em>alimony </em>as for other relief. The allowance of a <em>ne exeat, </em>when the husband threatens to leave the state, and his wife without any support, is essential to justice, and has been granted in like cases.

From what was said in the case of <em>Mix </em>v. <em>Mix,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as well as from the cases now cited, the rule appears to be, that the wife who is under the necessity of carrying on a suit against her husband, or of defending one against him, is entitled, as well to a reasonable allowance to be paid by the husband for the necessary expenses of the suit, as to an allowance for <em>alimony </em>pending the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">I shall, accordingly, allow the <em>ne exeat, </em>and direct security under it to be taken, in the sum of 25,000 dollars, and shall, also, allow at the rate of 100 dollars per month, for <em>alimony, </em>and the further sum of250 dollars, to be paid by the defendant <em>to </em>the plaintiff, or to the register, or assistant register, on her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>behalf, towards defraying the necessary charges of the suit, on herParL</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AyD\"> Ante, p. 109.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
