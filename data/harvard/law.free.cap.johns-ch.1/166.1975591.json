The patentee took possession of the islands, and transmitted them, by descent, to the great grandfather of the plaintiff, who was seised thereof in 1745. In <em>August, </em>1778, he made his will, and devised the islands to <em>William Nicoll, </em>the grandfather of the plaintiff, for life; remainder to the father of the plaintiff, for life ; remainder to the first son of the plaintiff\u2019s father, in fee tail; and, afterwards, died. The plaintiff\u2019s grandfather entered on the premises, under the will, in 1780, and continued in possession until his death, in 1796. The plaintiff\u2019s father then entered as tenant for life, and continued in possession until his death, in 1799, when the plaintiff, then <em>en ventre sa mere, </em>became seised of the premises in fee tail, and which was converted into a fee simple, under the will, by virtue of the act abolishing entails.

But, lately, the defendants have set up their title to those islands, as part of the <em>common </em>lands of <em>Huntington.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-6\">That, in 1802, <em>Zebulon Smith </em>having entered on <em>Captree </em>island, and cut and carried away grass, in defiance of the plaintiff\u2019s right, and <em>J.

That the defendants persisting in their claim to the said islands, declaring their intention to enter thereon, and to encourage others to enter, and cut, and carry away, the grass, &amp;c., in despite of the plaintiff\u2019s title, so that the plaintiff will be forced to abandon his rights, or be led into a <em>multiplicity of suits, and to great expense.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-6\">That owing to the great changes which have taken place in the beach, between the bay and the ocean, and the guts or water passages through the same, since the letters patent were issued, the <em>Huntington </em>gut cannot be located without the testimony of <em>aged witnesses. </em>And the bill, therefore, prayed that their testimony might be <em>perpetuated ; </em>and that the title of the plaintiff might be established by a decree of this court; and that the defendants may be restrained by an <em>injunction </em>from further entering on the islands, and taking the profits: and that the suits against <em>Monfort </em>and <em>Leek, </em>also, be enjoined; and for further and other relief, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-7\">The <em>answer </em>of the defendants admitted the patent to <em>Mcoll, </em>in 1688, but insisted that it covered <em>Fire Island </em>only, and not the others. They denied that any of the ancestors, or guardians of the plaintiff, ever had seisin or possession of, or right to, the other islands, but admitted the chain of descent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>as stated, and the title to <em>Fire Island ; </em>that the four islands are uninhabitable, and were only useful for the grass, &amp;c.; and denied any use by the plaintiff, or his ancestors, or ownership, except as to <em>Fire Island. </em>The defendants denied that <em>Huntington </em>Gut, mentioned in the patent to <em>Mcoll, </em>lay west of the four islands, and averred that it was the same as the one now railed <em>Fire Island Inlet, </em>and, sometimes, formerly, the <em>Great Gut; </em>and was, from the earliest settlement of the country, known by the name of the <em>Huntington Gut. </em>They admitted the changes of the guts, as stated by the plaintiff; that <em>Huntington Gut, </em>in the patent, is now called <em>Fire-Island </em>Inlet, and was never filled up, and that no other gut was ever called by the name of <em>Huntington.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-3\">They admit the patent and confirmation to the town of Huntington, in 1666, and that, counting east, the nine necks will not include either of the four islands; but they insisted that the nine necks were not contiguous, but were so many necks as had been purchased of the <em>Indians, and </em>that <em>some of </em>them were as far <em>east </em>as the bounds of <em>Huntington ; </em>that the three islands are embraced by the patent of <em>Huntington ; </em>and that the freeholders, &amp;c., took possession of them as such, and continued in possession, until the patent of the 2d <em>of.

Theyadmittedthepatentofconfirmationml694. and that the bounds of the town are as therein described: and that the eastern boundary line of the town, as set forth in the patent, is not so far east as to embrace the three islands, or either of them. The defendants insisted, that the inhabitants of <em>Huntington </em>have always claimed and exercised ownership, and, for twenty years past, have let out the lands yearly ; and that no adverse claim was set up, until about eighteen or twenty years ago, when the plaintiff\u2019s grandfather made claim to those islands ; and about twelve years ago, he brought actions of trespass against persons entering on the islands under the defendants, before justices of the peace; and the defendants pleading title, the causes were removed into the county court, but were not prosecuted far-; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>ther. That the guardians of th\u00e9 plaintiff brought three actions of trespass, as stated by the plaintiff, but the defendants in those suits did not plead, or rely on the title of the town of Huntington, but on the want \u00f3f possession in the plaintiff; and that the defendants insisted on their right, and a possession of the three islands, for above one hundred years. They admitted, that suits were brought against <em>Smith </em>and others, and a verdict found in one of the suits, for the plaintiff; but that such verdict was against the evidence, which was contradictory. They admitted that they persisted in their right, but denied any intention to force the plaintiff to abandon his claim, by a multiplicity of suits; and they objected to the examination of witnesses <em>in perpetuam rei memoriam, </em>and to the prayer of the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-5\">It is unnecessary to state the mass of evidence taken in. the cause. The material parts of it will be found in the opinion delivered by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-6\">In 1807, the Chancellor having ordered an injunction to restrain <em>Weeks </em>from proceeding in the suits brought by him; and, also, that the guardians of the plaintiff should be examined as witnesses in the cause, <em>appeals </em>were entered on those orders; and, in Februdry, 1808, the court of errors dismissed the appeal, and remanded the cause. (Vide S. C., 3 Johns. <em>Rep. </em>566\u2014608.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-7\">This cause was first brought to a hearing, on the* pleadings and proofs, before the late Chancellor, in 1809, who, without entering fully into the merits, awarded a feigned issue, to be tried in <em>Queen\u2019s </em>county, by a special jury, at the circuit of the supreme court. By the directions for the feigned issue, the right of <em>Nicoll </em>only, to the islands in question, was to be tried, without any inquiry into the title of the town of <em>Huntington.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-8\">The feigned issue was accordingly made up, and tried before the present <em>Chief Justice, </em>in <em>June, </em>1811, and a verdict was found against the plaintifl\u2019s title. The judge certified, that he was satisfied with the verdict; and that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>was of opinion, and so declared to the jury, on the trial, that neither the plaintiff, nor the trustees of the town of Huntington, had any title to the premises in question, upon a just location of their respective patents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-4\">In <em>August, </em>1811, the plaintiff petitioned for a and, also, moved for a new trial of the feigned issue, which last motion stood over, by order of the court, until the question as to a rehearing should be decided ; because, if a rehearing should be granted, a new trial would be unnecessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-6\">The petition for a rehearing stated, as grounds for the application, that the Chancellor had erroneously excluded some affidavits which had been offered in evidence on the part of the plaintiff; and that the feigned issue, as directed, had only brought the plaintiff\u2019s title in question, without, at the same time, inquiring into the title of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-7\">In <em>December, </em>1811, the Chancellor ordered a rehearing of the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-8\">In <em>May, </em>1812, a petition was presented, on the part of the plaintiff, to dismiss <em>William </em>Udall, as one of the guardians of the plaintiff, to the end that he might be a competent witness for the plaintiff in the cause, the plaintiff offering to give security for costs, if required; and the guardian was. accordingly, dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-9\">In <em>\"October, </em>1812, the plaintiff petitioned the court for an order for leave to examine further witnesses in the cause, to establish facts discovered since the former hearing, and to examine <em>William Udall, </em>late one of the plaintiff\u2019s guardians, and who could not, while guardian, have been examined ; and in support of this application, the following cases were cited : <em>Callon </em>v. <em>Mince, Prec. in Chan. </em>234. 2 <em>Vern. </em>472. <em>Sanford </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>3 <em>Bro.

That the plaintiff had a right to the equitable interposition of this court on account of the <em>difficulties </em>attending a remedy at law; that a court of chancery has jurisdiction, and it may decide questions of law and fact, without a jury, and though such questions relate to lands or goods. (5 <em>Br. P. C. </em>369. 8 <em>Br. P. C. </em>399. 5 <em>Vesey, </em>jun. 671. <em>Cur. Cancell. </em>344. 6 <em>Crunch's Rep. </em>22. 1 <em>Johns.

That the first patent to the inhabitants of <em>Huntington </em>did not include the premises ; that the <em>bay </em>is an <em>arm </em>of the <em>sea, </em>and is to be considered as the <em>sea, </em>in the meaning of the patent. (1 <em>Harg. Law Tracts, </em>10\u201418.) The second patent was similar to the first. The third patent contracts the limits of the town, on the north, and enlarges them on the south ; and the defendants admit that this patent does not cover the premises. This patent was, in law, a <em>surrender </em>of the two former patents ; and if so, there must be an end of the title of the defendants. (20 <em>Vin. Ab. Surrender, </em>125. s. 5. 128. s. 9, 10. 129. s. 11, 12. 131. s. 25. 29. 6 <em>Co. </em>69. <em>b. </em>10 <em>Co </em>67. b.) If the defendants have no title, the plaintiff, having shown a possession, must prevail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-15\">That from the evidence in the cause, no further issue or trial could be necessary to enable the court to decide in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>favour of the plaintiff. But if any issue should be directed, it ought to be so framed as to inquire into the title of the defendants, as well as that of the plaintiff; for, if neither ' 1 party had a title, the property was in the state : and this re-suit would have great influence as to awarding costs. But it is enough for the plaintiff to show a possession, or colourable title.</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"Ate\"><em>August </em>29th.</otherdate>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-9\"><em>For the </em>defendants, it was insisted, that this was not a case of original equity jurisdiction. It was strictly matter of legal cognizance, of which chancery entertains jurisdiction incidentally, in order to prevent suits becoming an instrument of oppression by means of endless litigation, but which a court of law has no power to prevent. However clear and uncontradicted the evidence may have been, this court could not decree, without directing an issue at law. The suit is in the nature of a <em>bill of peace. </em>There have been two verdicts, one for each party. One verdict is not sufficient to decree in favour of the plaintiff. (4 <em>Bro. P. C. </em>692\u2014700.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-10\">2. The third patent was not a surrender of <em>the fee </em>granted by the first and second. There can be no surrender of a <em>fee, </em>by implication. This is applicable only to lesser estates which can be merged in a greater. (Co. <em>Litt. </em>337. b. 4 <em>Cruise\u2019s Dig. </em>155. <em>tit. </em>32. ch. 9. s. 1. 4. 6. <em>Perkins, </em>585. 20 <em>Vin. Ab. </em>123. pl. 5. 144. pl. 3.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-12\">The cause stood over for decision to this day, when the following judgment was pronounced by the court:</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b187-13\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"AC2\">The foundation of the bill is the legal right of the plaintiff to the three islands in dispute; and his claim to the assistance of this court arises from the peculiar state of the property, and the oppressive nature of the litigation which it involves. His case states a proper ground of equitable jurisdiction, and if the title he sets up was sufficiently established at law, before he came here, or was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>since established to the satisfaction of this court, either upon its own view of the testimony, or by verdict, upon one or more issues, to be awarded to its discretion, it would then be <em>' J </em>, the duty of the court to declare that right by decree, and protect it by injunction. But, on the other hand, if the title of the plaintiff fails, on investigation, and I shall be satisfied, from all that appears in the case, that is not well founded, it would then be useless to put the parties to the expense of another feigned issue. The bill would have no real ground of support, and ought to be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">I have accordingly been led to direct my first and principal attention to the testimony bearing on the plaintiff\u2019s title.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">His title rests upon the construction and location of the patent of 1688, to <em>William Nicoll, </em>his ancestor. There was no possession of the islands by any person, except occasional entries, and these were not so exclusive, steady, and certain, as to amount to evidence of right, and to supersede the necessity of paper title.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-14\">The words of the patent are easily and obviously satisfied according to the present physical state of that part of the country, without resorting to the pretensions of the plaintiff. Indeed, it is impossible to cast the eye upon any modern and accurate map of <em>Long Island </em>without being struck with the impression, that the plaintiff\u2019s construction of his patent is violent and unnatural; and nothing can reconcile us to it, but satisfactory proof that the beach on the south side of that island has undergone some great change since the date of the patent. There is a cluster of low islands, or small isles, which are separated by water, when the tide is full, but not so when the tide is down, and which are called ' <em>Fire Island, </em>or <em>Fire Islands, </em>and they lie <em>between a very noted and large inlet, or gut, and the lands of Nicoll. </em>It is admitted, on all sides, that they are included in the patent; and if that gut was <em>in esse, </em>at the time of the patent, it would seem, very naturally, to have been the one intended. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The words of the patent are, \u201c all those islands, and small isles, of sandy land and marsh, or meadow ground, with the appurtenances, situate, lying, and being, on the south side of \u2019 <em>J </em>' i 11 j <em>Long </em>Island, between the mlet or gut, commonly called <em>Huntington Gut, </em>and the lands of the said <em>Nicoll, </em>at a1 certain river called Conetqunt,\u201d &amp;c. If the above inlet, now existing and generally known by the name of <em>Fire-Island Inlet, </em>be the one referred to in the patent, by the name of the \u201c gut, commonly called the <em>Huntington gut,\u201d </em>it puts an end to the.plaintiff\u2019s claim. To this point a great part of the testimony in the cause has been directed. On the part of the plaintiff, several witnesses have been examined to prove that, for the last 40 or 50 years, or as long as they can well remember, this <em>Fire-Island Inlet </em>has been known by the several names of <em>Fvre-Island Inlet, </em>or <em>Gut, </em>the <em>Great Gut, Nicoll'1 s </em>Gut, or <em>Nine-Mile Gut ; </em>but not by the name of <em>Huntington Gut. </em>The testimony of <em>Garret Kettletas, Israel Howell, Jacob Willet, Isaac Thompson, Daniel Jarvis, Epenetus Wood, Daniel TJdall, </em>and <em>Richard Udall, </em>goes to this fact. On the other hand, there are several witnesses examined on the part of the defendants, who testify to the same length of time, and that <em>Fire Island Inlet </em>was known, as well by the name of <em>Huntington Gut, </em>or <em>Huntington East Gut, </em>as by the other names above mentioned. This appears from the testimony of <em>Luke Ruland, Moses Wicks, Caleb Saxton, James Pearsall, \u25a0 Gilbert Wickes, Joseph Ruland, Joseph Ketcham, </em>and <em>Arthur Dingee. </em>There may be a few more witnesses on one side or the other, whose testimony has some relation to this point; but it is unnecessary to be more particular. The weight of this testimony, in respect to the name, is on the side of the defendants, from this circumstance, that the witnesses on that side speak affirmatively, as to a fact within their knowledge, of the name of <em>Huntington Gut, </em>or <em>Huntington East Gut, </em>and the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses can only speak negatively of their having no knowledge of any such name so applied. But after all. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>there is much uncertainty in the attempt to designate the gut, by the shifting and changing <em>names </em>used within the last fifty years. The patent goes back 125 years, and speaks _ _ _ . ,, _ \u2022 i of the name <em>then </em>commonly given to the inlet.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The plaintiff has, however, proved affirmatively, by seve- ~ Tal witnesses, as <em>Garret Kettletas, Isaac Howell, David Willet, John Arthur, </em>and <em>Epenetus Wood, </em>that there was -formerly a gut to the westward of the islands in dispute, and now filled up, which was called <em>Huntington Gut. </em>On the other hand, it is proved by <em>Caleb Saxton, Gilbert Wickes, Joseph Ketcham, </em>and <em>Richard Udall, </em>that <em>Gilgo Gut </em>(and which now appears on the maps to be west of the town of <em>Huntington) </em>was anciently known by the name of <em>Huntington West Gut, </em>or <em>Huntington Gut ; </em>and one of them said it had been called <em>Huntington West Gut </em>by old whale-men, who have been dead forty years; and another said, that the temporary gut, opposite <em>Cedar Island, </em>was called <em>Huntington West Gut, </em>as contradistinguished from <em>Fire Island Inlet, </em>which was called <em>Huntington East Gut.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">With respect to this intermediate gut, between <em>Fire-Island Inlet </em>and <em>Gilgo Gut, </em>(the two plain and noted inlets, which, and none other in that quarter, are known to modern times and modern maps,) it appears to have been very temporary, and soon disappeared. The whole testimony concerning it, is loose tradition, and involved in darknes and fable. <em>Jacob Seaman </em>says, that about fifty years ago, the ocean broke through the beach, between <em>Fire-Island Gut </em>and <em>Gilgo Gut, </em>with great violence, and formed what was called <em>Cedar-Island Gut, </em>but which in a few years was filled up, and gone. <em>Isaac Thompson </em>speaks, also, but loosely, of a gut called <em>Huntington Gut, </em>between <em>Cedar </em>and <em>Oak Islands, </em>now disappeared ; and he says, that within his memory, the water has several times broke through the beach, and that the inlets afterwards closed up.. Though several of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses have designated one of these intermediate and temporary guts, as, having been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>known by the name of <em>Huntington Gut, </em>yet, I think, we must be governed by mere conjecture, in fixing on any of these transient inlets as the inlet intended by the patent of 1688. * Why should we be seeking, through the most vague and contradictory traditions, for some extinguished inlet, which may enable the plaintiff to embrace islands lying far west, and <em>collateral </em>to his lands, when we have, in front of his farm, a large inlet of unknown antiquity, which includes <em>between it and his lands </em>the little islands lying <em>against </em>or <em>opposite </em>his lands, and which so readily corresponds with the words of the patent ?</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">But it is contended, that even <em>Fire-Island Inlet, </em>though now nine miles wide, did not exist at the date of the patent. If this be really so, we are then reduced to the necessity of exploring in the dark for the inlet in question. The bill admits, that it is now difficult to ascertain the one intended. To prove the commencement of <em>Fire Island Inlet </em>since 1688, the testimony of <em>John Arthur </em>and <em>Richard Udall, </em>is relied on. The first witness says, that he always understood, from a boy, (and as he said this in 1770, and was then seventy-four years old, he must refer back to within thirty years of the patent,) that <em>Fire-Island Inlet </em>broke through after <em>Nicoll </em>settled there, and that it used to be called the <em>New-Gut. </em>The other witness says, that old Mr. <em>Willis </em>told him, that he had been informed by his ancestors, that <em>Fire-Island Gut </em>broke through in the winter of 1690, or 1691, in a storm. This, at best, is improbable, and rests on foundations too weak. The sudden existence of such a grand inlet as that, known in the memory of the oldest witnesses by the names of the <em>Great Gut </em>and the <em>Nine Mile Gut, </em>and which was a passage for privateers durihg the revolutionary .war, must have been ascertained with much greater historical certainty; for it would have been regarded as a remarkable phenomenon in the natural history of the country. The inlet may, probably, have extended itself gradually towards the west Several of the witnesses attest to this, and the <em>fecM </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>applies equally to <em>Gilgo Gut; </em>but this progress must have been very gradual, for <em>Isaac Thompson, </em>who lived opposite <em>Fire-Island Inlet </em>forty-nine years, says, only, that from the appearances and changes within his knowledge, he thinks it probable that, formerly, the east shore of the gut was as far eastward as the end of <em>Fire Island. </em>If this was so, then the description in the patent applied most precisely to the <em>Fire Islands, </em>and to them only.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The patent to <em>William Smith, </em>in 1693, is a most important <em>item </em>of testimony, in the consideration of this question of fact; with me, it has all the preponderance so justly due to written, over parol proof, especially when we are referring to times far beyond the memory of man. That patent was 1 for lands bounded west on <em>East Conetqunt </em>river, and east on <em>Mastick </em>river, and down on each side to the main sea, with the islands in the bay, \u201c from a certain gut, or inlet, westward, commonly called <em>Huntington East Gut, </em>to a place on the beach, eastward, called <em>Cuptuange, </em>being the west bounds of <em>Southampton; </em>the beach and bay being twenty-four miles east and west.\u201d The present <em>Chief Justice, </em>who <em>tried the </em>feigned issue heretofore awarded in this cause, on the point whether the title of the three islands was in the plaintiff, certified, that this patent to <em>Smith </em>was offered in evidence upon the trial, and was located by parol proof; and that it appeared that the gut, in the patent to <em>Smith, </em>called <em>Huntington East Gut, </em>was the same with the one mentioned in the pleadings and testimony in this cause, by the name of <em>Fire-Island Inlet; </em>and that running west from the west bounds of <em>Southampton, </em>the twenty-four miles would terminate some distance to the east of <em>Fire-Island, </em>making the probable width of the gut, at the date of the patent, from three and a half to five miles, being nearly the width of <em>-NicolPs </em>land on <em>Long-Island. </em>He further certified, that he told the jury, if <em>Huntington East Gut, </em>in the patent to <em>Smith, </em>was the same with <em>\u2018Huntington Gut, </em>in the patent to <em>Mcoll, </em>the islands in question were not included in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>patent, and that he was of that opinion, and so told the jury, who accordingly found a verdict for the defendants. This patent to <em>Smith </em>does away all pretence of the creation of <em>Fire-Island </em>Inlet, by some violent action of the sea, since 1688 ; for, ifit existed in 1693, and was then a familiar passage, \u201c commonly called <em>Huntington East </em>Gut,\u201d it is quite certain it was not \u201c the new gut,\u201d suddenly brought into existence by a storm, within the two or three preceding years.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">From this view of the case, I am perfectly satisfied that the patent to <em>Nicoll </em>does not extend to <em>Captree, Oak, </em>and <em>Grass Islands, </em>and there is no need of any further issue to inform and satisfy my judgment. I have given the plaintiff the benefit of the testimony excluded on the issue; for I have taken it all into consideration in forming my conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">I have not placed reliance on the evidence which the plaintiff has given, of the use and possession of the islands, because, as I have already observed, (and the fact appears abundantly in. the testimony,) the islands are not capable of any other, possession, occupancy, or real use, than occasional and periodical entries to cut the grass and sedge; and the testimony as to this use, is quite as strong, if not much stronger, in favour of the defendants.' Several witnesses have testified to the claim and use of the islands, by the plaintiff and his ancestors, from the time of the lease to <em>Howell </em>and <em>Smith, </em>in 1768, down to the time of filing the bill; but as many, and, perhaps, more witnesses, testify to a similar claim and occupancy, during the same period, by the defendants, and those claiming under the town of <em>Huntington, </em>the result is, that possession must be adjudged to belong to, and to be in, the party who has the right; and as the plaintiff has no title, he has no lawful possession. The equity of his bill has totally failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">It cannot be material whether the title set up by the defendants be good or not, as to the point of the dismissal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>the bill. If they lia ve no ti tie, yet the bill must be dismissed, because the plaintiff has no title, and, consequently, no equity to support his case. But it is a very different ques-ti\u00b0n, whether the bill shall be dismissed with, or without, On this question, I have felt some embarrassment. Costs are always discretionary in this court. They are awarded, as Lord <em>Hardwicks </em>has observed, (2 <em>Atk. </em>552.,) not from any statute authority, but from conscience, and <em>ex arbitrio boni </em>viri, as to the satisfaction due on one side or the other. A general denial of costs, in all cases, would be holding out encouragement to great vexation, without any recompense, and therefore, costs usually follow the justice of the case ; hut they do not always follow the event of the cause. There are cases in which costs have been denied, though the plaintiff failed, when he had probable cause of suit. <em>(Trethewy </em>v. <em>Hoblin, </em>2 <em>Ch. Cas. </em>9.) So, where infant heirs revived a cross bill, and entered into very long and expensive examinations, to set aside a deed, and failed, yet costs were denied against them, as they had probable cause to contend. <em>(Shales </em>v. Sir <em>John </em>Barrington, 1 <em>P. Wms. 481.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">In the present case, it strikes me that the plaintiff had probable cause to come here. His ancestors had maintained a long and steady claim to the islands in dispute, and had leased one of them as early as the year 1768. He had also succeeded at law in an action of trespass, tried at the <em>Suffolk </em>circuit, in which he had alleged a seisin in himself, and the defendant had alleged a freehold in <em>Huntington, </em>and on the traverse of the defendant\u2019s title, the issue had been found for the plaintiff. Other trespass suits between the parties were still pending; and, with respect to the merits of the case, as it appears before this court, the defendants, when brought in, deny the plaintiff\u2019s title, and set forth the patents under which they claim an exclusive? title to the premises. The issue awarded here was upon the title of the plaintiff, but the defendants\u2019 title was brought into view, and to the notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>the court, by the pleadings; and on the trial of the issue, and on the argument in this court, the learned judge before whom the cause was tried, certified, that he gave it as his opinion , . , to the jury, that the patents under which the defendants claimed did not cover the islands in dispute. I do not wish to give any decided opinion on that point. When a cause resolves itself into a dry legal question, the proper <em>forum </em>for the determination of it is a court of law, and I only notice that title here incidentally, as it serves to guide me in the exercise of a suitable discretion as to costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">It is admitted that the last patent to <em>Huntington </em>does not touch the islands. If the defendants have a title, it is under their first patent, of 1666, and the terms of it are extremely vague as to the southern boundary, and the better opinion is, that it is limited, in breadth, to the \u201c nine several necks of meadow ground;\u20195 if that be so, the premises are excluded. These necks are undoubtedly to be taken in continuity. <em>Ad proximum antecedens fiat relatio. </em>It is a general principle, in the construction of written instruments, that a particular specification will exclude things not specified. But, whatever doubts might have existed under this patent, I consider them as removed by the last patent of 1694, which was granted on the petition of the inhabitants of <em>Huntington, </em>and was intended as a substitute for the preceding patents, \u201c so as that the limits and bounds of their town should not be as above mentioned, but as hereafter expressed.\u201d The clear definition and location of the southern boundaries of their town, by this last patent, certainly concludes the inhabitants of <em>Huntington </em>from resorting to the vague and indefinite description of the former patents, even if we suppose, in opposition to the usage under our government, that there are technical difficulties in the way of a legal surrender to government of an estate in fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">If, then, the plaintiff had probable cause for instituting his suit, and the defendants have been litigating against his claim, without any better claim or title on their part, I think it forms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>a very reasonable case for the denial of costs on either side. It is a case of mutual error.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Bill dismissed without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
