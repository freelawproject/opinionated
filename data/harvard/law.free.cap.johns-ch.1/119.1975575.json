In <em>July, </em>1806, the ship arrived at <em>New-York </em>with a valuable cargo of coffee and other goods. On the 3d <em>oiAugust, </em>1806, <em>Murgatroyd </em>died intestate, and the defendant, <em>Thomas Murgatroyd, </em>administered on his estate. <em>Ogden </em>having assigned parts of the cargo to other creditors, it was agreed among all the parties concerned, and by <em>Thomas Murgatroyd, </em>the administrator of <em>Murgatroyd, </em>deceased, to submit the rights of the respective claimants to arbitration. On the hearing before the arbitrators, <em>Thomas Murgatroyd, </em>the administrator, claimed to be entitled to the benefit of the security, intended by the assignments from <em>Ogden, </em>to the amount of the notes which he was holden to pay by reason of the endorsements of the intestate. On the 2d of <em>October, </em>1806, the arbitrators made an award, directing the distribution of the cargo among all the claimants, who acquiesced in the award, and received their proportions. The sum received by <em>Thomas Murgatroyd, </em>the administrator, amount<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>ed, besides charges, to 19,000 dollars. While the arbitration was pending, the plaintiffs made repeated applications to <em>Thomas Murgatroyd, </em>for payment of the notes, and were always referred by him to the issue of the arbitration, the notes should be paid; and, after the award, he promised to pay the notes out of his proportion of the cargo, as soon as it was sold. One of the notes, to <em>Moses \u00bfy Son, </em>was paid by the administrator, and one of the notes, to Kauman, was paid by the intestate, in his lifetime, but the other notes remain unpaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-8\">After the award, the administrator sold part of the cargo, but refused to pay the plaintiffs, alleging, that the intestate had incured other responsibilities for <em>Ogden </em>which ought first to be secured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-9\">The widow of <em>S.

The administrator had applied, in <em>April, </em>to the surrogate, on theground of a deficiency ofpersonal assets, and obtain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>ed an order, on the 12th of <em>June, </em>1807, for the sale of the real estate of the intestate, and the proceeds to be brought into the hands of the surrogate, to be distributed according to law ; ^ but the surrogate suspended the proceeding on the order, and consented to the order of sale by the master, with a view to secure the surplus moneys arising from the mortgaged premises. The bill of the plaintiffs called for an account, &amp;c. and that the moneys arising from the sale of the cargo might be applied to the payment of the notes, and not to the payment of the intestate\u2019s debts generally ; and that the surplus proceeds of the mortgaged premises might be distributed equally, without a preference of the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-8\"><em>T. Murgatroyd, </em>in his answer, admitted that the notes were given and endorsed, and the protest and notice to the endorsee; that the first assignment, by <em>Ogden, </em>of the 20th of <em>December, </em>1805, was a quantity of coffee, particularly designated, but denied that it was made specifically to secure the endorsements, or notes, but was intended as a security against all the engagements by <em>S. M. </em>for <em>Ogden ; </em>that the second assignment, of the 12th of <em>February, </em>1806, did not relate to any specific liabilty, but was a general security, like the other, for all advances and responsibilities on account of <em>Ogden ; </em>that the only specific security given by <em>Ogden, </em>was of the <em>freight </em>of the ship, which was assigned on the 4th of <em>May, </em>1806, and when the ship arrived, <em>Ogden </em>himself received the freight, and became insolvent, so that none of it came to the hands of S. <em>M., </em>or of the administrator. He denied that the intestate ever admitted that the assignments were specifically to secure the endorsements, or that he promised to pay the notes out of the proceeds. He admitted that <em>Ogden </em>made other assignments of goods expected in the ship <em>Emperor, </em>to other creditors; that the arbitrators awarded as alleged by the plaintiffs ; that he exhibited the three assignments to the arbitrators, and claimed, under them, to be allowed for all the responsibilities and pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>ments of the intestate for <em>Ogden, </em>amounting to 31,276 dollars and 50 cents, including the endorsements, a note of 5,000 dollars, and a check of 5,000 dollars ; but he denied that he made any claim on account of the notes, more than for any other <em>item. </em>He admitted that all parties acquiesced in the award, and that he received under it, out of the assignment, 16,270 dollars and 55 cents ; but denied that he had promised to pay the notes out of the proceeds. He admitted the payment of one of the notes to <em>Moses, </em>which had been negotiated to J. <em>R. Livingston, </em>but said that it was paid in expectation of receiving the <em>freight, </em>and not under the idea that the notes had any preference on the cargo. That he had refused to pay the notes out of the money he had received, because he had other demands against <em>Ogden, </em>to wit, a note dated the 14th of <em>January, 1806, </em>for 5,000 dollars, for advances made to him by the intestate, and a check of <em>Ogden, </em>dated the 10th of <em>April, </em>1806, for 5,000 dollars, which was unpaid; to satisfy which demands, he insisted he had a right first to apply the proceeds, and also to reimburse himself the sum paid to <em>J. R. L. </em>for the note, and also the amount of the note to <em>Kauman </em>; that the intestate, as administrator, with the will annexed, of <em>Susannah Stevenson, </em>appropriated to his own use the sum of57,766 dollars and 13 cents, and for that balance the defendant confessed the judgment to <em>Susan Storm, </em>&amp;c. the devisee under the will of Mrs. <em>Stevenson, </em>which was entered up the 22d of <em>December, </em>1806; which judgment was <em>bona fide, </em>and had been pleaded by him, as stated in the bill; and he denied that it was fraudulent, or done under the indemnification of any person whatever; and he insisted that he was bound by law, to consider all the proceeds in his hands as <em>assets, </em>to be applied, in the course of administration, according to the general rules of law; and that he was, therefore, bound to apply all the property of the intestate, in his hands, in satisfaction of that judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-3\">The defendant admitted, that the amount of the property in the hands of C. <em>Wilkes </em>was 11.150 dollars and 50 cents. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>the- whole of which he claimed as <em>assets. </em>The defendant admitted the existence of the mortgage stated in the bill, and the suit and sale, but said that the sale had been since vacated, but for what reason he did not know.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-8\"><em>Garret Storm, </em>and <em>Susan, </em>his wife, (formerly <em>Susan Murgatroyd, </em>widow of the intestate,) <em>Charles Wilkes, </em>and <em>William Lazorence, </em>put in their joint and several answers, in which the principal facts, as stated in the answer of <em>T.

M. </em>afterwards expressed fears as to the sufficiency of the security, the witness, in <em>May </em>following, assigned to him the freight; that the assignment made by him, on-the 16th of <em>December, </em>1805, had no reference to the notes, but was intended as a general security j that the note of 5,000 dollars, and the check for the like sum, were not included in the security provided by the assignments of the 12th of <em>February, </em>and of <em>May, </em>1806, but were intended to be secured by the one in <em>December </em>preceding; that \u201c he always considered that <em>S.

(1 Equity Cas. Ab. 93. K. pl. 5. Bac. </em>Ab. <em>Obligation, </em>(B.) 168. <em>Kip </em>v. <em>Bank of New-York, </em>10 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>63.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-11\">Where a deed is, on the face of it, contrary to the <em>intent </em>of the parties, it is, <em>prima facie, </em>fraudulent, and parol evidence is, therefore, admissible to show the intent; and it was admitted, on all hands, that the assignment, though general, was intended as a specific security.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b137-12\">In <em>Neilson </em>v. <em>Blight, </em>(1 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>205.,) it was decided that where a trust was created for the benefit of a person, though without his knowledge at the time, he might affirm the trust, and enforce its execution. There could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>no doubt as to the equity of the case; and it was equally clear, that the surplus moneys in the hands of the administrator, arising out of the sale of the real estate, were <em>equitable assets. </em>An executor, though entitled to the surplus of the personal estate, cannot take the proceeds of the real estate. An equity of redemption is equitable assets ; and on the principle that equality is equity, a court of equity will always endeavour to make equitable assets, by disregarding all preferences among the creditors. (3 <em>Bac. Ab. 58. </em>1 <em>Salk. </em>79. s. 1.) This court, then, ought to lay hold of the fund, and distribute it rateably among all the creditors.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b138-9\"><em>Wells </em>and <em>Colden, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJb\">contended, that the plaintiffs had no equity, in preference to the infant children of the intestate. The principal object of the plaintiffs, in coming into this court, was to set aside the judgment, on the allegation of fraud; but that allegation had been fully disproved, and the judgment shown to be <em>bonafide.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b138-10\">The plaintiffs seek to alter the legal distribution of the <em>assets </em>in the hands of the administrator, and, on some pretext of equity, to gain a preference over the judgment creditor, and against the infant children of the intestate. The administrator had a right to confess the judgment, and thereby give a preference; but the plaintiffs insist that there are certain liens and trusts which ought to change the legal destination of the property. The credit was given to the personal responsibility of the intestate, as endorser, and to <em>Samuel G. Ogden, </em>as maker of the notes. The plaintiffs did not look further, and further they ought not to be allowed to go. The intestate was to be indemnified, for lending his name and money to <em>Ogden, </em>by the assignments. Third persons, not privies to an assignment made for the benefit of <em>S. M., </em>and now claimed for his children, ought not to take that benefit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>The note and check, which are to be refunded, will nearly absorb all the money the administrator has received; and this court can distribute only the surplus that may remain, after deducting what had been advanced by the intestate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-4\">The assignments of the 20th of <em>December, </em>and 12th of <em>February, </em>are both general; but that of the 14th of <em>May </em>is a specific security. The answer expressly denies that the assignment of the 12th of <em>February </em>was specific. Can <em>parol </em>evidence be admitted to contradict, or alter the operation of that assignment ? Parol trusts are void by the statute; and to permit parol evidence, in this case, would be against the policy of the statute, and of dangerous consequence. The answer denies all the allegations on which the plaintiffs rest their claim to the interposition of this court. The evidence, in a great degree, confirms the answer, that the assignments of <em>December </em>and <em>February </em>were <em>general, </em>and intended to cover all the responsibilities of the intestate for <em>Ogden. </em>The assignment of the freight, in <em>May, </em>being intended to be <em>specific, </em>was so expressed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-5\">Where a general assignment is given by way of security, and without any specific destination, it may be applied by the assignee to any debt or demand due to him, at his elec-, tion or discretion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b139-6\">Again, there is no colour of equity for considering the surplus money in this court, on the sale of the mortgaged premises, as equitable assets. This court will not consider itself as ancillary to the surrogate; and because, by chance, the money has come into this court, decree according to the rules of the surrogate\u2019s court. The proceedings before him were abandoned, and the surplus ought then to be distributed according to the rules of law.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b139-11\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"AXTr\">The plaintiffs found their claim to the proceeds of the cargo, assigned by <em>Ogden </em>to <em>S. Murgatroyd, on </em>the 12th of <em>February, </em>1806, as being property held by the intestate, in trust, for the payment of their notes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>. \u201e trator, for the ire If this he or&gt;ce conceded or ascertained, as a matter of fact# the conclusion follows, of course, that the proceeds were not assets in the hands of <em>Thomas </em>Murgatroyd, the adminisneral creditors of his intestate, but they existed in his hands subject to the trust. The cases of <em>Deering </em>v. <em>Torrington, </em>(1 <em>Salk. </em>79. pl. 1.,) and of <em>Kip </em>v. <em>The Bank of New-York, </em>(10 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>63.,) show that property held in trust does not pass to the representatives of the trustee discharged of the trust, but, if it can be traced and distinguished, it shall enure to the benefit of the <em>cestuy que trust.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">The assignment to <em>Samuel Murgatroyd </em>was absolute on the face of it; but it is admitted by the answer of the ad- \u25a0 ministrator, and supported by all the proof in the cause, that the assignment was made, and taken by him, as a security or indemnity merely; this fact being admitted, the party interested has a right to go into parol proof to explain the^extent and object of the security. The admission of parol proof, to show the intent, becomes indispensable. The * defendant, (the administrator,) in his answer, admits the assignment to be different from what it purports to be. It does not, therefore, truly express the intent of the parties; and parol evidence is, then, clearly admissible to show that intent. The deed was false on the face of it, by the admission in the answer, but that admission does not go to impeach the general fairness of the transaction ; ythe difference between the deed as expressed, and the deed as intended, may have arisen from mistake, or ignorance, or accident; and it becomes necessary, in order to attain justice, that the court should let in parol proof to discover, and carry into effect the reai intention of the. parties in creating the security.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">I have no doubt, then, of the competency of the parol proof in this case ; and the weight of that proof goes to establish the fact for which the plaintiffs contend, that the assignment was made to indemnify <em>S. Murgatroyd </em>against the endorsement of the notes in question. This appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>from the evidence of <em>Ogden, </em>who made the assignment, and who testifies that he made it for that specific purpose, and for no other, and that he always considered that S. <em>Murga</em>7 . mi \u2022 i <em>troyd, </em>the assignee, so understood it. This appears, also, from the testimony of <em>J. G. Bogart, </em>and of <em>D. A. Ogden, </em>who state, that they understood the same from the administrator, <em>Thomas Murgatroyd ; </em>and it further appears, from the evidence of <em>Wilkes, </em>that when he demanded payment of the notes of th\u00a1e intestate, he admitted, in respect to the ship, an assignment to him, by <em>Ogden, </em>as security for his endorsements. We have,, then, a very full and explicit admission of the fact from^all the parties concerned ;\u25a0 from <em>Ogden, </em>who made the assignment; from <em>Samuel Murgatroyd, </em>the assignee; and from <em>Thomas Murgatroyd, </em>his administrator, and one of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">I shall then consider this fact as well made out, viz. that the assignment of the 1.2th of <em>February, </em>1806, though absolute on the face of it, was intended, by the parties <em>to it, to be </em>a security only to the intestate for his endorsement of the notes in question. This being the case, the plaintiffs, as holders of the notes, are entitled to the benefit of this collateral security, given by their principal debtor to his surety ; and the case of <em>Maure </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>(1 <em>Eq. Ab. </em>93. <em>K. </em>5. <em>Mich. </em>1692.,) is directly to this point. These collateral securities are, in fact, trusts created for the better protection of the debt; and it is the duty of this court to see that they fulfil the design. And whetherthe plaintiffs were apprized, at the time, of the creation of this security, is not material. The trust was created for their benefit, or for the better security of their debt, and when it came to their knowledge, they were entitled to affirm the trust, and to enforce its performance. This was the principle assumed in the case of <em>Neilson </em>v. <em>Blight, </em>(1 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>205.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">The plaintiffs are, accordingly, entitled to the exclusive appropriation of the 11,150 dollars and 50 cents,.in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>hands of <em>Charles Wilkes, </em>with the interest thereon, towards the payment of their notes.</p>\n<p id=\"AKe\">The next question is, whether the surplus moneys now in this court, and arising on the sale of the lands mortgaged to Lawrence, shall go to the administrator for distribution, where they will be absorbed by the judgment confessed, or whether they shall be distributed under the direction of this court, <em>pro rata, </em>among all the creditors, as equitable assets. The administrator is not, as such, entitled to this surplus ; it is part of the <em>real </em>estate, and goes to the heirs, and would be assets in their hands. The heirs appear to be infants, and their mother^ <em>Susan Storm, </em>is before the court in the character of a creditor, in-behalf of her children, and holding a judgment confessed by the administrator. I am inclined to consider the moneys in question as equitable assets. It was held, in <em>Plunket </em>v. <em>Penson, </em>(2 <em>Atk. </em>290.,) that the equity of redemption of a mortgage, in fee, forfeited in the lifetime of the mortgagor, was equitable and not legal assets ; and the same doctrine was held by the Master of the Rolls, in the case of <em>Sir Charles Cox\u2019s creditors, </em>(3 <em>P. Wms. </em>341.) But as the creditor has a remedy at law, with us, against an equity of redemption, it might be doubted whether it could be deemed equitable assets while unsold; but after it is converted into money, under the decree of this court, I think the money is to be treated as equitable assets; for the creditor must come here for relief, as the money is placed under the jurisdiction of the court. In <em>Freenoult </em>v. <em>Dedire, </em>(1 <em>P Wms. 429.,) it </em>was said, that where the estate descends to the heir, it is legal assets, but if the heir sell the land before suit, it then becomes equitable assets. The general doctrine is to encourage, as much as possible, the idea of equitable assets, because equality in the payment of debts is equity, and the rule of distribution, in chancery, is founded On principles of natural justice. Assets may be partly legal and partly equitable, dnd the court will, in such case, discriminate, and direct that such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>arc legal, be applied in a course of administration, and such as are equitable, be applied <em>pari passu. </em>This was done in <em>North v. Cox, </em>(3 <em>P. Wms. </em>344 n. 3.) In the distribution of legal assets, this court follows the rule of law, to prevent confusion in the administration of the estate; but whenever the assets are considered as equitable, then it is well and uniformly settled, that they are to b\u00e9 distributed among all the creditors, <em>pro rata, </em>without giving preference. <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Bank of England, </em>(2 <em>Cas. </em>temp. <em>T. </em>218.)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">I conclude, then, that the surplus moneys now in court are to be treated and distributed as equitable assets ; and as no objection was made to the want of proper parties before the court, the decree must be entered accordingly;</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">1. That the plaintiffs are entitled to the 11,150 dollars and 50 cents, in the hands of Mr. <em>Wilkes </em>; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">2. That the surplus moneys, arising upon the sale of the mortgaged premises, ought to be distributed as equitable assets, rateably among all the creditors.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
