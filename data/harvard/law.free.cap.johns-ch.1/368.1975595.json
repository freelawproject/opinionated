The cases of <em>Griells </em>v. Gansell, and of <em>Darling </em>v. <em>Staniford, </em>(2 <em>P. </em>Wms. 646. <em>Dickens, </em>358.,) show, that re-examinations have been allowed in such cases ; and, in the latter case, the court took the re-examination from the examiner into their own hands. Let the witness be re-examined before one of the examiners of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">Rule accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
