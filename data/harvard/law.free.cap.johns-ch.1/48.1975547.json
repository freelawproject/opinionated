Even in cases of decrees for costs only, there are exceptions to the general rule ; and it is so admitted in one of the cases referred to. The facts alleged- in the petition for a rehearing, in this case, are such as to render it proper and expedient that the case should he reconsidered.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
