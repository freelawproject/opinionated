That the referees, although the question could not fairly arise until the death of <em>Ralph Thurman, </em>the defendant, without male issue, who should attain the age of twenty-one years, have decided that he took an absolute estate, in fee, in the premises ; and that, if that question could arise, it was decided, by the referees, incorrectly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-5\">The 2d, 3d, and 4th exceptions were, that the referees make no award respecting sundry debts due to the testator, and divers bank shares and cattle which belonged to the testator, and are enumerated in the schedule annexed to the answer of the defendant to the original bill, and which matters, it was contended, were submitted to the referees for their determination, under the order of reference.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-6\">The last exception was, that the referees had made no award as to the disposal \u00a9f any personal property of the testator, not enumerated in the schedules annexed to the answer, which might, after filing the answer, come to the knowledge of the executor; whereas they ought to have awarded and directed that the same should be duly collected, and from time to time accounted for, by the executor, according to the will of the testator.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b235-11\"><em>Harison </em>and Robinson, in suport of the exceptions.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b235-12\"><em>Riggs, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b235-13\">For the <em>plaintiffs, </em>it was. contended, that the intention of the testator was to govern in the construction of the will, and that, to discover that intention, the whole will must be taken together. (2 <em>Bl. Com. </em>381. n. 13. 1 <em>Vesey, </em>169. 1 <em>Vesey, </em>jun. 268. 270. 2 Vesey,jun. 105.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>That if the will had stopped at the words \u201c if he die before he come of age, and without male issue,\u201d it must be admitted that <em>Ralph </em>would take an estate tail under the <em>* </em>. law, or an estate in fee under our statute; but this was restricted by the subsequent clause, limiting the estate on condition that <em>his first son comes of age'. </em>This clause manifestly showed, that the testator intended that the estate should go over to his nephew, <em>Nicholas Roosevelt, </em>unless <em>Ralph </em>had a son who arrived at full age. <em>(Cro. Eliz. 525. Talbot's Cas. </em>44. 1 <em>Bro. </em>147.) This restriction is not to be rejected as repugnant to the will, for it is perfectly consistent with it; and it was intended for the-benefit of <em>Roosevelt. </em>To support this intention of the testator, the word \u201c and\u201d\u2022 is to be read <em>or. (Talbot's Cas. </em>44. 3 <em>Atk. </em>283. 4 Vesey, 311. 227. 3 Vesey, 103 8. Viner, 181. pl. 7. 182, pl. 11, 12, 15, 16. 186, pl. 51. 1 P. <em>Wms. </em>54. n. 1.) If the word \u201cand\u201d is not construed disjunctively, the intention of the testator, that the first taker should arrive at the age of 21 years, without regard to his issue, and the provisions of the will, would be defeated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-9\">For the defendant, it was insisted, that, as the question now raised was put at issue by the pleadings, and was left to the decision of the referees, by the order of reference entered by the consent of the parties, it was now too late to object that the decision of the question was premature, after it bad been argued and discussed before the referees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-10\">That all the other exceptions are not founded on any thing now before the court, and no objections on those points were made before the referees; and it was, therefore, too late and irregular to raise them here. The defendant, however, was willing that all assets that should come into the defendant\u2019s hands, subsequently to his answer, should be duly accounted for in the course of administration ; and the counsel for the plaintiffs expressed themselves satisfied that a saving to that effect should be inserted in the decree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>As to the construction of th\u00e9 will, it is said, that <em>Ralph </em>was to have an estate in fee, if he attained the age of 21 years, or had male issue ; and that, if he had such issue, he could not sell until his son was of age. A legacy of 1,000 pounds is devised to him, and is not that to be disposed of until after his death ? It is admitted that he had a <em>life </em>estate ? Is he, then, to lose the . legacy, and get only a life estate ? <em>Roosevelt </em>is to have half of that legacy, and yet claims the fee after his death. Such was not the intention of the testator. He meant, undoubtedly, that the whole of his estate should be settled when the devisees came of age. The word \u201c and\u201d is not to be read or, to carry the estate over; the words create an estate in fee, or an estate in tail, in <em>Ralph. </em>An estate tail arises by implication, where the devise over is to the blood of the devisor, not where it is to a stranger. <em>(Talbot's Cases, </em>1. 2 <em>Vern. </em>324. 766. 8 <em>Vin. Devise. </em>1 <em>P. </em>Wms. 605. <em>Resol. 4. 1 Atk. </em>432. 2 Vesey, 243. 247, 248. <em>Ambl. </em>355. 358. 385. 4 <em>Term Rep. </em>82. 5 <em>Term Rep. </em>335.) The court will carry a general intent into effect, though it may defeat a particular intent. (<em>Whitebread v. St. John, </em>10 <em>Ves. </em>152\u2014154.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-6\">The restriction in the latter clause, is repugnant to the estate, before given in the former parts of the will, and a restraint upon'alienation, and ought to be rejected as void.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b237-11\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"A30\">The last exception taken to the report was disposed of by arrangement between the counsel. It was agreed, on the part of the defendant, <em>Thurman, </em>that the decree should contain a provision, that the assets which might subsequently come to the hands of the defendant, as executor, should be duly accounted for in the course of ad* ministration, and this was all the security required on the part of the plaintiffs. As to the 2d, 3d, and 4th exceptions, they relate to some small matters of account said to have been omitted by the referees; and there is nothing before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>the court to enable me to judge of the truth and force of these exceptions. The objection to any such alleged omissions, ought to have been made to the referees on the making up of their report There remains for consideration the first, and which was the only material exception taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">This exception is, that the referees have determined that the defendant, <em>Thurman, </em>is entitled to an estate in fee in the two houses and lots mentioned in the report, whereas, they were not called on to decide this point, and, if they were, they ought to have decided it differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\"><em>It </em>was suggested upon the argument, and, I think, not denied, that this point of law was raised, and discussed on both sides, before the referees. If this be so, it is now too late for the plaintiff to object to the jurisdiction of the referees over the question ; and it appears to have been a point put in issue by the pleadings, and proper for the consideration\" of the referees under the submission. By the original bill, the defendant, <em>Thurman, </em>was called on, as executor, to account, among other things, for the rents and profits of the real estate whereof his testator died seised ; and, by the answer, he sets up an absolute title in himself in fee, under the will, to the two lots which are the subject of discussion, and denies that he is accountable for the rents and profits of them. The reference was made, by consent, to one merchant and two gentlemen of the bar, with directions to state an account, and to decide on all questions in dispute between the parties, \u201c as well matters of law as of fact.\u201d I have no doubt, therefore, that the question of law, on the title of <em>Thurman </em>to the two houses and lots in <em>New-York, </em>was in issue, and properly embraced by the submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">After the parties have chosen to submit a point of law to gentleman of the profession, it may be doubted whether the court ought to permit the discussion to be renewed here, without showing a case of gross and palpable mistake. In this case, however, a reservation appears in the rule of submission, by which the report was declared to be liable te <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>exceptions by either party, as a master\u2019s report would be. This reservation may have been intended to be confined to that part of the submission which was the ordinary subject of reference to a master, and this is, perhaps, the better construction of the rule. But I do not wish to construe the rule rigorously, in this case, nor to deprive the parties of a resort to the opinion of the court on the question of law arising upon the will; and I shall only observe, that <em>after such, a reference as the one before us, </em>the objection should be supported upon pretty clear and solid grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\">As <em>Richardson, </em>the first devisee, and <em>John, </em>a devisee named subsequent to the defendant, died in the lifetime of the testator, their names may be considered as struck out of the will. The devise then is of the two houses and lots, 6i <em>with every right </em>agreeable to the deeds of the same, to be delivered to the defendant as soon as he comes to the age of 21 years; and if he dies <em>before he comes to age, and without male issue,\u201d </em>than the <em>devise </em>over was to bis nephew, the plaintiff, <em>Roosevelt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">If the will had stopped here, it. seems to be conceded that the defendant would have taken an estate in fee, or an estate tail, under the <em>English </em>law, which by our statutes is now turned into an estate in fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The construction is plausible, that by the devise of the lots, \u201c with every right\u201d belonging thereto, under the deeds, the whole interest of the testator therein passed. He gives the houses with the ground, and every other building, and <em>every right, </em>agreeable to the deeds. The words are not free from ambiguity; if he meant by them only a description of his estate, and not of his entire interest therein, yet the limitation of \u201c dying without male issue\u201d made it an estate tail. This construction of those words appears to be well settled. <em>(Whiting v. Wilkins, </em>1 Bulst. 219. 8 <em>Viner, 211. </em>pl. 11. 4th <em>Resolution, </em>in 1 <em>P. Wms. </em>605. 2 <em>Bro. </em>558. 578. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Applin, </em>4 <em>Term Rep. </em>82. <em>Denn v. Slater, 5 Term Rep. </em>335. <em>Stanley v. Leonard, Amb. </em>355.) The fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>vested on his attaining the age of 21, or having male issue* Either event was sufficient; for the word <em>and, </em>in the devise, is not here to be read <em>or, </em>but is to be taken in its natural and grammatical sense. The case of <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Jessep, </em>(12 <em>East, </em>288.) is to this very point; and it was there held, that the words in a will are to be construed according to their natural sense, unless some obvious inconvenience, or incongruity, would result from so construing them. Why should we, as Lord <em>Ellenborougk </em>observed, read or for <em>and, </em>and give the estate over, upon the happening of one only of the events, when no inconvenience would ensue by construing the word in its natural sense. In the case referred to, the devise was to a natural son; \u201c and if he die before 21, and without issue,\u201d then to the testator\u2019s father and the mother of the son; and, on a different construction, if the son had happened to die before 21, leaving issue, that issue could not have taken. So here, if <em>Thurman </em>had died under age, and had left issue, the reading the word <em>and </em>as or, would have disinherited that issue as to the devise, and this could hardly have been the testator\u2019s meaning. To prevent siifch a result, the courts have frequently reversed the rule by turning <em>or </em>into <em>and. </em>(2 <em>Ves. </em>249.)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">But the principal difficulty has arisen from the subsequent part of the will, in which it is declared that \u201c the first possessor, as soon as his first male child should come of age, it is my will that the right of the said houses be to him, his\" heirs and assigns, but not to be disposed of by him before his eldest son comes of age.\u201d It is contended, on the part of the plaintiffs, that here is an executory devise engrafted on the preceding fee; and, on the part of the defendant, that it is only a temporary restriction intended by the testator upon the power of alienation, and that the restriction is so far void as-being repugnant to the nature of the estate.1 It appears to me, on an examination of the will, that the' latter is the sounder construction. \u25a0 The limitation over, to <em>Roosevelt, </em>is upon the event of the defendant\u2019s dying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>under age, and without male issue. There is no provision for the remainder over, on the event of the first male child dying under age, and the omission shows that the testator could not have had in contemplation the case of a limitation over, except upon the event of the nephew himself dying under age and without such issue. The will also directs, that \u201c whoever gets ti e houses\u201d shall have no claim to the 1,000/. legacy, but his share shall go to the other relations; and, as the defendant takes the houses upon either construction, he loses his legacy. It is not probable, when we recur to the known value of such a pecuniary legacy, at so early a period as the date of the will, that the testator intended that any estate in those two houses, short of a fee, should be a substitute for it. If we compare the several provisions in the will, it seems to have been the testator\u2019s general design, that all the legacies and grants should vest at the age of 21. Thus, the pecuniary legacies of 1,000/. are to be paid as the legatees respectively come of age, and these very lots are \"to be given to the devisee (and three were named in succession) when he comes of age. So the limitation over is to vest whenthe plaintiffis of age ; and all the residue of the estate, real and personal, is to b\u00e9 divided, and paid to the residuary legatees at the same per od. The existence of an executory devise, in this case, is not, then, in furtherance of the uniformly-declared intentions and policy of the will. The idea of an executory devise is, where the testator gives absolutely to one, and, upon the happening of an event gives the same estate to another. But here is no designation of the person who is to take, by way of executory devise, if the defendant should die without any male child being of age. It is not the plaintiff, <em>Roosevelt, </em>for the event had long before happened, and must have happened, upon which the limitation to him was determined; and he has, in consideration thereof, his share (being here a moiety) of the legacy, which the defendant lost on taking the estate. In short, the general scope or design of the will was to fix and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>close all the interests, as soon as the objects of the testator\u2019s bounty came \u00b0f age ; and this last strange and perplexed provision was not intended in favour of Roosevelt, (for it has no allusion to him,) hut it seems to have been meant as a check to an improvident waste, or alienation of the estate, by the defendant, during the early part of his life ; and being an intention inconsistent with the rules of law, it must be rejected,</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">I am, accordingly, of opinion, that the exceptions be overruled, and with costs, as to all, except the last; and that the report be confirmed, with a provision in the decree as to future assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Decree accordingly, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b242-8\"><em> </em>Vide <em>Campbell </em>v.
