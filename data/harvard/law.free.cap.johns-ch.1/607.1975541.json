That the guardian had received property, and for which he must account, and that it ought to be referred to a master to take an account, and to report whether he be a fit and proper person to continue guardian.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-14\">2. That the surety was holden, though the bond taken by the surrogate was incorrectly taken, and not according to the form prescribed by the act, (sess. 25. ch. 110.,) as it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>taken in the name of the people, and not to the infant. That this court will correct such a mistake, and enforce the bond according to the agreement and intention ofthe parties. He cited 1 <em>Ves. </em>456. 3 <em>Atk. </em>388. 1 <em>Bro. </em>269. 1 <em>P. Wms. </em>60. 277. 334. 2 <em>Chan. Cas. </em>225. <em>Prec. in Chan. </em>309.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b621-9\"><em>H. Bleecker, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AE_\">said, that the surety was not holden, as the statute had prescribed the form of the bond. If he was, the guardian ought first to be found in default, and unable to account and satisfy, but here was no evidence of any devastavit, or default in the guardian.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b621-10\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"ADL\">There must be a reference to the master, to take an account of the property which it is admitted, or proved, has come to the possession of the guardian; and, under the allegations contained in the case, it will be proper for the master to inquire, also, into the fitness and competency of the guardian to continue in his trust. Perhaps it will be premature to take an account of the assets in the hands of the executors of the surety, until the default ofthe principal, and his inability to pay, are first ascertained. But as to the main point in the case, whether the surety is to be holden, though the bond was taken in the name of the people instead of the name of the infant,T have no difficulty in saying, that it is within the ordinary jurisdiction of this court to correct such a mistake, by holding the party according to his original intention, and to consider the bond as taken to the infant. Where the intention is manifest, this court will always relieve against mistakes in agreements. (2 <em>Atk. </em>203. 1 <em>Ves. 317.) </em>The case cited from Prec. ire <em>Chancery </em>shows, that the court will do it in the case of a surety. Here it is admitted in the answer, and the bond itself is conclusive proof that <em>Vail </em>intended to bind himself as security for <em>Blachly, </em>the guardian; and, whether the bond was taken in the name of the infant, or in the name of <em>the </em>people, in trust for the infant, it is but matter of form and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>not of substance ; it would be intolerable that such a mistake should prejudice or destroy the rights of the infant.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">I shall, accordingly, decree, that the bond, executed by the surety, is to be valid as a security to the like extent as if it had been taken by the surrogate according to-the act; that the guardian shall account with the plaintiff for the moneys, -estate, and effects of the plaintiff, which have come to his hands as guardian; that it be referred to a master to take the account, and also to inquire and ascertain whether B., the guardian, be able to pay what maybe found due, and whether he has taken due care of the plaintiff and her estate ; and whether he be a suitable person to continue guardian ; and that the question of costs, and all other questions,, be, in the mean time, reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">Decree accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
