The bill charged, that the defendant had received the money on the bill of exchange, and the proceeds of the goods so placed in his hands, but refused to account for the same. The plaintiff prayed a discovery of the amount in the hands of the defendant, and that he should account therefor, or for so much as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>was sufficient to pay the principal and interest due to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-4\">The bill was filed, as well in behalf of the plaintiff, as such other of the creditors of <em>Creighton </em>and <em>Plaine </em>as should come in and contribute to the expense of the suit. <em>Thompson, </em>in his answer, admitted, that he received of <em>Creighton </em>an assignment of the proceeds of certain goods, shipped by <em>Creighton </em>and <em>Plaine </em>to <em>Savannah </em>; and that, after much difficulty, he received the proceeds, and also a bill for 100 pounds sterling; that, at the time he received the assignment, he gave a receipt to Creighton, promising to distribute the fund between the other creditors of <em>Creighton </em>and <em>Plaine, </em>named in the receipt, and himself, but that he had no recollection or knowledge of the names of the said creditors, nor of the amount of their several debts, not having retained a copy of the receipt, nor supposing that <em>Creighton </em>was about to leave the city of <em>New-York, </em>where all the parties resided; that, in fact, <em>Creighton </em>soon after went to <em>Nevi-Orleans, </em>where he had since resided, and the defendant had written to him several times, requesting of him a copy of the receipt, or directions howto distribute the fund, but had never heard from him ; and the defendant professed a readiness to distribute the fund, whenever he was informed of the names of the creditors, and of the amount of their respective debts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-5\">The assignment of the goods to the defendant, by <em>Creighton, </em>was proved by a witness who was a clerk to the defendant at the time, and who entered the goods in the books of the defendant, to the credit of the estate of <em>Creighton </em>and <em>Plaine : </em>and there being a deficiency of about 400 dollars, of the full amount due to their creditors, <em>Creighton </em>drew a bill of exchange on <em>Edinburgh, </em>in favour of the defendant, for 100 pounds sterling, dated the 10th of <em>July, </em>1799, at sixty days sight, which had been duly honoured and paid, and was passed, also, in the books of the defendant, to the credit of the same fund; that in <em>December, </em>1801, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>after the witness had left the service of the defendant, he was requested, by him, to assist in making out a distribution of the fund among the creditors of <em>Creighton </em>and <em>Plame^ </em>as wag ^en ready to be distributed, but the witness, being then about to leave the city, did not attend to the defendant\u2019s request.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-5\">The master\u2019s report stated, that the amount of the trust property in the hands of the defendant, in <em>July, </em>1799, was 1,632 dollars and 71 cents, and that the debt due from <em>Creighton </em>and <em>Plains </em>to the plaintiff was, on the 11th <em>March, </em>1799, 213 dollars and 84 cents.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b96-6\"><em>Boyd, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAp\">contended, that being an innocent trustee, the defendant was not chargeable with <em>interest </em>or <em>costs, </em>but merely for the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s debt. He cited 1 <em>Vern. </em>110. 1 <em>Ves. </em>jun. 452. <em>Prec. in Chan. </em>254.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b96-8\"><em>Harison </em>and <em>Wilkins, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Acq\">insisted, that the defendant Ijad been guilty of gross negligence; having received the property,- in <em>1799, </em>and had been in cash for the amount since 1801, without having made any distribution of the fund ; and that he ought, therefore, to pay <em>interest </em>and costs. They cited 1 <em>Vern. </em>196. 2 Vern. 548. 1 <em>Bro. Ch. Cas. </em>362. 375. 384, 385. 10 <em>Mod. </em>21.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b96-11\">The Chancellor.</author>\n<p id=\"A8x\">The \"defendant received the trust fund as early as <em>July, </em>1799, and a list of the creditors, of whom the plaintiff was one, and he promised to distribute the fund among the creditors, according to a list of them, named in a receipt which he gave to <em>Creighton. </em>He has not done it, and the plaintiff filed his bill in <em>April, </em>1803. The defendant renders no sufficient excuse for not distributing this fund. He appears to have been guilty of negligence, and he does not show what he did with the fund in the mean time. The presumption is, that he appropriated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>it to his own use. He is justly chargeable with <em>interest, </em>on the fund, from the time it was converted into cash, and with the <em>costs </em>of suit. This is the rule of the court in the case of a negligent trustee, and the cases which were cited by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, particularly the one of <em>Treves </em>v. <em>Townshend, </em>in 1 <em>Bro. </em>384, 385., are to this point. Let tiie decree he so entered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
