The examiner, also, certified that the witness was very deaf. The cause was set down for hearing: and the motion now was, that the witness, who was in court, and appeared to he aged, should be examined <em>ore terms </em>by the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b538-10\"><em>Riggs, </em>in support of the motion,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjT\">cited 2 P. <em>Wms. </em>646.

The mistake suggested might easily happen from the age and great deafness of the witness. If the mistake exists, the deposition ought to be corrected, otherwise the witness would appear to contradict himself; and the cases cited appear to support this course of proceeding. '</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">The motion must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">The witness was, thereupon, sworn in court, and examined, and his deposition amended.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
