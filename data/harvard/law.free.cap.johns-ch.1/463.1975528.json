The insurance was on 500 barrels of flour from <em>Newport </em>to St. <em>Jago de Cuba, </em>on board the <em>Spanish </em>brig <em>Patriota, </em>which was captured by a <em>Carthagena </em>privateer. On the 21st of December, 1814, the policy was assigned by <em>Titus </em>and <em>Gibbs </em>to the plaintiffs, in <em>trust, </em>for themselves and other creditors of <em>Titus </em>and <em>Gibbs. </em>The bill charged that the defendants refused to pay the loss, alleging, among other things, that the plaintiffs had no title to the property insured, which, in fact, belonged to one /., a <em>Spaniard, </em>and not to <em>Titus </em>and <em>Gibbs. </em>The bill prayed that the defendants might answer the matter charged in the bill, and be compelled to pay the plaintiffs the amount insured, as for a total loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-9\">To this bill the defendants demurred on the following grounds: That it appeared by the bill that the plaintiffs\u2019 demand, or cause of action, was properly cognizable in a court of law; as it is not alleged that <em>Titus </em>and <em>Gibbs </em>refused to let the plaintiffs make use of their names, in a suit at law; or that they are, in any way, hindered from prosecuting at law; or that they stood in need of any discovery to aid them in such action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b476-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number><em>S.

The plaintiffs are entitled to make use of the names of <em>Gibbs </em>and <em>Titus, </em>the original assured, in the, suit at law ; and the nominal plaintiffs would not be permitted to defeat or prejudice the right of action. It may be said here, as was said by the Chancellor, in the analogous caseof <em>Dhegetoft v. The London Assurance Company, (Mosely, </em>83.,) that, at this rate, all policies of insurance would be tried in this court. -In that case the policy stood in the name of a nominal trustee ; but that was not deemed sufficient to change the jurisdiction ; and the demurrer to the bill was allowed, and the decree was afterwards affirmed in parliament. (3 <em>Bro. P. C. </em>525.) The bill, in this case, states no special ground for equitable relief; nor is any discovery soughtwhich requires an answer\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">Bill dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
