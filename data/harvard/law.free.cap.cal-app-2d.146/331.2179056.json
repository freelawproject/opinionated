WOOD (Fred B.), J.</author>\n<p id=\"Am2\">After the denial of his application</p>\n<p id=\"Aab\">to the respondent board of medical examiners for a reciprocity physician and surgeon certificate without examination,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Levon A. Akopiantz petitioned the board for a hearing to determine that New York\u2019s medical licensing requirements were not less than those of California on July 1, 1949, the date his New York license was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\">Upon filing this petition, Akopiantz requested a hearing oh June 21, 1954, and waived the issuance of the statement of issues prescribed by section 11504 of the Government Code. Upon the hearing, which was held on the date requested, he stipulated that \u201ca hearing may be granted on the petition in lieu of a formal statement of issues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">We look, therefore, to the petition and there find, among others, certain significant issues .stated in the form of the following averments: (1) Akopiantz\u2019 resident professional instruction equaled or exceeded in duration and attendance and included total and proportionate hours of study of the subjects equivalent to those stated in section 2192 of the Business and Professions Code, and were equivalent in quality, standard and excellence to the minimum requirements specified in articles 4 and 5 (\u00a7\u00a7 2165-2195) of chapter 5 of division 2 of said code; (2) the California State Board of Medical Examiners has determined the equivalence of the requirements of the New York licensing authority, with respect to professional instruction in the schools of medicine which petitioner attended, for the purpose of issuing (and did issue) reciprocity certificates to Howard Golden and Leonard S. Lazaroff in 1945 and 1946, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">These allegations, it is apparent, were designed to meet,the requirements of section 2193 of the Business and Professions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Code as it read on the day<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (July 1, 1949) petitioner received his New York license: \u201cAn applicant, whose application is based on a diploma issued to him by a foreign medical school <em>approved </em>by the board, except a Canadian school, shall furnish documentary evidence, satisfactory to the board, that: (a) He has completed a resident course of professional instruction in an <em>approved </em>medical school or schools <em>equivalent </em>to that required in this article [\u00a7\u00a7 2190-2195] for a physician and surgeon applicant.\u2019\u2019 (Emphasis added.) These were basic California requirements for a foreign medical school graduate who applied for examination in this state on July 1, 1949. They were made applicable to Akopiantz\u2019 request for a reciprocity certificate (without examination) by the provisions of sections 2316, 2316.5, 2317 and 2320 of the Business and Professions Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">The respondent medical board found: (1) \u201cIt has'not been shown that said resident professional instruction described ... in Finding . . . III<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> hereof equaled or exceeded in duration and attendance and included total and proportionate hours of study of the subjects of instruction equivalent to those stated ... in Section 2192 of the Business and Professions Code and were in all respects equivalent in quality, standard, and excellence to the minimum requirements specified in Articles 4 and 5, Chapter 5 [\u00a7\u00a7 2165-2195], Division 2 of said Code.\u201d (Finding IV),- and (2) that \u201ccredit given at St. Mungo\u2019s College Medical School and the Anderson College of Medicine hereinabove referred to in Finding III, was for work completed in extramural medical schools, which are schools unapproved by the Board of Medical Examiners of the State of California. Extramural schools were expressly disapproved by the Board of Medical Examiners of the State of California as of the date of October 1, 1939.\u201d (Finding VII.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Thus, it happens that the board found against Akopiantz upon the two major issues. Either finding, unless unsupported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record, would support the denial of his request for a reciprocity certificate without examination. The board used only one of them. In its \u201cdetermination of the issues\u201d it said merely that the \u201capplication for a reciprocity certificate should be denied on the basis that he is a foreign graduate, trained in part in an unapproved school pursuant to the provisions of section 2193 of the Business and Professions Code ...\u201d Then followed the \u201corder,\u201d expressly denying the application for a reciprocity certificate without specifying the reason or reasons for the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\">The conclusion seems inescapable that the board denied the application solely upon the ground that the St. Mungo\u2019s and Anderson schools were \u201cunapproved,\u201d not upon the ground that the resident instruction received at the foreign medical schools was not the \u201cequivalent\u201d of that required by sections 2190-2195 of our code.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">However, both findings are. material to the inquiry in this proceeding. Even if the court were to determine that the foreign schools have been approved by the board, the board would have no authority to issue the requested reciprocity certificate if the court determines that the evidence supports the board\u2019s finding that the foreign instruction was not the \u201cequivalent\u201d of California requirements.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The trial court made two findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">(1) That the applicant \u201chas not established that he is qualified educationally for a reciprocity certificate, under section 2310 of the Business and Professions Code\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">(2) That the \u201cpetitioner has sufficient educational training and experience to qualify for an examination under\u201d section 2193. Upon the basis of finding Number 2, the court directed the board to give Akopiantz an examination under section 2193 of the code and, if he passes, to license him as a physician and surgeon in this state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">These findings seem inconsistent; irreconcilably so. One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>says the applicant has not shown he is \u201c qualified educationally\u201d for a reciprocity certificate; the other, that he has sufficient \u201ceducational training and experience to qualify\u201d for the examination. In either ease the educational requirement (resident instruction \u201cequivalent\u201d to California requirements) is identical, the only difference being that if Akopiantz were applying to take the examination he need not show that his foreign schools were \u201capproved\u201d by the board.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">Each of these findings should be read in the light of the only type and quality of education that was involved, a \u201cresident course of professional instruction\u201d at a \u201cmedical school,\u201d\u2014a course \u201cequivalent to that required\u201d by our statute \u201cfor a physician and surgeon applicant\u201d (\u00a72193). As thus read, one finding says that the applicant\u2019s foreign school instruction was equivalent; the other, that it was not. Both can not stand. Bach cancels the other out, leaving no support for the order appealed from or any part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The board, which has appealed from that part of the order which directs that an examination be given (Akopiantz has appealed from the whole of the order) would have us interpret finding Number 2 as determining that Akopiantz\u2019 training and experience in residence at certain hospitals in this country after graduation at Lausanne, when added to his foreign school instruction, measure up to the requirements of section 2193. We do not find a satisfactory basis for such an interpretation. Under any theory the possibility remains that the second finding deals with the same type of instruction as the first and thus leaves the findings in such a state of uncertainty as to furnish inadequate support for the order or any part of it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>If this case is again tried, the present difficulty can be avoided if the trial court will couch its findings in specific terms, e.g., by declaring as to each significant finding of the board (clearly identified by subject matter or paragraph number) that it is, or is not, supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\">We do not undertake to further define the issues upon a new trial but do state that, as concerns the review of the board\u2019s disapproval of the medical schools Akopiantz attended, this may be treated as a proceeding under section 2174 of the Business and Professions Code. (See <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Board of Medical </em>Examiners, 31 Cal.2d 30, 41-42 [187 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The order is reversed and the cause remanded for such further proceedings as may not be inconsistent with the views herein expressed, each party to bear his own costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Peters, P. J., and Bray, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-6\">He bases his claim upon the fact that on July 1, 1949, the State of New York\u2019 admitted him to practice upon successful completion of an examination. He received his medical degree at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, in June, 1941. Lausanne gave him credit for 2432 Hours of training elsewhere, including 1251 hours at two schools in Scotland) St. Mungo\u2019s College Medical School (October, 1936, to June 30, 1937) and the Anderson College of Medicine (October, 1937, to June, 193.8).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Our reciprocity statute applies if the applicant <em>\u201c </em>is authorized to practice in any other state if it is a system or mode that is recognized by this chapter [eh. 5 of div. 2 of the Business and Professions Code, \u00a75 2000-2497] . . .\u201d It declares that \u201c [s]ubjeet to the provisions of sections 2320 and 2321, no examination for any reciprocity certificate shall be\" required.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 2310.) Specific requirements are imposed by several sections of said chapter 5, particularly including sectipns.2316, 2316.5, 2317, 2192 and 2193 of the code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b351-5\">See section 2193 as amended by Stats. 1941, eh. 751, p. 2287.

These facts and the silence of the board\u2019s decision on this subject indicate that the board was unaware of the possibility that the petition might embrace a request for an examination.</p>\n<p id=\"AcE\">This would not prevent the court from referring back to the board the question of Akopiantz\u2019 eligibility to take the examination should it appear upon a new trial meet and proper to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"AGc\">The fact that the court's finding Number 2 was not, of course, remove that finding from the record nor resolve the conflict between it and finding Number 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
