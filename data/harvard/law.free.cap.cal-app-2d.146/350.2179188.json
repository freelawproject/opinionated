Appellant and respondent thereupon entered into a written contract of employment on a contingent fee basis. The contract is set forth in full in the footnote hereto.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Pursuant to the contract, appellant paid respondent $500, but failed to pay anything further. The respondent instituted an action against the Bremers on behalf of appellant and prepared, filed and caused to be served upon the Bremers copies of the proper pleadings and documents. The respondent advised the appellant not to discuss the case with the Bremers. However, appellant did not follow this advice, and without consulting the respondent, entered into another contract with the Bremers. Respondent first learned of the latter agreement some twelve days after its execution, and thereafter respondent made several calls and wrote several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>letters in an attempt to protect the interests of the appellant under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Two months later, and again without the knowledge of respondent, appellant executed a new and further agreement with the Bremers involving construction of buildings on the same premises to which the prior dispute had related. The latter contract called for a profit to the appellant of 10 per cent of the basic cost of the construction, plus costs of extras installed. The basic cost was $90,880.27, plus $2,433.34 extras, or a total of $93,313.61.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">After the construction was completed, appellant again became involved in a dispute with the Bremers involving the amounts due to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The respondent brought the instant action in three counts, one on the contingent fee contract and two common counts. Judgment was rendered in favor of the respondent in an amount equal to one-third of 10 per cent of $93,313.61.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Appellant contends that there was a conversation with the respondent upon the execution of the contingent fee contract, in which it was agreed that in the event the contemplated action against the landowner was settled prior to the trial by completing the first contract, the $500 paid would be full payment. The trial court found against the appellant on that contention, upon conflicting evidence. Conflicts of the evidence are to be weighed and to be determined by the trial court, and in this instance there was ample evidence to sustain the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Appellant further contends, in substance, that the contingent fee contract was not fair and equitable.  Whether a contingent fee contract is unconscionable is to be determined from the facts and situation as it appeared to the parties at the time the contract was entered into, and not as later developments may unfold. <em>(Swanson </em>v. <em>Hempstead, </em>64 Cal.App.2d 681, 688 [149 P.2d 404].)  Furthermore, a fee agreement negotiated, made and entered into before the time an attorney undertakes to represent the client is not excessive merely because the fee is to be $500 plus one-third of the gross recovery. <em>(Swanson </em>v. <em>Hempstead, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">Appellant asserts that if the respondent was to recover anything under the contract it was necessarily limited to one-third of the net fee derived from the second contract, not the gross fee. In this particular case the appellant himself brought about a large part of the difficulty in proceeding as he did. He attempted to settle his own case without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>knowledge or consent of the respondent\u2014and the appellant himself testified that his new contract with the Bremers, which \u201csettled his controversy with the landowner\u201d called for a profit to himself of ten per cent of $93,313.61. The new contract was the result of respondent\u2019s efforts in appellant\u2019s behalf, and therefore the respondent was entitled to one-third of the \u201cgross recovery,\u201d either by settlement or otherwise, namely, one-third of $9,331.36, or $3,110.45. The position the appellant found himself in was specially created and made for him by no one other than himself. He is, of course, estopped from raising the issues attempted in bar of the respondent\u2019s recovery. <em>(Safway Steel Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lefever, </em>117 Cal.App.2d 489, 491 [256 P.2d 32]; <em>Merry </em>v. <em>Garibaldi, </em>48 Cal.App.2d 397, 401 [119 P.2d 768].)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The trial court apparently made an error in the mathematical calculation since the judgment should have been for the sum of $3,110.45, rather than the sum of $3,112.03. The judgment is modified to read as follows: \u201cthat plaintiff have and recover judgment against the defendant, Robert C. Higgins, for the sum of $3,110.45, together with interest thereon at the rate of 7% per annum from and after August 29, 1955, and for the further and additional sum of $113.93, together with interest thereon at the rate of 7% per annum from and after April 14, 1954, together with costs herein amounting to the sum of $116.70.\u201d As so modified the judgment is affirmed, the respondent to recover his costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Doran, Acting P. J., and Nourse (Paul), J. pro tem.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied January 23, 1957.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-19\">\u201cMr. Robert C.
