No claim is made that she had any right in the subject' property. Mr. Emery died in 1915. His estate was probated in the superior court of San Benito County. On September 5, 1916, that court by its final decree of distribution appointed Lucien Oudin testamentary trustee of and distributed the entire estate to him in trust with directions to sell all real property situated in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">On December 21, 1921, Oudin, as trustee, by grant deed conveyed to F.

Prescott substantially all the land originally acquired by Emery from Batz and including within its boundaries the subject property, together with a large parcel not acquired from Batz, with this exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">\u201cExcepting however, from the parcel above described [substantially all of the land originally acquired by Emery from Batz in 1897] the following, to-wit: . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">\u201cFourth.

On January 9, 1922, Prescott by grant deed conveyed the property described in his deed from Oudin to Title Insurance &amp;.Trust Company. This deed contained the same exception as in the deed from Oudin to Prescott.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">On September 20,1922, Title Insurance and Trust Company released and quitclaimed to defendant all its right, title and interest in the property described in the Emery deeds of 1901 and 1904.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In September 1951 defendant, with the permission of the Public Utilities Commission, ceased operating railroad lines on the property conveyed by the deeds of 1901 and 1904, and removed all its rails.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Oudin died and Waller Taylor II was appointed trustee of the Emery testamentary trust in his place. On December 29, 1953, Taylor executed a quitclaim deed of the subject property to plaintiff. Plaintiff brought this suit to quiet title and for possession of the property, claiming under the re-entry clauses in the deeds of 1901 and 1904. The judgment decreed plaintiff is the owner in fee simple and entitled to possession of the property from and after the abandonment of the property by defendant in 1951, excepting certain portions acquired in 1947 by Alhambra for street-widening purposes by eminent, domain proceedings and subject to certain public easements which had been executed and recorded by defendant as conditional grantee of the property prior to its abandonment of the property on September 30, 1951. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Defendant\u2019s first contention is that the deed from Taylor to plaintiff did not convey the reversionary rights. It is argued that whether the fee or an easement was conveyed by the deeds of 1901 and 1904, the reversionary rights were conveyed with the surrounding property by the deed from Oudin Prescott and they were subsequently released to defendant Prescott\u2019s successor, Title Insurance and Trust Company. Defendants urged below that the Oudin-Prescott deed is indefinite and uncertain in that it cannot be ascertained therefrom whether the reversionary rights were conveyed thereby. They further contended it was the intention of Oudin to convey such rights. In support of their contention they relied on a provision in Mr. Emery\u2019s will directing the testamentary trustee \u201cto sell all of my real property situated in the State California,\u201d and a report made by Oudin to the superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>court of San Benito County that he had sold \u201call said real property in California\u201d except a parcel in Santa Barbara County. The court found that defendant is not the owner or entitled to the possession of the land conveyed by the 1901 and 1904 deeds, thereby impliedly finding that the OudinPrescott deed did not convey the reversionary rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Defendant says we are not bound by the trial court\u2019s construction of the Oudin-Prescott deed. The same contention with respect to a trial court\u2019s construction of a written contract was made in <em>Overton </em>v. <em>Vita-Food Corp., </em>94 Cal.App.2d 367 [210 P.2d 757], in which we said (p. 370) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">\u201cAppellant first says that we are not bound by the trial court\u2019s construction of the contract and are called upon to determine its meaning as a matter of law. Counsel cite <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>26 Cal.2d 621, 630 [160 P.2d 772], <em>Estate of Platt, </em>21 Cal.2d 343, 352 [131 P.2d 825], and <em>Texas Co. </em>v. <em>Todd, </em>19 Cal.App.2d 174, 185 [64 P.2d 1180]. This rule applies only where the trial court\u2019s decision was based solely on the terms of the written instrument. <em>(Union Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>93 Cal.App.2d 669, 673 [209 P.2d 621].) This was the situation in the cases cited by counsel. The rule is otherwise where parol evidence is introduced in aid of interpretation of the contract and where the evidence is such that conflicting inferences may be drawn therefrom. In such case the rule is that a reviewing court will accept or adhere to the interpretation of a contract adopted by the trial court and not substitute another of its own. <em>(Estate of Rule, </em>25 Cal.2d 1, 11 [152 P.2d 1003, 155 A.L.R. 1319].) In the case at bar evidence was introduced in aid of interpretation of the contract and conflicting inferences may be drawn therefrom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Defendant concedes \u201cthat conflicting inferences could be drawn from the will and report, which we rely on as confirming our construction of the Oudin-Prescott deed.\u201d Since conflicting inferences may be drawn from the evidence introduced for the purpose of construing the Oudin-Prescott deed, the issue was one of fact and the finding of the trial court is binding on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">The deed from Oudin to Prescott expressly excepted from the property thereby conveyed the property conveyed to Los Angeles and Pasadena Electric Railway Company in 1901 and to defendant in 1904. The trial court found as a fact that title to the reversionary rights created by the Emery deeds was not conveyed by the Oudin-Prescott deed. The deed from Prescott to Title Insurance and Trust Company expressly ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>eepted the reversionary rights. They remained in the trustee of the Emery testamentary trust\u2014Oudin, later Taylor. <em>(Hannah </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. R. R. Co., </em>48 Cal.App. 517 [192 P. 304].) Taylor, pursuant to an order of the superior court of San Benito County, conveyed the reversionary rights to, and they are vested in, plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\">The next point urged is that the court erred in declaring a forfeiture in view of claimed undisputed evidence as to \u201cchanged conditions\u201d and waiver. The contention is that by reason of a change of economic conditions and substitution of motor coach service over parallel routes, defendant \u25a0 was excused from further compliance with the terms of the conditions subsequent and that these facts constitute a waiver on the part of plaintiff and his predecessors in interest. The argument seems to be that abandonment of the use of rthe land as a right of way should be excused because a different mode of transportation had been- made necessary through a change of economic conditions. The court found that defendant in 1951 ceased operating railroad lines on the land conveyed by the Emery deeds and removed all its rails, and that the \u201cabandonment of , . the use of said right of way for railroad purposes and the cessation of use of said property, and failure to perform the express conditions in the said grant of right of way to use the same for railroad purposes . . . constitute a breach of said conditions subsequent. \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant does not challenge these findings.  Whether there has been an abandonment is a question of fact, not of law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ocean Shore Railroad, </em>32 Cal.2d 406, 417 [196 P.2d 570, 6 A.L.R.2d 1179]; <em>Tamalpais etc. Co. </em>v. <em>North-western Pac. R. R. Co., </em>73 Cal.App.2d 917, 931-932 -[167 P.2d 825].) The condition subsequent specified in the Emery deeds occurred; the electric railway constructed on the lands \u25a0granted ceased to be maintained and operated, and the rails were removed. The land has reverted. <em>(Potomac Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Routzahn, </em>192 Md. 499 [65 A.2d 580, 584]; <em>Missouri Pac. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>195 Ark. 487 [112 S.W.2d 957, 958].)</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">A ruling of the court excluding evidence of the dealings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>of plaintiff with the trustee and the beneficiaries of the Emery testamentary trust for the purpose of prosecuting the present litigation is assigned as error. The argument is that the evidence would have shown plaintiff\u2019s title is invalid. The point is without merit. It appears from the order of the superior court of San Benito County, quoted in the margin,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that plaintiff\u2019s activities and agreements with the trustee and the beneficiaries were fully disclosed to that court before it made the order, and that with that information before it the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>authorized the conveyance from the trustee Taylor to plaintiff. A right of re-entry or of repossession for breach of conditions subsequent can be transferred. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1046.) Taylor is not claiming any illegality in the deed to plaintiff; nor are the beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\">The defense of illegality, although open to the parties and those claiming under them, cannot as a general rule be invoked by third persons. <em>(California etc. Assn. </em>v. <em>Stelling, </em>141 Cal. 713, 720 [75 P. 320] ; <em>Wayman Inv. Co. </em>v. <em>Wessinger, </em>13 Cal.App. 108, 110 [108 P. 1022]; 17 C.J.S. 671, \u00a7 283.) The defense is raised by defendant, a stranger, solely to prevent the enforcement of valid conditions subsequent in deeds executed to defendant and its predecessor in interest, the terms of which have been admittedly broken by defendant. The court did not err in excluding the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Finally, it is asserted the reversionary rights vested in the trustee of the Emery testamentary trust were destroyed by defendant\u2019s adverse possession under color of the deed from Title Insurance and Trust Company. This contention is predicated on the fallacious assumption that by \u201ccolor of title\u201d under the quitclaim deed from Title Insurance and Trust Company to defendant, made in 1922 and recorded in 1923, the latter obtained \u201cprescriptive title\u201d by continuous \u201cadverse possession\u201d since 1923.  It is elementary law that possession alone, no matter how exclusive and complete, is not sufficient to create a prescriptive title. In order to do that the possession must be \u201cadverse\u201d to the party against whom such title is asserted. <em>(Dobbins </em>v. <em>Economics Gas Co., </em>182 Cal. 616, 630 [189 P. 1073] ; <em>Grimmesey </em>v. <em>Kirtlan, </em>93 Cal.App. 658, 665 [270 P. 243]; <em>Madden </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>21 Cal.App. 541 [132 P. 291].) At all times after recordation of the quitclaim from Title Insurance and Trust Company to defendant, the latter continuously used the property for the purposes stated in the Emery deeds until September 1951. There was no evidence that the trustee of the Emery testamentary trust had any knowledge of any claim on the part of defendant to an unrestricted fee in the land. Nor was there any evidence that defendant took any affirmative step to disclose an intent to act in derogation of the terms of the Emery deeds. The finding adverse to this claim is sustained by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In their opening brief counsel for defendant in effect conceded that the Emery deeds conveyed the fee on the condition subsequent that the grantees would continue operation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>trains on the land conveyed, and that such operation ceased in September 1951. Their contention was that the reversionary rights were conveyed by the Oudin-Preseott deed. In their reply brief they shift their position. They there contend the Emery deeds conveyed easements and not the fee on a condition subsequent.  A question smuggled into a closing brief merits scant consideration. The point needs no discussion after <em>Highland Realty Co. </em>v. <em>City of San </em>Rafael, 46 Cal.2d 669 [298 P.2d 15]. The court there said (p. 677) :</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u201cIt is of course true, as defendants point out, that \u2018A fee simple title is presumed to be intended to pass by a grant of real property, unless it appears from the grant that a lesser estate was intended. \u2019 (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1105; <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>McCombs </em>(1941), <em>supra, </em>17 Cal.2d 23, 28 [109 P.2d 329].) In the Elliott case a land company deeded to Rice a parcel of land, \u2018except the south 30 feet thereof reserved for road purposes,\u2019 and in concluding that the reservation was of only an easement rather than of the land itself the courts declared, quoting in part from <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Gates </em>(1921), 186 Cal. 151, 155 [199 P. 40], that \u2018there is a vast difference between a grant for purposes of \u201cright of way\u201d for a road and a grant of land \u201cto be used for a road.\u201d The latter grant may be entirely consistent with the conveyance of a fee-simple title, as a road may be maintained as readily on land held in 'fee as under an easement, but the grant of land as a right of way recognizes nothing but an easement. This rule was applied in <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Selig, </em>48 Cal.App. 228 [191 P. 983], where the court construed a deed conveying land to the city of Los Angeles for the purposes of a public road as passing the fee-simple title. Under the same principle of construction, the language in the deed of the land company to Rice conveyed a fee-simple title to him with the reservation of an easement on the part of the grantor. [Citations.] \u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Applying this rule the court noted that the basic deed of 1875 from Hayes before it for construction was \u201cof a right of way \u2018upon, over, and along a strip of land,\u2019 \u201d and therefore concluded that the Hayes deed conveyed only an easement, and not the underlying land. The court then considered a deed from Hayes\u2019 successor, Magnesen, which conveyed \u201cA tract of land ten (10) feet in width adjoining and lying south of that portion of the right of way\u201d which Hayes had conveyed. The court said the language of the Magnesen deed \u201cindicates a distinction between the nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>and .extent of the property interest or right he was conveying and that conveyed by the 1875 deed.\u201d In other words the Hayes deed conveyed an easement, the Magnesen deed conveyed the land. (Also see <em>Hannah </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. R. R. Co., </em>48 Cal.App. 517, 521 [192 P. 304].)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Under the rule, the Emery deeds conveyed the fee. The grants were not of land as a right of way. They were not of a right of way \u201cupon, over, and along a strip of land.\u201d They were grants of the entire land for the purpose of use as a way for an electric railroad. Two parcels conveyed by the 1901 deed were described as \u201cA strip of land 60 feet in width\u201d with metes and bounds descriptions. The two other parcels conveyed were described as \u201cA triangular piece of land\u201d in a designated quarter section with metes and bounds descriptions. The grantors reserved to themselves, their heirs and assigns, the right to establish and maintain across the \u201cparcels of land\u201d streets \u201cat such points as shall be designated upon any map or maps of subdivision of the lands belonging to the parties of the first part [the grantors] lying adjacent to the said strips and parcels of land hereby conveyed.\u201d The grantors also reserved to themselves, their heirs and assigns, the right \u201cto lay, construct and maintain private pipe lines for the conveyance of water across said strips and parcels of land and underneath the tracks.\u201d The grantee \u201cas a part of the consideration for this conveyance\u201d agreed that it, its successors and assigns, would construct and equip an electric railway from Los Angeles to Pasadena upon a line passing through the lands conveyed and continuously operate the same, and a branch line to Alhambra. The deed is replete with references to \u201cthe land conveyed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The 1904 deed recites that Pacific Electric \u201cis now the owner of said described property [described in 1901 deed]\u201d and is desirous \u201cof acquiring additional ground\u201d; as an inducement to the Emerys \u201cto grant to\u201d Pacific Electric \u201csaid additional ground,\u201d it has entered into certain covenants and agreement \u201chereinafter set forth.\u201d In the 1904 deed the Emerys granted \u201cFirst: A strip of land of irregular width [metes and bounds description] Together with the right to construct and maintain upon land adjoining the above, described strip of land . . . side slopes.\u201d \u201cSecond: A strip of land of irregular width [metes and bounds description] Together with the right to construct . . . side slopes\u201d on adjoining land.

'. conveyed\u201d by the 1901 deed. The only mention of a \u201cright of way\u201d is with reference to the use to which the grantee agreed to put the property.
