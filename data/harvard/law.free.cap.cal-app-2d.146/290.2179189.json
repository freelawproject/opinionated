Neumeister died testate November 17, 1944, a resident of the county of Los Angeles. On January 24, 1946, by decree of distribution, half of the estate was distributed to named legatees, and half to Security-First National Bank in trust with directions in subparagraph (a) to pay $300 every year to named persons (United States nationals) designated as \u201cprimary beneficiaries.\u201d The decree provided that the trust should continue as to them for the period of their lives and the lives of their descendants and heirs living at the death of the testator, or a period of ten years from the death of the testator, whichever period is the shorter, except as it might otherwise be terminated as provided in the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">In subparagraph (b) the decree provided that if at any time within the term of the trust for the benefit of the \u201cprimary beneficiaries\u201d persons named as \u201csecondary beneficiaries\u201d (German nationals) \u201cshall not be prohibited by the laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of California from becoming beneficiaries under said will and under the trust intended to be created herein,\u201d the trustee was directed to pay each of them $225 quarterly, or $75 monthly. The trustee was empowered to withhold payment to a \u201csecondary beneficiary\u201d if it appeared to its satisfaction that because of political or other conditions in the country in which such beneficiary resided he would not have the benefit, use or control of the funds; and if and when the conditions had been removed to pay the amount withheld and resume payment of the installments. It was provided that the provision for withholding should not continue beyond the time elsewhere specified as fixing the duration of the trust. The trustee was directed to continue distribution to the \u201csecondary beneficiaries\u201d until each had received an equal amount and the trust estate had been completely exhausted ; provided, however, that in no event should the trust continue longer than 20 years from the date of death of the testator, nor beyond the continuance of the lives of the \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary beneficiaries\u201d and their descendants or heirs living at the testator\u2019s death, whichever period is shorter.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">The decree further provided that when the \u201csecondary beneficiaries\u201d should be legally eligible to receive distribution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>trust funds, all payments to the \u201cprimary beneficiaries\u201d should cease and:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">\u201c(h) If the trust as to the secondary beneficiaries shall continue for the period of twenty years from the date of decedent\u2019s death, then, upon the expiration of said period of twenty years from the date of decedent\u2019s death the trust shall thereupon terminate and the trust estate then remaining shall be distributed, paid and delivered to the said secondary beneficiaries, to the exclusion of any of the primary beneficiaries, unless all of said secondary beneficiaries shall at that time be dead, in which event the trust estate then remaining shall be distributed, paid and delivered to said primary beneficiaries. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The material parts of the decree of distribution are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>On January 31, 1946, the Alien Property Custodian of the United States executed Vesting Order Number 5769 whereby he vested in himself \u201call right, title, interest and claim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>any kind.or character whatsoever\u201d of the secondary beneficiaries \u201cand each of them, in and to the Trust created under the Will\u201d of the deceased.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">On May 8, 1946, the trustee filed a petition requesting the court to \u201cconstrue the last Will and Testament of said decedent, and the Decree of Distribution of this Court and instruct your Trustee whether to pay said trust money for the secondary beneficiaries over to the Alien Property Custodian under one interpretation of the provisions of the Will of the decedent, or whether such trust moneys should be paid by the Trustee herein to the primary beneficiaries in the United States, under the provisions of said trust, on the grounds that the rights of the secondary beneficiaries are dependent on their being in position to actually receive payment and if they are not, then to adopt the alternate course in making payments to the primary beneficiaries herein, all of whom are in the United States.\u201d On December 20, 1946, the court instructed the trustee as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">\u201cThat due to the fact that the Alien Property Custodian issued its vesting order No. 5769 thereby vesting all the right, title and interest of the four (4) secondary beneficiaries, being residents and nationals of a designated enemy country\u2014 Germany\u2014and that the Alien Property Custodian by reason of the Vesting Order stands in place of the said s\u00e9condary beneficiaries, and becomes the owner of said funds, thereby causing a failure on the part of said secondary beneficiaries to be legally eligible to personally receive distribution of said trust funds amounting to the sum of Eight Thousand Four Hundred Ninety-eight Dollars and eighty-seven cents ($8,498.87[)], distribution and payment of the amounts provided for in sub-Paragraph (a) of the Decree of Distribution shall be made to the primary beneficiaries, share and share alike, being the beneficiaries in the United States. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The trustee then began paying the \u201cprimary beneficiaries\u201d \u00e1nd continued to do so through November 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">On December 2,1954, the trustee filed a petition for\" instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>tions, praying \u201c[t] hat the Court declare said Trust Estate terminated as of November 17, 1954,\u201d the date when the 10-year period prescribed in the decree for the payment to the \u201cprimary beneficiaries\u201d expired. The Attorney General appeared in response to the petition and an appearance was made on behalf of the German \u201csecondary beneficiaries\u201d in their individual capacities. Evidence was introduced establishing the existence of reciprocity under German law as of November 1954. The court found: 1. It was the intent of the testator that the \u201csecondary beneficiaries\u201d take nothing unless they shall be legally eligible to receive distribution of the trust funds and personally receive distribution. 2. On December 26, 1946 said \u201csecondary beneficiaries\u201d were not eligible to personally receive distribution of the trust funds, and the United States government took nothing by its Vesting Order Number 5769 issued January 31, 1946. 3. On November 7, 1954 (10 years after the death of the decedent) the \u201csecondary beneficiaries\u201d were entitled to personally receive the benefit of the trust funds. The court then ordered: 1. The \u201csecondary beneficiaries\u201d' are entitled to receive the net distributable balance of the funds on hand with the trustee. 2. The payments shall be made to the \u201csecondary beneficiaries\u201d pursuant to the will, the decree, and this order; the first payments to be made as of February 17, 1955, and subsequent payments quarterly thereafter. 3. This trust does not terminate at this time. Since payments are to be paid to the \u201csecondary beneficiaries,\u201d the trust is to continue until the funds are exhausted, but not later than November 17, 1964. 4. The Attorney General, as successor to the Alien Property Custodian, is not entitled to any of the payments from the trust which commence as to the \u201csecondary beneficiaries\u201d on February 17, 1955. The Attorney General appeals from the parts of the order to which reference has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Paragraphs (a) and (b) established a trust for a maximum period of 10 years for the benefit of the United States nationals subject to change of beneficiaries in favor of the German nationals whenever the latter were not \u201cprohibited by the laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of California from becoming beneficiaries under\u201d the trust. At such time as no prohibition was thus placed on the \u201csecondary beneficiaries,\u201d the trust assets became payable to them. It is agreed that in November 1954 neither state nor federal law imposed any prohibition on the German nationals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>\u201cfrom becoming beneficiaries under\u201d the trust. It is also agreed that the fact the \u201csecondary beneficiaries\u201d were enemy nationals at the time of the death of the testator did not deprive them of the right to take under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The question is whether the Alien Property Custodian took anything by his Vesting Order. The answer depends on whether under the decree of distribution the \u201csecondary beneficiaries\u201d took nothing unless they should be legally eligible to receive distribution of the trust fund at the date of death of the testator. The Attorney General says the interests of the \u201csecondary beneficiaries\u201d were contingent interests. The \u201csecondary beneficiaries\u201d say they had nothing until they were eligible to distribution. The trial judge was of the view \u201cthat the vesting of any rights in the secondary beneficiaries was conditional and was subject to a condition-precedent\u2014 the condition-precedent being the existence of a legal situation in which the secondary beneficiaries could have and receive the benefits of the property involved,\u201d but that the Attorney General could not reach such interests until the condition was fulfilled. We have concluded the interests of the \u201csecondary beneficiaries\u201d were from the date of death of the testator property interests which vested in the Alien Property Custodian at the time of the Vesting Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">First, the order of December 20, 1946, adjudicated that the Alien Property Custodian had succeeded under his Vesting Order to the interests of the \u201csecondary beneficiaries\u201d and had become \u201cthe owner of said funds, thereby causing a failure on the part of said secondary beneficiaries to be legally eligible to personally receive distribution.\u201d That order became final and is res judicata with respect to those questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\"><em>Estate of Schneider, </em>140 Cal.App.2d 710 [265 P.2d 45], is conclusive that from the death of the testator the \u201csecondary beneficiaries\u201d had contingent property interests in the trust and that such interests vested in the Alien Property Custodian by his Vesting Order. In Schneider the gift was to German nationals \u201cIf . . . alien residents of Germany shall become legally entitled under the laws of the United States and the State of California to take and inherit under my will. ...\u201d In an opinion authored by Mr. Presiding Justice Moore it is stated (p. 717):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">\u201cImmediately, upon the death of Mrs. Schneider all legacies bequeathed by her, including the beneficial interests in the trust which had failed, vested in the designated donees (Prob. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 300, 28; <em>Estate of Laurence, </em>84 Cal.App.2d 500, 504 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>[191 P.2d 109]; <em>Burns </em>v. <em>McGraw, </em>75 Cal.App.2d 481, 488 [171 P.2d 148]), subject only to the possession of the executrix for the purpose of administration. (Prob. Code, \u00a7 142; Civ. Code, \u00a7 694.) However, their delayed possession did not affect the fact that each legatee and each beneficiary was at decedent\u2019s death, vested with right of ownership of his bequest or beneficial interest. Such vesting occurred in 1945 when the testatrix departed this life. Hence, at the time, in 1946, when the Alien Property Custodian made the vesting order vesting ownership thereof in himself these beneficial interests were then the properties of the several persons named in (A) 3 of Eleventh and the Custodian was authorized by the Trading with the Enemy Act to seize them. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u201c [P. 718.] Conceding that the interests thus created were contingent, they were nevertheless property interests capable of transfer or of inheritance. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 669, 688, 693, 699; <em>Sinclair </em>v. <em>Crabtree, </em>211 Cal. 524, 528 [296 P. 79].) Since they were interests capable of transfer, they became property of the German beneficiaries promptly on the death of Mrs. Schneider in 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">\u201c The conclusion is, therefore, unavoidable that at the time of the vesting order, in 1946, the estate of each legatee and the beneficial interest of each beneficiary of the trust was subject to seizure under the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended. \u201d (Also see <em>Matter of Bendheim, </em>124 Misc. 424 [209 N.Y.S. 141], aff. 214 App.Div. 716 [209 N.Y.S. 794]; <em>Matter of Littman, </em>176 Misc. 679 [28 N.Y.S.2d 458]; <em>Matter of Carrington, </em>195 Misc. 442 [90 N.Y.S.2d 757]; <em>Matter of Sandhagen, </em>107 N.Y.S.2d 73; <em>Estate of Kuhirt, </em>132 N.Y.S.2d 97; <em>Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Markham, </em>68 F.Supp. 829, 830.)</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">The Trading with the Enemy Act must be given a liberal construction. <em>(Cities Service Co. </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>342 U.S. 330, 333-334 [72 S.Ct. 334, 96 L.Ed. 359]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chemical Foundation, </em>272 U.S. 1, 9-10 [47 S.Ct. 1, 71 L.Ed. 131].) The seizure power conferred by sections 5(b) and 7(c) of the Trading with the Enemy Act as amended (50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 \u00a7 5(b), 7(c)) is all-embracing in its terms. The power extends to <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>any property or interest \u2019 \u2019 of a foreign national (50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 5(b)) including, but not limited to, \u2018 \u2018 choses in action and rights and claims of every character and description.\u201d (50 U.S.C.App. \u00a77(c).) The language of these provisions is \u201cmost comprehensive.\u201d <em>(Application of Miller, </em>2d Cir., 288 F. 760, 766.)  The terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>\u201care so general and all-inclusive that\u201d the act \u201cpermits the seizure under proper circumstances of almost any character of interest in property. Any other ruling . . . would be to frustrate the purpose of the Act.\u201d <em>(Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Markham, </em>68 F.Supp. 829, 830.)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The wording of the decree of distribution at bar is: \u201cIf at any time within the term of the aforesaid trust for the benefit of said primary beneficiaries, the persons hereinafter designated as \u2018secondary beneficiaries\u2019 shall not be prohibited by the laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of California from becoming beneficiaries under said will and under the trust intended to be created herein, then from the time that such prohibition no longer exists the trustees shall distribute and pay out of the trust estate then remaining\u201d specified amounts to each of such persons. The \u201csecondary beneficiaries\u201d thus had contingent interests in the trust estate. The wording quoted merely postponed <em>enjoyment </em>of a gift already made. <em>(Estate of Heye, </em>195 Misc. 1026 [91 N.Y.S.2d 266] ; <em>Estate of Reiner, </em>44 N.Y.S. 2d 282. <em>Cf. Estate of Schaefer, </em>121 N.Y.S.2d 233.) All conditions imposed by the testator on the gift to the \u201csecondary beneficiaries\u201d have been fulfilled and the Attorney General, as successor to their interest, is now entitled to distribution of the trust assets. <em>(Sinclair </em>v. <em>Crabtree, </em>211 Cal. 524 [296 P. <em>79]; Estate of Schneider, </em>140 Cal.App.2d 710 [296 P.2d 45].) The fact that the interests did not become distributable until after termination of the war presents no bar to payment to the Attorney General. <em>(Application of Miller, </em>288 F. 760, <em>768; Hess </em>v. <em>Miller, 6 </em>F.2d 388; <em>Matter of Bendheim, </em>124 Misc. 424 [209 N.Y.S. 141], aff. 214 App.Div. 716 [209 N.Y.S. 794]; <em>In re Bendit\u2019s Will, </em>214 App.Div. 446 [212 N.Y.S. 526] ; <em>Todeva </em>v. <em>Oliver Iron Mining Co., </em>232 Minn. 422 [45 N.W.2d 782, 789],)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The parts of the order appealed from are reversed with directions to the superior court to make findings and render an order consonant with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Shinn, P.
