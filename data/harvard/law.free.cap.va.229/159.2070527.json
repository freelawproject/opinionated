Watson, Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney of Chesterfield County, petitioned for a writ of mandamus against the respondent, the Honorable William N. Humphries, Jr., Judge of the Circuit Court of Chesterfield County. Va. Const, art. VI, \u00a7 1; Code \u00a7 17-96. The petition alleges that Judge Humphries convicted Robert Forest Jennings of use of a firearm while committing robbery, a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that, instead of sentencing Jennings as the statute mandated, the judge withheld imposition of sentence for a period of one year. The petitioner prays that we issue a writ of mandamus directing the judge to vacate the judgment and sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>tence Jennings according to the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the sole question before us is whether, under the facts presented, Judge Humphries had the authority to withhold imposition of the sentence mandated by Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">The facts are undisputed. On July 31, 1984, Jennings pled guilty to robbery and to use of a firearm while committing robbery. Judge Humphries accepted the pleas and found Jennings guilty of both crimes. He continued the cases for a probation officer\u2019s presentence investigation and report.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">On September 25, 1984, the judge received the probation officer\u2019s report, heard additional evidence, and pronounced judgment in both cases. He sentenced Jennings to 15 years in the penitentiary for robbery, but suspended the entire sentence \u201cupon the conditions that [Jennings]: (1) keep the peace and be of good behavior and obey all laws for a period of Twenty (20) years, (2) continue with psychiatric care and treatment with reports to the Court every Ninety (90) days for a period of One (1) year, (3) participate in the Community Diversion Incentive Program, if qualified, (4) be placed on probation under the supervision of the Probation Officer of this Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Nevertheless, the judge withheld imposition of sentence on the firearm conviction \u201cuntil September 26, 1985, a period of Twelve (12) months, upon the conditions that [Jennings]: (1) keep the peace and be of good behavior and obey all laws, (2) continue with psychiatric care and treatment with reports to the Court every Ninety (90) days.\u201d When the judge ruled, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">On the firearm charge, I\u2019m going to withhold imposition of sentence ... for a period of twelve months, at which time I\u2019m going to review it and determine what sentence, if any, you will receive. More than likely, you will receive a two-year sentence and credit for the six months you have served, but I\u2019m going to take a look at that in one year ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">On September 28, 1984, the judge conducted a hearing on the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment and sentence Jennings according to the mandatory provision of \u00a7 18.2-53.1. Having received no decision on its motion, on October 12, 1984, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney petitioned for a writ of mandamus. On the same date, Judge Humphries denied the motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">In his letter opinion, the judge noted that \u201c[t]he issue involved is whether under Section 18.2-53.1 the Court can withhold imposition of sentence for a stated period of time or if the Court must immediately impose the mandatory sentence called for when a firearm is used in the commission of a felony.\u201d Judge Humphries acknowledged that \u00a7 18.2-53.1 \u201cclearly [states] that the Court cannot do three . . . things: (1) suspend the sentence, in whole or in part; (2) place the defendant on probation; (3) allow the sentence to run concurrently with the sentence imposed on the primary felony.\u201d However, the judge asserted that he had \u201cdone none of the things prohibited by the statute by merely withholding imposition of the sentence for a specified period of time.\u201d He further opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">To require, in every case, that the defendant begin his sentence immediately regardless of the circumstances of the particular case would be unrealistic and unreasonable. If the defendant were in need of immediate surgical or medical treatment or if the defendant were a female about to give birth, would the Court be precluded from withholding imposition of sentence? To allow this defendant to continue with his rehabilitation, including the private psychiatric care, at no expense to the Commonwealth, is a reasonable basis for delaying the imposition of sentence and does not appear to be inconsistent with the requirements of Section 18.2-53.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 makes it a separate felony to use a firearm while committing certain felonies, including robbery. It further provides that \u201cany person found guilty thereof shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years for a first conviction,\u201d and that \u201c[notwithstanding any other provision of law, <em>the sentence </em>. . . <em>shall not be suspended in whole or in part, nor shall anyone convicted [thereunder] be placed on probation.\u2019\u2019'\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.) Moreover, the punishment mandated is to run consecutively with the sentence imposed for the primary felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Because the statute\u2019s purpose is \u201cto deter violent criminal conduct,\u201d <em>Ansell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 763, 250 S.E.2d 760, 762 (1979), it provides an \u201cinflexible\u201d penalty. <em>Holloman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 221 </em>Va. 196, 198, 269 S.E.2d 356, 358 (1980). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Clearly, therefore, by prescribing a mandatory sentence, the General Assembly has divested trial judges of all discretion respecting punishment. <em>See Parrigen </em>v. Long, 145 Va. 637, 640-41, 134 S.E. 562, 562-63 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">The respondent concedes that Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 prescribes a mandatory sentence; nonetheless, he contends that a trial court has the inherent discretionary power \u201cto delay the commencement of a term of incarceration.\u201d Relying upon cases from other jurisdictions, he argues that a court may exercise its discretion \u201cto permit a defendant to put his \u2018affairs\u2019 in order; to permit a defendant to move for a new trial or to appeal; to permit inquiry into a defendant\u2019s sanity; to permit medical treatment; or to respond to some other necessity which presents a reasonable and just ground for delay.\u201d Any support for this argument from these cases is merely dicta.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In any event, the reasons for delay in the cited cases differ substantially from Judge Humphries\u2019: \u201c[t]o allow [Jennings] to continue with his rehabilitation.\u201d Further, unlike the present case, the courts in the cited cases were not confronted with a mandatory sentence and the delays were of relatively short duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">As previously noted, the purpose of \u00a7 18.2-53.1 is to deter violent crimes, not to reform or rehabilitate criminals. <em>See Ansell, </em>219 Va. at 763, 250 S.E.2d at 762. It expressly prohibits a court from either suspending the sentence or placing a defendant on probation. The statute provides that the sentence \u201cshall not be suspended,\u201d and we construe this language to mean that the court can neither delay imposition of the sentence nor stay its execution. <em>See Richardson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>131 Va. 802, 808, 109 S.E. 460, 462 (1921). Here, however, the court not only \u201csuspended\u201d the sentence in violation of the General Assembly\u2019s clear mandate, but also, in its effort to rehabilitate Jennings, effectively placed him on probation in contravention of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Accordingly, the writ of mandamus will be granted directing the trial judge to forthwith vacate his judgment of September 25, 1984, and to sentence Jennings according to the provision of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">\n<em>Writ granted.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-11\"> Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">It shall be unlawful for any person to use or attempt to use any pistol, shotgun, rifle, or other firearm or display such weapon in a threatening manner while committing or attempting to commit murder, rape, robbery, burglary, malicious wounding as defined in \u00a7 18.2-51, or abduction. Violation of this section shall constitute a separate and distinct felony and any person found guilty thereof shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years for a first conviction, and for a term of four years for a second or subsequent conviction under the provisions of this section. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the sentence prescribed for a violation of the provisions of this section shall not be suspended in whole or in part, nor shall anyone convicted hereunder be placed on probation. Such punishment shall be separate and apart from, and shall be made to run consecutively with, any punishment received for the commission of the primary felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b181-9\"> The respondent does not challenge mandamus procedurally, but asserts that the petitioner\u2019s requested relief should be denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
