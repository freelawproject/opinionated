They are gleaned from testimony given during ore tenus hearings and from voluminous correspondence among the parties\u2019 attorneys and others involved in this controversy. The legal dispute does not turn upon widely conflicting facts but upon construction and interpretation of the uncontradicted evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">In a written contract dated July 17, 1978, appellant Elizabeth P. Scott, the purchaser, agreed to buy from appellees M. Y. Sutherland, Jr., and Phyllis H. Sutherland, the sellers, land in Albemarle County. The agreement described the property as: \u201cAll of those certain tracts or parcels of land containing in the aggregate 463 acres more or less, on the north side of St. Rt. 692 and desig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>nated on the Albemarle County Tax Maps as Parcels #86-24, #86-24-B and #87-3 . . . .\u201d The description excluded a tract of four acres with a brick house and brick inn and included a barn as delineated on a sketch attached to the contract. The description also provided: \u201cFinal metes &amp; bounds of 4 acres to be excluded shall be surveyed at Purchaser\u2019s expense.\u201d The contract price was $460,000, with $5,000 cash paid upon execution of the agreement; $125,000 cash to be paid at closing, scheduled for September 1, 1978; and $330,000 to be paid over a period of ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The provision which generated this dispute was contained in paragraph 2 of an addendum, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">\u201cPurchaser reserves the right to survey this property prior to closing, and in the event such survey should disclose there are less than 463 acres in the above described property, the purchase price shall be abated at the rate of $1,000.00 per acre. If the survey should disclose more than 463 acres the purchase price shall be increased at the rate of $1,000.00 per acre.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">In preparation for closing, the purchaser retained a surveyor and instructed him to do preliminary work to determine whether there was any risk in completing the transaction based on old plats already available. The surveyor reported that, using the old plats, the acreage called for in the contract would be accurate within \u201cplus or minus two acres.\u201d The purchaser decided to close without further surveying. Upon learning of the surveyor\u2019s work, the sellers refused to close, insisting the purchaser was bound to provide a full, complete survey. Extended negotiations between the parties failed and the transaction eventually was aborted.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">This litigation ensued with the purchaser filing in June of 1979 a bill for specific performance. Asserting she was ready, anxious, and willing to close the transaction, the purchaser alleged that sellers failed and refused to comply with the contract. She asked the court to order a conveyance of the property and other relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">In their answer, the sellers alleged that a completed survey had showed \u201can acreage of 469.797 acres instead of the estimated 463 acres mentioned in said contract.\u201d Asserting the purchaser had never tendered or offered to tender the purchase price of $466,797, allegedly due because of the increased acreage, the sellers, in a cross-bill, sought damages for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Following hearings on the merits, the trial court ruled the purchaser had breached the contract, denied the request for specific performance, and awarded the sellers judgment on the cross-bill for $22,326.80. The purchaser appeals from the June 1981 final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Paragraph 2 of the addendum was inserted at the suggestion of the purchaser\u2019s attorney, James B. Murray, Jr. Murray had been called on short notice to the purchaser\u2019s home, several days before the contract was executed, to advise his client during negotiations for purchase of the land, a part of the Sutherlands\u2019 farm that adjoined the Scott property. Murray, who knew Sutherland had been farming \u201cthat area for a long time,\u201d suspected that only descriptions in old deeds based on old surveys were available. Murray had not had the opportunity to examine the land records to determine \u201cwhat sort of description existed.\u201d Thus, he suggested addition of the clause in question in order to give the purchaser \u201ca right to have the property surveyed, should [Murray] . . . find out that these descriptions are inadequate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Following execution of the contract, Murray discussed with his client the advisability of having the property surveyed prior to closing and whether \u201cthere was any risk to Mrs. Scott in going through with the contract as an in gross purchase.\u201d Murray had reviewed the land records and discovered three plats that \u201clooked quite old\u201d pertaining to the property. When Murray told his client that a complete survey would cost approximately $4,000, the purchaser indicated the estimate \u201cwas pretty expensive\u201d and said \u201cshe didn\u2019t want a survey if she could avoid it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Murray then contacted Kurt M. Gloeckner, an experienced Charlottesville surveyor. Murray asked the surveyor \u201cto please go look at these old plats and give us an estimate of how accurate you think they are.\u201d Several days later, the surveyor reported to Murray that he had looked at the plats and that they did not \u201cclose.\u201d The surveyor also said there \u201cwas some risk to Mrs. Scott, that there might be a lot less acres than 463.\u201d Murray then asked the surveyor if there was \u201cany cheap, inexpensive way to determine whether . . . the plats are accurate.\u201d The surveyor said that he could \u201cdo some field work,\u201d indicating he could \u201crun around the property once, and get some feel where the corners lay, that sort of thing, and come back and let us know whether or not the old plats were accurate.\u201d Murray instructed Gloeckner to \u201cas cheaply and quickly and inexpensively as possible . . . run out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>there and take a look and give me an opinion whether the description that exists in the land records, the old plats, present any great risk to Mrs. Scott closing the transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The surveyor obtained permission from Mr. Sutherland to go on the land. Gloeckner and two employees went to the property with \u201ca compass and chain to see if we could find any of the old physical evidence, monuments, irons, trees, anything that was called for by the old plats.\u201d The surveyor testified he performed \u201ca working traverse,\u201d which, he said, did not constitute making a survey or fixing a boundary of the property. In the process of performing a working traverse, according to Gloeckner, the surveyor selects a number of arbitrary points, for example, near an iron or monument, and uses those points to locate other physical evidence on the ground. \u201cThese points are also picked where the visibility is the best so that you can make the best time and make the longer shots.\u201d The surveyor testified that the working traverse \u201ceventually leads to a mathematically closed geometrical figure. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">After labor for the working traverse was concluded in the field, the results were plotted on a worksheet together with some of the points that had been \u201cpicked up along the way,\u201d such as fence posts, irons, and \u201ctrees with fence.\u201d Enlargements of the old surveys were placed over the worksheet. This showed that Gloeckner\u2019s lines were \u201csometimes in and sometimes outside of the property as described by the old plats.\u201d Using a computer, the surveyor then estimated the acreage within the working traverse and, by adding and subtracting, he estimated the acreage according to the old plats.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Upon completion of this work, Gloeckner compiled \u201ca very rough report\u201d for Murray. He made \u201can educated guess\u201d that the contract acreage was off \u201cplus or minus two acres\u201d from the actual acreage. The surveyor submitted a bill to the purchaser for $2,650 to cover \u201cReconnaissance Survey of Tax Map 86, Parcels 24, 24B and Tax Map 87, Parcel 3, Albemarle County, Virginia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Murray testified that, upon receipt of Gloeckner\u2019s report in early August indicating the purchaser did not \u201cstand much risk\u201d in using the old plats, he told the surveyor to proceed no further with work on the tract to be purchased. Gloeckner already had performed a full survey of the four-acre excluded parcel by that time, for which he billed the purchaser separately. Murray, and his law partners, prepared the necessary documents and announced that the purchaser was ready to close on September 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>In the meantime, Mr. Sutherland had learned of the surveyor\u2019s apparently extensive activity on his property. During the last week of August, letters began passing between attorneys for the purchaser and the sellers. The sellers refused to close on September 1 and took the position that the purchaser was in the process of completing a full survey of the entire property and demanded a copy of the survey before closing. Counsel for the purchaser notified counsel for the sellers on September 11 that Gloeckner was not employed to perform a survey of the property but was instructed \u201cto do the absolute minimum amount of work necessary to determine that the potential margin of error in the old surveys was significantly small that Mrs. Scott would incur no great risk by purchasing the property without a survey.\u201d Counsel for the purchaser pointed out that in the contract Mrs. Scott alone reserved the right to have a survey prepared and that she had not chosen to exercise that right. Mrs. Scott\u2019s attorney also wrote: \u201cWe have been prepared to close since September 1 and have the cash in hand with which to do so and hereby tender it to you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">No closing occurred, and the attorneys proceeded to inundate each other with lengthy correspondence. They debated such topics as the meaning of the addendum, the extent of Gloeckner\u2019s work on the property, whether the sellers were suffering damages by the delay, and the existence of a gore that may or may not have been within the bounds of the property covered by the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">As months passed with the controversy unresolved, the real estate agents involved on either side of the transaction attempted to engineer a settlement of the dispute. They agreed to finance a full, complete survey of the property if Mrs. Scott would agree to pay for any additional acreage disclosed by the survey. The purchaser agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Gloeckner performed the survey, which was completed about December 6. The survey showed that the area was 6.7 acres more than the in-gross contract description, making the purchase price approximately $467,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">The parties still could not agree to conclude the transaction. New issues were injected into the discussion. For example, the sellers claimed interest for the alleged failure of the purchaser to close on September 1. Finally, Mrs. Scott instructed her attorneys to soften their \u201crigid\u201d position on some of the issues that had arisen. Testimony showed that she wished to close the transaction, \u201cdid not want to create any further animosity,\u201d and \u201cwanted to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>whatever was necessary to placate Mr. Sutherland . . . without any further hardship [or] hard feelings. . . .\u201d Accordingly, in a letter to the sellers\u2019 attorney dated January 29, 1979, the purchaser\u2019s attorney confirmed that Mrs. Scott would agree to a sale by the acre instead of an in-gross sale, and that she would \u201cpay for the additional acreage. . . .\u201d This offer was not accepted and, after new counsel entered the case for the purchaser, the present suit was filed in June of 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Following consideration of the evidence, the chancellor ruled that the purchaser breached the contract and, therefore, was not entitled to specific performance. In addition, the court decided that the sellers were entitled to recover damages as the result of the purchaser\u2019s default. The chancellor, in an April 1980 letter opinion, determined that the \u201celection to survey,\u201d under the addendum, \u201crest[ed] with the purchaser, Mrs. Scott.\u201d The trial judge wrote that \u201cthere was no requirement that Mrs. Scott survey the property, she only had [an] election to do so and not an obligation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The court further ruled, however, that the evidence disclosed that the purchaser did \u201csubstantial survey work, [and] that this work was done for the purpose of determining the number of acres contained in the property.\u201d Continuing, the chancellor said, \u201cWe believe the evidence discloses that though a survey was not completed in the technical sense, that the purposes envisioned under the addendum . . . for a survey, that is the determination of acreage, were met by the work performed. Consequently, the purchaser was thus bound to perform in a manner consistent with the exercise of her election under the addendum. . . .\u201d The court ruled that because a full, complete survey of the property was not provided by the purchaser, she was not ready to perform the contract at the time required.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Elaborating on the letter opinion during an April 29, 1980 hearing, the trial court said that once the purchaser \u201cundertook to determine what the acreage was,\u201d then the purchaser \u201chad to do all things that were necessary to complete what an effective survey would have done and to comply with the contract based on the results of that effective survey.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">On appeal, determination of the legal effect of paragraph 2 of the addendum is dispositive of the controversy. Adopting the trial court\u2019s reasoning, the sellers contend that when the purchaser, having agreed to purchase land in gross and not by the acre, com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>menced survey work with respect to the tract to be purchased to determine the acreage, the purchaser was legally required to complete a full survey of the entire property. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Under the language of the addendum, the purchaser had the right to change the nature of the contract from a sale in gross to a sale by the acre. <em>See Nelson </em>v. <em>Carrington, </em>18 Va. (4 Munf.) 332 (1813). As the sellers point out, this change was to be accomplished by a survey. The trial court correctly held that the purchaser was not <em>required </em>to survey the property; she had an <em>election </em>to do so and not an obligation. Conversely, the sellers had no right to insist that the purchaser perform a survey. The right to require a survey was for the purchaser\u2019s benefit alone in connection with her right to convert the sale in gross to a sale by the acre.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The meaning of \u201csurvey,\u201d therefore, is crucial to a decision on the issue presented. The verb \u201cto survey,\u201d in the context of this contract, means \u201cto ascertain corners, boundaries, and divisions, with distances and directions, and not necessarily to compute areas included within defined boundaries.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1296 (5th ed. 1979). <em>Accord Kerr </em>v. <em>Fee, </em>179 Iowa 1097, 1104, 161 N.W. 545, 547 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">In <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Lawyers Title Ins. Corp., </em>112 F. Supp. 221, 224-25 (E.D. Va. 1953), Judge Hutcheson stated that the following definition of \u201csurvey\u201d was not only \u201clegally accurate\u201d but was in common use and accepted: \u201c \u2018[T]he act by which the quantity of a parcel of land is ascertained; the paper containing a statement of the courses, distances, and quantity of land is also called a survey,\u201d\u2019 <em>quoting </em>Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary 1159 (1940). The district court, in the process of holding that the document in issue relating to land in Surry County was merely a drawing and not a plat of survey, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-8\">\u201cThere are no metes and bounds, courses and distances. There is no scale of measurement. There is no note of survey anywhere disclosed. The drawing bears no date nor does the name of a surveyor or engineer appear although on a copy there is the name of Charles Ruffin, with no reference as to his connection. Certain streams are reflected, including the James River, but the map, if such it may be called, is totally inadequate for the purpose of establishing either a starting point or a boundary line.\u201d 112 F.Supp. at 223.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>According to the uncontradicted evidence, and against the background of the foregoing definitions, the purchaser did not, in the language of the addendum, \u201csurvey this property prior to closing.\u201d The witnesses used various terms to describe the extent of Gloeckner\u2019s work which was accomplished in response to Murray\u2019s instruction to \u201cas cheaply and quickly and inexpensively as possible . . . run out there and take a look and give me an opinion whether the description that exists in the land records, the old plats, present any great risk to Mrs. Scott closing the transaction.\u201d Terms such as \u201cworking traverse,\u201d \u201cfield reconnaissance survey,\u201d and \u201cpreliminary work\u201d were used to describe the surveyor\u2019s efforts. The trial court used the term \u201csubstantial survey work.\u201d Nevertheless, whatever term is used to describe the surveyor\u2019s activities, before September 1 he never performed a \u201csurvey\u201d as defined above, nor was he requested to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The effect of the trial court\u2019s ruling was to find that once the purchaser initiated activity to determine the acreage of the tract, the sellers acquired a right under the contract to, paraphrasing one of the foregoing definitions, demand that the purchaser proceed to ascertain corners, boundaries, and divisions, with distances and directions, and not merely to compute areas included within defined boundaries. In our judgment, such an interpretation is at odds with the clear language of the addendum and was not contemplated by the parties at the execution of the contract. Under the addendum, the purchaser could investigate to ascertain whether she would safely rely on old plats and deed descriptions without being forced, against her will and at the whim of the sellers, to convert a sale in gross to a sale by the acre by supplying a complete survey.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Therefore, we hold that the purchaser made a proper tender of performance in advance of the closing date of September 1 and that she was ready, willing, and able to perform in accordance with the contract for a sale in gross. It follows that the sellers breached the contract by their insistance on a full and complete survey and by their refusal to close on September 1. Because the transaction was not completed as agreed, the purchaser ultimately changed her position when she agreed to treat the contract as a sale by the acre after the agent-financed survey had been completed. But the sellers may not properly complain about this change of position because it is to their advantage, time not being of the essence of the contract. Under the addendum, the purchaser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>became obligated to pay an increased price because of the additional acreage.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court, annul the damage award, and remand the suit. The trial court will be directed to enter a decree requiring the sellers specifically to perform the contract; requiring the purchaser to pay, according to the addendum, for the increased acreage as disclosed by the completed survey; and dismissing the cross-bill.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b151-7\">We do not address the problem of the existence or location of the gore, an issue that was not raised in the pleadings and that is not germane to the suit for specific performance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
