The decision turns upon our construction of Code \u00a7 15.1-431, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-10\">When a proposed amendment of the zoning ordinance involves a change in the zoning classification of twenty-five or less parcels of land, then, in addition to [the newspaper publication required by Code \u00a7 15.1-431], written notice shall be given by the local [board] at least five days before the hearing to the owner or owners ... of each parcel involved, and to the owners ... of all abutting property and property immediately across the street or road from the property affected. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">Appellants, Lawrence Transfer &amp; Storage Corp. and others<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (the landowners), filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the trial court, pursuant to Code \u00a7 15.1-497.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The landowners alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>that they were aggrieved by a decision of the Augusta County Board of Zoning Appeals because the Board failed to comply with the notice provisions of Code \u00a7 15.1-431 before conducting a hearing on an application for a special use permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">T. O. Tench and Louise V. Tench (collectively, Tench) own a 205.802-acre tract (the 205-acre tract or parcel) in Augusta County. The landowners\u2019 properties abut the Tench tract. Tench contracted to sell Wells Construction Company, Inc. (Wells), 10 acres lying within the 205-acre parcel. Wells applied for a special use permit allowing it to construct and operate asphalt and concrete batching plants on the 10 acres. The proposed 10-acre parcel had not been subdivided of record and was not shown separately on any of the County\u2019s records; it remained part of the 205-acre parcel. The 10-acre tract was shown, however, on the site plan attached to Wells\u2019 application.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Tench owns all the land abutting the proposed batching site. None of the owners of land abutting the 205-acre tract received written notice of the hearing. The Board gave written notice only to Tench and to a non-resident who owned land across the road from an easement to the 10-acre parcel. The Board did give notice by newspaper publication as provided by Code \u00a7 15.1-431. Following a hearing, the Board approved Wells\u2019 application.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">After allowing the writ of certiorari, the trial court ruled that the landowners were not entitled to written notice of the Board\u2019s hearing, and that only owners abutting the 10-acre parcel were entitled to such notice. Having concluded that the Board complied with the statute\u2019s notice requirements, the court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. We granted an appeal from the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The landowners assert that the proposed 10-acre tract is not a separate parcel but is merely an unsubdivided portion of the Tench tract. They contend that the statute is concerned with actual, recorded property boundaries and not with \u201cillusory boundaries which exist only in the [applicant\u2019s mind].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The Board counters with the contention that the statute applies solely to the property which is undergoing a zoning change. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>it asserts that the 10-acre parcel is the \u201cproperty affected\u201d within the intendment of Code \u00a7 15.1-431.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">\u201cZoning laws should be given a fair and reasonable construction in the light of the manifest intent of the [legislature], the object sought to be attained, [and] the natural import of the words used in common and accepted usage. . . .\u201d <em>Mooreland </em>v. <em>Young, </em>197 Va. 771, 775, 91 S.E.2d 438, 441 (1956). <em>See also Citizens Association </em>v. <em>Schumann, </em>201 Va. 36, 40, 109 S.E.2d 139, 141 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The statute\u2019s obvious intent is to afford property owners who are closest to the land involved an opportunity to be heard by the Board. Landowners abutting and across a road from the property involved are those most likely to be affected by the proposed change.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Code \u00a7 15.1-431 mandates written notice to three categories of landowners. First, the Board must notify \u201cthe owner ... of [the] <em>parcel </em>involved\u201d in the proposed zoning change. (Emphasis added.) The second category of owners who must be notified are \u201cthe owners ... of all abutting property.\u201d Finally, notice must be given to owners 'of \u201cproperty immediately across the street or road from the <em>property </em>affected.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Applying this language to the present case, we think it apparent that the \u201cparcel involved,\u201d is the parcel of \u201cthe owner,\u201d that the sole record owner is Tench, and that the only parcel Tench owns is the 205-acre tract. Thus, the \u201cparcel involved\u201d is the 205-acre tract. It naturally follows, therefore, that the additional words \u201cand to the owners ... of all abutting property,\u201d extend the protection of the notice statute to the owners of property abutting the 205-acre tract. Likewise, the words \u201cproperty immediately across the street or road from the property affected,\u201d refer, in this case, to property across the street or road from the recorded 205-acre parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">If we adopted the Board\u2019s contention, the General Assembly\u2019s clear intent easily could be frustrated or circumvented. By simply creating a smaller parcel within a larger recorded parcel, written notice would be required only for the owner of the parcel involved. He, of course, being interested in the change, would already know of the proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">This is essentially what occurred in the present case. Only Tench, the owner, and one other party received written notice. Frustration of the statute\u2019s objective is graphically illustrated by the fact that Lawrence Transfer, one of the appellants, owned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>property which not only abutted the Tench tract but which was a mere 30 feet from the batching site. Yet, Lawrence Transfer received no direct notice of the hearing. Clearly, the General Assembly did not contemplate this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The Board argues that requiring notice to all abutting landowners could reach an absurd result when, due to the size of the tract, some abutting property is distant from the area to be changed. While this may be the result in some cases, we believe that, on balance, an excess of notice is more in keeping with the General Assembly\u2019s intent than no notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">We conclude, therefore, that when Code \u00a7 15.1-431 is construed in the light of the General Assembly\u2019s obvious intent and purpose, giving the words used their natural and logical import, the terms \u201cparcel involved\u201d and \u201cproperty affected\u201d each refer to the entire recorded parcel owned by Tench and not to a nonexistent tract lying somewhere therein. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court, vacate the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals, and invalidate the special use permit without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">\n<em>Reversed and permit dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b589-12\"> In this case, a special use permit was granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals, and Code \u00a7 15.1-496 provides that \u201c[n]o such special exceptions . . . shall be authorized except after <em>notice </em>and hearing as required by \u00a7 15.1-431.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b589-13\"> Other appellants are: C.
