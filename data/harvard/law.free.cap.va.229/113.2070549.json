Confirming the verdict, the trial court imposed penitentiary sentences of life and 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">In his appeal of the rape conviction, Elam contends that \u201cthe prosecution failed to show penetration\u201d. Otherwise, he does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence as to either conviction. Elam broke and entered the prosecutrix\u2019s mobile home, wakened her in her bed, \u201cjerked the cover off\u2019, told her that \u201che was mean as the devil and he\u2019d do something to hurt [her]\u201d, and \u201cjerked off some of [her] clothes.\u201d The prosecutrix, 87 years of age and crippled, \u201ccommenced yelling\u201d and tried to resist the assault, but her efforts \u201cdidn\u2019t do no good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">As proof that penetration never occurred, the defendant relies upon the following excerpt from the transcript of the victim\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-15\">Q. All right, after he jerked off your clothes, what did he do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>A. Well, he didn\u2019t rape me; I don\u2019t think he raped me; but it seemed like they thought he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">Q. Did he try to put his penis into your sexual organ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">Q. But you don\u2019t know whether he got it in or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">A. No, I don\u2019t, but it liked to scared me to death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">We agree with the defendant that this testimony, while sufficient to prove attempted rape, is insufficient, standing alone, to prove rape. But it does not stand alone, and we do not agree that it forecloses proof of penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">To the lay person, rape is generally construed to mean total consummation of an act of sexual intercourse, committed forcibly and with complete penetration. But the law does not define the crime in the vernacular. We have recently summarized and reaffirmed the legal principles. Penetration by a penis of a vagina is an essential element of the crime of rape; proof of penetration, however slight the entry may be, is sufficient; evidence of ejaculation is not required; and no hypothesis that penetration was accomplished by some object other than a penis is sufficient to reverse a conviction unless it reasonably flows from the evidence itself rather than the imagination of counsel. <em>Tuggle </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 493, 323 S.E.2d 539 (1984). Given the circumstantial evidence of penetration adduced by the Commonwealth in this case, the jury could rationally discount the uncertainty reflected in the prosecutrix\u2019s testimony as the product of lay ignorance of these legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">The medical and forensic evidence was compelling. The examining physician testified that he found a vaginal laceration \u201cabout the length of my little finger in the vertical position, and about twice that in the horizontal position.\u201d He said that \u201chalf of the vertical tear, was outside of the entrance, and the other half was inside.\u201d The \u201cdome of the vagina . . . [was] reddened as if it had been struck by something.\u201d Type A blood, consistent with that of the prosecutrix and inconsistent with that of the defendant, was found on the bed, on the defendant\u2019s clothes, and in his pubic area. There was no evidence of ejaculation in or about the vagina, but a blanket contained the residue of seminal fluid.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">There is nothing in the record to account for the laceration and bleeding other than the prosecutrix\u2019s testimony that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>attempted forcible intercourse, and we hold that the evidence of penetration was fully sufficient to support the rape conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Attacking both convictions, Elam argues that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to trial by an impartial jury. He challenged the impartiality of one member of the venire because she was the sister of a <em>former </em>Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney and that of four other members because they were <em>former </em>clients of the incumbent Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney. All five were interrogated individually by the court and defense counsel, each declared that his relationship would not affect his ability to give the defendant a fair trial, and the court overruled the defendant\u2019s several objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Affirming the common-law rule, we have held that a person is not disqualified to sit as a juror in a civil case solely because he is related to counsel for one of the parties. <em>Petcosky </em>v. <em>Bowman, </em>197 Va. 240, 253-54, 89 S.E.2d 4, 14 (1955) (first cousin). We have never had occasion to consider whether that rule applies in a criminal case, and we do not now. The prospective juror was not related to the attorney representing the Commonwealth in this case, and her answers on <em>voir dire </em>contradict any suspicion of bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">There is no merit in Elam\u2019s challenge to the other four veniremen. The question is squarely controlled by our decision in <em>Calhoun </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 256, 263, 307 S.E.2d 896, 900 (1983), where we said that \u201cwe will not adopt a <em>per se </em>rule disqualifying a prospective juror solely on the ground that sometime in the past the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney had represented him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Finding no error in the court below, we will affirm the judgments in both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
