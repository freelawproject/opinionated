(Armco), a corrugated pipe manufacturer, sold a quantity of its pipe to New Horizon Development Company of Virginia, Inc. (New Horizon), a construction company. The purchase order was memorialized by an \u201cacknowledgment,\u201d which New Horizon received from Armco. New Horizon regularly placed orders and received acknowledgments similar to those in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">Upon receipt of the pipe and acknowledgment, New Horizon accepted them and paid the purchase price. The acknowledgment contained the following pertinent provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">This is an exact duplicate of your order as entered on our plant. ACCEPTANCE OF YOUR PURCHASE ORDER IS VALID ONLY WITH THE INCLUSION OF ALL \u201cCONDITIONS OF SALE\u201d (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LIMITED WARRANTIES, LIMITATION OF BUYER\u2019S REMEDIES, AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY FOR FAILURE OR DELAY IN DELIVERY) ON THE BACK HEREOF, as established by (1) your acceptance of the products herein described, (2) your failure to object promptly to any of said \u201cConditions of Sale,\u201d or (3) otherwise.

ACCEPTANCE. Any quotation by Seller on the face hereof or on any attachment hereto is merely an invitation for an offer from potential customer(s). All resulting customer offers (orders) are thus subject to acceptance at Seller\u2019s offices at the address shown on the face hereof, before any contract is formed.

SELLER MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTY WHATEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE WHICH EXCEED OR DIFFER FROM THE WARRANTIES HEREIN EXPRESSED ARE DISCLAIMED BY SELLER AND EXCLUDED FROM THIS AGREEMENT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">3. LIMITATION OF BUYER\u2019S REMEDIES. Seller\u2019s liability hereunder shall be limited to the obligation to repair or replace products proven to have failed to meet the specification or to have been defective in quality or workmanship at the time of delivery, or allow credit therefor, at its option.

At an architect\u2019s suggestion, however, New Horizon erected sections of the pipe vertically to store water in a passive solar heating system. Leaks developed in the joints and seams of the pipe, and the problem was finally corrected by welding. New Horizon sued Armco for the cost of repairs, alleging breach of express and implied warranties, misrepresentation, and negligence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Armco contended that, upon acceptance by New Horizon, the acknowledgment became the parties\u2019 contract and that it excluded all warranties and remedies except those provided for therein. The court rejected this contention and submitted to the jury the issues of express and implied warranties. The jury returned a verdict in favor of New Horizon, which the trial court approved, and this appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">We will summarize the testimonial evidence which Armco unsuccessfully sought to exclude. An architect contacted an Armco sales representative requesting information regarding use of Armco\u2019s pipe for the vertical storage of water. The architect was interested in using the pipe in the construction of a passive solar heating system for a bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">The pipe was used successfully for the bank project. Thereafter, the architect designed another solar heating system for a residence. Armco\u2019s pipe also was used in this system. New Horizon was the general contractor for the construction of the residence, including the solar heating system. Upon the architect\u2019s advice, New Horizon purchased the pipe from Armco. Armco\u2019s representative knew of the proposed project and did not question its feasibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">The system consisted of five pipes, approximately 30 feet long, installed vertically. (This contrasted with the bank project which contained eight vertical pipes, each of which was 10 feet long.) Because the pipe was not manufactured in 30-foot lengths, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>delivered to the construction site in 10-and 20-foot sections, which were joined to achieve the 30-foot height. When the project was completed, the pipes were filled with water, and the leaks occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">Generally, a contract for the sale of goods is unenforceable unless it is evidenced by a writing \u201csigned by the party against whom enforcement is sought.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.2-201(1). However, <em>\u201c[bjetween merchants </em>if within a reasonable time a writing in confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and the party receiving it has reason to know its contents\u201d (emphasis added), the requirements of Code \u00a7 8.2-201(1) are satisfied \u201cunless written notice of objection to [the writing\u2019s] contents is given [by the receiving party] within ten days after it is received.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.2-201(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The term \u201cbetween merchants\u201d applies in any transaction where both parties are \u201cchargeable with the knowledge or skill of merchants.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.2-104(3).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">\u201cMerchant\u201d means a person who deals in goods of the kind or otherwise by his occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices or goods involved in the transaction or to whom such knowledge or skill may be attributed by his employment of an agent or broker or other intermediary who by his occupation holds himself out as having such knowledge or skill.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Code \u00a7 8.2-104(1). Thus, as used in the U.C.C., \u201cmerchant\u201d denotes a business professional as opposed to a casual or inexperienced seller or buyer. Code \u00a7 8.2-104, official comment 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">When a writing which meets the requirements of Code \u00a7 8.2-201 is \u201cintended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement,\u201d the terms thereof may not be contradicted \u201cby evidence of any prior agreement.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.2-202. To limit either warranties or remedies, however, the exclusionary language in the writing must be \u201cconspicuous.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.2-316(2). Whether a provision is conspicuous is a question of law for a court. Code \u00a7 8.1-201(10). <em>See Lacks </em>v. <em>Bottled Gas Corp., </em>215 Va. 94, 96, 205 S.E.2d 671, 673 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">A provision is deemed to be conspicuous when \u201cit is so written that a reasonable person against whom it is to operate ought to have noticed it.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.1-201(10). For example, language con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>tained in the body of an agreement is conspicuous if it is written in \u201clarger or other contrasting type or color.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Both Armco and New Horizon held themselves out as having knowledge or skills peculiar to the practices involved in the transaction. Armco is a manufacturer and New Horizon a building contractor; both are business professionals. Thus, they are \u201cmerchants\u201d as defined by Code \u00a7 8.2-104(1). Because the transaction was \u201cbetween merchants,\u201d the acknowledgment became the parties\u2019 contract when New Horizon failed to give Armco written notice of any objection within 10 days after receiving the acknowledgment. Code \u00a7 8.2-201(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Having met the requirements of Code \u00a7 8.2-201, the acknowledgment became the \u201cfinal expression\u201d of the parties\u2019 agreement. Code \u00a7 8.2-202. Consequently, its terms and provisions, including those limiting warranties and remedies, could not be contradicted \u201cby evidence of any prior agreement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">This brings us to the central issue in this appeal: whether the provisions of the U.C.C. or Code \u00a7 11-4<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> govern the type-size requirements for the contract. As previously noted, the U.C.C. requires only that the excluding language be conspicuous, Code \u00a7 8.2-316(2), and language is conspicuous when it is written in larger type, Code \u00a7 8.1-201(10). Because the excluding language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>in the contract is in larger type, we hold as a matter of law that it is conspicuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">The type size, however, does not meet the requirements of Code \u00a7 11-4 which was in effect prior to the U.C.C. For this reason, the trial court ruled that the exclusions were unenforceable. We hold that the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Under the facts of this case, Code \u00a7 11-4 is inconsistent with the U.C.C. provision requiring that a limiting term or clause need be only conspicuous. Thus, the provisions of Code \u00a7 11-4 do not apply to this U.C.C. transaction. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.10-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">We conclude, therefore, that because the limiting language of the contract was conspicuous within the meaning of the U.C.C., the court erred in submitting the issues of express and implied warranties to the jury. Accordingly we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and enter final judgment for Armco.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-9\"> The trial court ruled that the misrepresentation and negligence allegations were unsupported by the evidence and refused to submit these issues to the jury. New Horizon assigned cross-error to these rulings. Because we find no merit to the assignments of cross-error, we reject New Horizon\u2019s contentions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\"> \u00a711-4.
