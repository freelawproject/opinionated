His employer, Beatrice Pocahontas Company, and the employer\u2019s insurance carrier, Old Republic Insurance Company (collectively, the employer), agreed to compensate Shortridge at a rate of $199 per week based on his average weekly wage of $379.90 at the time of the injury. The Industrial Commission entered an award approving this agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">In October 1980, Shortridge began receiving additional benefits of $316.63 per month under the Federal Old-Age Survivors and Disability Insurance Act (Social Security Amendments of 1969). His federal disability benefit was increased to $351 per month as of July 1, 1983. Each of his children receives $18 per month in federal benefits. His wife received similar benefits of $18 per month, which terminated after delivery of a check dated July 1, 1983, covering the month of June.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">Shortridge sought cost-of-living increases for 1980, 1981, and 1982, asserting that his combined worker\u2019s compensation and federal Social Security benefits amounted to less than 80% of his av<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>erage monthly earnings before his disability. The Commission awarded cost-of-living allowances for all three years in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Code \u00a7 65.1-99.1 provides that compensation for cost-of-living increases \u201cshall at no time exceed the then current maximum weekly amount payable under \u00a7 65.1-54.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.1-54 establishes a ceiling for Virginia disability benefits based on the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth. The average weekly wage is computed yearly on or before January 1 for the 12-month period ending the preceding June 30 and becomes applicable the following July 1. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.1-54. Accordingly, in awarding Shortridge cost-of-living increases, the Commission limited the cost-of-living awards to the maximum weekly amount then payable. On each July 1, when the statutory maximum amounts increased, the Commission allowed full cost-of-living allowances for the remainder of the period. The employer challenges this ruling by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The employer relies on Code \u00a7 65.1-99.1, which states that any change in the cost-of-living supplement \u201cshall become effective as of October one next following such determination date.\u201d It argues the Commission improperly awarded increased cost-of-living supplements each July 1 upon increase in the maximum weekly amount payable under Code \u00a7 65.1-54. The argument, however, is without merit. The Commission did not award separate cost-of-living increases effective July 1 and October 1 of each year. Instead, it determined claimant\u2019s entitlement each year as of July 1; each cost-of-living increase became effective the following October 1. But because of the limitation of Code \u00a7 65.1-54, the Commission restricted the amount payable to the statutory maximum amount then in effect. When the maximum increased on July 1 of each year, the Commission allowed payment of the full cost-of-living supplement already awarded. Each July 1 increase was merely a change in the payable amount of a previously awarded supplement, not a change in the cost-of-living supplement itself. Hence, Code \u00a7 65.1-99.1 did not prohibit the July 1 payment increases, and the full supplement was properly payable after each year\u2019s increase in the statutory maximum benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The employer also challenges the Commission\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 65.1-99.1 in determining whether a claimant is entitled to a cost-\u00f3f-living supplement. The statute provides for such a supplement if the combined federal and state disability benefits of a \u201cclaimant or his dependents\u201d are less than 80% of the aver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>age monthly earnings of the claimant before disability or death. The employer concedes that if Shortridge\u2019s own Social Security disability benefits are added to his monthly compensation rate, the total is less than 80% of his average monthly earnings before disability. It argues, however, that the Commission erred in not adding the additional Social Security benefits received by his dependents.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Shortridge\u2019s average weekly wage before disability was $379.90. This figure, multiplied by 52 weeks and divided by 12 months, produces an average monthly wage of $1,646.23, 80% of which is $1,316.98. Shortridge\u2019s compensation rate is $199 weekly, or $862.33 monthly. As the employer concedes, if his worker\u2019s compensation benefit of $862.33 is added to his own federal disability benefit, the combined benefit is less than 80% of $1,646.23, his average monthly wage before disability.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Even if the federal benefits paid to his wife and children are included in this computation, as employer urges they should be, the family\u2019s total federal disability benefit would be no greater than $405.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hence, the combined disability benefits, $405 and $862.33, would be $1,267.33, which is still less than 80% of his average monthly earnings before disability. Because there would be no difference in outcome under either interpretation of the statutory language, this issue is not properly before us for resolution. We will not give an advisory opinion as to what benefits are properly includible in determining eligibility for cost-of-living supplements under \u00a7 65.1-99.1. <em>See Butler </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>219 Va. 164, 167, 247 S.E.2d 353, 355 (1978); <em>City of Fairfax </em>v. <em>Shanklin, </em>205 Va. 227, 229, 135 S.E.2d 773, 775-76 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Finally, the employer challenges the Commission\u2019s award which directed that future payments continue at the rate ordered \u201cpending additional cost-of-living changes.\u201d The employer argues the Commission is without authority to direct future cost-of-living supplements absent application and proof of eligibility by Short-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>ridge. The employer, however, contests an action not yet taken by the Commission; there is no evidence that additional cost-of-living changes have been awarded. Again, the employer\u2019s argument is raised prematurely and any opinion we might express would be merely advisory. We decline to address this issue until it is presented in a justiciable controversy that is ripe for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">We affirm the Industrial Commission\u2019s practice of allowing payment of previously awarded cost-of-living supplements immediately upon an increase in the statutory maximum amount payable, but hold that the other issues are not properly raised in this appeal. Accordingly, we will affirm the Industrial Commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-6\"> Shortridge initially received $316.63 monthly, but this federal disability benefit was increased to $351 per month as of July 1, 1983. Thus, the combined benefit total would be either $1,178.96 or $1,213.33. Each of these figures is less than $1,316.98.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b103-7\"> Shortridge\u2019s wife and each of his two children received monthly disability benefits of $18, but the wife\u2019s final benefit payment was July 1, 1983. Shortridge\u2019s own disability benefit was increased to $351 as of July 1, 1983; therefore, the total of their federal disability benefits peaked at $405 on this date and thereafter declined when the wife\u2019s benefits ceased upon her return to work.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
