(Fox), the defendant below, is a general construction contractor. Appellee Earl E. Norris Roofing Company, Inc. (Norris), the plaintiff below, is a roofing contractor. Both parties have had more than 20 years\u2019 experience in the construction business. Norris filed a motion for judgment against Fox alleging that \u201c[b]y contract dated August 17, 1978, plaintiff contracted with defendant to provide roofing and sheet-metal work on defendant\u2019s project\u201d. Norris claimed that Fox was \u201cindebted to the plaintiff in the amount of $8,463.50 representing contract sums due\u201d. In a counterclaim, Fox demanded $2,400.00 in damages resulting from Norris\u2019s alleged breach of the terms of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-14\">Prior to trial, the parties stipulated that, with respect to the items in agreement, Fox had paid Norris all but $1,496.00 due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>under the \u201cAdjusted contract sum\u201d. The parties agreed that this stipulation was made \u201cwithout prejudice to the right of Norris to allege and prove its claim . . . [for] $5,685.00\u201d. That figure included, among other things, $3,800.00 for \u201cgutter and downpipe\u201d, $895.00 for \u201cchimney caps\u201d, and $560.00 for \u201croof vents\u201d. It was further agreed that the stipulation was made \u201cwithout prejudice to the right of Fox to allege and prove its counterclaim of $2,757.81\u201d. The jury awarded Norris $7,181.00 \u2014 the unpaid balance of the adjusted contract sum plus the full amount of its modified claim. The jury also returned a verdict for Fox for $1,378.90 on its counterclaim. Fox appeals from the judgment confirming the two verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Insofar as pertinent to this appeal, the \u201cSub-Contract Agreement\u201d, dated August 17, 1978, provided that Norris \u201cwill furnish all materials and labor . . . and fully construct and in a good substantial, thorough and workmanlike manner perform and in every respect complete all the roofing and sheetmetal work, Sections 7A &amp; 7B on [Fox\u2019s project] . . . according to the plans and specifications\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Section 7A of the architect\u2019s specifications, entitled \u201cRoofing\u201d, required Norris to \u201c[i]nstall all vent flashing, and roof vents.\u201d Under Section 7B, entitled \u201cSheet Metal Work\u201d, Norris agreed to \u201c[p]rovide all sheet metal work including, but not limited to . . . [m]etal flashing, counter flashing, edge strips, cap flashing, crickets, chimney caps and cleats . . . [d]ownspouts, gutters and concrete splashblocks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">A. <em>The Verdict for Norris</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The parol-evidence issue raised by Fox\u2019s first assignment of error is addressed to the judgment confirming the verdict awarded Norris. Over Fox\u2019s objection that extrinsic evidence was not admissible to vary the written contract, Earl E. Norris, the plaintiffs president, was permitted to testify that, prior to execution of the written contract, the parties had reached an oral agreement. Mr. Norris testified that the oral agreement pertained to supply and installation of roofing materials and flashing and that guttering was not included. He acknowledged, however, that he had \u201cmet with Mr. Fox\u2019s take-up man . . . and we went over the plans and specifications\u201d and that he had read the written contract before he signed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Called by Norris as an adverse witness, A. M. Fox, Jr., the defendant\u2019s president, was questioned about the negotiations leading to execution of the contract. Asked if he and Mr. Norris had discussed \u201cthe cost of doing just the roofing, not the guttering or sheet metal work\u201d, Mr. Fox replied, \u201cWe discussed the whole job because it had to go to one subcontractor.\u201d According to Mr. Fox, it was agreed that Norris \u201cwas going to do all the work that was required in Section 7A and 7B of the specifications\u201d. Mr. Fox had made handwritten notes of his telephone conversation with Mr. Norris, and Norris offered a copy as plaintiffs exhibit. The notes indicated that the contract price was based on \u201c425 squares at $90 per square\u201d. Counsel for Norris, observing that cost estimates for guttering are calculated by the lineal foot rather than by the square, enquired if Mr. Fox was \u201ctalking to Mr. Norris about $90 a square, which would include guttering\u201d, and Mr. Fox replied, \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d Mr. Fox testified that he told Mr. Norris that the contract price was too high and that \u201che gave me a rough breakdown of it.\u201d As reflected in the notes, the \u201cbreakdown\u201d included an item for \u201cgutters\u201d. Mr. Fox conceded that \u201c[w]e didn\u2019t discuss chimney caps and vents\u201d. He explained that \u201c[i]t was assumed by everyone that it was part of the fireplace . . . contract\u201d but, \u201c[a]s it turned out, it was not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">After the roofing and flashing had been installed, Mr. Norris told Mr. Fox that he \u201chad not received the contract on the guttering\u201d. Insisting that guttering was included in the August 17, 1978 contract, Mr. Fox told Mr. Norris, \u201cGo ahead and do it and we\u2019ll get it straight.\u201d Norris installed the gutters and submitted a bill for $3,800.00 which Fox refused to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">One of the instructions to the jury included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">[Wjhere due to the mutual mistake of both parties the language used in a written contract is broader in its meaning than was in fact intended by the parties . . . oral evidence may be received to narrow and restrict the meaning of the language used so that it will accord with the actual meaning of the parties, provided that the evidence of the mistake is clear and convincing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Fox does not challenge the accuracy of this language as a definition of the mutual-mistake exception to the parol evidence rule. Rather, Fox contends that the evidence concerning oral negotia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>tions, even if admissible for the limited purpose of resolving Norris\u2019s claim of mutual mistake, fails to support the claim. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The pre-trial stipulation concerning Norris\u2019s $5,685.00 claim included charges for chimney caps and vents. In light of Mr. Fox\u2019s testimony below, the only damage item sought by Norris which is fairly disputed on appeal is the cost of guttering.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Guttering was expressly included in the specifications incorporated in the subcontract agreement. Although we assume that Mr. Norris honestly thought it was not included, Mr. Fox thought otherwise. To Mr. Fox, inclusion of guttering was not a mistake, but was a written memorial of one of the constituent items of the lump-sum \u201cbreakdown\u201d identified by Mr. Norris in the telephone conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">But, to satisfy the mutual-mistake exception, the mistake must be one common to both contracting parties. \u201cParol evidence is never competent to show merely what one of the parties to a contract thought.\u201d <em>Title Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>158 Va. 713, 718, 164 S.E. 387, 389 (1932); <em>see also Foreman </em>v. <em>Clement, </em>139 Va. 70, 80-81, 123 S.E. 336, 339 (1924). We hold, therefore, that any mistake with respect to guttering was unilateral and that the trial court erred in admitting parol evidence to contradict Norris\u2019s written commitment. Because the jury\u2019s verdict awarding Norris $7,181.00 was based, in part, upon the mutual-mistake instruction, we will reduce the judgment by $3,800.00 (the extra charge for guttering) and enter a modified judgment for Norris in the sum of $3,381.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">B. <em>The Verdict for Fox</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">The mitigation-of-damages issue raised by the second assignment of error is addressed to the judgment confirming the verdict awarded Fox on its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">Fox\u2019s architect testified that Norris had installed the metal flashing improperly. His drawings pictured the flashing turned up eight inches. Norris turned it up no more than two inches and bent the metal by hand, leaving the corners rounded. As a result, rain and snow leaked into the buildings. Mr. Fox testified that Mr. Norris agreed to correct the defect but never did. Fox had the problem repaired by others at a cost, documented by paid invoices, of $2,757.81, the total mentioned in the pre-trial stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Norris offered no evidence to contradict the expense Fox incurred. Instead, Norris maintained that much of the expense could have been avoided. Mr. Norris testified that Bud Mitchell, Fox\u2019s job supervisor, had asked him if the flashing was \u201cturned up high enough\u201d and that he had told him that \u201cthis is normal, it\u2019s the standard way of doing that.\u201d According to Mr. Norris, this conversation had occurred when only \u201ctwo or three\u201d of the 20 units had been flashed and, after that, \u201c[n]o more was said about it.\u201d The expense entailed would have been much less, he said, if Fox had instructed him to correct the defect before the flashing was covered with \u201csiding\u201d by other workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Borrowing language from <em>Hannan </em>v. <em>Dusch, </em>154 Va. 356, 377, 153 S.E. 824, 831 (1930), Norris asked the trial court to instruct the jury that a party claiming damages for breach of contract has a duty to use ordinary care to mitigate damages resulting from the breach. The court particularized the rule in the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-5\">If you believe from the evidence that [Fox], through its agents, knew or should have known that [Norris] had turned the flashing up only 1 <em>xk </em>inches instead of 8 inches, and if you further believe that any of the damage allegedly resulting from the failure to turn the flashing up 8 inches could have been avoided had [Fox] or its agents used ordinary care to cause the flashing to be corrected before causing the buildings to be completed, and if you believe that [Fox] did not use ordinary care to bring about such corrections, then you may find for [Fox] on its counter-claim only in such amount as you believe from the evidence to have been the actual cost of correcting the flashing at the time the defect was or should have been discovered by [Fox].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">In paraphrase, this instruction told the jury that, if Fox, through its agent Mitchell, \u201cknew or should have known\u201d that Norris had not complied with the flashing specifications, Fox had a duty to \u201ccause the flashing to be corrected before causing the buildings to be completed\u201d and that Fox should bear any loss flowing from its violation of such duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">We believe the instruction misstated the predicate for Fox\u2019s duty under the facts of this case. Fox\u2019s agent, Mitchell, questioned the sufficiency of the flashing. But, absent evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>that Mitchell knew or should have known that Norris\u2019s failure to turn the metal up higher would result in damage, Fox had no duty to mitigate. There was no such evidence. Indeed, Mr. Norris assured Mitchell that his workmanship was \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cthe standard way of doing that\u201d and, thus, led him to believe there was no damage to mitigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">Norris had the burden of proving that Fox had a duty to mitigate damages and that he violated that duty. <em>Foreman </em>v. <em>Caligari, Inc., </em>204 Va. 284, 290, 130 S.E.2d 447, 451 (1963). Norris did not carry its burden, the instruction constituted prejudicial error, and we will modify the verdict awarded Fox on its counterclaim. Since Fox\u2019s evidence of liquidated damages was documented and uncontroverted, we will enter final judgment for Fox in the sum of $2,757.81.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\n<em>Modified and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
