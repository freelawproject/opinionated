Bernardini, the claimant, had been employed for about three years by Kraft Dairy Group, Inc., in a plant manufacturing ice cream. In April 1983, she was assigned to new duties which involved removing from a production line cellophane-wrapped bundles of four half-gallon containers of ice cream and stacking them on a wooden pallet. When 360 half-gallons were stacked on a pallet, the claimant covered the stack with a towel or piece of cardboard. She then, with the help of her foreman, lifted an empty wooden pallet, weighing 75 to 100 pounds, placed it on top of the completed stack, and began a second stack above the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">On June 6, 1983, after the claimant had filled \u201ceighteen to twenty\u201d pallets with over six thousand half-gallon containers of ice cream, while putting a towel on \u201ctop of the second layer,\u201d she experienced \u201ca strong pull pain\u201d in her left arm. She described the pain to her foreman, who was helping her put the towel in place, and told him that she \u201cneeded to see a doctor.\u201d She continued to work on June 6, and worked thereafter on June 7, 8, and 9. On June 10, she consulted a physician of her own choice, Dr. Michael J. Decker. He reported that the claimant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>was in good health until she developed shoulder pain while working Monday [June 6] at the Sealtest Ice Cream factory where she loads pallets with \u201ctubes\u201d of ice cream. Each tube contains 3 half-gallons of ice cream and the patient has to lift as many as 3 of these at a time in a very rapid manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Dr. Decker\u2019s diagnosis was \u201cstrain of the left shoulder and arm.\u201d He later reported, \u201cI think we are dealing with a chronic musculoligamentous strain.\u201d He also opined, \u201c[Wjithout a doubt, her heavy lifting at work caused the problems in her shoulder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The claimant returned to work on June 20, 1983, but was unable to work the full day due to the pain in her arm and shoulder. On Dr. Decker\u2019s advice, she remained away from work thereafter because no light-duty work was available for her. In September, she was examined by Dr. Herman N. Nachman, an orthopedic surgeon. Dr. Nachman reported: \u201cIt is my impression, based upon history, physical examination and x-ray studies that Miss Bernardini sustained a strain of the muscles of the left upper and forearm areas as a result of repetitive heavy lifting that she described occurring June 6, 1983.\u201d He recommended that she return to work, but restrict her lifting to 20 pound loads for at least two weeks. He said, \u201c[S]he may then resume working without restriction of weight lifting, but I think that the physical capability of this young lady must be taken into account in her job assignment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The employer defended the claim on the grounds that no industrial accident had been shown and that the claimant had given defective notice. Deputy Commissioner Yates, after a full hearing, held that the claimant had failed to carry her burden of proving the occurrence of an industrial accident. On review, the full commission, Chairman James dissenting, reversed the deputy commissioner\u2019s order, found that an industrial accident had been proved, and held that sufficient notice had been given to the employer. Because we agree with the views expressed in the deputy commissioner\u2019s opinion and in the dissenting opinion with respect to the absence of proof of an industrial accident, it is unnecessary to discuss the adequacy of notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The case is controlled by our recent decision in <em>The Lane Company, Inc. </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>229 Va. 196, 326 S.E.2d 702 (1985) where, reaffirming our prior holdings, we said, \u201cin order to show that he has suffered an \u2018injury by accident\u2019 arising out of ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>exertion, a claimant must prove an \u2018identifiable incident that occurs at some reasonably definite time,\u2019 which is the cause of \u2018an obvious sudden mechanical or structural change in the body\u2019.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199, 326 S.E.2d at 703 (citations omitted). In <em>City of Norfolk </em>v. Lassiter, 228 Va. 603, 324 S.E.2d 656 (1985), we held that an employer was justified in defending a claim where the claimant had given \u201cno account of any accident or sudden precipitating event on the job which might have caused his injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605, 324 S.E.2d at 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Here, Miss Bernardini was engaged in doing the normal, repetitive work required by her assigned duties. She had been performing these duties for several months without injury, although Dr. Nachman\u2019s report implied that the heavy lifting required of her might have exceeded her physical capabilities. Both physicians who examined her concluded that her injury was caused by the repetitive heavy lifting she did at work. She was, in other words, injured by the cumulative trauma caused by the physical exertions inherent in her normal work. Although she first reported a \u201cstrong pull pain\u201d in her arm on June 6, 1983, she could point to no accident, identifiable incident, or sudden precipitating event on that day, or on any other day, to which her injury could be attributed. At the time she reported her pain to her foreman, she was engaged in nothing more strenuous than arranging a towel over a stack of ice cream containers.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Under the well-settled law in Virginia, an injury resulting from the cumulative trauma caused by the physical exertions inherent in an employee\u2019s normal work is not an \u201cinjury by accident,\u201d compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. As we pointed out in <em>Lane, </em>any marked change from this settled rule involves policy determinations that \u201care peculiarly within the province of the General Assembly.\u201d <em>Lane, </em>229 Va. at 703, 326 S.E.2d at 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Although the claimant in <em>Lane </em>was similarly unable to prove an \u201caccident, identifiable incident, or sudden precipitating event\u201d which caused his injury, he did at least sustain a disc herniation, which, if its onset could have been shown to be sudden, rather than gradual or cumulative, might have qualified as an \u201cobvious sudden mechanical or structural change in the body.\u201d Here, Miss Bernardini was found to have a \u201cstrain,\u201d later characterized as a \u201cchronic musculoligamentous strain,\u201d resulting from repetitive heavy lifting. This condition falls short of the \u201cobvious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>sudden mechanical or structural change in the body\u201d which is prerequisite to a finding of an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d compensable under the Act. <em>VEPCO </em>v. <em>Cogbill, </em>223 Va. 354, 288 S.E.2d 485 (1982); <em>Badische Corp. </em>v. <em>Starks, </em>221 Va. 910, 275 S.E.2d 605 (1981); <em>Virginia Electric, Etc., Co. </em>v. <em>Quann, </em>197 Va. 9, 87 S.E.2d 624 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we will reverse the order of the Industrial Commission, vacate the award, and dismiss the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
