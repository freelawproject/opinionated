The condominium involved is Fairlington Villages, consisting of 1,703 units, located partly in the City of Alexandria and partly in the County of Arlington.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-14\">On June 22, 1979, the Unit Owners Association of Fairlington Villages and Andrea S. Minniear, the owner of a condominium unit (collectively, the Association), filed a bill of complaint in the Circuit Court of the City of Alexandria against CBI Fairmac Corporation (Fairmac), the developer of the condominium project. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Count I of the bill alleged that in the sale of condominium units, Fairmac had violated the \u201cfull and accurate disclosure\u201d requirement of Code \u00a7 55-79.90<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by representing to prospective purchasers that a 3.3-acre parcel of land, which appeared to be included in the condominium project, would be improved as a park for use of unit owners when in fact the parcel was not part of the condominium project, was zoned for commercial use, and was intended by Fairmac to be sold for commercial development.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Count II of the bill of complaint alleged that commercial use of the disputed parcel would violate restrictive covenants to which the parcel was subject. With respect to both counts, the bill prayed for a declaratory judgment, a permanent injunction, and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">In petitions filed on August 1 and 22, 1979, David J. Frantz and 26 other owners of condominium units (the intervenors) sought leave to intervene as complainants in the suit. The intervenors alleged that they owned units \u201clocated either directly across from or in close proximity to\u201d the disputed parcel, that they were not \u201cadequately represented by the parties before the Court,\u201d and that \u201ctheir rights [would] be prejudiced\u201d unless they were allowed to intervene. Over Fairmac\u2019s objection, the trial court on August 22, 1979, granted the petitions to intervene and gave the intervenors leave to \u201cassert such claims as they may have against [Fairmac].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Nothing of substance occurred in the suit until September 29, 1980, when the Association moved to dismiss its bill of complaint with prejudice because it had reached a settlement with Fairmac. On October 6, 1980, the trial court entered an order reciting that the Association and Fairmac \u201cand only these parties have settled between themselves the matters raised in this action\u201d and directing that the claims of the Association be dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">On February 18, 1981, Fairmac moved the trial court to reconsider its order of August 22, 1979, which permitted the 27 unit owners to intervene. In the alternative, Fairmac asked the court to dismiss the suit as to all parties on the ground that the intervenors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>were bound by the Association\u2019s settlement with Fairmac and had no independent status to raise the claims asserted in the bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">In a letter opinion dated June 4, 1981, the trial court held that the intervenors were bound by the Association\u2019s settlement with Fairmac and, therefore, were not entitled to relief under Count I of the bill of complaint, which related to Fairmac\u2019s alleged failure to make a full and accurate disclosure. The court held further, however, that the intervenors had standing to question a violation of restrictive covenants, as alleged in Count II of the bill. In an order incorporating its holdings, the court dismissed Count I and retained Count II on the docket for further action. The order stated that the dismissal of Count I was \u201cwithout prejudice to the right of the intervenors to maintain an action or actions for fraud and misrepresentation, if they be so advised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">On October 28, 1981, the intervenors moved to amend Count I to allege the existence of an \u201cEasement by Estoppel\u201d in their favor \u201cacross\u201d the disputed parcel and to add a new count to allege a \u201cCommon Law Dedication\u201d of the parcel \u201cto public use as a park and community center.\u201d On November 18, 1981, the trial court denied the motion to amend, stating that \u201cthe proposed amendments are simply attempts to reassert claims disposed of by [the] prior ruling dismissing Count I.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">In a \u201cFinal Decree\u201d entered February 24, 1982, the trial court dismissed Count II, relating to the alleged violation of restrictive covenants, and ordered the case removed from the docket. The intervenors have appealed, assigning error only to the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Count I and its refusal to permit amendments to the bill of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The record shows that the parcel in dispute is located across South 31st Street from the condominium in the Arlington County portion of the project. The parcel had been zoned for limited commercial use long before the condominium was developed. Several buildings located on the east end of the parcel were used during development for sales, maintenance, and related activities while the remainder was used as a storage yard for contractors\u2019 equipment. The parcel was shown as a \u201cPark\u201d on a plat attached to the public offering statement published by Fairmac in connection with the sale of condominium units. After development of the project, the parcel was cleared of construction debris, improved with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>planting of grass and shrubbery, and used as a park by residents of the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Under the terms of the settlement which resulted in the dismissal of Count I of the bill of complaint, Fairmac agreed to pay the Association $275,000 in cash, to grant the Association a scenic and use easement over a strip of land fronting 230 feet on South 31st Street, constituting approximately the middle one-third of the disputed parcel, to pay any real estate taxes on the strip, and to maintain the strip as an unimproved park area for the use of unit owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Fairmac also agreed in the settlement to place restrictive covenants on the remainder of the disputed parcel, prescribing permitted uses and architectural styles, and to give the Association first refusal with respect to the sale of all but one portion of the parcel. In return, the Association agreed to dismiss with prejudice the bill of complaint it brought against Fairmac and to release Fairmac from all pending claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The record shows further that Fairmac executed and delivered deeds granting the scenic and use easement across the middle portion of the disputed parcel and subjecting the remainder of the land to the agreed upon restrictive covenants. Fairmac represents on brief that it also paid the $275,000 sum stipulated in the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">In ruling that the intervenors were bound by the Association\u2019s settlement with Fairmac, the trial court based its decision on Code \u00a7 55-79.80, part of the Virginia Condominium Act. Paragraph (b) of the Code section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">Except to the extent prohibited by the condominium instruments, and subject to any restrictions and limitations specified therein, the executive organ of the unit owners\u2019 association, if any, and if not, then <em>the unit owners\u2019 association itself, shall have the irrevocable power as attorney-in-fact on behalf of all the unit owners </em>and their successors in title <em>to </em>grant easements through the common elements and <em>accept easements benefiting the condominium or any portion thereof</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">(Emphasis added.) This Code section, the trial court wrote, \u201cclearly . . . authorized [the Association] to accept the easement and deed pursuant to the settlement agreement,\u201d thus disentitling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>the intervenors \u201cto the relief prayed for in Count I of the Bill of Complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">The intervenors concede that in a condominium, a unit owner possesses certain rights of a collective nature which he holds in common with other unit owners and which are subject to the control of the unit owners\u2019 association.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition to these collective rights, however, the intervenors say, a unit owner possesses certain other, separate, and individual rights which are his, and his alone, to assert, free from control of the unit owners\u2019 association.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Among these other rights, the intervenors maintain, is the right to receive from the condominium developer full, fair, and accurate disclosure of the true nature of the condominium, as required by Code \u00a7 55-79.90. This is the right Fairmac violated in the present case, submit the intervenors, and the violation constitutes a cause of action only they, and not the Association, could assert and compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">We disagree with the intervenors. We believe that the right sought to be asserted in the bill of complaint was not of the individual nature the intervenors ascribe to it. While the disputed parcel did not constitute a common element of the condominium, as that term is used in the Condominium Act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the right claimed in the parcel, once established, would have been held in common by all the unit owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Having this collective character and stemming from the Condominium Act, the right claimed in the disputed parcel was one the Association had the authority to assert. This authority is derived from several statutory sources which delineate the functions of a unit owners\u2019 association. Code \u00a7 55-79.73(a) states that the by-laws of a condominium shall provide for \u201cthe self-government of the condominium by an association of all the unit owners.\u201d Code \u00a7 55-79.79 provides that \u201call powers and responsibilities, including financial responsibility, with regard to maintenance, repair, renovation, restoration, and replacement of the condominium shall belong ... to the unit owners\u2019 association in the case of the common elements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Further, Code \u00a7 55-79.80, in addition to conferring power, as previously noted, to grant and accept easements, authorizes a unit owners\u2019 association to make improvements on common elements and to acquire, hold, convey, and encumber title to real property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And Code \u00a7 55-79.53 contains these important provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\">The declarant, every unit owner, and all those entitled to occupy a unit shall comply with all lawful provisions of [the Condominium Act] and all provisions of the condominium instruments. <em>Any lack of such compliance shall be grounds for an action or suit to recover sums due, for damages or injunctive relief, or for any other remedy available at law or in equity, maintainable by the unit owners\u2019 association, </em>or by its executive organ or any managing agent on behalf of such association, or, in any proper case, by one or more aggrieved unit owners on their own behalf or as a class action. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">But, the intervenors insist, the foregoing Code section \u201cspecifically authorizes aggrieved unit owners to maintain actions on their own behalf for lack of compliance with the Virginia Condominium Act in \u2018any proper case.\u2019 \u201d The intervenors ask, \u201cWhat more proper case could there be than this one?\u201d The intervenors then answer their own question by saying that they were entitled to full and accurate disclosure of \u201call the material facts and circumstances pertaining to the condominium,\u201d that Fairmac failed to make this disclosure in violation of the Condominium Act, that they own units \u201cin close proximity to [Fairmac\u2019s] adjacent commercially zoned tract,\u201d and that they will \u201cmost directly bear the impact of commercial development.\u201d Hence, the intervenors conclude, they are \u201cthe real parties in interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">We believe, however, that the phrase, \u201cin any proper case,\u201d limits, rather than expands, the instances in which actions or suits are maintainable by unit owners pursuant to the authority of Code \u00a7 55-79.53. Hence, while a unit owner may assert a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>under the provisions of the Condominium Act for the violation of some individual right,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 55-79.53 contemplates that a violation of a right held in common by all unit owners shall be maintained by a unit owners\u2019 association, unless the association fails or refuses to assert the common right.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">We believe also that because a unit owners\u2019 association has the authority under Code \u00a7 55-79.53 to assert a claim for the violation of a common right, it necessarily has the authority to compromise the claim. Furthermore, in the present case, Code \u00a7 55-79.80, upon which the trial court based its decision, provides additional authority for an association\u2019s compromise of a claim involving a violation of a common right. Under that Code section, a unit owners\u2019 association has \u201cthe irrevocable power as attorney-in-fact on behalf of all the unit owners . . . to . . . accept easements benefiting the condominium or any portion thereof.\u201d Necessarily implied from this language is the authority of a unit owners\u2019 association, in accepting easements from others, to make reasonable concessions and to surrender doubtful claims by way of compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">We believe further that the intervenors are bound by the compromise reached between the Association and Fairmac. As noted, the compromise involved a claim for the violation of a common, rather than an individual, right. The compromise was reached by the Association in a representative capacity on behalf of all the unit owners pursuant to its express and implied authority. And, so far as the record reveals, the transaction was free of fraud or collusion; indeed, the intervenors do not even contend there was any overreaching or unfairness involved in the Association\u2019s settlement with Fairmac.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">We conclude with a quotation from a case cited in Fairmac\u2019s brief. Although the quotation concerns the common elements of a condominium, it is relevant here because it expresses the compelling reason for collective action through a unit owners\u2019 association in the enforcement of any common right:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">Realistic and practical application of the statutory scheme requires that the language used in and pursuant to the statute be liberally construed to include [as part of the authority of a unit owners\u2019 association] the assertion and settlement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>claims on behalf of unit owners against the developer with respect to common elements. To deprive the association of the right to act on behalf of all unit owners in such matters would leave the responsibility for and authority over the common elements fragmented and thus make vindication of the common rights highly uncertain, difficult and burdensome.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><em>Siller </em>v. <em>Hartz Mountain Associates, </em>184 N.J. Super. 450, 455, 446 A.2d 551, 554 (1981), <em>aff'd, </em>184 N.J. Super. 442, 446 A.2d 547 (1982), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>93 N.J. 370, 461 A.2d 568 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Because we hold the trial court did not err in ruling that the Association had authority to assert and compromise the claim set forth in the bill of complaint and in ruling that the intervenors were bound by the compromise, we need not consider the intervenors\u2019 further contention that the court erred in refusing them permission to amend the bill. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-8\"> Code \u00a7 55-79.90 is part of the Virginia Condominium Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 55-79.39 to -79.103; \u00a7 55-79.90 provides in part that \u201c[a] public offering statement [for the sale of condominium units] shall disclose fully and accurately the characteristics of the condominium and the units therein offered and shall make known to prospective purchasers all unusual and material circumstances or features affecting the condominium.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\"> The intervenors concede, for example, that a unit owners\u2019 association may \u201cassert, defend and settle those claims related to the common element[s].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b469-9\"> Code \u00a7 55-79.41 defines the term \u201ccommon elements,\u201d to mean \u201call portions of the condominium other than the units.\u201d In this case, the disputed parcel was not a portion of the condominium.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\"> A new paragraph of Code \u00a7 55-79.80 became effective after the trial court rendered its decision in the present case.
