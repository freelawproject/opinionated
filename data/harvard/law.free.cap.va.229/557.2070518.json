Conlin, an employee of Ford Motor Company (Ford), sued Turner\u2019s Express, Inc., and others<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> (collectively, Turner\u2019s Express) to recover damages for personal injuries which she alleged were caused by Turner\u2019s Express\u2019 negligence. Turner\u2019s Express defended on the ground that Conlin\u2019s exclusive remedy was against her employer, Ford, under the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Code \u00a7 65.1-1, <em>et seq. </em>The trial court agreed and entered judgment for Turner\u2019s Express. Thus, the sole question presented in this appeal is whether Turner\u2019s Express was engaged in the trade, business, or occupation of Ford at the time Conlin was injured or whether it was an \u201cother party\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 65.1-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">The facts were stipulated. Conlin was employed by Ford at its Norfolk plant. She was injured while operating a forklift used to load Ford machinery and parts onto Turner\u2019s Express\u2019 trailer. While the forklift was on the trailer\u2019s floor, the floor collapsed, which caused the forklift and Conlin to fall. Conlin received workers\u2019 compensation from Ford.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">Ford contracted with Turner\u2019s Express to haul Ford\u2019s machinery and parts between its plants. This particular cargo was to be transported to Ford\u2019s plant at Mawhwah, New Jersey. Under their agreement, Ford was obligated to load the cargo and to unload it at its destination. Turner\u2019s Express is a public motor carrier which operates under an Interstate Commerce Commission permit. Ford occasionally engaged other motor carriers for this service.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">When an employee and his employer accept the provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the rights and remedies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>granted thereby \u201cshall exclude all other rights and remedies\u201d of the employee to recover for an injury received during the course of his employment. Code \u00a7 65.1-40. If, however, the employee\u2019s injury is caused by the negligent act of a party who is a stranger to the trade, occupation, or business of his employer, the employee may maintain an action at law against the \u201cother party.\u201d <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Dean Steel Erection Co., 229 </em>Va. 164, 167, 327 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1985); <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Bass Constr. Co., </em>223 Va. 363, 365, 288 S.E.2d 489, 490 (1982). Whether a third party is engaged in the trade, occupation, or business of the employer \u201cdepends upon the facts and circumstances in each case, and for that reason the question does not readily yield to categorical or absolute standards.\u201d <em>Bassett Furniture </em>v. <em>McReynolds, </em>216 Va. 897, 902, 224 S.E.2d 323, 326 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">The present case is factually similar to <em>Floyd, Administratrix </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>203 Va. 269, 123 S.E.2d 369 (1962). Floyd was killed in an industrial accident, and his employer, Glamorgan Pipe and Foundry Company, paid workers\u2019 compensation to his personal representative. Glamorgan manufactured pipe and sold and shipped it to its customers. R. S. Powell, Inc., was a contract motor carrier engaged by Glamorgan to transport pipe from Glamorgan\u2019s plant to its customers. Floyd\u2019s job consisted of loading pipe on Powell\u2019s trailers. As Powell\u2019s driver was backing a trailer to position it for loading, the trailer struck and killed Floyd. Floyd\u2019s representative sued Powell and its driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">We affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the action and ruled that the representative\u2019s exclusive remedy was under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. 203 Va. at 273-74, 123 S.E.2d at 372. We held that if an independent contractor is performing work that is part of the trade, business, or occupation of the employer, the contractor is not an \u201cother party\u201d against whom an action will lie. <em>Id. </em>at 274, 123 S.E.2d at 372. We reasoned that \u201cGlamorgan\u2019s trade, business or occupation was manufacturing pipe and selling and shipping it to its customers. Transporting the pipe to the customers was a necessary element of this business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273, 123 S.E.2d at 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Similarly, in the present case, transporting machinery and parts from one plant to another was an essential element of Ford\u2019s business. Therefore, because Turner\u2019s Express was engaged in Ford\u2019s trade, business, or occupation, Turner\u2019s Express was not an \u201cother party\u201d whom Conlin could sue.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>There is but one factual distinction between <em>Floyd </em>and the present case. In <em>Floyd, </em>Powell\u2019s employee assisted the manufacturer in loading the pipe. In the present case, however, Turner\u2019s Express\u2019 driver did not assist in the loading operation. We do not believe this distinction is relevant to a determination whether Turner\u2019s Express was engaged in Ford\u2019s trade, business, or occupation. Thus, the distinction makes no difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Conlin relies primarily upon <em>Hipp </em>v. <em>Sadler Materials Corp., </em>211 Va. 710, 180 S.E.2d 501 (1971), and <em>Burroughs </em>v. <em>Walmont, </em>210 Va. 98, 168 S.E.2d 107 (1969), to support her position that Turner\u2019s Express was an \u201cother party\u201d under the statute. Her reliance is misplaced. In <em>Hipp, </em>a materialman was delivering his products to a building contractor when the builder\u2019s employee was injured. The employee sued the materialman. 211 Va. at 710, 180 S.E.2d at 501. In <em>Burroughs, </em>there was a similar delivery, and the materialman\u2019s injured employee sued the building contractor. 210 Va. at 99, 168 S.E.2d at 108. We held in both cases that one who merely delivers his materials is not engaged in the trade, business, or occupation of a builder and, therefore, is an \u201cother party\u201d subject to suit. 210 Va. at 100, 168 S.E.2d at 108-09; 211 Va. at 711, 180 S.E.2d at 502.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">In the present case, however, Turner\u2019s Express was not merely delivering merchandise to a job site but was transporting cargo between Ford\u2019s assembly plants, an essential part of Ford\u2019s business. Therefore, Turner\u2019s Express was not an \u201cother party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Thus, we hold that Conlin\u2019s claim against Turner\u2019s Express is barred by Code \u00a7 65.1-40. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b578-12\"> The other defendants were Kim Leasing Company, Inc. (Kim) and Paul Drummond. Drummond operated the tractor-trailer involved in the accident. Turner\u2019s Express owned the tractor; Kim owned the trailer which it leased to Turner\u2019s Express.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
