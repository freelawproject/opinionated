Baker, sustained a back injury on July 25, 1980, while employed by Daniel Construction Company as an electrician. The claimant was paid compensation for temporary total disability through June 11, 1982. Effective on that date, compensation was terminated upon the Industrial Commission\u2019s finding that the claimant was able to return to his regular employment; however, he has never returned to his pre-injury duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">On June 8, 1983, the claimant filed an application for reinstatement of compensation for temporary total disability, based upon a change in condition. At the time, there was pending before the Commission a request by the claimant that Dr. Benjamin Rezba, an orthopedist, be designated as the treating physician in place of another doctor designated previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">Finding that the claimant had failed to prove he was \u201cagain disabled for his pre-injury work,\u201d the Commission denied his application for reinstatement of compensation. The Commission did grant, however, the claimant\u2019s request that Dr. Rezba be designated as the treating physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-14\">Further, noting Dr. Rezba had reported that \u201cpsychological considerations play a part in the claimant\u2019s symptomology,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Commission ordered the employer to make available to the claimant a panel of three psychiatrists for the claimant\u2019s selection of a doctor to provide \u201ca specific answer ... to the question . . . whether the claimant is prevented from return to his pre-injury employment ... as a result of psychological disability caused by his industrial accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">The employer has appealed from the ruling relating to the designation of Dr. Rezba as the treating physician and from the order concerning the panel of psychiatrists. The employee has not appealed the denial of his application for reinstatement of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The record shows that following the claimant\u2019s injury, he was treated by Dr. James B. Troup, an orthopedist apparently selected by the claimant but later designated by the Commission as the treating physician. While the claimant was still under Dr. Troup\u2019s care, the employer requested an examination by Dr. Stephen M. Levin, another orthopedist. Following this examination, Dr. Troup suggested that the claimant be referred to Dr. Levin for treatment, and the employer approved this referral.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">After a course of treatment, Dr. Levin reported on August 31, 1982, that the claimant was able to return to his regular work duties. The claimant then on his own saw Dr. Rezba on September 2, 1982. Dr Rezba reported that the claimant was \u201cstill disabled\u201d as a result of his industrial accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">On September 28, 1982, the Commission directed the claimant to \u201creport back to Dr. Troup for treatment [or] further referral.\u201d Doctor Troup saw the claimant on December 22, 1982, and on December 27 reported that he could not \u201cfind anything here to specifically treat\u201d and that he did not believe he could help the claimant. Doctor Troup stated he was aware that the claimant had seen Dr. Rezba and that Dr. Rezba felt he could \u201cdo something to help this patient.\u201d Doctor Troup concluded by saying he would \u201csuggest that arrangements be made for the patient to be treated by Dr. Rezba.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Upon receipt of this report, the employer wrote the claimant\u2019s counsel, stating that \u201c[i]nasmuch as Dr. Troup does not wish to continue treating [the claimant], the employer ... is offering [the claimant] a panel of three (3) physicians to choose from for treatment.\u201d The panel did not include the name of Dr. Rezba. The claimant\u2019s counsel responded with a request to the Commission that it designate Dr. Rezba as the treating physician. As pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>viously noted, the Commission granted the request, and it is this action which is the subject of the employer\u2019s first assignment of error in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">The employer does not contend that the claimant is not entitled to the services of a treating physician furnished at the employer\u2019s expense. Rather, the employer argues that because Dr. Troup, the previously designated treating physician, did not make \u201ca medical referral\u201d of the claimant to Dr. Rezba, the Commission should not have designated Dr. Rezba but should have required the claimant to select a new treating physician from the three-doctor panel offered by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">We do not agree with the employer. Under Code \u00a7 65.1-88, an employer is required to furnish an injured employee \u201ca physician chosen by the injured employee from a panel of at least three physicians selected by the employer and . . . other necessary medical attention.\u201d The Code section provides that the \u201cunjustified refusal of the employee to accept such medical service . . . shall bar the employee from further compensation until such refusal ceases and no compensation shall at any time be paid for the period of suspension unless, in the opinion of the Industrial Commission, the circumstances justified the refusal.\u201d The Code section also provides that \u201c[i]n any such case the Industrial Commission may order a change in the medical . . . service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">We applied Code \u00a7 65.1-88 in <em>Peninsula Trans. Dist. Comm. </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>228 Va. 614, 324 S.E.2d 662 (1985), a case cited by the present employer. There, we reversed an award of compensation because of the employee\u2019s refusal to choose a physician from a panel. But the facts of the two cases differ materially. In <em>Peninsula, </em>the employer offered the employee a three-doctor panel only two days after the industrial accident and before the employee had received treatment from any physician. Here, the employer did not offer the employee a panel until almost two and one-half years after the industrial accident and after the claimant had been treated by a number of doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Furthermore, in this case, contrary to the employer\u2019s assertion, the Commission specifically found that \u201cDr. Troup referred the claimant to Dr. Rezba,\u201d and this finding is supported by evidence. In his notes of the claimant\u2019s December 22, 1982 office visit, Dr. Troup wrote that \u201c[Dr. Rezba] feels he can help the patient\u201d and that \u201cDr. Rezba ought to be given a chance to follow the patient.\u201d In his December 27, 1982 report, Dr Troup stated that Dr. Rezba <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>\u201cfeels he can do something to help this patient\u201d and that he, Dr. Troup, \u201cwould, therefore, suggest that arrangements be made for the patient to be treated by Dr. Rezba.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Whether Dr. Rezba should have been designated as the claimant\u2019s treating physician was a matter within the discretion of the Commission. Under the circumstances of this case, we cannot say that the Commission abused its discretion. Hence, we will not disturb the Commission\u2019s action with respect to Dr. Rezba.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The employer also assigns error to the Commission\u2019s action in requiring the employer to designate a panel of three psychiatrists, one of whom the claimant would select to decide whether he was suffering from a \u201cpsychological disability caused by his industrial accident.\u201d The employer contends the Commission exceeded its authority in this respect. On the other hand, the claimant contends the Commission acted within its authority because, under Code \u00a7 65.1-88, an employer is required to furnish \u201cother necessary medical attention,\u201d and the services of a psychiatrist are included within this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">On this phase of the case, the Commission stated in its written opinion that although Dr. Rezba believed \u201cpsychological considerations play a part in the claimant\u2019s symptomology, <em>the question of causal relationship to the original industrial accident has not been answered to the satisfaction of the </em>Commission.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Having made this finding, the Commission should have ended its inquiry into the question of the claimant\u2019s alleged psychological disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The burden was upon the claimant to satisfy the Commission by a preponderance of the evidence both that he suffered from a psychological disability and that the disability was causally related to his industrial accident. <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Halco Engineering, Inc., </em>225 Va. 97, 101, 300 S.E.2d 761, 763 (1983); <em>Ins. Management Corp. </em>v. <em>Daniels, 222 </em>Va. 434, 438-39, 281 S.E.2d 847, 849 (1981). It is clear from the record that the claimant utterly failed to establish even a prima facie case of psychological disability or causal relationship. Hence, it was error for the Commission to allow the claimant the benefit of any medical services incident to his alleged psychological disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">For the reasons assigned, we will affirm the Commission\u2019s designation of Dr. Rezba as the claimant\u2019s treating physician, and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>will reverse and annul its action in requiring the employer to furnish the claimant a panel of psychiatrists.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\n<em>Affirmed in part and reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
