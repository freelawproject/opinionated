Contracts, express or implied, are not made by action of one party alone, where the other party has no \u2018 control and no authority to interfere; citing <em>Thornton v.

The plaintiffs reside \u00a1at the city of Flint, and the services were performed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>there, the notice of foreclosure being published in Lake \u2022county. After a trial in justice\u2019s court the cause was removed to the circuit court for the county of Wayne, and tried before a jury, the plaintiffs obtaining verdict and judgment. Defendant brings error.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">It appeared upon the trial that plaintiff Willison loaned money for the defendant, and. took a mortgage for her and in her name, which was foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The defendant contends here that there was no testimony given upon the trial authorizing the trial court to submit to the jury the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, for the reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">1. That the plaintiff Willison testified that he loaned the defendant\u2019s money with the distinct understanding that no charge should be made against her for any -collections.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\"><em>2. </em>That he loaned it without consulting her.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">3. That he loaned it upon inadequate security.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">4. That he had the land bid off in defendant\u2019s name by the register of deed\u00e9, and the deed recorded, without her knowledge, and sent the deed to her by mail, without consulting her.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">We think the court was not in error in submitting plaintiffs\u2019 claim to the jury. While Mr. Willison testified that there was an understanding that he was to charge the defendant nothing for loaning the money and collecting interest for her, it does not appear that the plaintiffs were to be to the expense of the foreclosure of the mortgage. They had been doing business for the defendant, loaning her money, and taking mortgages for her in her name, and the money loaned, to secure which this mortgage was given, came from prior loans; and the plaintiff Willison testified that it had been their custom, when money came, to them from prior loans, to reinvest it; that upon the foreclosure of this mortgage they paid the advertising, sheriff\u2019s, and register\u2019s fees, and paid an attorney <em>$25 </em>for the use of his name in the foreclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>proceedings. For these amounts plaintiffs had judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"Amdn\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b532-4\">McGrath, Grant, and Montgomery, JJ., concurred. Morse, C.
