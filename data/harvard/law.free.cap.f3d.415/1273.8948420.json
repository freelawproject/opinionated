On appeal, Baker argues that \u201ca prisoner has a first amendment int[e]rest in using his religious name, at least in conjunction with his committed name,\u201d and courts have approved the addition of a prisoner\u2019s new name. According to Baker, the district court erred by denying his motion to have his new name added to his commitment order. Baker further argues that Federal Bureau <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>of Prison (\u201cBOP\u201d) policy does not prohibit the addition of a second name to a prison record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">We review the district court\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See High v. Zant, </em>916 F.2d 1507, 1509 (11th Cir.1990). We have held that prisoners retain the right to the free exercise of religion. <em>See Hakim v. Hicks, </em>223 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir.2000). A \u201cdual-name policy,\u201d whereby an inmate is permitted to use a religious name in conjunction with his commitment name, \u201calways is sufficient to satisfy an inmate\u2019s free exercise claim involving use of a religious name.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1248. The Fourth and Sixth Circuits have held, however, that an inmate who legally changes his name does not have a constitutional right to have his pre-existing prison records altered to reflect his newly adopted name. <em>See Barrett v. Va., </em>689 F.2d 498, 503 (4th Cir.1982); <em>Imam Ali Abdullah Akbar v. Canney, </em>634 F.2d 339, 340 (6th Cir.1980). We agree with the reasoning of our sister circuits and hold that although an inmate is entitled to prospective recognition of a legal name change, by means of a \u201cdual-name policy,\u201d an inmate is not entitled to have documents that pre-dated his legal name change altered. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Baker\u2019s motion for a new commitment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
