Ogle, </em>92 Fed.Appx. 996 (5th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (unpublished). Following our judgment, Ogle filed a petition for certiorari, in which he challenged for the first time the constitutionality of the Sentencing Guidelines as applied to him. The Supreme Court granted Ogle\u2019s petition for certiorari, vacated our judgment, and remanded the case to this court for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We now reconsider the matter in light of <em>Booker </em>and decide to reinstate our previous judgment affirming Ogle\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-21\">Because Ogle did not raise any <em>Booker-related </em>challenges to his sentence until his petition for certiorari, we will not review his claim absent extraordinary circumstances. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>409 F.3d 675, 676 (5th Cir.2005). Our cases make it clear that an argument not raised in appellant\u2019s original brief as required by Fed. R.App. P. 28 is waived.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant argues that based on remarks made by the trial judge at sentencing, he can satisfy the plain-error test discussed in <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-22 (5th Cir.2005). Even if appellant can satisfy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>plain error test, he has not met the even more exacting test required to show the presence of extraordinary circumstances, which requires appellant to show a \u201cpossibility of injustice so grave as to warrant disregard of usual procedural rules.\u201d <em>McGee v. Estelle, </em>722 F.2d 1206, 1213 (5th Cir.1984) (footnote omitted). Accordingly, we decline to consider the merits of his <em>Booker </em>challenge. Having reconsidered our decision pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions, we REINSTATE OUR JUDGMENT affirming Ogle\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-12\">. <em>See Procter &amp; Gamble Co. v.
