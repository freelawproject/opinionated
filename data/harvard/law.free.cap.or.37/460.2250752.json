Burness, a resident and tax- \u2019 payer of Multnomah County, against the board of county commissioners for that county and others for a decree annulling and declaring void a contract between the county and defendant Noble. On September 19, 1898, Noble and the county judge (assuming to act for the county) entered into the following contract:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-3\">\u201cThis memorandum and agreement, made this nineteenth day of September, 1898, by and between the County of Multnomah, State of Oregon, party of the first part, and H. E. Noble, party of the second part, witnesseth : That whereas a large amount of delinquent taxes upon mortgages and other real property for the years 1887 to 1895, inclusive, still remains unpaid, and the county has been wholly unable to collect the same by ordinary means ; and whereas by reason of the lapse of time, and from other causes, it has been found, and is still deemed, impossible to find bidders for a great amount of such property if exposed for sale in the ordinary course ; and whereas the county is desirous of making an arrangement whereby the collection of said taxes may be .energetically prosecuted without loss or expense to the county. .Now, therefore, it is agreed between said county \u2022 and said H. E. Noble, that the county court shall make an order for the issuance of an alias warrant or warrants for the collection of all delinquent mortgage and real-prop.erty taxes for the years 1887,1888, 1889, 1890,1891, 1892, 1893, 1894, and 1895, and shall cause to be made out such delinquent rolls or lists as may be proper or necessary for the collection of Such taxes, the same to be corrected as hereinafter provided, and to advertise and sell, in due form, and in all respects as provided by law, the real property and mortgages upon which taxes are delinquent for the said years, or any of them, mortgage taxes to be collected from the land mortgaged, or from the mortgagee, as the court may specifically direct; that the county judge shall bid in for the County of Multnomah all property offered at such sale for which there shall be no' other bidders, and shall take certificates of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>sale to the county, in due form of law; that in consideration of the terms and conditions of this agreement, to be kept and performed by said H. E. Noble, said certificates shall be forthwith assigned, transferred, and set over by the proper officers of the county to said H. E. Noble, or to such person as may be designated, but in such case said Noble shall remain responsible for the due performance of all conditions of this contract on his part in like manner as if assignment had been made to himself, such certificates to remain in the custody of the. county judge. And the said H. E. Noble agrees to prepare at his own cost and expense, and furnish to the county, corrected lists of the various properties to be sold for said taxes, giving corrected descriptions of the real property as the same appear on the deed and- mortgage records of Multnomah County, showing \u25a0 double assessments and taxes paid, but not credited, and other errors affecting collection of such taxes, and generally furnishing such facts and details as may be necessary, supplementary to the rolls and returns now on file or of record for the taxes of such years, as shall enable the proper officers to make out complete and correct rolls of such delinquent taxes, and of the properties to be sold therefor, so far as such facts can be ascertained from, diligent and careful examination of the county records ; the county, on its part, agreeing to make use of all such data, and to take all steps and proceedings carefully and precisely in accordance with law, so far as possible. And said Noble further. agrees' to \u00fase all due and diligent effort for the- collection and enforcement of such taxes, availing himself of the means and methods followed by him in the case of taxes which he bids in for himself or others, -and particularly to seek out and obtain, as far as possible, the addresses of all persons owning or interested in anyof the properties sold,, whether resident or nonresident, and to notify.such persons of the taxes due, and seek payment from them, and generally to take all lawful means for the collection of such taxes out of the property taxed, or from the persons against whom such taxes are Charged, or their successors or assigns ; and on '.the payment of any tax or redemption of the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>sold by or for any taxpayer, or'his successors or assigns, the county shall receive out of such moneys the amount .of the tax and its actual cost lawfully expended, and all sums in excess thereof which may be lawfully collected, including penalty, interest, and redemption fees, shall be retained by said Noble, and shall constitute his sole compensation under this contract; <em>provided, </em>that in no case where collections are made shall the compensation of said Noble be less than the penalties now provided by law; but .said Noble is to make no charge whatever against the county for his services under this contract. It is further expressly agreed and understood by and between the parties hereto that the county court is left free and untrammeled in making any compromise or concessions in the settlement of any irregular or illegal assessments, and the said H. E. Noble shall only receive compensation of such proportion of the amount collected as the penalties provided by the law now in force bear to the whole amount due, based on the actual amount of money received by the county in such cases. Where any tax and costs are wholly remitted, said Noble shall receive no compensation, and said county shall retain the absolute right to adjust any and all claims for taxes so that no injustice may be done the owner of property included under this contract. It is also understood and agreed that said work shall be diligently and vigorously prosecuted by said H. E. Noble ; that he shall make reports to the county court when called for, and, in event said work shall not be prosecuted as aforesaid, then this contract shall be declared \u2022 null and void, and said certificates reassigned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-4\">\u201cIn witness whereof, the parties hereto have hereunto set their hands, and caused these presents to be executed by the County Court of Multnomah County, under its corporate seal, the day and year first above written.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-5\">(Signed) Multnomah County, Oregon,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b483-6\">By W.M.

Section 896 of Hill\u2019s Ann. Laws gives the county court (now the county commissioners under the act of 1898) power and authority \u201cto have the general care and management of the county property, funds and business, where the law does not otherwise expressly provide.\u201d This power is general and not special: <em>Levy Court </em>v. <em>Coroner, </em>69 U.

Assistance in performing these duties is the purpose of the general grant of power : <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Board of Comrs. </em>96 Ind. 84-111; <em>Biggs </em>v. <em>Caldwell County, </em>28 Mo. 586; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Whitman County, </em>1 Wash. 533 (20 Pac. 599); <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Cedar County, </em>34 Iowa, 54; <em>Page </em>v. <em>Am.

Rep. 20, 10 Pac. 484; <em>Wormington </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>22 Or. 606, 30 Pac. 450 ; <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Bellows, </em>24 Or. 553, 34 Pac. 549; <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Job, </em>25 Or. 512, 36 Pac. 293 ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pennoyer, </em>26 Or. 205, 37 Pac. 906, 41 Pac. 1104, 25 L. R. A. 862; <em>State ex rel. </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>28 Or. 498, 43 <em>Pac. </em>471, 31 L. R. A. 473; <em>Brownfield </em>v. <em>Houser, </em>30 Or. 534, 49 Pac. 843); and we think plaintiff is within this rule. It is stipulated and agreed in the contract that all moneys which would otherwise go to the county on the redemption of lands sold for delinquent taxes for specified years, for \u201cpenalty, interest and redemption fees,\u2019\u2019 shall be paid to Noble. If, therefore, the contract is void, such payment would necessarily be a wrongful diversion and misapplication of the county funds, to the injury of every taxpayer. It is claimed, however, that, were it not for the contract with Noble, there would be no \u201cpenalty, interest or redemption fees\u2019\u2019 on delinquent taxes for the years specified. But the court is bound to assume that the county authorities will, in good faith, and without the added stimulus of a contract with a private individual, enforce the collection of delinquent taxes as required by law. The plaintiff, therefore, is entitled to maintain this suit, if the contract is void, as we think it is. It is not only, in effect, an agreement by the board of county commissioners to use the general governmental machinery in the collection of delinquent taxes for the benefit, primarily, of a private individual, but it undertakes to interfere with the discharge of the duties assigned by law to other officers, and is therefore beyond the power of the board of commissioners to make: <em>City of Ft. Wayne </em>v. <em>Lehr, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>88 Ind. 62 ; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County, </em>99 Cal. 628 (84 Pac. 439); <em>House </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County, </em>104 Cal. 73 (37 Pac. 796).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> The contract, as modified, stipulates, in substance, that the county court will order the issuance of an alias warrant for the collection of taxes of 1887 to 1895, inclusive, and will cause to be made out delinquent rolls or lists, to be corrected by using the. descriptions furnished by Noble of real property or mortgages to be sold for taxes, as the same appear on the deed and mortgage records of Multnomah County, and advertise and sell the real property and mortgages therein described ; that the proper county officers will bid in all property offered for sale for which there shall be no other bidders ; and that Noble shall have the right at any time to pay to the county clerk the amount for which any parcel has been sold, in which event the certificate shall be transferred and assigned to him. It is further provided that all collections shall be made through the clerk of the county court in the usual manner, Noble to act as the agent of the county, and to use all due and diligent efforts in the collection of taxes, \u201cavailing himself of the means and methods followed by him in the case of taxes which he bids in for himself or others.\u201d On payment of any taxes, or redemption of the property sold, the county is to retain the amount of the tax and its costs, and all sums in excess thereof, including penalty, interest, and redemption fees, shall be paid to Noble, and shall constitute his compensation under the contract, provided that in no case shall his compensation be less than the penalties provided by law, and, if suit be brought against the county under the contract on account of the adding of descriptions to the assessment roll, as contemplated therein, Noble is to defend the same and pay the costs. Now, this statement of the several provisions of the contract is sufficient, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>our opinion, to show its invalidity. In the first place, it undertakes to interfere with the duties of the county court, by providing in advance that an alias warrant for the col-' lection of delinquent taxes shall be ordered issued by that tribunal.' Again, it undertakes to interfere with the duties of the county judge, or his successor, by stipulating that he shall bid in for the county all property offered for sale under such alias warrants, for which there are no other bidders. These objections may be considered as formal and somewhat .technical.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><bracketnum>3.</bracketnum> A more serious and insurmountable one, however, is that the board of county commissioners undertakes by the contract to interfere with the duties of the county clerk, by stipulating how and from what data he shall make delinquent tax lists, when his duties in that regard are- specially prescribed by statute, and the board of county commissioners or county court has no control over him, except, perhaps, to see that he faithfully executes the duties of his office. The statute requires the county assessor to set down in the assessment roll \u2018 a description of each tract or parcel of land to be taxed, specifying under separate heads the township, range, and section in which the land lies; or, if divided into lots and blocks, then the number of the lot and block \u201d (section 2770); and, after the necessary \u201calterations in the description of lands or other-property upon such roll \u201d has been made by the county court (section 2782), the county clerk is required, within a certain specified time, to deliver a transcript of the assessment roll to the sheriff, with a warrant attached for the collection of the taxes charged thereon (section 2794). If the sheriff shall be unable to collect the same, he is required to make out a statement of the taxes remaining unpaid, with a full and correct description of the real estate taxed, from Ms tax roll, and return the same to the county court, with the proper affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>annexed, by the first Monday in April after the date of the tax list (sections 2809-2811). It is the duty of the county clerk, after the return of the delinquent list by the sheriff, and within ten days thereafter, to make \u201cfrom said delinquent tax roll a true and correct list of the taxes returned as unpaid, and a correct description of the lands or town lots, if the same can be made \u201d (section 2814), and deliver the same to the sheriff of the county, with a warrant attached, commanding him to levy upon the goods and chattels of the delinquent taxpayer, and, if none be found, upon the real property set forth in the tax list, or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the amount of taxes, costs, and expenses. It thus appears that there is no power or authority vested by statute in any person or tribunal to change the description of real estate contained in the assessment roll after it has been approved by the county court. But the contract with Noble provides that he shall prepare corrected descriptions of the real property to be sold for taxes, \u201c as the same appear on the deed and mortgage records of Multnomah County,\u201d and, generally, to furnish \u201csuch facts and details as may be necessary, supplementary to the rolls and returns now on file or of record for the taxes of such years, as shall enable the proper officers to make out complete and correct rolls of such delinquent taxes, and of the properties to be sold therefor, so far as such facts can be ascertained from diligent and careful examination of the county records,\u201d and the county agrees to make use of such data ; thus, in effect, providing for the alteration and changing of a public record, and the making of a new and false delinquent tax roll. Clearly, such a contract cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\">The claim is made that, under the contract as modified, the only corrections contemplated of the descriptions of real estate contained in the roll were such as might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>necessary to make them complete. The language of the contract in this regard is that \u201cwherever said contract provides that rolls, lists, or other records shall be corrected, it is understood that \u2018corrected\u2019 shall mean only that the description now contained in said records may be completed, and that said rolls shall in all other respects be exactly copied, and no omissions or other alterations made therein, errors and omissions excepted.\u201d What the parties meant by the word \u201ccompleted\u201d can only be gathered from the other provisions of the contract, from which it is quite clear that a change in the descriptions of real estate was contemplated. This is apparent from the entire contract, and is especially evidenced by the fifth subdivision of the modified contract, wherein Nobles agrees that, if suit be brought against the county \u201con account of the adding of descriptions to the assessment roll as contemplated therein,\u201d he will defend and pay the costs of such suit. So we conclude the contract is susceptible of no other reasonable construction than that it contemplated an alteration and change, if necessary, in the descriptions of real property upon the delinquent assessment rolls for the years specified. It was further argued that under section 2814 the county clerk is authorized, in making up the delinquent list, 'to go outside of the roll for data from which to obtain a correct description of the land or town lots taxed. But it seems to us the plain and obvious meaning of the section is that the delinquent list shall be made from the delinquent tax roll as returned by the sheriff, and the description of the land or town lots be obtained from that source, and no other.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\">There are other provisions of the contract which naturally challenge attention, but sufficient has been noted to show its invalidity. It may be conceded that if Mr. Noble had been employed by the county commissioners to com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>pile information which other county officers could legitimately make use of in the performance of their duties, and had contracted to pay him a proper compensation therefor, such contract would be valid : <em>Burnett </em>v. <em>Mark</em>ley, 23 Or. 436 (31 Pac. 1050). But the work he engaged to do was not of that character. The decree of the court below is affirmed. Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
