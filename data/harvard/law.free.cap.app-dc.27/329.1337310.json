The method of making concrete piles which consists in providing a pile with an opening therethrough, driving said pile to displace the earth, then withdrawing the pile and permitting a flow of air through the same into the hole below the pile, then filling the hole thus formed with concrete, and permitting the same to set, substantially as specified.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">\u201c5. The method of making concrete piles, which consists in providing a pile with an enlarged head, driving said pile to displace the earth, and thereby forming a hole larger than the pile stem, withdrawing the pile, and afterward filling the hole with concrete, substantially as specified.\u201d ,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">\u201c8. The method of making concrete piles, which consists in providing a pile with a detachable point composed of concrete, driving said pile to displace the earth, withdrawing the pile, without the concrete point, and then filling the hole, above said point, with concrete or other plastic material, and permitting the same to set, substantially as specified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-10\">\u201c9.
