A. Gaines &amp; Company, a corporation, filed notice of opposition to the registration applied for, on the ground that it is the owner of a mark which so nearly resembles that of the applicant that confusion is likely to result to its damage. In the notice of opposition, appellant is represented as the' \u201csole and exclusive owner\u201d -of a trademark for whisky, consisting of the words \u201cOld Crow,\u201d accompanied by the picture of a crow.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The opposition was dismissed, upon demurrer, by the Examiner of Interferences, and on appeal to the Commissioner his decision was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">We entirely agree - with the Commissioner, and adopt the reasons therefor given in his decision as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">\u201cBoth marks include the word 'old\u2019 and both include the representation of a bird, but there the similarity ends. The jay as disclosed in the application and in the specimens accompanying it is entirely different in appearance from a crow, and could by no possibility be mistaken therefor. The name 'jay\u2019 is entirely different in sound from 'crow\u2019 and suggests a different idea. If there is to be any confusion between the marks, it must be because of the association of the word 'old\u2019 with the name of 'bird.\u2019 I am satisfied, however, that this one point of similarity is not sufficient to confuse the public, nor to mislead purchasers exercising ordinary care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">.Appellant has also .attacked the constitutionality of the trademark act, approved February 20, 1905, under which this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>opposition arose. The appellant is in no situation to raise this question in this proceeding, and we decline to consider it for the same reasons, substantially, given in the opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Stafford for this court, in the recent case of <em>Gaines </em>v. <em>Knecht, </em>ante, 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">The decision of the Commissioner is affirmed, and this decision will be certified to him as required by law. It is so ordered. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
