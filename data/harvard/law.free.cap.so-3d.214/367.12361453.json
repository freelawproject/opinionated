The parties have not specified the exact terms of the custody arrangement set forth in their divorce judgment pertaining to the child born of the marriage. However, on July 29, 2010, the trial court granted the father\u2019s petition to modify the custody provisions of the divorce judgment, awarded the parties \u201cjoint custody, care, and control\u201d of the child and specified that the father have \u201cprimary placement\u201d and the mother have \u201csecondary placement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">In April 2014, the father notified the mother by letter that he planned to relocate with the child to Tennessee. On May 7, 2014, the mother filed a petition seeking to modify custody of the child and objecting to the father\u2019s proposed relocation with the child. In her modification petition, the mother also sought an order preventing the father from taking the child out of Alabama pending a hearing on the mother\u2019s petition. The mother filed a separate motion seeking pendente lite custody of the child. On May 8, 2014, the trial court entered an order enjoining the father from relocating with the child pending a hearing on the mother\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">The trial court conducted an ore tenus hearing. At that hearing, it was agreed that the father no longer proposed to relocate to Tennessee and, therefore, that any issue pertaining to that move was moot. On February 26, 2015, the trial court entered a judgment finding that the issue of the father\u2019s proposed relocation was moot and denying the mother\u2019s custody-modification claim. The mother filed a postjudgment motion, and the trial court denied that motion. The mother timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">The mother first argues that, in denying her petition to modify custody, the trial court applied an incorrect modification standard. In reaching its judgment on the issue of custody, the trial court determined that the mother had failed to meet the modification standard set forth in <em>Ex parte McLendon, </em>455 So.2d 863 (Ala.1984). The <em>McLendon </em>standard provides that the parent seeking to modify a previous custody award must demonstrate that a material change in circumstances has occurred such that a change of custody would materially promote the child\u2019s best interests and that the benefits of the change would offset the disruptive effect of the change in custody. <em>McLendon, </em>455 So.2d at 866; <em>Ex parte Cleghorn, </em>993 So.2d 462, 468-69 (Ala.2008). The mother argues, however, that the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard set forth in <em>Ex parte Couch, </em>521 So.2d 987, 989 (Ala.1988), applies under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The determination whether the <em>McLendon </em>standard or the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard set forth in <em>Couch </em>applies turns on whether there has been a previous custody determination as between the two parents. If no previous custody determination has been made, or if a custody determination has been made that does not favor one parent over the other, such as an award of joint custody pursuant to which the parties share both joint legal custody and joint physical custody, <em>see </em>\u00a7 30-3-151(1), Ala.Code 1975, the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard applies. <em>New v. McCullar, </em>955 So.2d 431, 434 (Ala.Civ.App.2006). However, if a previous custody award favors one parent, i.e., by awarding one parent primary, or sole, physical custody, the <em>McLendon </em>standard applies to any modification action. <em>Rehfeld v. Roth, </em>885 So.2d 791, 794 (Ala.Civ.App.2004) (citing <em>Scholl v. Parsons, </em>655 So.2d 1060, 1062 (Ala.Civ.App.1995)). Our supreme court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\">\u201cThere are different standards for a trial court to use in ruling on questions of child custody. If one parent has previously been granted primary physical custody or if one parent has \u2018given up\u2019 legal custody, then an existing custody arrangement will be modified only if the modification materially promotes the best interests and welfare of the child. <em>Ex parte McLendon, </em>455 So.2d 863, 865-66 (Ala.1984). If neither parent has previously been given primary physical custody, then the \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 standard applies. <em>Ex parte Couch, </em>521 So.2d 987, 989 (Ala.1988).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag-\"><em>Ex parte Johnson, </em>673 So.2d 410, 413 (Ala.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">In this case, the most recent, July 29, 2010, custody-modification judgment stated that the parties were to \u201cshare the joint custody, care, and control of their minor child.\u201d However, that judgment then specified that the father have the \u201cprimary placement\u201d of the child and that the mother have \u201csecondary placement.\u201d The mother was ordered to pay child support to the father and was awarded liberal visitation with the child, i.e., alternating weekends, one weekday each week during the school year, and one-half of the summer break.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>The mother contends that because the July 29, 2010, modification judgment specified that the parties share \u201cjoint custody\u201d and because she has \u201cplacement\u201d of the child for what she contends in her brief is approximately 150 days per year, the custody award awarded the parties joint legal custody and joint physical custody, rather than an award of primary physical custody, or sole custody, to the father. The term \u201cjoint custody\u201d is defined in \u00a7 30-3-151(1), Ala.Code 1975, as \u201c[j]oint legal and joint physical custody.\u201d However, our appellate courts have recognized that there is confusion in the trial courts\u2019 use of that term, and, therefore, the courts have interpreted the term \u201cjoint custody\u201d according to the intent of the trial court in using the term. This court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-4\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s divorce judgment awarded the parties \u2018joint custody,\u2019 yet it awarded the father \u2018primary physical custody.\u2019 \u2018These terms have been-commonly employed by the bench and bar; however, in light of the definitions of the types of custody set out in the joint-custody statute, those older terms are unclear and ... serve only to confuse the issue of custody.\u2019 <em>Harris v. Harris, </em>775 So.2d 213, 214 (Ala.Civ.App.1999). Using the proper terms set out in the joint-custody statute, \u00a7 30-3-151, Ala. Code 1975, the divorce judgment can be construed only one way\u2014that is, it awards the father sole physical custody and the mother and the father joint legal custody. <em>See Harris, </em>775 So.2d at 214.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aso-dedup-0\"><em>Richardson v. Fotheringham, </em>950 So.2d 339, 341 (Ala.Civ.App.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">This court interpreted a previous judgment that had awarded the parties \u201c \u2018joint custody\u2019 \u201d but had awarded the father \u201c \u2018primary placement\u2019 \u201d to be a custody judgment in favor of the father. <em>Clayton v. Langley, </em>175 So.3d 179 (Ala.Civ.App.2015). Similarly, in <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>887 So.2d 257, 261-62 (Ala.Civ.App.2003), this court concluded that a custody judgment that awarded the parties \u201c \u2018joint custody,\u2019 \u201d but specified that the mother was to have \u201c \u2018primary physical custody,\u2019 \u201d was a judgment that favored the mother.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">\u201c[TJhere is but one way to interpret a judgment that awards \u2018joint custody\u2019 with an award-of \u2018primary physical custody\u2019 to one parent\u2014such a judgment must be interpreted as awarding the parents joint <em>legal </em>custody-and awarding one parent sole <em>physical </em>custody, the term used by [\u00a7 30-3-151] to denote a parent being favored with the right of custody over the other parent, who will receive visitation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-10\"><em>Smith v. Smith, </em>887 So.2d at 262. In <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>supra, this court recognized the difference between the terminology employed by the trial court in its judgment and that used in \u00a7 30-3-151, and we stated: \u201cWe take this opportunity to remind the bench and bar that our legislature has adopted terminology to be used in crafting custody judgments. Use of the terminology used before the enactment of \u00a7 30-3-151 only serves to engender confusion.\u201d <em>Id. See also Martin v. Payne, </em>739 So.2d 510, 510-11 (Ala.Civ.App.1999) (a judgment that awarded \u201cjoint custody\u201d but that the evidence showed primary placement was awarded to the mother with the father having liberal visitation was a judgment that favored the mother such that the <em>McLendon </em>standard applied to a modification of the judgment); and <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>75 So.3d 132, 138-39 (Ala.Civ.App.2011) (stating that \u201cthis court has urged trial courts to use the terminology contained in \u00a7 30-3-151 when crafting custody judgments\u201d but holding that a judgment awarding the\" parties joint custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>with one parent having primary physical custody \u201cshould be interpreted as awarding the parties joint legal custody of the children and awarding [that one parent] sole physical custody of the children\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\">The mother argues that the number of days each month that the child spent with her should be used to determine the nature of the custody award set forth in the July 29, 2010, modification judgment. The mother cites a number of cases in support of that argument. However, in most of those cases, the custody judgments that the parties sought to modify were different from the July 29, 2010, modification judgment that the mother sought to modify in this action. In those other cases, the custody judgments at issue specifically awarded the parties joint <em>physical </em>custody, and the courts examined whether the award was a trae award of joint physical custody such that there was no preference in favor of either parent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>New v. McCullar, </em>supra, the custody judgment at issue provided that \u201c \u2018the parties share joint legal and joint <em>physical </em>custody,\u2019 \u201d although it specified that the child\u2019s primary residence was with the mother. 955 So.2d at 432. The main opinion concluded that: \u201cTo the extent that the divorce judgment is internally inconsistent, we conclude that it in fact created a joint-physical-custody arrangement, as defined by \u00a7 30-3-151(3).\u201d 955 So.2d at 436. Therefore, given the facts of that case, the main opinion concluded that the \u201cbest interests\u201d standard applied to a modification of that judgment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">In <em>E.F.B. v. L.S.T., </em>157 So.3d 917 (Ala.Civ.App.2014), although the custody judgment sought to be modified designated the father as the \u201cprimary custodian,\u201d that judgment specified that the parties shared \u201cjoint physical custody.\u201d This court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">\u201cLike in <em>New, </em>we conclude that the custody arrangement under the modified judgment in the present case, in which the parties received \u2018joint physical custody\u2019 and both parties exercised custody over the children for an approximately equal amount of time, amounts to \u2018a joint-physical-custody arrangement, as defined by \u00a7 30-3-151(3).\u2019 <em>New [v. McCullar], </em>955 So.2d [431,] 436 [ (Ala.Civ.App.2006) ].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-9\"><em>E.F.B. v. L.S.T., </em>157 So.3d at 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">In <em>Hovater v. Hovater, </em>577 So.2d 461, 464 (Ala.Civ.App.1990), the mother was awarded \u201c \u2018primary physical custody\u2019 \u201d of the children during the school year and the father was awarded \u201c\u2018primary physical custody\u2019 \u201d during the summer. This court concluded that the \u201cbest interests\u201d standard applied, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-11\">\u201cWe conclude that, by the use of the term \u2018joint custody\u2019 and by the division of physical custody, the parties and the trial court envisioned a \u2018joint legal\u2019 and \u2018joint or split physical\u2019 custodial arrangement. Because neither party was awarded exclusive physical custody, the proper standard of review was the \u2018best interests and welfare\u2019 of the children as opposed to the more stringent burden established by <em>McLendon.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">In this case, the July 29, 2010, modification judgment awarded the parties joint custody\u2014not \u201cjoint physical custody\u201d\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>and it awarded the father primary placement. Further, that judgment required that the mother pay child support. Although the award of child support is not dispositive, it tends to support the conclusion that the father was preferred in the custody award, i.e., that the custody award favored the father over the mother.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-4\">\u201cWhen a previous joint custody determination favors one parent, such as when one parent has been granted primary physical custody, and the other parent moves for a modification, the stricter standard set out in <em>McLendon </em>applies.... Even though the parties in this case refer in their briefs to joint custody, the record indicates that the [father] had primary physical custody.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-5\"><em>Ex parte Johnson, </em>673 So.2d 410, 413-14 (Ala.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Given the facts of this case, the language of the July 29, 2010, modification judgment, and the foregoing authority, we conclude that the July 29, 2010, modification judgment awarded the parties joint legal custody of the child, with primary physical placement, or sole physical custody, <em>see </em>\u00a7 30-3-151(5), awarded to .the father.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the <em>McLendon </em>standard applied to any action seeking to modify that judgment. <em>Rehfeld v. Roth, </em>supra. The mother has failed to demonstrate that the trial court erred with regard to the standard it applied to her action seeking to modify custody of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The mother next argues that the trial court\u2019s denial of her modification petition was not supported by the evidence. The record indicates that since the entry of the 2010 modification judgment, the father and the child have changed residences multiple times. The father and the child initially lived with the father\u2019s then wife, Jennifer, and they moved to the child\u2019s paternal grandfather\u2019s home when the father and Jennifer separated. The father and the child lived with the paternal grandfather for approximately two weeks before the father moved himself and the child in with his new girlfriend, Karen, whom he later married. It appears that the father, Karen, and the child lived together in at least two different residences. The father and Karen separated in December 2013, and the father and the child again began living' with the paternal grandfather and shared a room in the basement of the paternal grandfather\u2019s home. The father testified that he then began investigating moving to Tennessee to obtain employment and to be closer to friends and some cousins. The father denied that his proposed move to Tennessee in the spring of 2014 was prompted by a new relationship with a woman named Tasha, but other evidence in the record disputes that claim. The father notified the mother on April 8, 2014, that he had rented an apartment in Sparta, Tennessee, and that he intended to move to Tennessee with the child. The father testified that, after the mother filed her petition objecting to the move to Tennessee in April 2014, he and the child moved into a home with his new girlfriend, Stacy, in Alabama. At the time of the hearing in this matter, the father was still living with Stacy and her children, but the two had not married. The record indicates that, since 2010, the child has attended three different schools; however, in spite of the more recent relo-cations of her residence with the father, the child has remained in the same school for almost four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>The father denied that the frequent changes in his and the child\u2019s residences had had a detrimental effect on the child, but the mother testified that the child\u2019s grades had dropped temporarily after some of those moves. The father admitted that moving so frequently into homes with different women was not appropriate for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">The mother testified that she had married and moved in with her husband after the 2010 hearing and that she and her husband had moved twice since that time. The mother and her husband have a young child. The mother testified that she does not work outside the home because her potential earnings would not make paying for day-care and work-related expenses viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The mother presented evidence in support of her allegation that the father had an anger problem and was controlling. Karen, the father\u2019s most recent wife, testified that the father had anger issues and often yelled at her and sometimes at the child. However, the father impeached some portions of Karen\u2019s testimony about the details of an alleged act of domestic violence with a tape recording he made of that incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">The father was questioned about a road-rage incident during which he exited his vehicle and shot a gun into the ah-; the child and other children were in the vehicle during that incident. The father testified that the people in the other vehicle had been the aggressors and that he was not certain whether they were young people acting badly or people who might rob him. Other testimony in the record indicated that the father had been the aggressor in that incident and that the child and the other children in the father\u2019s vehicle during that incident had been very frightened. In another portion of his testimony, the father stated that he believed that it was appropriate to respond in an angry or hostile manner, either physically or verbally, if he was provoked or if another person behaved badly first.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The mother testified that she believed that the child was afraid of the father, and she detailed some instances that she said supported that conclusion. The father testified that the child sometimes lied to him and that he raised his voice or punished her for those lies, but he disputed that the child was afraid of him. He also disputed the mother\u2019s allegation that he discouraged the child from speaking with the mother after the child\u2019s sporting events. Both parties have purchased a telephone, and each had created social-media profiles, for the child\u2019s use because each alleged that the other had \u201cblocked\u201d the child from communicating with the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">The father presented evidence indicating that the mother purchased expensive gifts for the child and ate at'restaurants frequently but was regularly in arrears on her child-support obligation. The father also disagreed with the mother that the child should be allowed to consume coffee when she'visited the mother and that she should be allowed to have a boyfriend at 12 years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">The child testified before the trial court while the parties were not present. \u25a0 In short, the child testified that she was occasionally afraid of the father and that she would prefer to live with her mother and visit the father on the same schedule pursuant to which she had been visiting the mother. No useful purpose would be served by setting forth the full details of the child\u2019s testimony. We note that the trial court found it necessary to remind the parties not to ask the child about any specifics of her testimony or to punish her for anything she had said during her testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>mony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Further, in its judgment, the trial court specifically ordered that the parties were restrained from questioning the child about where she preferred to live, from blocking each other\u2019s access to the child through her telephone and social-media accounts, and from speaking derogatorily about each other in front of the child. <em>See Price v. Price, </em>440 So.2d 1110, 1110 (Ala.Civ.App.1983) (\u201cThe paramount consideration for a court in a child custody case is the best interests and welfare of the child.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">The mother argues that the evidence warranted a change in custody. She cites in support of her argument the father\u2019s numerous moves and relationships, the alleged incident of domestic violence against one of his former wives, and the road-rage incident. In denying the mother\u2019s petition to modify custody of the child, the trial court specifically found that the mother had failed to meet the <em>McLendon </em>standard \u201cin that she failed to present sufficient evidence that the proposed change of custody would offset the disruption caused by the change of custody.\u201d The mother contends that the father\u2019s choices have been disruptive for the child and that a modification of custody would provide the child needed' stability. The mother also points out that the child expressed a desire to live with her and that, although it is not determinative, a child\u2019s custody preference is a factor for the trial court to consider. <em>Glover v. Singleton, </em>598 So.2d 995, 996 (Ala.Civ.App.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">This court shares the mother\u2019s concern about the lack of stability in the father\u2019s residences and relationships and agrees that the evidence in the record also tends to support the conclusion that the father does have an issue with anger. The evidence supports a conclusion that both parties,- but particularly the father, have allowed their dislike for each other to impact the manner in which they parent the child, but it appears that the trial court has attempted to take steps, through enjoining certain behaviors of the parties, to ensure that the child\u2019s best interests are protected. However, the evidence in the record also indicates that the child loves both parents and is generally happy during each parent\u2019s custodial periods. The trial court could have concluded that the child\u2019s preference concerning her primary residence focused on the parties\u2019 differing parenting styles. \u201cOn appellate review of custody matters, this court is limited when the evidence was presented ore tenus, and, in such circumstances, a trial court\u2019s determination will not be disturbed \u2018absent an abuse of discretion or where it is shown to be plainly and palpably wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cheek v. Dyess, </em>1 So.3d 1025, 1029 (Ala.Civ.App.2007) (quoting <em>Alexander v. Alexander, </em>625 So.2d 433, 434 (Ala.Civ.App.1993)). This court might not have reached the same result as did the trial court given the evidence. However, this court did not have the trial court\u2019s advantage of being able to observe the witnesses as they testified and to\u2019 assess their demeanor and credibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-12\">\u2018 \u201cThe trial court is in the ... position of discerning the demeanor and other like intangibles which do not transfer so readily in a transcript.\u201d <em>Shepherd v. Shepherd, </em>531 So.2d 668, 671 (Ala.Civ.App.1988). Stated another way, \u201cthe deference given to the trial court by the ore tenus rule is, in part, due to the trial court\u2019s unique position to see and/or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>hear something that may not be apparent on the face of the written record.\u201d <em>Willing v. Willing, </em>655 So.2d 1064, 1068 (Ala.Civ.App.1995). <em>See Dobbins v. Dobbins, </em>602 So.2d 900, 901 (Ala.Civ.App.1992) (\u201cThe reason for the ore tenus rule is [well established], i.e., that the trial court had the opportunity to observe the witnesses as they testified, to judge their credibility and demeanor, and to observe what this court cannot perceive from a written record.\u201d).\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><em>Fell v.

Given the totality of the evidence, we cannot say that the trial court erred in determining that the mother failed to meet her burden under <em>Ex parte McLendon, </em>supra.

The July 2010 custody-modification judgment awarded Ryan Nichole Whitehead (\u201cthe mother\u201d) and Brandon Heath Whitehead (\u201cthe father\u201d) \u201cjoint custody\u201d of the child. The Alabama joint-custody statutes, codified at Ala.Code 1975, \u00a7 30-3-150 et seq., define joint custody as \u201c[j]oint legal custody and joint physical custody.\u201d Ala.Code 1975, \u00a7 30-3-151(1). Thus, contrary to the main opinion\u2019s conclusion, the failure of the Calhoun Circuit Court to use the term \u201cjoint physical custody\u201d in the July 2010 custody-modification judgment does not serve to make that judgment significantly distinguishable from the judgments sought to be modified in <em>New v. McCullar, </em>955 So.2d 431 (Ala.Civ.App.2006), and <em>E.F.B. v. L.S.T., </em>157 So.3d 917 (Ala.Civ.App.2014). Furthermore, the July 2010 judgment awarded the parents joint custody in one paragraph of the judgment and set out what it called \u201cplacement\u201d in a separate paragraph. Although the July 2010 judgment awarded the father \u201cprimary placement\u201d and the mother \u201csecondary placement,\u201d that judgment did not, as did the judgments sought to be modified in <em>Richardson v. Fotheringham, </em>950 So.2d 339, 341 (Ala.Civ.App.2006), and <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>887 So.2d 257, 261-62 (Ala.Civ.App.2003), award \u201cprimary physical custody\u201d of the child to either parent. I cannot equate the term \u201cprimary placement\u201d with the much more descriptive term \u201cprimary physical custody.\u201d I construe the use of the terms \u201cprimary placement\u201d and \u201csecondary placement\u201d as a method of delineating which parent would exercise custody at certain times.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">Because the July 2010 judgment, like the judgments in <em>New </em>and <em>E.F.B., </em>awarded the mother and the father joint custody, I find this case indistinguishable from <em>New </em>and <em>E.F.B. </em>My conclusion is bolstered by the fact that, in the present case, the mother\u2019s \u201csecondary placement\u201d provides her with a comparable number of custodial days as was awarded the \u201csecondary\u201d parent in both <em>New </em>and <em>E.F.B. </em>Therefore, I conclude that the trial court improperly applied the more stringent custody-modification standard set out in <em>Ex parte McLendon, </em>455 So.2d 863 (Ala.1984), to the mother\u2019s custody-modification petition. <em>See Watters v. Watters, </em>918 So.2d 913, 916 (Ala.Civ.App.2005) (indicating that a parent seeking modification of a joint-custody arrangement is not required to meet the standard set out in <em>Ex parte McLendon). </em>Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the trial court, remand the cause, and instruct the trial court to reconsider the evidence presented under the best-interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>standard to decide the mother\u2019s custody-modification petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">I further note that this case illustrates the continued confusion created by the refusal of the bench and bar to use the custody terminology chosen by our legislature. The joint-custody statutes became effective on January 1, 1997, more than 19 years ago. For 19 years, a significant number of the members of the bench and bar have continued to use the old, outdated terminology when drafting custody judgments and custody agreements. The terminology in the joint-custody statutes is no longer new and it should not be unfamiliar to any attorney in this state. The only proper terms to describe custody in Alabama are those set out in the joint-custody statutes: joint custody, joint legal custody, joint physical custody, sole legal custody, and sole physical custody. <em>See </em>\u00a7 30-3-151 (defining the various forms of custody). Continued use of terms like \u201cprimary physical custody\u201d serve to make unclear custody judgments and agreements and to confuse the parties regarding their custodial arrangements, which, in turn, leads to confusion among the trial courts and the appellate courts regarding the appropriate standard applicable to later custody-modification actions. Much difficulty and litigation could be avoided by the use of the proper terminology at the outset.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
