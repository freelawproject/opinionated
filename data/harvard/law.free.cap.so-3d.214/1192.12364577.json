DR-14-53.01 based on its purported lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">\n<em>Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-7\">The father and Heather Stouffer Wilson (\u201cthe mother\u201d) were divorced by a judgment entered by the Hoke County District Court in North Carolina (\u201cthe North Carolina court\u201d) on August 25, 2003; that judgment incorporated a settlement agreement entered into by the parties that, among other things, awarded the parties joint , legal custody of the parties\u2019 child, C.J.S. (\u201cthe child\u201d), and awarded the father primary physical custody of the child, subject to the mother\u2019s visitation. On August 15, 2007, ,the North Carolina court entered a judgment incorporating an agreement of the parties that, among other things, awarded the parties \u201cjoint permanent custody ... with the [mother] having the primary custody and the [father] having the secondary custody\u201d and also awarded standard visitation to the father (\u201cthe North Carolina modification judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-10\">The mother and the father were previously before this court in appeal no. 2140061, in which we affirmed, without an opinion, a September 19,2014, judgment of the trial court declining to modify custody of the child pursuant to the father\u2019s custody-modification petition following the trial court\u2019s domestication of the North Carolina modification judgment. <em>See Stouffer v. Wilson </em>(No. 2140061, July 10, 2015), \u2014 So.3d - (Ala.Civ.App.2015) (table). This court entered its certificate of judgment in <em>Stouffer </em>on July 29, 2015. We note that, although the trial court, in its September 19, 2014, judgment, declined to transfer sole physical custody of the child to the father, as requested in the father\u2019s petition, the trial court awarded the father \u201cliberal visitation to be agreed between the parties.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because that award differed from the North Carolina modification judgment, which had awarded the father specified visitation, the trial court\u2019s September 19, 2014, judgment modified the North Carolina modification judgment in accordance with Ala.Code 1975, \u00a7 30-3B-102(H),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a part of Alabama\u2019s version of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (\u201cthe UCCJEA\u201d), Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 30-BB-101 et seq. The father did not challenge that part of the trial court\u2019s judgment in <em>Stouffer </em>modifying his visitation with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-4\">On July 22, 2015, the mother filed in the trial court a petition for a finding of contempt against the father. She asserted, among other things, that, at that time, she was a resident of Colorado, having recently moved from Alabama to that state, and that, on July 19, 2015, the date on which the father\u2019s summer visitation with the child in Pennsylvania, where the father resides, was to end, the mother had received a text message from the father informing her that he was not returning the child to her custody. The mother sought the issuance of an instanter order requiring the father to return the child to her custody, an award of temporary and exclusive custody of the child to the mother, and pendente Kte relief. The trial court filed an instanter order on July 22, 2015, ordering law-enforcement authorities to dispatch a deputy to facilitate the orderly transfer of the child from any person who had custody of the child to the mother. On that same date, the trial court entered an order denying the mother\u2019s request for pendente lite relief. Also on July 22, 2015, the father filed an answer to the mother\u2019s contempt petition and a custody-modification petition, seeking primary physical custody of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">On July 27, 2015, the mother filed in the Franklin County Branch of the Court of Common Pleas of the 39th Judicial District of Pennsylvania (\u201cthe Pennsylvania court\u201d) a petition for registration of the trial court\u2019s September 19, 2014, judgment and its July 22, 2015, instanter order and for the \u201cexpedited enforcement\u201d of both. In her petition, the mother asserted, among other things, that Pennsylvania law-enforcement authorities had been unwilling to facilitate the transfer of the child without first having the trial court\u2019s July 22, 2015, instanter order registered in Pennsylvania. She sought attorney\u2019s fees, an expedited hearing, immediate custody of the child pursuant to the orders of the trial court, and an order requiring law-enforcement authorities to assist her in obtaining physical custody of the child. On July 28, 2015, the Pennsylvania court entered an order registering the trial court\u2019s September 19, 2014, judgment and its July 22, 2015, instanter order; awarding the mother sole physical custody of the child; and ordering Pennsylvania law-enforcement authorities to enforce the terms of the Pennsylvania court\u2019s order. - The mother filed a petition for a finding of contempt against. the father in the Pennsylvania court on August 4, 2015; she asserted therein, among other things, that the child had refused to leave the father\u2019s home despite the best efforts of the Franklin County Sheriffs Department (\u201cthe Pennsylvania sheriffs department\u201d). The mother requested that the Pennsylvania court set a contempt hearing, that it order the father to appear in court with the child, and that it enter an order directing the Pennsylvania sheriffs department to physically remove the child from the father\u2019s home and transfer him to the mother\u2019s custody. On August 6, 2015, the fa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>ther filed in the Pennsylvania court an emergency petition for special relief. The father sought sole physical custody of the child based on his concerns for the child\u2019s safety and best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">On August 13, 2015, the Pennsylvania court entered an order finding that temporary emergency jurisdiction existed under Pennsylvania\u2019s version of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, 23 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 5401 et seq., concluding that, due to safety concerns for the child, an emergency situation existed and suspending enforcement of its July 28, 2015, order directing that the child be returned to the mother\u2019s custody. The Pennsylvania court, repeatedly noting the temporary nature of its emergency order, further indicated that it was \u201cin no way assuming permanent jurisdiction\u201d and that the trial court would be contacted and advised of the emergency order. The Pennsylvania court entered a second order on August 13, 2015, concluding that the father\u2019s actions had not been willful with regard to the child\u2019s failure to return to the mother and denying the mother\u2019s contempt petition. On August 14, 2015, the Pennsylvania court entered an order indicating, among other things, that it had conducted an emergency hearing pursuant to the father\u2019s request that it exercise temporary emergency jurisdiction as to the child; that the Pennsylvania court had contacted the trial court; and that, \u201cfor the six months prior to the filing of [the] proceedings [in the Pennsylvania court] the child\u2019s home state for jurisdictional purposes remains ... Alabama.\u201d The Pennsylvania court ordered that its August 13, 2015, emergency custody order would terminate on November 11, 2015, and it directed the parties to resume proceedings in the trial court within that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">On August 19, 2015, the mother filed a motion in the trial court seeking an emergency order from the trial court setting a hearing and awarding her \u201csole permanent and exclusive custody\u201d of the child. The trial court entered an order setting the mother\u2019s motion for a hearing on August 26, 2015. On August 21, 2015, the father filed in the trial court an objection to the setting of an emergency hearing and a motion seeking to \u201ctransfer jurisdiction\u201d\u2014 i.e., to cede jurisdiction to determine issues relating to the child\u2019s custody\u2014to Pennsylvania. In his motion to transfer jurisdiction, the father admitted that, for purposes of the present case, Alabama would be the home state of the child, although he also argued that, as between Alabama, Pennsylvania, and Colorado, it would also be the least convenient forum. The trial court entered an order on August 26, 2015, noting that, at the healing on that date, the father had appeared through counsel and that the father\u2019s counsel had moved to dismiss the father\u2019s request to modify custody, which the trial court had granted. The trial court stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-7\">\u201c[The father] submitted himself to the jurisdiction of this Court on July 22, 2015, by seeking yet another modification of custody then decided, once he got a favorable ruling in [the] Pennsylvania [court] that [this court] no longer had jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-8\">\u201cThis Court does not find it necessary to decide whether or not it had continuing jurisdiction to modify custody since there is no request to modify pending before it. The only issue is whether this court has jurisdiction to enforce its Order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-9\">\u201cFurther the Court found jurisdiction at the commencement of the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1226-10\">\u201cThe argument of the [father] is essentially that [neither] this court, nor any other court, can enforce the custody order of September 29, 2014. This court finds such a position to be untenable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>Courts have inherent power to enforce its own orders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1227-4\">The trial court then directed the father to return the child to the mother within seven days of the entry of the order and noted that his failure to do so would constitute contempt of court for which the father would be placed in jail until he purged himself of the contempt. On September 1, 2015, the father filed a motion to alter, amend, or vacate the trial court\u2019s August 26, 2015, order, arguing that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the child-custody determination. The trial court entered an order denying the father\u2019s motion on September 2, 2015. On that same date, the trial court entered an order denying a motion for a stay that had been filed by the father. The father filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in this court on that same date. The father also filed a request for a stay, which this court granted pending further order by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-6\">\u201c \u2018A writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy, and it \u201cwill be issued only when there is: 1) a clear legal right in the petitioner to the order sought; 2) an imperative duty upon the respondent to perform, accompanied by a refusal to do so; 3) the lack of another adequate remedy; and 4) properly invoked jurisdiction of the court.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1227-7\"><em>Ex parte Monsanto Co., </em>862 So.2d 595, 604 (Ala.2003) (quoting <em>Ex parte Butts, </em>775 So.2d 173, 176 (Ala.2000), quoting in turn <em>Ex parte United Serv. Stations, Inc., </em>628 So.2d 501, 503 (Ala.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-8\">The father argues in his petition that the trial court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction to enter its August 26, 2015, order. He asserts that Ala.Code 1975, \u00a7 30-3B-202, a part of the UC-CJEA, applies to enforcement of a child-custody determination in addition to modifications of a child-custody determination. Section 30-3B-202 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-11\">\u201c(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 30-3B-204, [Ala.Code 1975,] a court of this state which has made a child custody determination consistent with Section 30-3B-201[, Ala.Code 1975,] or Section 30-3B-203[, Ala.Code 1975,] has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the determination until:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-12\">\u201c(1) A court of this state determines that neither the child, nor the child and one parent, nor the child and a person acting as a parent have a significant connection with this state and that substantial evidence is no longer available in this state concerning the child\u2019s care, protection, training, and personal relationships; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azoq\">\u201c(2) A court of this state or a court of another state determines that the child, the child\u2019s parents, and any person acting as a parent do not presently reside in this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1227-13\">\u201c(b) A court of this state which has made a child custody determination and does not have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this section may modify that determination only if it has jurisdiction to make an initial determination under Section 30-3B-201.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1227-14\">The father argues that, because \u00a7 30-3B-202(a) provides that a court of this state \u201chas continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the [child-custody] determination\u201d until such time as specified in the statute, that section applies to the enforcement of the child-custody determination as well as to the modification of that determination. We disagree. Rather, \u00a7 30-3B-202(a) refers only to the continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of a court to modify the determination. That Code section does not address the jurisdiction of a court of this state to enforce its own orders and judgments. <em>See In re Marriage of Medill, </em>179 Or.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>630, 646, 40 P.3d 1087, 1096 (2002) (\u201cThe UCCJEA does not expressly address the enforcement of a custody determination made ... by a court of a state that no longer has jurisdiction to modify that determination, .. .\u201d). \u201cA trial court has the inherent power to enforce its judgments \u2018and to make such orders and issue such process as may be necessary to render [the judgments] effective.\u2019 \u201d <em>Goetsch v. Goetsch, </em>990 So.2d 403, 413 (Ala.Civ.App.2008) (quoting <em>Dial v. Morgan, </em>515 So.2d 14, 15 (Ala.Civ.App.1987)). To the extent that \u00a7 30-3B-202(a) implicates a trial court\u2019s power to enforce its judgments by observing that it continues to have \u201cexclusive jurisdiction over the determination,\u201d it refers only to a court\u2019s power to enforce and interpret its judgments as that power is derived from state law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See In re Marriage of Medill, </em>179 Or.App. at 647, 40 P.3d at 1097 (recognizing that a trial court\u2019s loss of jurisdiction to modify the existing custody determination under the UCCJEA does not, by force of logic, render that determination unenforceable); <em>Heilig v. Heilig </em>(No. W2013-01232-COA-R3-CV, Feb. 28, 2014) (Tenn.Ct.App.2014) (not reported in S.W.3d); and <em>Nelson v. Norys </em>(No.2004-CA-001725-ME, July 29, 2006) (Ky.Ct.App.2005) (not reported in S.W.3d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">The father also argues that the trial court\u2019s August 26, 2015, order was a modification of the trial court\u2019s September 19, 2014, judgment because, he says, that order superseded the September 19, 2014, judgment by requiring that the child be returned to the mother within seven days. We disagree. The September 19, 2014, judgment allowed for the father\u2019s visitation with the child as agreed between the mother and the father. Because it is clear from the proceedings below that the mother and the father had not agreed for the child to continue visiting the father at the time the mother filed her contempt petition on July 22, 2015, the trial court was merely enforcing its judgment and returning the child to the mother\u2019s physical custody, which she was awarded in the September 19, 2014, judgment. We note further that, even if the trial court\u2019s August 26, 2015, order was, in fact, a modification of the September 19, 2014, judgment, the trial court was within its jurisdiction'to modify that judgment pursuant to \u00a7 30-3B-202(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-7\">Pursuant to Ala.Code 1975, \u00a7 30-3B-201(a), a court of this state has jurisdiction to make an initial child-custody determination only if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-8\">\u201c(1) This state' is the home state of the child on the date of the commencement of the proceeding, or was the home state of the child within six months before the commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from this state but a parent or person acting as a parent continues to live in this state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1228-9\">\u201c(2) A court of another state does not have jurisdiction under subdivision (1), or a court of the home state of the child has declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that this state is the more appropriate forum under Section 30-3B-207[, Ala.Code 1975,] or 30-3B-208, [Ala.

He cites <em>Peterson v. Peterson, </em>965 So.2d 1096, 1101 (Ala.Civ.App. 2007), in which this court affirmed a judgment of the Mobile Circuit Court deferring to the jurisdiction of a North Carolina court with regard to issues of custody and visitation regarding the children at issue in that case. In <em>Peterson, </em>the Mobile Circuit Court had entered a judgment divorcing the parties and awarding the father sole physical custody of the parties\u2019 children. <em>Id. </em>at 1097. Following the entry of the divorce judgment, the father took the children to live with him in North Carolina; although the children returned to Alabama and resided with their maternal grandparents from August 2003 until July 2004, they had remained with the father in North Carolina since July 2004. <em>Id. </em>The mother resided in North Carolina from December 2003 until January 2005; during that time, on December 21, 2004, the mother filed a petition in Alabama seeking a modification of the divorce judgment. <em>Id. </em>This court concluded that the evidence justified a determination that, pursuant to \u00a7 30-3B-202(a)(2), the Mobile Circuit Court did not have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate the mother\u2019s petition because neither the children, nor the children\u2019s parents, nor any person acting as a parent were residing in Alabama at the time the mother filed her petition for modification. <em>Id. </em>at 1099-1100. We further determined that \u00a7 30-3B-201 did not confer subject-matter jurisdiction upon the Mobile Circuit Court because the record established that the mother, the father, and the children were all residing in North Carolina when the mother filed her modification petition and there was no evidence in the record indicating that'a North Carolina court had declined to exercise jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 1100.</p>\n<p id=\"b1229-9\">In the present case, like in <em>Peterson, </em>neither the mother, nor the father,, nor the child, nor any person acting as a parent were residing in Alabama at the time the mother filed her motion for an emergency hearing on August. 19, 2015. Unlike in <em>Peterson, </em>however, \u00a7 30-3B-201 confers jurisdiction on the trial court in the present case. The \u201chome state\u201d of a child is defined in \u00a7 30-3B-102(7) as \u201c[t]he state in which a child lived with a parent or a person acting as a parent for at least six consecutive months immediately before the commencement of a child custody proceeding.\u201d Because the child was visiting the father at the time the mother moved to Colorado, it is clear that Colorado was not the child\u2019s home state at any time. Additionally, Pennsylvania is clearly not the child\u2019s home state because the child has not lived in Pennsylvania for at least six consecutive months at any time of which this court is aware. Thus, no court of any other state would have jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 30-3B-201(a)(l). Indeed, the father admitted in his August 21, 2015, motion before the trial court that,\" for purposes of the present case, Alabama would be the home state of the child. To the extent that Pennsylvania could assert jurisdiction over an initial custody determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>nation in the present case based on the father\u2019s residing in that state and the child\u2019s presence therein, we note that the Pennsylvania court declined jurisdiction. Specifically, the Pennsylvania court stated in its August 14, 2015, order, that it \u201cis of the opinion that for the six months prior to the filing of these proceedings the child\u2019s home state for jurisdictional purposes remains ... Alabama.\u201d Thus, Alabama would have jurisdiction to make an initial child-custody determination pursuant to \u00a7 30-3B-201(a)(3). To the extent that the Pennsylvania court could not assert jurisdiction in the present case to make an initial child-custody determination, Alabama would have jurisdiction to make such a determination pursuant to \u00a7 30-3B-201(a)(4). We conclude therefore that, because the trial court would have jurisdiction to make an initial child-custody determination in the present case, the father\u2019s argument that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to enforce its September 2014 judgment or to modify that judgment based on the operation of \u00a7 30-3B-202 is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-4\">Because the father has failed to prove a clear legal right to the order sought in his petition for a writ of mandamus, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-5\">APPLICATION GRANTED; OPINION OF NOVEMBER 6, 2015, WITHDRAWN; OPINION SUBSTITUTED; PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1230-6\">THOMPSON, P.J., and PITTMAN, THOMAS, and DONALDSON, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b1230-7\">MOORE, J., dissents, with writing.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1224-8\">. Although the father argues on rehearing that the trial court had modified the child\u2019s custody by awarding \u201csole physical custody\u201d to the mother, in contrast to the North Carolina modification judgment, which awarded the parties \"joint permanent custody,\u201d we note that that aspect of the trial court\u2019s September 19, 2014, judgment was not a departure from the North Carolina modification judgment and, thus, did not amount to a modification thereof. The trial court's judgment specified that the parties were awarded joint legal custody of the child, with the mother being awarded sole physical custody of the child, subject to the father\u2019s visitation. Because that award merely reaffirmed the North Carolina modification judgment regarding custody of the child, albeit using different terminology, that aspect of the custody award did not amount to a modification of custody pursuant to Alabama\u2019s version of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, Ala.Code 1975, \u00a7 30-3B-101 et seq. <em>See Smith v.

We note that nothing in this opinion should be interpreted as indicating that, where the UCCJEA bestows jurisdiction (other than temporary emergency jurisdiction) upon a court of another state in a child-custody proceeding and the jurisdiction of that other state\u2019s court is duly invoked, a court of this state may continue to exercise its jurisdiction over a child-custody determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1230-8\">MOORE, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AN2D\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-9\">I respectfully dissent. The sole question before this court is whether the Russell Circuit Court (\u201cthe trial court\u201d) had subject-matter jurisdiction to enter its August 26, 2015, order. In that order, the trial court commanded Byron Stouffer (\u201cthe father\u201d) to return C.J.S. (\u201cthe child\u201d) to the physical custody of Heather Stouf-fer Wilson (\u201cthe mother\u201d). In doing so, the trial court, as it expressly stated, was acting to enforce its own judgment entered on September 19, 2014 (\u201cthe 2014 judgment\u201d), not to modify it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The father asserts that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to enforce the 2014 judgment because neither he, nor the mother, nor the child were residing in Alabama on July 22, 2015, when the mother commenced her action to enforce the 2014 judgment. I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1230-12\">Section 30-3B-202, Ala.Code 1975, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-13\">\u201c(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 30-3B-204, [Ala.Code 1975,] a court of this state which has made a child custody determination consistent with Section 30-3B-201[, Ala.Code 1975,] or Section 30-3B-203[, Ala.Code 1975,] has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the determination until:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-14\">\u201c(1) A court of this state determines that neither the child, nor the child and one parent, nor the child and a person acting as a parent have a significant connection with this state and that substantial evidence is no longer available in this state concerning the child\u2019s care, protection, training, and personal relationships; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"arj-dedup-1\">' \u201c(2) A court of this state or a court of another state determines that the child, the child\u2019s parents, and any person acting as a parent do not presently reside in this state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1230-15\">By its unambiguous language, \u00a7 30-3B-202 grants a court of this state that has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>made a child-custody determination \u201ccontinuing, exclusive jurisdiction\u201d over that determination. Such jurisdiction inherently would include the power to enforce the judgment by any lawful means, not just the power to modify the judgment. Equally unambiguously, \u00a7 30-3B-202(a)(2) provides that the continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of the court ends when \u201cthe child, the child\u2019s parents, and any person acting as a parent do not presently reside in this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-4\">In this case, it is undisputed that the child and the child\u2019s parents did not reside in Alabama on July 22, 2015, the date the mother commenced her enforcement action. <em>See Peterson v. Peterson, </em>965 So.2d 1096, 1099 (Ala.Civ.App.2007) (holding that the continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of a court over a child-custody determination depends on the circumstances existing at the time an action seeking to invoke that jurisdiction is commenced). The mother had moved her residence from Alabama to Colorado a month before she commenced the enforcement action. The father was a resident of Pennsylvania when the mother commenced her enforcement action. The child was supposed to move with the mother to Colorado, but declined, expressing an intention to reside with the father in Pennsylvania. Regardless of the ultimate disposition as to his custody, the child no longer resided in Alabama in July 2015. Hence, pursuant to \u00a7 30-3B-202(a), the trial court had lost continuing, exclusive jurisdiction and, with it, the power to enforce the 2014 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1231-5\">Because the trial court did not have jurisdiction to enforce the 2014 judgment, this court should issue the writ of mandamus for which the father petitions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1230-10\">. Thus, I find no need to discuss the jurisdiction of the trial court to modify the 2014 judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
