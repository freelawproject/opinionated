Bailey (Bailey) appeals from an order of the tax court granting summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner and holding that taxpayer is not entitled to the benefits of the remedial provisions of \u00a7 1341 of the Internal Revenue Code (I.R.C.).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-18\">Bailey was an officer, shareholder and director of Bestline Products, Inc., and Bestline Products Corporation (Bestline), a \u201cpyramid\u201d multi-level direct sales organization. Bailey received salary, dividends and bonuses from Bestline in his capacity as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>officer, shareholder and director and included such items in his gross income during several taxable years.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">In 1971, Bailey entered into a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) under which he agreed, in his capacity both as an individual and as a corporate officer, to cease and desist from operating the Bestline business in a deceptive or fraudulent manner or in violation of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">In 1976, the District Court for the Northern District of California determined that Bailey, in his continued operation of Best-line, violated the terms of the consent decree, and pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(0, fined Bailey $1,036,000. The California district court then granted Bailey\u2019s request that his payment of the $1,036,000 fine be applied as restitution in a settlement of a multidistrict class action against Bestline and its officers pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The California district court\u2019s order authorizing the transfer of funds expressly stated that, \u201cthe ultimate disposition of these funds in no way shall alter their status as civil penalties\u201d imposed under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45(Z).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">In Bailey\u2019s federal income tax return for 1977, he claimed that his payment of the $1,036,000 qualified him for a reduction in tax of $364,343 under I.R.C. \u00a7 1341. The Commissioner disallowed that claim and Bailey filed a petition with the United States Tax Court, seeking a redetermination of the deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">On January 26, 1984, after a hearing on cross-motions for summary judgment, the tax court granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Bailey\u2019s motion. The court held that Bailey failed to meet the prerequisites of I.R.C. \u00a7 1341 because (1) the $1,036,000 payment did not arise out of the original salary, dividend and bonus payments to Bailey, and (2) the $1,036,000 payment is a penalty and, thus, not deductible in any event under \u00a7 162(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Section 1341 provides a special method for computing tax liability in circumstances where a taxpayer has received an item of income under \u201cclaim of right,\u201d included that item in income, and in a subsequent taxable year was required to restore that item because it was established that the taxpayer did not in fact have an \u201cunrestricted right to such item.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 1341; Treas.Reg. \u00a7 1.1341-1. Taxpayers who invoke the provision pay the lesser of (1) their normal tax for the year of restoration, computed with a deduction for the restoration, or (2) a tax computed without such deduction, but reduced by the amount the tax in the year of receipt would have been decreased had the amount restored been excluded. I.R.C. \u00a7 1341(a). Section 1341, in effect, gives a taxpayer benefits that would approximate a deduction in the year of receipt of the amount later restored when doing so results in a lower tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">Before invoking \u00a7 1341, the taxpayer must be entitled under some provision of the Internal Revenue Code to a deduction for the restoration payment in that year. I.R.C. \u00a7 1341(a)(2); Treas.Regs. 1.1341-1(a)(1); <em>United States v. Skelly Oil Co., </em>394 U.S. 678, 683, 89 S.Ct. 1379, 1382, 22 L.Ed.2d 642 (1969); <em>see also National Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. United States, </em>244 F.Supp. 135, 139-142 (M.D.Tenn.1965), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>385 F.2d 832 (6th Cir.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">Section 162(f) prohibits a deduction \u201cfor any fine or similar penalty paid to a government for the violation of any law.\u201d Section 1.162 \u2014 21 (b)(l)(ii) of the Treasury Regulations provides that this deduction prohibition applies to amounts \u201cpaid as a civil penalty imposed by Federal ... law.\u201d Bailey contends, however, that \u00a7 162(f) is inapplicable because the $1,036,000 payment was not a penalty paid to a government, but rather constituted restitution made to private litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">In <em>Southern Pacific Transportation Co. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>75 T.C. 497, 646-654 (1980), the tax court held that civil penalties \u201cimposed for purposes of enforcing the law and as punishment for the violation thereof\u201d are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>non-deductible payments under \u00a7 162(f), while civil penalties \u201cimposed to encourage prompt compliance with a requirement of the law, or as a remedial measure to compensate another party for expenses incurred as a result of the violation\u201d fall outside the scope of the deduction prohibition in \u00a7 162(f). <em>Accord Huff v. Comm\u2019r, </em>80 T.C. 804, 824 (1983); <em>Middle Atlantic Distributors, Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>72 T.C. 1136 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-3\">Bailey\u2019s obligation to pay the $1,036,000 payment arose out of a judgment in a suit brought against Bailey by the FTC to recover civil penalties under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45 where the District Court for the Northern District of California found that Bailey \u201cfailed or neglected to obey terms of an FTC Consent Order\u201d and ordered that Bailey \u201cshall forfeit and pay to the plaintiff United States of America civil penalties in the amount of [$1,036,000].\u201d Bailey, therefore, forfeited the $1,036,000 as punishment for his violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and the payment was thus a fine \u201cimposed for purposes of enforcing the law and as punishment for a violation thereof.\u201d <em>See Southern Pacific, </em>75 T.C. at 652.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">The fact that the California district court, upon Bailey\u2019s application, permitted him to apply the $1,036,000 civil penalty toward the settlement of his potential liabilities in the multidistrict class action does not change the status of the payment as a civil penalty. The characterization of a payment for purposes of \u00a7 162(f) turns on the origin of the liability giving rise to it. <em>Middle Atlantic Distributors v. Comm\u2019r, </em>72 T.C. at 1145; <em>Uhlenbrook v. Comm\u2019r, </em>67 T.C. 818, 823 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The tax court correctly concluded, therefore, that taxpayer\u2019s $1,036,000 payment constitutes a non-deductible penalty under \u00a7 162(f). Since the $1,036,000 payment is not otherwise deductible under the provisions of the Code, \u00a7 1341 treatment of the payment is not appropriate. Treas.Regs. 1.1341-l(a)(l); <em>National Life and Accident Ins. Co. v. United States, </em>244 F.Supp. at 139-142.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Taxpayer is precluded from invoking \u00a7 1341 for another reason. Section 1341 applies where the item was included in a taxpayer\u2019s income because it then \u201cappeared\u201d that the taxpayer \u201chad an unrestricted right to such item,\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 1341(a)(1), but it was later \u201cestablished\u201d that the taxpayer\u2019s claim of right was defective, such that at the time of receipt the taxpayer did not, in fact, \u201chave an unrestricted right to such item.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 1341(a)(2). This language requires that the taxpayer\u2019s obligation to repay must arise out of the specific \u201ccircumstances, terms and conditions\u201d of the transaction whereby the amount was originally included in his income. <em>Pahl v. Comm\u2019r, </em>67 T.C. 286, 289-291 (1976); <em>Blanton v. Comm\u2019r, </em>46 T.C. 527 (1966) <em>aff'd, </em>379 F.2d 558 (5th Cir.1967); <em>Usher v. Comm\u2019r, </em>40 T.C.M. (CCH) 385, 392-393 (1980). The $1,036,000 Bailey paid in 1977 was a civil penalty imposed under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45 for his multiple violations of an FTC consent order. The payment, therefore, arose from the fact that Bailey violated the consent order, and not from the \u201ccircumstances, terms, and conditions\u201d of his original receipt of salary and dividend payments from Best-line. Indeed, the amount of the penalty was not computed with reference to the amount of his salary, dividends, and bonuses, and bears no relationship to those amounts. <em>See Uhlenbrock v. Commissioner, </em>67 T.C. 818, 823 (1977) (taxpayer\u2019s payment of addition to tax penalty is not deductible under \u00a7 1341 as a restoration of previously reported executor\u2019s commissions where the amount he received as commissions bore no relationship to the amount he later became obligated to pay). </p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Since the tax court correctly determined that the taxpayer is not entitled to invoke I.R.C. \u00a7 1341, the judgment below is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
