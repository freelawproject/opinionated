Dreifus, and Joseph Yorizzo with, <em>inter alia, </em>conspiring to violate certain reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5311 <em>et seq. </em>(1982) (the \u201cAct\u201d), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (1982). In an opinion reported at 587 F.Supp. 302 (1984), the court concluded that, as a matter of law, the defendants\u2019 acts as set forth in count 1 of the indictment and elaborated on in the government\u2019s response to defendants\u2019 challenges to the indictment could not reflect the conspiracy charges because none of the defendants was required to file any of the reports required by the Act or the regulations promulgated thereunder. On appeal, the government contends that the district court both misinterpreted the indictment and construed unduly narrowly the Act and the regulations implementing it. For the reasons below, we agree and conclude that the indictment adequately alleged that defendants conspired to violate the Act. We vacate the dismissal of counts 1 and 3 and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-15\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-16\">In response to the defense motions attacking the indictment, the government submitted to the district court the affidavit of Assistant United States Attorney Stacey J. Moritz (\u201cMoritz Affidavit\u201d), which was based principally on an examination of tapes of conversations between and among the defendants and others in the presence of an undercover Special Agent of the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) wearing a recording device. In reviewing the district court\u2019s dismissal of the indictment, we accept as true all of the allegations of the indictment, as amplified by the Moritz Affidavit. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Von Barta, </em>635 F.2d 999, 1002 (2d Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 998, 101 S.Ct. 1703, 68 L.Ed.2d 199 (1981). Contrary assertions of fact by the defendants will not be considered. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-17\">A. <em>The Government's Allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-18\">The indictment set forth a scheme in which the defendants conspired to aid an undercover agent in transferring out of the United States large amounts of United States currency and in opening a foreign interest-bearing bank account, all without disclosures to the United States Government, in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5313, 5314, 5315, and 5322(b). It charged, <em>inter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number><em>alia, </em>that defendants (1) \u201cwere engaged as a business in dealing in currency\u201d; (2) agreed to provide a money laundering service for cash transfers in the United States that would conceal the true source and holder of the funds, and agreed, as part of that scheme, \u201cto accept in excess of $3 million in cash transfers in the United States in the period October to December 1983\u201d; (3) agreed to open and assist in the opening of foreign bank accounts on the behalf of United States residents and to transfer currency to those accounts, using false documentation to conceal the true identities of the account holders; and (4) agreed they would not file currency transaction reports with respect to any of the transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">The government described the defendants\u2019 overt acts as follows. On October 19, 1983, IRS Special Agent Marc Lotz, acting undercover, met with Goldberg at United Mizrahi Bank and Trust Co. (\u201cUMB\u201d), where Goldberg was a bank officer. Lotz stated that he had hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash that he wished to move from safe deposit boxes to interest-bearing accounts outside the United States without disclosing those transactions. Later that day, Goldberg informed him that UMB could not accommodate him, and took Lotz to the North American Bank, Ltd. (\u201cNAB\u201d) to meet Dreifus, whom Goldberg introduced as manager and United States representative of NAB. Goldberg and Dreifus suggested ways in which Lotz could move his money out of the United States without notifying the United States Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">On October 20, Lotz and Goldberg spoke by telephone several times. Lotz told Goldberg that he wanted to move two or three million dollars out of the United States. Goldberg informed Lotz of the plan Goldberg and his colleagues had devised for the laundering and transfer of those funds. Lotz would give the defendants currency; he would receive in exchange a UMB bank check drawn on a UMB customer\u2019s account made payable to NAB; the NAB check would then be used to open Lotz\u2019s foreign bank account and would not be traceable to Lotz.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">Goldberg at first demanded thirty percent of any money thus laundered as the defendants' fees for the laundering. Subsequently, however, he agreed, subject to checking with his partners, to accept $25,-000 to launder the first $200,000, on the understanding that this would be a test run for the eventual laundering of a total of $3,000,000. Goldberg stressed that the federal government would never learn of the transactions nor learn that Lotz was earning interest abroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">On October 21, Lotz arrived at NAB with $200,000 in currency. He met with Goldberg and Dreifus and was introduced to Yorizzo, a retired policeman. In exchange for his $200,000, Lotz was given a UMB bank check for $175,000, drawn on Yoriz-zo\u2019s account. Upon Lotz\u2019s arrival at the meeting, Goldberg displayed a handgun and he and Yorizzo demanded to frisk Lotz for a body wire. Goldberg overrode Lotz\u2019s protests against the search, stating that precautions were necessary because they were engaged in an illegal transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">During this meeting, Goldberg and Yor-izzo began counting Lotz\u2019s cash on a machine brought to the bank by Yorizzo, and Dreifus prepared documents to open an Israeli bank account for Lotz. Two sets of papers were prepared: one under the \u201creal\u201d name Lotz was using in his undercover capacity and one under a new fictitious name. Dreifus repeatedly assured Lotz that the papers bearing his \u201creal\u201d name would be locked away. After Drei-fus had prepared the two documents, and just before Goldberg and Yorizzo had finished counting the $200,000, a team of IRS agents entered the room and arrested the three defendants. The present indictment followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">B. <em>The Proceedings Below</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">Count 1 of the indictment charged the defendants with conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; to violate 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5313 and the regulations thereunder (which require the reporting of transactions involving more than $10,000 in currency) by caus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>ing \u201cvarious financial institutions\u201d to fail to file the mandated currency transaction reports, \u201cas part of a pattern of illegal activity involving transactions exceeding $100,000 in a twelve month period.\u201d Count 1 also alleged that defendants had conspired, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, to violate 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5314, which requires the reporting of transactions with foreign financial agencies. In pretrial motions the defendants challenged the sufficiency of count 1 on the ground that the conduct alleged did not constitute a federal offense because none of the transactions engaged in by the defendants triggered a requirement under the Act for the filing of reports. The district court agreed, stating that \u201c[although defendants\u2019 actions might indicate a ready willingness to engage in criminal conduct,\u201d 587 F.Supp. at 304, the allegations of the indictment failed to describe a conspiracy to violate 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5313 or 5314.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">The court held that \u00a7 5313 was not implicated because the defendants were not financial institutions nor had they caused a financial institution to fail to file a required report. It rejected what it characterized as the government\u2019s \u201cmain contention,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>that \u201ceach defendant himself [was] a \u2018financial institution\u2019,\u201d finding that such a contention was inconsistent with the plain meaning of the Act. 587 F.Supp. at 306-07. Finding misplaced the government\u2019s reliance on the definition of \u201cfinancial institution\u201d in 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.11 (1984) as \u201c[a] person who engages as a business in dealing in or exchanging currency as, for example, a dealer in foreign exchange or a person engaged primarily in the cashing of checks,\u201d the court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeOY\">[a] single transaction between individuals involving the exchange of a check for currency \u2014 even if some future transactions are contemplated \u2014 cannot bring one within the definition of \u201cengaging as a business\u201d in exchanging currency. The example given by the regulation, \u201ca person engaged primarily in the cashing of checks,\u201d makes it clear that it does not apply to an individual whose primary occupation is something else but who embarks upon an isolated \u2014 or even a series of isolated \u2014 transactions involving the exchanging of a check for currency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">587 F.Supp. at 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">The court also concluded that the indictment did not show a conspiracy to violate \u00a7 5314 because there was no suggestion that any of the defendants had an interest in a foreign interest-bearing account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1024-8\">The Government offers no explanation of how defendants may have violated this section which appears to be directed at individuals with interests in foreign accounts. It is not even suggested that any of the defendants had any such interest. We fail to see a violation of \u00a7 5314.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-10\">Accordingly, the district court dismissed count 1 of the indictment. In addition, the court dismissed count 3, which alleged that Goldberg unlawfully possessed a firearm during the commission of the felonies charged in count 1, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2) (1982), on the ground that count 3 was dependent on count 1; and it dismissed count 4 which charged Goldberg with obstruction of justice, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503 (1982), on the ground that that offense was insufficiently pleaded. The court did not dismiss Count 2, which charged Goldberg with possession of an unregistered firearm, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861, 5871 (1982); it stayed trial on count 2 pending disposition of the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-11\">C. <em>The Issues on Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-12\">On appeal, the government does not challenge the court\u2019s dismissal of count 4, but it argues that the court erred in dismissing count 1 (and perforce count 3) because (1) the defendants could be viewed, jointly, as a financial institution within the meaning of the Act, and (2) the fact that no defendant actually possessed an interest in a foreign bank account as contemplated by \u00a7 5314 was irrelevant to the charge that they conspired to violate that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>Finding merit in both of the government\u2019s arguments, we vacate the dismissal of counts 1 and 3 and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">The Bank Secrecy Act was enacted in 1970 \u201cto require certain reports or records where they have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5311. To accomplish that end, the Act established reporting requirements for domestic transactions in United States currency and for transactions involving foreign financial agencies, and pursuant to the Act the Secretary of the Treasury (\u201cSecretary\u201d) has promulgated various regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">A. <em>The Alleged Conspiracy To Violate the Domestic Reporting Requirements of \u00a7 5313</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">The domestic reporting requirements are governed by \u00a7 5313, which provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-9\">(a) When a domestic financial institution is involved in a transaction for the payment, receipt, or transfer of United States coins or currency (or other monetary instruments the Secretary of the Treasury prescribes), in an amount, denomination, or amount and denomination, or under circumstances the Secretary prescribes by regulation, the institution and any other participant in the transaction the Secretary may prescribe shall file a report on the transaction at the time and in the way the Secretary prescribes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1025-10\">31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5313(a). Section 5322(b) of the Act provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-11\">[a] person willfully violating this sub-chapter or a regulation prescribed under this subchapter (except section 5315 of this title or a regulation prescribed under section 5315), while violating another law of the United States or as part of a pattern of illegal activity involving transactions of more than $100,000 in a 12-month period, shall be fined not more than $500,000, imprisoned for not more than 5 years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1025-12\">The regulation setting forth the reporting requirements envisioned by the Act states, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-13\">Each financial institution shall file a report of each deposit, withdrawal, exchange of currency or other payment or transfer, by, through, or to such financial institution, which involves a transaction in currency of more than $10,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj_\">31 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.22(a) (1984). Since \u00a7 5313, as implemented by the regulation, requires reports only by \u201cfinancial institution[s],\u201d the principal question on this appeal with respect to the alleged conspiracy to violate \u00a7 5313 is whether defendants\u2019 activities involved such an institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-14\">The term \u201cfinancial institution\u201d is defined in both the statute and the regulations. Section 5312(a)(2) of 31 U.S.C. provides twenty-one definitions of \u201cfinancial institution,\u201d including \u201can insured bank,\u201d \u00a7 5312(a)(2)(A); \u201ca commercial bank or trust company,\u201d \u00a7 5312(a)(2)(B); \u201ca private banker,\u201d \u00a7 5312(a)(2)(C); \u201ca currency exchange,\u201d \u00a7 5312(a)(2)(J); \u201can issuer, redeemer, or cashier of travelers\u2019 checks, checks, money orders, or similar instruments,\u201d \u00a7 5312(a)(2)(E); and \u201canother business or agency carrying out a similar, related, or substitute duty or power the Secretary of the Treasury prescribes,\u201d \u00a7 5312(a)(2)(U). The Secretary\u2019s regulations define \u201cfinancial institution\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-15\"><em>Financial institution. </em>Each agency, branch, or office within the United States of any person doing business in one or more of the capacities listed below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-16\">(1) A bank (except bank credit card systems);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-17\">(2) A broker or dealer in securities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-18\">(3) A person who engages as a business in dealing in or exchanging currency as, for example, a dealer in foreign exchange or a person engaged primarily in the cashing of checks;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-19\">(4) A person who engages as a business in the issuing, selling, or redeeming of travelers\u2019 checks, money orders, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>or similar instruments, except one who does so as a selling agent exclusively or as an incidental part of another business;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-4\">(5) A licensed transmitter of funds, or other person engaged in the business of transmitting funds abroad for others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">31 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.11. We conclude that the part of definition (3) that defines a financial institution as \u201c[a] person who engages as a business in dealing in ... currency\u201d is sufficiently broad to encompass the activity alleged in count 1 of the indictment and that its breadth reflects Congress\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">The legislative history of the Act indicates that the Act\u2019s reporting requirements were designed to provide a sweeping law enforcement tool for locating, <em>inter alia, </em>large transfers, in currency, of the proceeds of unlawful transactions. The report by the House of Representatives Committee on Banking and Currency on H.R. 15073, which eventually became the Act, noted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-7\">Criminals deal in money \u2014 cash or its equivalent. The deposit and withdrawal of large amounts of currency or its equivalent (monetary instruments) under unusual circumstances may betray a criminal activity. The money in many of these transactions may represent anything from the proceeds of a lottery racket to money for the bribery of public officials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-8\">... [The Act] requires reports of cash transactions involving such amounts, or taking place under such circumstances, as the Secretary of the Treasury shall be regulation prescribe____ These reports may be of considerable value to law enforcement agencies in criminal investigations and prosecutions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-11\">H.R.Rep. No. 975, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 11-12, <em>reprinted in </em>1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4394, 4396-97 [hereinafter cited as House Report]. <em>See also California Bankers Assn. v. Shultz, </em>416 U.S. 21, 38, 94 S.Ct. 1494, 1506, 39 L.Ed.2d 812 (1974) (\u201cCongress recognized the importance of reports of large and unusual currency transactions in ferreting out criminal activity and desired to strengthen the statutory basis for requiring such reports.\u201d); 116 Cong.Rec. 16954 (1970) (statement of Rep. Patman) (\u201cIf certain cash transactions are required to be reported to the Treasury Department, law enforcement agencies, particularly in the income tax field, will have a useful tool in their investigations and proceedings.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-13\">In seeking to ferret out those engaged in criminal activity, Congress focused on criminals\u2019 increasing use of financial institutions to preserve or conceal the proceeds of their crimes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-14\">During the last decade, law enforcement agencies have found that the increasing growth of our financial institutions has been paralleled by an increase in criminal activity utilizing these institutions. Petty criminals, members of the underworld, those engaging in \u201cwhite collar\u201d crime and income tax evaders use, in one way or another, financial institutions in carrying on their affairs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-15\">House Report at 10, <em>reprinted in </em>1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 4394, 4395. Congress also recognized that a wide range of entities could be used to effect the transfers of large amounts of cash:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-16\">The subject matter with which we deal is indeed complicated. It involves the operation not only of our domestic and foreign banking <em>but also other financial institutions </em>involved in the exchange of currency or its equivalent, the equivalent being in the form of securities, money orders and a host of other financial instruments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1026-17\">116 Cong.Rec. 16956-57 (1970) (statement of Rep. Widnall) (emphasis added). It thus sought to reach the maximum amount of criminal conduct possible, and to grant broad authority to the Secretary to impose reporting requirements.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-18\">Under the terms of [the Act], the Secretary of the Treasury is granted broad authority to impose reporting requirements on persons and <em>all other entities cognizable as legal personalties </em>[sic] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>transferring money or monetary instruments to foreign countries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 16957 (statement of Rep. Burton) (emphasis added). Congress\u2019s assumption was that the reporting requirements would be far-reaching, with the Secretary empowered to exempt normal business transactions from the reporting requirements. <em>See id. </em>at 16964-65 (statement of Rep. Hanley).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">The Secretary\u2019s definition of a financial institution, from which a report is required, as \u201c[a] person who engages as a business in dealing in ... currency,\u201d 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.11, is plainly consistent with Congress\u2019s goal of requiring reports from \u201call ... entities cognizable as legal personal[i]ties\u201d that could be used as instrumen-talities for transferring or exchanging currency. Since count 1 of the indictment, as amplified by the Moritz Affidavit, adequately charges that the defendants were engaged as a business in dealing in currency and that the defendants themselves constituted a financial institution that intended not to file reports we conclude that the indictment alleged activities that fit within this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">The district court concluded that there were two flaws in count l\u2019s allegation of a conspiracy to violate \u00a7 5313. First, it thought the indictment charged that each individual defendant was himself a financial institution, and saw such a characterization as contrary to the plain meaning of the Act. Second, the court read the indictment as charging but a single instance of currency dealing, and apparently concluded that the defendants, individually or jointly, could not be said to be in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of dealing in currency. We disagree with both views.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">As to the first, even assuming that the indictment charged that each defendant individually was a financial institution, we would not view such a characterization as outside the intended scope of the Act or the regulations. The regulations define a financial institution in part as \u201ca person.\u201d There is no indication in the statute or the regulations that a natural person cannot be considered a financial institution, and it seems strained to assume that the term \u201cperson\u201d was intended to exclude natural persons. Nor is the term \u201cperson\u201d limited to natural, discrete individuals. Section 5312(a)(4) of the Act defines \u201cperson,\u201d in part, by incorporating the definition of that' term found in 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 (1982), which encompasses corporations and partnerships. We need not determine here, however, whether the indictment properly alleged that each individual defendant constituted a financial institution, for the indictment asserted that the defendants \u201cagreed together\u201d to violate the Act\u2019s reporting requirements and that they \u201cwere engaged as a business in dealing in currency.\u201d The most natural reading of these allegations is that defendants were jointly so engaged. This view is supported by the Moritz Affidavit, which recounted, on the basis of taped conversations, that Goldberg and Dreifus suggested to Lotz various methods for transferring currency without reporting; that Goldberg\u2019s agreement on a reduced initial laundering fee was made expressly subject to his partners\u2019 approval; that Goldberg and Yorizzo insisted on searching Lotz for a wire; that Yorizzo (the only nonbanker among the defendants) brought to the bank a money-counting machine with which he and Goldberg proceeded to count Lotz\u2019s cash. Plainly it would be within the terms of the indictment for a jury to find that the defendants had acted as a partnership or joint venture to assist Lotz in laundering currency. We think it clear beyond peradventure that partnerships and joint ventures are among the entities from which Congress sought to require reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-10\">Further, we disagree with the district judge\u2019s view that the indictment failed to substantiate that the defendants engaged in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of dealing in currency because it charged that but a single transaction was involved. Rather, the government charged that the interrupted $200,000 transaction was anticipated by the defendants to be but the first of a series of laundering transactions to take place over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>the course of several months; that that first $200,000 was less than 10% of the total amount defendants agreed to launder; and that defendants agreed to reduce their 30% laundering fee by more than half for the first $200,000 in anticipation of the fees they would receive for the remainder of the planned $3 million. Thus, while we agree with the district court that the terms \u201cengage[ ] as a business\u201d or \u201cdeal[ ] in\u201d imply that ordinarily proof of more than one transaction would be required, <em>cf. United States v. Tarr, </em>589 F.2d 55, 59 (1st Cir. 1978) (\u201cdealpng] in\u201d or \u201cengagpng] in the business of\u201d firearms, within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(1) (1982), normally implies more than one isolated transaction, although court could \u201cconceive of a single transaction sufficiently large\u201d to be within statute), we conclude that the indictment alleged that a series of transactions had been agreed on and that it is a permissible inference that persons who agree to launder a total of $3 million over a three-month period for fees totaling some $900,000 are doing business. In sum, we conclude that the indictment sufficiently alleged that defendants, as a partnership or joint venture, had engaged as a business in dealing in currency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">Defendants urge us to reach the contrary conclusion by (1) interpreting the terms \u201cfinancial institution\u201d and \u201cbusiness\u201d as referring only to legitimate enterprises, (2) adopting the view of the district court that the third definition of \u00a7 103.11 reaches only persons whose \u201cprimary\u201d occupation is exchanging or dealing in currency, or (3) employing the \u201crule of lenity.\u201d We find no merit in any of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">First, the notion that the Act was meant to require reports only from legitimate entities is contrary to the entire thrust of the Act. Its very purpose was \u201cto give the Secretary authority which will facilitate investigation and prosecution of criminal activities.\u201d 116 Cong.Rec. 16957 (1970) (statement of Rep. Widnall). Thus, as to actors transferring money to a foreign country, the Act was intended to impose reporting requirements on \u201call ... entities cognizable\u201d as personalities in the eyes of the law. <em>Id. </em>(statement of Rep. Burton). We find no support for defendants\u2019 argument in the Act, in its history, or in logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">Nor is there any sound basis for imputing to Congress the intent to reach only persons whose \u201cprimary\u201d occupation was dealing in currency. Defendants point only to the second example set out in the third definition of \u00a7 103.11, which, after defining \u201cfinancial institution\u201d as \u201c[a] person who engages as a business in dealing in or exchanging in currency,\u201d illustrates by adding \u201cas, for example, a dealer in foreign exchange or a person engaged primarily in the cashing of checks.\u201d There is no indication that the word \u201cprimarily\u201d should be read as applying to the regulation\u2019s basic definition. If the Secretary had intended such a limitation, it would,have been a simple matter to insert the word \u201cprimary\u201d before \u201cbusiness,\u201d thereby defining a financial institution as a person \u201cwho engages as a <em>primary </em>business\u201d in dealing in currency. The plain fact is that the regulation was not so written, and we see no support for the proposition that defendants are outside the reach of the Act because they may have engaged in the business of money laundering only as a sideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-8\">Finally, we reject defendants\u2019 contention that the rule of lenity sometimes employed in the construction of criminal statutes, <em>see, e.g., Ladner v. United States, </em>358 U.S. 169, 177-78, 79 S.Ct. 209, 213-14, 3 L.Ed.2d 199 (1958), requires the conclusion that defendants\u2019 conduct was outside the Act\u2019s scope. The rule of lenity is used only to resolve an ambiguity, \u201cnot to ... beget one.\u201d <em>Callanan v. United States, </em>364 U.S. 587, 464 U.S. 16, 596, 81 S.Ct. 321, 326, 5 L.Ed.2d 312 (1961) (footnote omitted); <em>Russello v. United States, </em>104 S.Ct. 296, 303-04, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983). Nor is it used to narrow a statute that has an unambiguously broad thrust. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>423 U.S. 122, 145, 96 S.Ct. 335, 346, 46 L.Ed.2d 333 (1975). Since the statutory and regulatory provisions unambiguously cover the defendants\u2019 alleged conduct here, the rule of lenity does not come into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>We conclude that the indictment adequately alleged activities of the defendants that, if proven, would permit the jury to find that they jointly engaged as a business in dealing in currency and thus were a financial institution within the meaning of the Act and the regulations. The district court erred, therefore, in concluding that the indictment failed to charge defendants with conspiring to commit acts that could be found to trigger the Act\u2019s reporting requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">B. <em>The Alleged Conspiracy To Violate the Foreign Transaction Reporting Requirements of \u00a7 53H</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aajd\">The Act\u2019s reporting requirements with respect to transactions with foreign financial agencies are set forth in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5314, which, unlike \u00a7 5313, imposes those requirements on \u201cresident[s] or citizen[s] of the United States\u201d rather than on financial institutions as such. Section 5314 provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-6\">(a) Considering the need to avoid impeding or controlling the export or import of monetary instruments and the need to avoid burdening unreasonably a person making a transaction with a foreign financial agency, the Secretary of the Treasury shall require a resident or citizen of the United States or a person in, and doing business in, the United States, to keep records, file reports, or keep records and file reports, when the resident, citizen, or person makes a transaction or maintains a relation for any person with a foreign financial agency. The records and reports shall contain the following information in the way and to the extent the Secretary prescribes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-7\">(1) the identity and address of participants in a transaction or relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-8\">(2) the legal capacity in which a participant is acting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-9\">(3) the identity of real parties in interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-10\">(4) a description of the transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aax\">31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5314(a). The pertinent regulation provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-11\">Each person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States (except a foreign subsidiary of a U.S. person) having a financial interest in, or signature or other authority over, a bank, securities or other financial account in a foreign country shall report such relationship to the Secretary for each year in which such relationship exists, and shall provide such information as shall be specified in a reporting form prescribed by the Secretary to be filed by such persons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1029-12\">31 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.24 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-13\">In the present case, the district court ruled that the indictment did not sufficiently allege an offense under \u00a7 5314 because that section requires reports from an individual having an interest in foreign accounts and it was not alleged that any of the defendants had such an interest. 587 F.Supp. at 309. The court\u2019s conclusion does not follow from its premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-14\">The indictment charged defendants with conspiracy to violate \u00a7 5314, in violation of the conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. 371, not with a substantive violation of \u00a7 5314. Though there was no indication in the indictment that any of the defendants themselves had or were to acquire an interest in a foreign bank account as to which they would be required to report, count 1 fairly alleged that defendants conspired to violate \u00a7 5314 by helping Lotz to place large amounts of cash in a foreign account without reporting the fact of such transfers and by providing a service that would conceal the true source and true holder of the funds in such an account. Thus, the indictment, although it did not mention 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (1982), the aiding and abetting section, adequately set forth factual allegations which, if proven, would allow the jury to find that defendants had conspired to aid and abet Lotz in failing to report an interest in a foreign bank account. <em>See United States v. Perry, </em>643 F.2d 38, 45-46 (2d Cir.) (defendants may be convicted of conspiring to aid and abet another to commit a substantive offense), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 835, 102 S.Ct. 138, 70 L.Ed.2d 115 (1981); <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>464 F.2d 240, 242 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>n. 1 (2d Cir.1972) (aiding and abetting theory may be submitted to jury though indictment did not charge a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">Nor is the fact that there was no actual violation of \u00a7 5314 because Lotz never acquired an interest in such an account any impediment to the imposition on defendants of liability for conspiracy. A substantive offense and a conspiracy to commit that offense are separate and distinct crimes. <em>Callarian v. United States, </em>364 U.S. 587, 593, 81 S.Ct. 321, 325, 5 L.Ed.2d 312 (1961); <em>Pinkerton v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 640, 643, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 1182, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946); <em>United States v. Tombrello, </em>666 F.2d 485, 489 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 994, 102 S.Ct. 2279, 73 L.Ed.2d 1291 (1982). A defendant thus may be convicted of the crime of conspiracy even if the substantive offense was not actually committed. <em>See United States v. Rose, </em>590 F.2d 232, 235 (7th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 929, 99 S.Ct. 2859, 61 L.Ed.2d 297 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">Finally, while a person acting as an agent of the government cannot be a coconspirator, <em>see United States v. Tombrello, </em>666 F.2d at 490 n. 3; <em>United States v. Chase, </em>372 F.2d 453, 459 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>387 U.S. 907, 87 S.Ct. 1688, 18 L.Ed.2d 626 (1967), the presence of such an agent does not destroy a conspiracy in which at least two other private individuals have agreed to engage in an unlawful venture, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Elledge, </em>723 F.2d 864, 866 (11th Cir.1984), and defendants may be convicted of conspiracy even if, unbeknownst to them, the substantive crime would never have been committed because the person the coconspirators thought would commit it was actually an agent of the government, <em>see United States v. Rose, </em>590 F.2d at 235 (fact that defendants\u2019 \u201cplan was doomed because they unwittingly chose as their instrumentalities agents of the government is irrelevant to the existence of the conspiracy\u201d); <em>United States v. Seelig, </em>498 F.2d 109, 113 (5th Cir.1974) (\u201cfact that a government informant was to effect the actual distribution of the drug does not extirpate [the defendants\u2019] liability for conspiring to violate the law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">We find no merit in defendants\u2019 contentions that the indictment does not sufficiently plead conspiracy and that they did not have the requisite intent to violate \u00a7 5314. Count 1, which expressly invoked \u00a7 5314, contained sufficient factual allegations to apprise the defendants of the government\u2019s contentions as to the time, place, and nature of, and participants in, the alleged conspiracy to violate that section, as well as many overt acts allegedly done in furtherance thereof. A conspiracy to violate \u00a7 5314 was therefore adequately pleaded. <em>See Wong Tai v. United States, </em>273 U.S. 77, 80-81, 47 S.Ct. 300, 301-302, 71 L.Ed. 545 (1927) (indictment for conspiracy need not be pleaded with the same particularity as would be required of an indictment for substantive offense so long as defendant is adequately advised of what charges he must meet). To the extent that defendants argue that they lacked the requisite intent to violate \u00a7 5314, they raise factual questions to be determined at trial, not on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-8\">We have examined all of defendants\u2019 other contentions and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-10\">The dismissal of Counts 1 and 3 of the indictment is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
