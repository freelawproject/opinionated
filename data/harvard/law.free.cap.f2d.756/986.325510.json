The Ottensmeyers sought treble damages for alleged violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The gravamen of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>appellants\u2019 complaint was that the appel-lees violated the Antitrust Act by instigating a search and seizure on the appellants\u2019 business premises. According to the Ot-tensmeyers, engaging the Maryland State Police to perform the search and seizure was an unlawful ploy to squash a competing business entity. The appellants also challenged, on a monopolization of trade theory, an agreement entered into between C &amp; P and the Ottensmeyers which prohibited Mr. Ottensmeyer from participating in the operation of appellants\u2019 answering service.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">The district court awarded summary judgment in favor of C &amp; P and AT &amp; T.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the grant of summary judgment for the reasons set forth by the court below which are summarized herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">The material facts are not in dispute. In April 1976, the Ottensmeyers began operating the A.A. Answering Service under a lease arrangement with the owners Mr. and Mrs. Monk. The telephone answering service was located at 165 N. Williams Street, Bel Air, Maryland. The same address doubled as the Ottensmeyers\u2019 residence from April 1976 until March 26,1979. In April 1978, the Ottensmeyers purchased the service from the Monks and became its sole owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">The A.A. service was a traditional telephone service used primarily by medical and business professionals. Emergency and non-emergency messages were received and dispatched. By 1978, the Otten-smeyers employed 6-8 part-time employees to assist at the switchboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-11\">In March 1978, Mr. Ottensmeyer wrote to Mr. Burke, a C &amp; P sales representative, seeking verification and approval of a call diverter system. Mr. Ottensmeyer informed Mr. Burke that the diverter equipment would allow potential Washington Metropolitan customers to be diverted to a Baltimore exchange that connects to the A.A. Answering Service \u201c[tjhereby extending the territory of the Answering Service to the Washington area.\u201d Mr. Ottensmeyer did not ask Mr. Burke whether the diverter equipment could also be used to provide A.A. customers with an alternative long-distance service. On March 6, 1978, Mr. Burke responded to Mr. Ottensmeyer\u2019s inquiry by stating \u201cyour device may be arranged as you have explained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-12\">On April 21, 1978, Mr. Ottensmeyer wrote to the General Legal Counsel Division of the FCC regarding, <em>inter alia, </em>regulations governing non-toll long distance calls made with call diverter equipment. In its May 15th letter, the FCC emphasized \u201cthat the answers we are giving pertain to the interstate communication services subject to the jurisdiction of this Commission. As you may know, <em>we do not have jurisdiction over intrastate services </em>which are regulated by the various state regulatory agencies.\u201d (Emphasis added). The FCC also stated that \"[bjridging of incoming calls by a Telephone Answering Service to another number is permissible with respect to interstate service ... but a company would have to be licensed to provide interstate communication services by reselling private-line service acquired from another common carrier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>In August 1978, Ottensmeyer installed two C &amp; P residential lines in a warehouse in Savage, Maryland. The two local lines were \u201cpatched\u201d or interconnected, which allowed non-toll calls between parties in the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. areas. The calls would have normally been subject to long distance rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-4\">On September 28,1978, a C &amp; P installer-repairman reported installing a residential service in a warehouse district in Savage, Maryland. He also reported observing two other residential lines at that business location.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">Mr. Tracy, of C &amp; P\u2019s Rate and Tariff Department, notified Ottensmeyer by telephone that subscribing to residential service in a business location violated Maryland\u2019s tariff laws. Prom the phone conversation Tracy learned that Ottensmeyer was providing non-toll patched service to Baltimore-Washington customers. A C &amp; P commercial manager sent four letters to Ottensmeyer confirming Tracy\u2019s phone conversation and informing Ottensmeyer that 1) the resale of telephone service<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 2) the maintenance of residential exchanges in an industrial district<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> violated Maryland\u2019s tariff laws and therefore his Savage, Maryland lines would be suspended on October 24, 1978. The service was in fact suspended on November 3, 1978. Ottensmeyer never responded to the four letters nor did he petition to the Maryland Public Service Commission (hereinafter P.S.C.) for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-10\">At approximately the time that Otten-smeyer set up the patching service in Savage, Maryland, a similar patching service was established by him at 165 N. Williams Street, Bel Air, Maryland. The patched lines at Bel Air permitted customers to make non-toll calls anywhere from Cardiff, Maryland (or Delta, Pennsylvania \u2014 which had local calling access to Cardiff) to the Baltimore metropolitan area. Ottensmeyer advised prospective and actual customers using the Bel Air patching service that the service was lawful. Any customers having doubts about the legality of the long distance patching service were shown a copy of the FCC letter received by Ottensmeyer (as previously mentioned, the FCC letter passed no judgment on the legality of <em>intrastate </em>non-toll service). Ottensmeyer did not inform any customers of C &amp; P\u2019s stated position regarding the patching of local telephone lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-11\">C &amp; P soon learned that non-metered long distance calls were being made between Harford County, Maryland and Baltimore. As a result, Heil, a C &amp; P Security Manager, conducted an investigation of Ot-tensmeyer\u2019s 165 N. Williams Street operation. Heil learned that ten <em>residential </em>phones, permitting service between Bel Air and Baltimore, were being used on AA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>premises.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As part of his investigation, he monitored the number of outgoing calls made on the ten residential lines. Heil discovered, for example, one of the residential phone lines subscribed to by Mr. Otten-smeyer\u2019s father carried 920 outgoing calls within a fifteen day period. The other numbers revealed similarly heavy \u201cnon-residential\u201d use. Heil also made several test calls through the patching system, using the appellant\u2019s secret code, and confirmed the fact that intrastate calls could be made which avoided state tolling charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">After Heil concluded his investigation, he informed a C &amp; P attorney that he believed Ottensmeyer was defrauding C &amp; P by using residential lines for business purposes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He also informed the attorney about the long distance patching system.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After receiving Heil\u2019s report, the C &amp; P attorney wrote to the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Harford County about the possible violations of Maryland\u2019s laws being committed by Ottensmeyer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">Heil submitted, in response to a request from the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney for Harford County, his investigative findings to the Maryland State Police. The case was turned over to police officer Kelly. Kelly was specially trained in electronic surveillance techniques and telephone company operations. He conducted an independent investigation of the call diverting system stemming from 165 N. Williams Street. On the basis of his investigation, Kelly reasoned that \u201can illegal scheme is being employed by Gregory Ottensmeyer ... to defraud the C &amp; P Telephone Co. of its duly earned long distance tariffs and that said fraud is being conducted ... with an illegal telephone device which \u2018cross connects\u2019 or \u2018patches\u2019 these dialing areas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-12\">Kelly accordingly applied to Judge Albert P. Close of the Circuit Court, Harford County, Maryland, for a search warrant. In his affidavit, Kelly informed the judge of his experience in the electronic field and of his independent investigation and conclusions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Judge Close issued a warrant that \u201ccommanded\u201d the Maryland State Police, \u201cwith the necessary and proper assistance,</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>including C &amp; P Telephone personnel,\u201d to enter the premises at 165 N. Williams Street and conduct the authorized search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-4\">The search was executed on March 26, 1979. The police were accompanied by Heil and other C &amp; P personnel. The search lasted approximately six hours. Records and patching/diverter equipment were seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">Following the search, the C &amp; P attorney authorized the sending of a letter to Otten-smeyer notifying him that his telephone services would be suspended due to contravention of Maryland\u2019s tariffs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On April 17, 1979, Ottensmeyer\u2019s attorney requested an informal conference with the P.S.C. to discuss the termination of A.A.\u2019s telephone service. A meeting was held on April 26 between Ottensmeyer\u2019s attorney and the attorney for C &amp; P.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-18\">Appellants\u2019 counsel inquired as to whether an agreement could be structured which would permit the continuation of A.A.\u2019s telephone services. C &amp; P and appellants\u2019 attorney agreed that A.A. could continue to offer traditional telephone answering service provided that Mr. Ottensmeyer was not involved in the operation (\u201cAgreement\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As a result, the A.A. Answering Service was leased to Mrs. O\u2019Brien, Mr. Ottensmeyer\u2019s mother, and Mr. Ottensmeyer moved from the premises at 165 N. Williams Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-19\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-20\">While the Supreme Court has warned that \u201csummary procedures should be used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>sparingly in complex antitrust litigation,\u201d <em>Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., </em>368 U.S. 464, 473, 82 S.Ct. 486, 491, 7 L.Ed.2d 458 (1962), it has also acknowledged the propriety of granting summary judgment in limited instances. \u201cWhile we recognize the importance of preserving litigants\u2019 rights to a trial on their claims, we are not prepared to extend those rights to the point of requiring that anyone who files an antitrust complaint setting forth a valid cause of action be entitled to a full-dress trial notwithstanding the absence of any significant probative evidence tending to support the complaint.\u201d <em>First National Bank of Arizona v. Cities Service Co., </em>391 U.S. 253, 290, 88 S.Ct. 1575, 1593, 20 L.Ed.2d 569 (1968). Thus, when antitrust allegations are mere \u201cwindow dressing\u201d or are simply thrown in as a shotgun approach for relief, we have granted a defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>See, e.g., Universal Lite Distributors, Inc. v. Northwest Industries, Inc., </em>452 F.Supp. 1206, 1210-1211 (D.Md.1978), <em>affirmed, </em>602 F.2d 1173, 1175 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">In granting summary judgment in favor of the appellees on the appellants\u2019 \u00a7 1 claim, the district court emphasized the glaring lack of evidence suggesting a conspiracy between C &amp; P and AT &amp; T. The existence of a conspiracy is.critical to a \u00a7 1 claim. <em>See Murdaugh Volkswagen, Inc. v. First National Bank of South Carolina, </em>639 F.2d 1073, 1075 (4th Cir.1981) (\u201cwhat is dispositive is the utter failure of plaintiff to show that the two defendants either <em>conspired </em>or acted <em>jointly </em>to injure the [plaintiffs]\u201d) (emphasis in original). In viewing the appellants\u2019 case as the trial court did on the appellees\u2019 motion for summary judg<em>ment</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014 i.e., by drawing all inferences in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion for summary judgment \u2014 we must agree with the district court that the appellants failed to present a genuine issue as to the existence of a conspiracy or \u201ccombination\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1. The appellants simply made conclusory assertions of conspiratorial conduct. There was absolutely nothing in the record to suggest that C &amp; P and AT &amp; T acted in combination to have the appellants\u2019 premises searched or their answering service terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-10\">In granting summary judgment in favor of the appellees on appellants\u2019 \u00a7 2 monopolization claim, the district court relied heavily on a recent extension of the <em>Noerr-Pen-nington </em>doctrine. Essentially, in their \u00a7 2 claim, the appellants were arguing that C &amp; P\u2019s complaint to the Maryland State Police and the resulting search and seizure constituted an unreasonable anti-competitive act which simply served to further C &amp; P\u2019s own monopolistic position in the long distance telephone market. The Supreme Court, however, has limited the reach of \u00a7 1 and \u00a7 2 by immunizing anti-competitive conduct undertaken to persuade or petition government entities, or to utilize judicial or quasi-judicial mechanisms.\u201d The grant of immunization has come to be called the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine. The two Supreme Court cases which gave rise to the doctrine are <em>Eastern R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., </em>365 U.S. 127, 81 S.Ct. 523, 5 L.Ed.2d 464 (1961) and <em>United Mine Workers of America v. Pennington, </em>381 U.S. 657, 85 S.Ct. 1585, 14 L.Ed.2d 626 (1965).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>The policies behind the <em>NoerrPennington </em>doctrine include preserving an individual\u2019s first amendment right to petition government officials and encouraging the free flow of ideas to political bodies in order to ensure intelligent decisionmaking. The Supreme Court in <em>Noerr </em>noted that, if attempts to influence the passage and enforcement of laws were not protected, the Sherman Act would regulate \u201cpolitical activity\u201d and not \u201cbusiness activity.\u201d Even if people or business entities petition their legislators with anticompetitive intent, their .conduct is still protected under the doctrine. The Supreme Court realistically concluded that people who lobby before their representatives usually, if not always, are seeking to further their own interests at the expense of others. It is the legislators\u2019 duty then to act as the ultimate arbiters of what serves the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\">There are, not surprisingly, some constraints upon the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine\u2019s grant of immunity. The Court in <em>Noerr </em>stressed that if the publicity campaign or lobbying effort were a \u201cmere sham\u201d intended to obfuscate \u201cwhat is actually nothing more than an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor\u201d the party would be held in violation of the Sherman Act. 365 U.S. at 144, 81 S.Ct. at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">The <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine has recently been extended to include information given to police which leads to anti-competitive consequences. <em>See Forro Precision, Inc. v. International Business Machines Corp., </em>673 F.2d 1045, 1059-1060 (9th Cir. 1982). Before <em>Forro, </em>the doctrine had been limited to communications within a legislative, administrative or judicial forum and to communications directed at executive officials or agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-8\">The facts in <em>Forro, </em>to some degree, parallel the instant case. IBM developed a new disk storage device. It discovered that its security had been violated and that the new design was prematurely \u201cout\u201d on the market. IBM suspected Forro and other enterprises of trade secret thievery and approached law enforcement officials about the matter. A warrant was issued to search the Forro facility as well as several other locations. IBM officials accompanied and assisted the San Jose police during the search at the Forro plant. Drawings, price lists and other records were seized. The search lasted twelve hours. It was widely publicized in computer trade journals. No indictment was ever sought against Forro. The court in <em>Forro </em>held that \u201cIBM\u2019s invocation of police assistance, which resulted in an investigation and a search of Forro\u2019s plant, may not serve as the basis of an antitrust claim because these actions are accorded immunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1058.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-9\">The court, in deeming IBM\u2019s actions immune from liability under the Sherman Act, acknowledged that communications to police do not constitute the type of \u201cpolitical activity\u201d protected by the <em>Noerr-Penning-ton </em>doctrine. However, the court in <em>Forro </em>noted that \u201cthe public policies served by ensuring the free flow of information to the police\u201d were equally as strong as the policies served by the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 1060. Specifically, the Ninth Circuit found that the police would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>be handicapped in protecting the public if people feared that information offered to officials would give rise to an antitrust violation; that is, there would be a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on information given to police if the Sherman Act hovered ominously overhead. The court in <em>Forro </em>addressed the <em>sham </em>exception originated in <em>Noerr </em>and noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-4\">If, in the case before us, IBM had provided the police with deliberately false information, <em>solely </em>for the purpose of harassing Forro or of achieving other ends unrelated to law enforcement, its conduct would unquestionably come within the sham exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1060 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-6\">Based on the first amendment concerns enunciated in <em>Noerr </em>and its progeny, we agree with the district court that <em>Forro </em>is a logical, proper extension of the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine. The \u201csham\u201d exception still applies and therefore provides a necessary safeguard against abusing the privilege of immunity. We further agree with the district court that the sham exception is inapplicable in the instant case \u2014 especially in light of police officer Kelly\u2019s expertise in telephone operations and independent assertion of wrongdoing. In other words, Kelly\u2019s independent investigation, which supported his affidavit for a search warrant, effectively nullified any allegations of a sham on the part of C &amp; P. Thus, C &amp; P's communications with the police and the subsequent search and seizure were not acts in violation of the Sherman Act. As a result, the appellants\u2019 antitrust claims must fail as a matter of law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1059-15\">. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-16\">Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1060-9\">Section'2 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1060-10\">Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A14\">The Ottensmeyers also asserted several pendent state claims <em>(e.g., </em>malicious prosecution, malicious abuse of process, trespass) against the appellee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1060-13\">.

Any person or persons found guilty of a violation of any of the provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall, upon conviction thereof, be imprisoned not exceeding six months or fined not exceeding five hundred dollars, or both, in the discretion of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">(\u00a7 194A was repealed by Acts 1978, Ch. 849, \u00a7 4 effective July 1, 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1063-9\">.

In addition to their claim for damages, the appellants sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief which would essentially prohibit the enforcement of the Agreement reached between appellants\u2019 attorney and C &amp; Pi The theory for the injunctive relief apparently rested on the fact that such an agreement was an unlawful restraint of trade or attempt to monopolize telephone services within Maryland. After eight days of hearings on the motion for a preliminary injunction, the district court ordered that appellants\u2019 request be denied. No appeal was taken by the appellants on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-23\">Given that C &amp; P had the authority to completely terminate AA's service for failure to comply with Maryland's tariff laws, it is difficult to imagine how the compromise C &amp; P agreed to\u2014 <em>i.e., </em>allowing AA\u2019s services to continue on condition that Mr. Ottensmeyer did not participate in its operations \u2014 constitutes an illegal restraint of trade. Suffice it to say, that the appellants \u00a7 2 claim based on the Agreement lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-24\">It should be noted that C &amp; P has stipulated that it will release Mr. Ottensmeyer from the terms of the Agreement inhibiting his involvement at the end of the present litigation if Mr. Ottensmeyer agrees to comply with Maryland\u2019s tariffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">. The appellate court must search the record to determine whether there is a genuine issue as to any material fact. \"The general standard that an appellate court applies in reviewing the grant or denial of a summary judgment motion is the same as that employed by the trial court initially under Rule 56(c)____\u201d <em>See </em>10 C.

In <em>Noerr, </em>the lobbying and publicity campaign launched by a group of railroads to foster the adoption and retention of certain state laws injurious to the trucking business was held not to be violative of the Sherman Act. Likewise, in <em>Pennington, </em>the attempts by large coal companies to secure favorable action from the Secretary of Labor \u2014 action which would be injurious to smaller coal producers \u2014 was held not to constitute an antitrust violation. <em>Pennington </em>emphasized that communications directed at executive officials or agencies \u2014 in contrast to the legislative and publicity efforts involved in <em>Noerr </em>\u2014 were protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-12\">Another case frequently cited when discussing the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine is <em>California Mo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number><em>tor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, </em>404 U.S. 508, 92 S.Ct. 609, 30 L.Ed.2d 642 (1972). <em>California Motor Transport </em>expanded the <em>Noerr-Pennington </em>doctrine to include administrative and adjudicative proceedings. <em>California Motor Transport </em>not only extended the applicability of the doctrine but it also unequivocally articulated its constitutional underpinnings. In <em>Noerr, </em>while the Supreme Court recognized that the failure to grant immunity for the conduct in question \u201cwould raise important constitutional questions,\" 365 U.S. at 137-138, 81 S.Ct. at 529-530, the Court actually rested its decision on principles of statutory construction. That is, the Court simply held that the Act did not apply to the \"mere solicitation of government action.\" 365 U.S. at 138, 81 S.Ct. at 530. However, the Court in <em>California Motor Transport </em>squarely held that first amendment rights of petition and association would be violated if groups could not \"use the channels and procedures of state and federal agencies and courts to advocate their causes and points of view respecting resolution of their business and economic interests <em>vis-a-vis </em>their competitors.\u201d 404 U.S. at 510-511, 92 S.Ct. at 611-612.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1066-8\">. In addition to entering summary judgment in favor of the appellees, the district court dismissed the appellants' pendent state claims for want of jurisdiction. The appellants contended that dismissal was improper especially since the statute of limitations on their state claims had run during the pendency of their federal action. However, there is no rule whereby district courts must exercise jurisdiction over time-barred state claims. Whether a trial court chooses to relinquish jurisdiction over time-barred state claims is a matter left to its sound discretion. <em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 727-729, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 1139-1141, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966).
