NEWMAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">Ethel Tolany appeals from the judgment of the District Court for the Southern District of New York (Abraham D. Sofaer, Judge) dismissing her complaint pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Tolany sought review of a final determination of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cSecretary\u201d) denying her application for widow\u2019s disability insurance benefits under the Social Security Act (\u201cAct\u201d). We conclude that Tolany\u2019s application must be remanded to the Secretary for consideration of new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">Appellant is a 59-year-old widow with a long history of urinary incontinence and hypothyroidism. She filed an application for widow\u2019s disability insurance benefits on October 21,1980, which was denied both on initial review and on reconsideration. Appellant was granted a <em>de novo </em>hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) on October 21, 1981. At the hearing the appellant described the unfortunate consequences of her condition. She testified that she urinates between five and ten times per hour, sometimes experiencing painful spasms, and that, when a bathroom is not readily available, involuntary voiding occurs with the same frequency. Despite her use of diapers whenever she goes out in public, the urine often is not contained and soils her clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-16\">The ALT denied appellant\u2019s disability claim. He found that appellant had proven that she suffered from urinary stress incontinence and hypothyroidism, but that these conditions were not severe enough to be considered the equivalent of the impairments set forth in the Secretary\u2019s \u201cListing of Impairments,\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404 subpart P, app. 1 (1984).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His decision became the final decision of the Secretary when the Appeals Council declined a request for review on February 10, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-17\">Appellant commenced this action in the District Court to review the decision of the Secretary pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1982). The Secretary moved for judgment on the pleadings. Appellant\u2019s affidavit in opposition to that motion included a September 1, 1983, medical report of Dr. Ivan Bodis-Wollner, indicating that appellant suffers from a \u201cdemyelinating disease.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court granted the motion, thereby affirming the administrative denial of disability benefits. The Court also ruled that the Bodis-Wollner report did not warrant a remand to the Secretary. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-18\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b341-19\">To qualify for <em>widow\u2019s </em>disability insurance benefits, appellant must meet a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>more stringent standard than that applicable to <em>wage-earner </em>claimants: \u201ca widow\u2019s disability must be sufficiently severe to preclude an individual from engaging in \u2018any\u2019 gainful activity, whereas a wage earner\u2019s disability need be sufficient to preclude an individual from engaging in any \u2018substantial\u2019 gainful activity.\u201d <em>Gallagher v. Schweiker, </em>697 F.2d 82, 84 n. 2 (2d Cir.1983). <em>Compare </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A) <em>with id. </em>\u00a7 423(d)(2)(B). Moreover, in determining whether a widow is disabled, the Secretary does not consider the \u201cage, education and work experience\u201d of the claimant. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1577 (1984). These two differences, a higher substantive standard and a slightly modified methodology, distinguish the disability determination for widows<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the disability determination for wage earners. The different substantive standard applicable to widows does not, however, imply additional differences in methodology. <em>See Smith v. Schweiker, </em>671 F.2d 789, 793 (3d Cir.1982) (\u201c[W]hile the test for determining entitlement to disability benefits may be different for widows than for wage earners, ... the process of evaluating the evidence of a claimant\u2019s impairment is not.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">The basic procedure for determining disability under the Act is set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520. That section provides that the Secretary shall follow what has come to be called the \u201csequential evaluation process.\u201d The use of this procedure is not discretionary; it is a regulatory requirement. <em>City of New York v. Heckler, </em>742 F.2d 729, 732 (2d Cir.1984). We recently summarized the five steps that section 404.1520 requires in the determination of disability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">The first step in the sequential process is a decision whether the claimant is engaged in \u201csubstantial gainful activity.\u201d If so, benefits are denied. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a), (b), 416.920(a), (b) (1983). If not, the second step is a decision whether the claimant\u2019s medical condition or impairment is \u201csevere.\u201d If not, benefits are denied. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(c), 416.920(c). If the impairment is \u201csevere,\u201d the third step is a decision whether the claimant\u2019s impairments meet or equal the \u201cListing of Impairments\u201d set forth in subpart P, app. 1, of the social security regulations, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.-1520(d), 416.920(d). These are impairments acknowledged by the Secretary to be of sufficient severity to preclude gainful employment. If a claimant\u2019s condition meets or equals the \u201clisted\u201d impairments, he or she is conclusively presumed to be disabled and entitled to benefits. If the claimant\u2019s impairments do not satisfy the \u201cListing of Impairments,\u201d the fourth step is assessment of the individual\u2019s \u201cresidual functional capacity,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>his capacity to engage in basic work activities, and a decision whether the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity permits him to engage in his prior work. If the residual functional capacity is consistent with prior employment, benefits are denied. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(e), 416.920(e). If not, the fifth and final step is a decision whether a claimant, in light of his residual functional capacity, age, education, and work experience, has the capacity to perform \u201calternative occupations available in the national economy.\u201d <em>Decker v. Harris, </em>647 F.2d 291, 298 (2d Cir.1981); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.-1520(f), 416.920(f). If not, benefits are awarded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-8\"><em>City of New York v. Heckler, supra, </em>742 F.2d at 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">The Act explicitly authorizes the Secretary to promulgate regulations to guide determination of whether a widow\u2019s impairments are sufficiently \u201csevere\u201d to preclude any gainful activity. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(B). In addition to the basic procedure for determining disability set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520, the Secretary has promulgated regulations specifically applicable to disability claims of widows. Section 404.1577 emphasizes the stricter statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>tory standard \u2014 preclusion of <em>any </em>gainful activity \u2014 and also states that age, education, and work experience will not be considered. Section 404.1578 provides that disability will be found if a widow\u2019s impairments have specific clinical findings that are \u201cthe same as those for any impairment\u201d on the Listing of Impairments in Appendix 1 or are \u201cmedically equivalent\u201d to those for any listed impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">It is not clear how the basic procedure outlined in section 404.1520 for all disability determinations fits with the provisions of sections 404.1577 and 404.1578 pertaining to widows. At least the first three of the sequential steps of section 404.1520 appear to apply fully to widows. Thus, a widow will be denied disability insurance benefits if (1) she is engaged in \u201csubstantial gainful activity,\u201d <em>compare </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a), (b), <em>with id. </em>\u00a7 404.1578(b); (2) her medical condition or impairment is not \u201csevere,\u201d <em>compare id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(c) <em>with id. </em>\u00a7 404.1578(a)(1) <em>and id. </em>404.-1525(a); or (3) her impairments are not the same as or the equivalent of any impairment on the Listing of Impairments, <em>compare id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(d) <em>with id. </em>\u00a7 404.-1578(a)(1). Furthermore, because section 404.1577 explicitly precludes consideration of the claimant\u2019s age, education, and work experience, there is no doubt that the fifth step of the basic sequential procedure is not applicable to widows to the extent that it requires consideration of these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">What is unclear is the extent to which the Secretary\u2019s regulations require some consideration of a widow\u2019s residual functional capacity. Such consideration is included in step four of the basic sequential procedure, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(e). For claimants with a severe impairment not listed or equivalent to a listed impairment, residual functional capacity is determined, first, to see if the claimant can perform prior work, <em>id., </em>and, if not, then to see if the claimant can perform other work, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(f). The special procedure for widows does not mention residual functional capacity, but this does not necessarily mean it may be ignored. Indeed, the explicit statement in section 404.1577 that age, education, and work experience \u2014 three of the factors listed in step five of the basic procedure \u2014 will not be considered suggests that the other factor mentioned in step five \u2014 residual functional capacity \u2014 will be considered. Moreover, the procedure for widows explains that disability <em>will be found </em>if the claimant <em>has </em>a listed impairment or the equivalent; it does not state that such an impairment is the only basis for meeting the statutory standard. If a claimant has an impairment that is not listed and is not the medical equivalent of a listed impairment, but the claimant nevertheless is unable to engage in any gainful activity, it is difficult to see how that person may be denied benefits. It would seem anomalous if an impairment that is only presumed to be disabling because it is listed results in allowance of benefits, yet an impairment that in fact leaves the claimant without the residual functional capacity to engage in any gainful activity is insufficient to warrant benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">The basic procedure and the widow\u2019s procedure might be reconciled by considering residual functional capacity in the determination of whether the claimant\u2019s impairment, if unlisted, is nonetheless equivalent to a listed impairment. The regulations make clear that a determination of medical equivalence must be based on medical evidence, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1526(b), and that \u201c[rjesidual functional capacity is a medical assessment,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 404.1545(a). Moreover, every claimant, including an applicant for widow\u2019s benefits, is required to submit \u201cmedical evidence\u201d that is \u201ccomplete and detailed enough\u201d to allow a determination of the nature of a claimant\u2019s impairments, their probable duration, and the claimant\u2019s \u201cresidual functional capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.-1513(d). It would be entirely understandable that benefits would be denied after a determination that a widow did not have an impairment equivalent to a listed impairment if that conclusion were based on a determination that the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity left the claimant with adequate capacity to perform \u201cany\u201d gainful activity. On the other hand, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity leaves that person unable to perform any such activity, then it is difficult to see how the impairment could fail to be the equivalent of some impairment on a list of what purports to be impairments \u201cconsidered severe enough to prevent a person from doing any gainful activity.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-1525(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">In this case, there was no assessment of the claimant's residual functional capacity, and the claimant, focusing on other issues in the litigation, has not posed the issue in terms that would prompt the Secretary to enlighten us as to what role residual functional capacity plays in determining a widow\u2019s claim or how the regulations are fairly to be understood in the event that residual functional capacity is to be ignored. In these circumstances and since the matter must be returned to the Secretary for further consideration in any event because of the report of Dr. Bodis-Wollner, we deem it inappropriate at this stage to do more than identify the issue for the Secretary\u2019s further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Dr. Bodis-Wollner\u2019s report of September 1, 1983, written after the Appeals Council denied review, sheds considerable new light on the seriousness of Tolany\u2019s condition. The report supplies the first diagnosis that attributes her incontinence to a demyelinating disease, by which her counsel states the doctor has said he means multiple sclerosis. This is not simply the application of \u201cspecific medical terminology\u201d to symptoms that had been observed for years, as was the case in <em>Mongeur v. Heckler, </em>722 F.2d 1033, 1038 (2d Cir.1983). In that case the alleged new evidence was only the designation \u201corganic brain syndrome\u201d applied to mental deficiencies that had been fully disclosed and evaluated in the past. Here a treating physician has for the first time diagnosed a neurological cause of Tolany\u2019s serious condition, which had previously been assessed and treated only as a urological impairment. Her condition must now be assessed in relation to the neurological impairments listed in Appendix 1, \u00a7\u00a7 11.00-11.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Furthermore, Dr. Bodis-Wollner\u2019s report provides significant new information as to whether Tolany\u2019s incontinence can be controlled by medication. The Secretary has argued that Tolany\u2019s incontinence \u201ccan be treated with drugs.\u201d Brief for Appellee at 16. However, as the Secretary also acknowledges, <em>id. </em>at 9, the only support for this conclusion in the record before the AU was the report of Dr. Elliot Leiter. His report stated that \u201cit is not possible for me to say, at the present time, whether this incontinence will be refractory to treatment.\u201d He added that the findings suggest that treatment with drugs <em>\u201cmight </em>help\u201d (emphasis in original). Now Dr. Bo-dis-Wollner reports that although Tolany has been taking the medication prescribed by Dr. Leiter, the medication \u201cappears to have had very little effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Dr. Bodis-Wollner\u2019s report satisfies the restrictive standards for a remand established by the amended version of section 205(g) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). The new evidence is material, and good cause for not presenting it earlier arises from the fact that the doctor\u2019s diagnosis was based on a recent neurological evaluation and laboratory data, and his assessment of her response to medication necessarily had to await some period of observation. <em>See Burton v. Heckler, </em>724 F.2d 1415, 1418 (9th Cir.1984); <em>Dorsey v. Heckler, </em>702 F.2d 597, 605-06 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Goerg v. Schweiker, </em>643 F.2d 582, 584 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Finally, we note that a remand will enable the Secretary to clarify the unarticu-lated assessment that she contends the AU implicitly made of the claimant\u2019s pain and the relationship of that pain, in conjunction with her other symptoms, to her overall ability to engage in any gainful activity. <em>See DeLeon v. Secretary, </em>734 F.2d 930, 937 (2d Cir.1984); <em>Marcus v. Cal-ifano, </em>615 F.2d 23, 27 (2d Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the cause remanded with directions to remand to the Secretary for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b341-13\">. The two parts of the Listing of Impairments most pertinent to Tolany\u2019s claim, as it was presented to the ALJ, are section 6.00 <em>et seq. </em>relating to the genito-urinary system and section 9.00 <em>et seq. </em>relating to the endocrine system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b341-20\">. The most common demyelinating disease is multiple sclerosis. At oral argument counsel for appellant asserted that Dr. Bodis-Wollner would have used this term in his diagnosis of appellant but for the negative psychological effect it might have had on her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b342-6\">. We use the term \"widow\" throughout only for convenience. Nothing in this opinion is intended to distinguish widows from other persons treated similarly by the Act and regulations, <em>e.g., </em>widowers and surviving divorced wives. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(B); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1577.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
