Because the bankruptcy court awarded attorney\u2019s fees in a relief from stay action, the disposition of which was governed entirely by federal law, pursuant to a state law which applied only to actions \u201con a contract,\u201d we affirm the district court\u2019s reversal of this award.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">The Johnsons purchased from the Righ-etti family a parcel of land which comprises a cattle ranch. The Righettis hold a promissory note secured by a first deed of trust against this parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-13\">In November 1982, after ceasing to make payments to the Righettis under the promissory note, the Johnsons filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. In May 1983, the Johnsons still had not made any payments to the Righettis and the Righet-tis filed a request for relief from the automatic stay, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d)(1), to foreclose upon their deed of trust. The Johnsons began payments again in July 1983. The bankruptcy court denied the Righettis\u2019 request for relief from the automatic stay and awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the Johnsons as the prevailing party under California Civil Code section 1717.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-17\">The Righettis appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to the district court. The district court affirmed the denial of the request for relief from the automatic stay but reversed the award of attorney\u2019s fees to the Johnsons. The Johnsons appeal the district court\u2019s order denying them attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-18\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b811-19\">The bankruptcy court awarded the John-sons attorney\u2019s fees incurred in opposing the Righettis\u2019 motion for relief from the automatic stay. It based this award upon California Civil Code section 1717. Section 1717 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-20\"><em>In any action on a contract, </em>where the contract specifically provides that attorney\u2019s fees and costs, which are incurred to enforce the provisions of that contract, shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party, then the party who is determined to be the prevailing party, whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in addition to costs and necessary disbursements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-21\">Cal.Civ.Code \u00a7 1717(a) (emphasis added). Because the promissory note and deed of trust securing it provided that the John-sons would pay any attorney\u2019s fees or costs the Righettis incurred in enforcing them, the bankruptcy court found section 1717 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>applicable and awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the party prevailing in the motion for relief from the automatic stay \u2014 i.e., the John-sons.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The district court reversed the award of attorney\u2019s fees, finding that the bankruptcy court had ignored the opening phrase of section 1717 in awarding such fees in stay proceedings. On its face, section 1717 applies only to actions \u201con a contract.\u201d The district court held that a request for relief from the automatic stay, brought under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d), is an action based on a federal statute and not on a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The question for determination here, then, is whether a motion for relief from an automatic stay pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d) is an \u201caction on a contract\u201d to which California law should be applied. Although the Righettis were seeking relief from the automatic stay in order to foreclose under the deed of trust, both case law and the nature of stay relief proceedings support the conclusion that stay relief proceedings are not actions \u201con a contract\u201d to which California law . should be applied. <em>See In re Coast Trading Co., </em>744 F.2d 686, 693 (9th Cir.1984) (\u201cthe question of the applicability of the bankruptcy laws to particular contracts is not a question of the enforceability of a contract but rather involves a unique, separate area of federal law\u201d). <em>Cf. In re Fulwiler, </em>624 F.2d 908 (9th Cir.1980) (nondischargeability proceeding in bankruptcy is not one in tort or contract to which state law providing for attorney\u2019s fees should apply).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">After a debtor files a Chapter 11 petition, he is protected by the automatic stay provision of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a) until an adequate plan takes hold. <em>See </em>Revisor\u2019s Note to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362. <em>See also In re BBT, </em>11 B.R. 224, 232 (Bankr.D.Nev.1981). To obtain relief from an automatic stay, a creditor may bring a request pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d). Section 362(d) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">On request of a party in interest and after notice and a hearing, the court shall grant relief from the stay provided under subsection (a) of this section, such as by terminating, annulling, modifying, or conditioning such stay\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-12\">(1) for cause, including the lack of adequate protection of an interest in property of such party in interest; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-13\">(2) with respect to a stay of an act against property, if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-14\">(A) the debtor does not have an equity in such property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-15\">(B) such property is not necessary to an effective reorganization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-16\">11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-17\">Stay litigation is limited to issues of the lack of adequate protection, the debt- or\u2019s equity in the property, and the necessity of the property to an effective reorganization. Hearings on relief from the automatic stay are thus handled in a summary fashion. <em>In re Cedar Bayou, Ltd., </em>456 F.Supp. 278, 284 (W.D.Pa.1978). The validity of the claim or contract underlying the claim is not litigated during the hearing. The action seeking relief from the stay is not the assertion of a claim which would give rise to the right or obligation to assert a counterclaim. <em>In re Essex Properties, Ltd., </em>430 F.Supp. 1112 (N.D.Cal.1977). <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 989, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 55, <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News, 5787, 5841. Thus, the state law governing contractual relationships is not considered in stay litigation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-18\">State law, therefore, is not ordinarily applied by the bankruptcy court to an action brought pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d). The Righettis\u2019 action, brought pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d), was predicated solely upon a federal statute and California state law was. not applied to any of the substantive issues involved. Thus, the bankruptcy court should not have applied the state substantive law awarding attorney\u2019s fees in this case. It is true that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>the bankruptcy court has authority to apply either state substantive law or federal substantive law, but the choice depends on the nature of the action involved. <em>See, e.g., In re Sparkman, </em>703 F.2d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir.1983) (because California state law governed the substantive issues involved in Sparkman\u2019s counterclaim filed in proof of claim litigation, it was appropriate to award attorney\u2019s fees under state statute); <em>In re Sonoma V, </em>23 B.R. 789, 796 (Bankr. 9th Cir.1982) (when a federal bankruptcy court exercises jurisdiction over a dispute involving state law (breach of contract action), state law with respect to attorney\u2019s fees applies). When, as here, federal and not state law governed the substantive issues involved in the Righettis\u2019 motion, the bankruptcy court should not have awarded attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to a state statute. <em>Cf. Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 259 n. 31, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 1622 n. 31, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975) (award of attorney's fees in federal litigation reversed as contrary to the \u201cAmerican Rule\u201d followed by federal courts under which attorney\u2019s fees are not recoverable by prevailing litigant in the absence of contrary federal statutory authorization\u2014 however, in diversity cases where state law governs, state provisions for such fees may be applied).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The Johnsons contend that this circuit applied section 1717 in a bankruptcy case, <em>In re Eastview Estates II, </em>713 F.2d 443 (9th Cir.1983), brought under a federal statute \u2014 i.e., 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(b)(1). Section 502(b)(1), however, provides that a court \u201cshall allow\u201d a claim, proof of which has been filed, \u201cexcept to the extent that ... such claim is unenforceable against the debtor ... under any ... applicable law....\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(b)(1). Thus, in proof of claim litigation under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(b)(1), the validity of the claim is determined under state law. Such is not the case in stay litigation under section 362(d). Indeed, in <em>In re Eastview Estates II, </em>the allowability of the brokers\u2019 claims against the estate under section 502(b)(1) turned on whether the brokers had a commission agreement enforceable under California law. 713 F.2d at 447. Because California law was applied to determine the substantive issues in that case, the court then applied California Civil Code section 1717 in determining the award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>at 451. Thus, the principal case relied upon by the Johnsons is not dispositive in this case. The question is whether state law governed the substantive issues of the case. In an action \u201con the contract,\u201d state law necessarily would, but this was not an action \u201con the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">Therefore, because federal law governs the disposition of this relief from stay action, it should also govern disposition of the attorney\u2019s fee issue in this case. No federal statute provides for an allowance of attorney\u2019s fees to debtors in circumstances such as in this ease.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, there is no evidence or allegation of bad faith or harassment on the part of the Righettis. <em>See In re Fulwiler, </em>624 F.2d 908, 910 (9th Cir.1980). Thus, because in the absence of a federal statute to the contrary, federal courts follow the \u201cAmerican Rule,\u201d under which attorney fees are not recoverable by the prevailing litigant, <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 247, 269-71, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 1616, 1627-29, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975), the Johnsons are not entitled to recover the attorney fees incurred in opposing the request for relief from the automatic stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">The district court\u2019s decision denying the Johnsons their attorney fees was therefore correct. A request for relief from the automatic stay pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(d) is not an \u201caction on a contract\u201d to which state substantive law would be applied but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>an action on a federal statute to be decided according to federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">The order of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b811-15\">. Because the order confirming the plan and discharging the debtors has been issued by the bankruptcy court, all proceedings in bankruptcy court are over. Therefore, because the final order has already occurred, <em>In re Mason, </em>709 F.2d 1313, 1316 (9th Cir.1983), we need not determine here whether an award of attorney\u2019s fees in an action for relief from the automatic stay is a final order appealable to this court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1293(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b812-7\">. Furthermore, when a party requests relief from the automatic stay he is not necessarily seeking to foreclose under a contract. Such an action could be brought by one seeking to proceed upon an alleged personal injury claim against the debtor or a variety of other claims not based on contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b813-6\">. The Johnsons argue that because the Righettis may have been able to recover attorney\u2019s fees under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(b), the debtors should be allowed to recover their attorney\u2019s fees. This argument is inapposite. Section 506(b) concerns only the award of attorney\u2019s fees to ov-ersecured creditors with a contractual right to reimbursement and is not applicable to the Johnsons. <em>See In re Carey, </em>8 B.R. 1000, 1002-04 (Bankr.S.D.Cal.1981) (court did not construe section 506(b) to incorporate state law on the availability of attorney\u2019s fees).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
