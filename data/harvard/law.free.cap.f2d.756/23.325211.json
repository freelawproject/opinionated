The alleged violations arose from a pre-filing letter sent by IRS officials in Nashville to investors in a tax shelter marketed by Mid-South, informing them that based on IRS review of Mid-South \u201cpurported tax deductions\u201d from that investment would not be allowed and investors claiming such deductions would be subject to penalties. In its second amended complaint, plaintiff claims that this letter caused the destruction of its business and loss of income, depriving it of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s requirement of due process. In addition, Mid-South argues that this letter revealed its identity as a taxpayer and the fact that it was subject to IRS audit, thereby disclosing tax return information in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court held that the United States had not waived sovereign immunity from the constitutional claim and that a cognizable Fifth Amendment property interest had not been alleged in any event. He also ruled that the individual defendants were not amenable to suit for the statutory violations because 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7431(a)(1) provides for suit against the United States as the exclusive remedy for violations of Section 6103. On the statutory claim against the United States, the Court held that no violation of Section 6103 had been stated in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-21\">The District Court correctly dismissed the constitutional claim against the United States and. the individual defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>ants. No constitutional claim is stated against the individual defendants because the plaintiff has alleged no property interest cognizable under the Fifth Amendment. Construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, its complaint alleges that the pre-filing letter has caused investors to withdraw their money from Mid-South and thereby caused the destruction of its business. It is settled, however, that not every expectation is entitled to the due process protections of the Fifth Amendment. <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2709, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972); <em>Leis v. Flynt, </em>439 U.S. 438, 441-443, 99 S.Ct. 698, 700-701, 58 L.Ed.2d 717 (1979). The plaintiff is in effect claiming that its business interests should be protected from IRS communications intended to convey to taxpayer investors information which will prevent them from being penalized for erroneously taking deductions on their income tax returns. A similar situation was before the Supreme Court in <em>Bob Jones University v. Simon, </em>416 U.S. 725, 94 S.Ct. 2038, 40 L.Ed.2d 496 (1974), where the taxpayer sought an injunction restraining the IRS from withdrawing advance assurance to donors that contributions to the taxpayer\u2019s organization would constitute charitable deductions under the Tax Code. The Court rejected the taxpayer\u2019s argument that prohibition of the desired injunc-tive relief under the Anti-Injunction Act (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7431(a)) would violate its Fifth Amendment rights because withdrawing the assurance of tax deductions would cause a reduction if not elimination of donations and the destruction of its organization. The Court reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\">... although the Congressional restriction to postenforcement review may place an organization claiming tax-exempt status in a precarious financial position, the problems presented do not rise to the level of constitutional infirmities, in light of the powerful governmental interests in protecting the administration of the tax system from premature judicial interference ... and of the opportunities for review that are available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">416 U.S. 725, 747-748, 94 S.Ct. at 2051-2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">Our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that the causal connection between the IRS\u2019s actions and the alleged business injury is attenuated. Here, there was no IRS action directly depriving the plaintiffs of property. <em>Accord Investment Annuity, Inc. v. Blumenthal, </em>609 F.2d 1, 7 (D.C.Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">On the issue of an alleged violation of the non-disclosure provisions in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103, we affirm the District Court\u2019s decision that under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7431(a)(1)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the only proper defendant to such a suit is the United States, and that no claim is stated against the individual defendants for such a statutory violation. We reverse the District Court\u2019s ruling that as a matter of law, the plaintiff has failed to allege that return information was disclosed within the meaning of section 6103. Such information is defined by Section 6103(b)(2) to include a \u201ctaxpayer\u2019s identity\u201d and \u201cwhether the taxpayer\u2019s return was, is being, or will be examined or subject to other investigation or processing.\u201d Construed favorably, Mid-South\u2019s complaint asserts that the pre-filing notice revealed its identity as a taxpayer and the fact that it had been under IRS investigation, since the investors\u2019 names were allegedly obtained through that investigation (a fact then revealed to them upon receiving the pre-filing letter). These allegations state a colorable claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">At oral hearing defendants argued that the pre-filing letter\u2019s legality might be saved under section 6103(e)(7) and perhaps other subsections which create exceptions to the non-disclosure provision, allowing disclosure to certain authorized persons. However, this issue was not presented to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the District Court, was not briefed or thoughtfully considered by the parties, and it is not suitable for our resolution at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment dismissing both the constitutional and statutory claims against the individual defendants, and the constitutional claim against the United States as a party defendant. We remand to the District Court for reconsideration of the statutory claim against the United States under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7431(a)(1), and the issue of a possible exception under Section 6103(e)(7) and other similar provisions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-14\">.

However, I believe that the actions of the individual defendants impinged upon plaintiff\u2019s constitutional liberty interest to operate a business without arbitrary interference. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">The record in this case discloses that the issue as to whether Mid-South was in fact operating an abusive tax shelter had not been officially determined by the agency. Despite this critical omission, IRS personnel unilaterally concluded that Mid-South\u2019s tax promotion was not legitimate, and arbitrarily notified all of Mid-South\u2019s clients of this determination, thus virtually destroying Mid-South\u2019s business. The defendant\u2019s action in posting the pre-filing letters becomes all the more capricious when viewed in light of the facts that (1) Mid-South was neither notified of the IRS\u2019 intent to mail the notices nor given the opportunity to defend its promotion, and (2) that no statutes or regulations enacted pursuant thereto authorized the IRS to implement such unilateral action. To the contrary, regulations enacted subsequent to the Mid-South incident mandate notification of the tax shelter promoter at the initial stages of the investigation, and provide numerous opportunities for the promoter to defend his activity. <em>See </em>Internal Revenue News Release IR-83-129 (October 19, 1983). In sum, it is clear that the arbitrary and capricious actions of the IRS\u2019 agents in the instant case were in direct contravention of Mid-South\u2019s liberty interest to operate its business free of such interference as recognized by this circuit in <em>Sanderson v. Village of Greenhills, </em>726 F.2d 284, 287 (6th Cir.1984) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">Thus, I would remand with instructions to the district court to analyze Mid-South\u2019s fifth amendment due process claim against the individual defendants in light of plaintiff's constitutional liberty interest.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
