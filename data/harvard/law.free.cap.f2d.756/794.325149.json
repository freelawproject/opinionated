Greer is entitled to receive federal social security survivor\u2019s benefits on behalf of her daughter Tonisha, based on the earnings record and insured status of the alleged father of the child, Anthony Lewis. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(d) (1982). Reva Greer was never married to Lewis and, in fact, at the time of Tonisha\u2019s birth, on January 28, 1980, she was still married to Andrew Greer. Mr. Greer, however, had been in the penitentiary since 1978. Appellant claims to be entitled to benefits because Lewis was contributing to Tonisha\u2019s support at the time of his death, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C)(ii) (1982), and because Tonisha allegedly would be entitled to inherit personal property from Lewis under the laws of devolution of intestate property of his state of domicile (Missouri) at the time of his death. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A) (1982). We hold the appellant not entitled to receive benefits for failure to present substantial evidence that Lewis was in fact the biological father of Tonisha.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-21\">Anthony Lewis was found dead, apparently murdered, on March 7, 1980. The appellant filed her application for child\u2019s insurance benefits two weeks later on March 21, 1980. This application was first denied by the Social Security Administration on May 14, 1980. A request for reconsideration was also denied. Appellant then requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) which was held on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>October 14, 1981. Also appearing at this hearing was Annette M. Ray, on behalf of Kenyai M. Ray, who was joined as a party in interest because already receiving benefits on Lewis\u2019 account which could be reduced if benefits were also awarded to Tonisha. In a decision dated November 24, 1981, the ALJ found Tonisha was not entitled to child\u2019s insurance benefits. Among specific findings made by the ALJ were the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-4\">3. There is no evidence contained in the record that the minor claimant was ever legally adopted by any person under the statutes of any state or was equitably adopted by any person under the doctrine and statutes which pertain in the State of Missouri.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-5\">4. There is no evidence contained in the record that the deceased wage earner was ever decreed by a court of competent jurisdiction to be the father of the minor claimant, or was ever ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction to contribute to the care and support of the minor claimant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-6\">5. There is no evidence contained in the record of an acknowledgement in writing by the deceased wage earner that he was the father of the minor claimant herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-7\">6. There is no substantial evidence contained in the record which would show that the deceased wage earner was the biological father of the minor claimant herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-8\">7. The claimant did not receive at least one-half of her support from the deceased wage earner in the relevant time period before the deceased wage earner\u2019s death on March 7, 1980.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-9\">8. The deceased wage earner was not living with the minor claimant during the relevant time period, from January 28, 1980, until March 7, 1980.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">The appellant\u2019s request for review of the AU\u2019s decision by the Appeals Council was denied on March 26, 1982, making the ALJ\u2019s determination a final administrative decision of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services subject to judicial review under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1982). The present action was commenced in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas on June 1, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">In an order denying the plaintiff-appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granting the defendant-appellee\u2019s motion for an order affirming the Secretary\u2019s decision, the district court concluded the AU\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence but noted that the ALJ failed to make any specific finding about Tonisha\u2019s qualification under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(2)(A) (1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-13\">(2)(A) In determining whether an applicant is the child or parent of a fully or currently insured individual for purposes of this subchapter, the Secretary shall apply such law as would be applied in determining the devolution of intestate personal property by the courts of the State in which such insured individual is domiciled at the time such applicant files application, or, if such insured individual is dead, by the courts of the State in which he was domiciled at the time of his death, or, if such insured individual is or was not so domiciled in any State, by the courts of the District of Columbia. Applicants who according to such law would have the same status relative to taking intestate personal property as a child or parent shall be deemed such.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-14\">At the time of his death, Anthony Lewis was domiciled in Missouri. Accordingly, the AU should have determined whether Tonisha would be deemed entitled to take intestate personal property from Lewis as a child under applicable Missouri law.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-15\">The relevant<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Missouri statute is Mo.Ann.Stat. \u00a7 474.060 (Vernon 1985 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>Supp.) which reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-5\">2. ... a person born out of wedlock is a child of the mother. That person is also a child of the father, if either of the following occur:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-7\">(2) The paternity is established by an adjudication before the death of the father, <em>or is established thereafter by clear and convincing proof</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">(emphasis added). Although the AU did not specifically apply this \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard to the evidence before him, he did find, as noted above, that there was no <em>substantial </em>evidence that Anthony Lewis was in fact the biological father of Tonisha. This finding was based upon a record which contained the following evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-9\">1. Reva D. Greer testified that Anthony Lewis was the father of Tonisha and was the only man with whom she was having sexual relations at the time Toni-sha was conceived. We note, however, that her testimony was not clear in this regard and that at one point she indicated that she started going with Lewis in September of 1979 \u2014 substantially less than 9 months before Tonisha\u2019s birth in January of 1980.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-10\">2. Reva Greer also testified and submitted statements to the effect that Lewis contributed to the support of Tonisha by buying food, clothes, and diapers for the baby, and by giving Reva money. All of these alleged contributions were on a cash basis however, and Reva\u2019s testimony, though corroborated somewhat by statements signed by Lewis\u2019 mother, was otherwise unsupported by documentation such as receipts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-12\">3. A signed statement by Jerry Patton, father of Anthony Lewis, was introduced in which Patton asserted that Lewis had told him he (Lewis) was the father of Tonisha.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-13\">4. Signed statements by Shirly Guess, Lewis\u2019 mother, indicated that she believed she was the grandmother of Toni-sha based upon things her son had said to her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-14\">5. The signed statement of Ida Paul, a friend of Lewis, asserting that Lewis told her he was Tonisha\u2019s father and that Paul and Lewis had together planned a successful baby shower for the infant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-15\">6. Annette Ray, mother of Kenyai M. Ray, testified that Lewis told her he did not believe he was the father of Reva Greer\u2019s child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-16\">7. Reva Greer also testified that Anthony Lewis had told her he wanted to have blood tests taken to make sure To-nisha was his child. These tests were never performed. Reva indicated that Lewis did not want to pay child support for Tonisha.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-17\">In reviewing the final administrative decisions of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, courts are bound to affirm them if supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1982). Substantial evidence means \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 217, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938). The substantial evidence standard is generally viewed as requiring something less than a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Bloodsworth v. Heckler, </em>703 F.2d 1233, 1239 (11th Cir.1983); <em>Sorenson v. Weinberger, </em>514 F.2d 1112, 1119 n. 10 (9th Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-18\">The evidence cited supra regarding (the issue of paternity in this case is, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>most part, pure hearsay indicating that Lewis himself had no consistent belief about whether he was Tonisha\u2019s father or not. We cannot say that the AU was unreasonable, when faced with this record, in judging that there was no substantial evidence of biological paternity, and we therefore hold that the district court below correctly affirmed the AU\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">This does not, however, directly answer the appellant\u2019s charge on appeal that the district court should have remanded the case to the AU for the making of an explicit application of the clear and convincing standard required for proof of paternity after the death of a father under the Missouri statute quoted supra. In this regard we first note that the record before us on appeal does not disclose that appellant ever asked the court below to remand the case. Quite to the contrary, the complaint filed below asked the district court to find on the record before it that the plaintiff-appellant had already met the burden of clear and convincing proof, and it prayed for reversal of the Secretary\u2019s decision and an award of benefits <em>by the court. </em>Having herself prompted the district court to determine whether the evidence in the record met the clear and convincing standard, appellant cannot now complain that the case should have been remanded for such determination. In any event, we find most sensible the district court\u2019s resolution of this question by determining that, under Missouri law, a finding that evidence is not \u201csubstantial\u201d necessarily implies that it does not meet the more stringent \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard. <em>Matter of O\u2019Brien, </em>600 S.W.2d 695, 697 (Mo.App. 1980) (clear and convincing is \u201can intermediate standard between preponderance of the evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Lastly, the appellant contends that' the evidence presented to the AU showed that Lewis was contributing to Tonisha\u2019s support at the time of his death so that she should have been found eligible for benefits pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 416(h)(3)(C)(ii) (1982). This section reads as follows: (3) An applicant who is the son or daughter of a fully or currently insured individual, but who is not (and is not deemed to be) the child of such insured individual under [\u00a7 416(h)(2)(A) ], shall nevertheless be deemed to be the child of such insured individual if:</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">(C) in the case of a deceased individual\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-8\">(ii) such insured individual <em>is shown by evidence satisfactory to the Secretary to have been the mother or father of the applicant and </em>such insured individual was living with or contributing to the support of the applicant at the time such insured individual died,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AV7\">(emphasis added). Though we are concerned that the AU appears to have somewhat arbitrarily evaluated the appellant\u2019s evidence of support with a \u201cone-half of total support\u201d test not found in statute or case law, we need not reach the merits of his decision on that basis since it is obvious that appellant has not met the necessary antecedent emphasized in the statutory language quoted supra. It clearly was not the intent of Congress in enacting this law to permit claims for benefits against the accounts of deceased wage earners by any child that received support from the wage earner regardless of whether that child was in fact the <em>wage earner\u2019s </em>child. In this case the Secretary, through the agency of the AU, clearly was not satisfied by the evidence presented that Tonisha is actually the biological daughter of Anthony Lewis. Because she has not established such biological paternity, the appellant simply is not eligible to receive benefits on Lewis\u2019 account.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">Based upon the foregoing findings and conclusions, the decision of the district judge is affirmed in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b868-10\">. The determination of what statute to apply actually involves some complexity inasmuch as the statutes effective at the time of Lewis\u2019 death and Reva Greer's filing of her application, Mo. Ann.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 474.060, 474.070 (Vernon 1956) were unconstitutional for the manner in which they prevented children born out of wedlock from taking their father\u2019s intestate personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>property. <em>Trimble v. Gordon, </em>430 U.S. 762, 97 S.Ct. 1459, 52 L.Ed.2d 31 (1977); <em>Gross v. Harris, </em>664 F.2d 667, 670 (8th Cir.1981). However, we agree with the district court that the new statute, quoted in the main text, should be applied to the present matter because no hearing was held on Reva Greer\u2019s application prior to the January 1, 1981, effective date of the revised statute. <em>Gross v. Harris, </em>664 F.2d at 669 n. 2 citing <em>State ex rel. St. Louis-San Francisco Ry. Co. v. Buder, </em>515 S.W.2d 409 (Mo. en banc 1974). Further, the applicability of the revised statute was agreed to by both the plaintiff and the defendant before the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
