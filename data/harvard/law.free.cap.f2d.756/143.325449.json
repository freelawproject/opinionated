SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b217-20\">Almost 14 years ago, soon after passage of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4321 <em>et seq. </em>(1982), this court faced the challenge of ensuring that the Act\u2019s \u201cimportant legislative purposes, heralded in the halls of Congress, [were] not lost or misdirected in the vast hallways of the federal bureaucracy.\u201d <em>Calvert Cliffs\u2019 Coordinating Committee v. USAEC, </em>449 F.2d 1109, 1111 (D.C.Cir. 1971). This case poses a no less formidable challenge: to ensure that the bold words and vigorous spirit of NEPA are not similarly lost or misdirected in the brisk frontiers of science.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-21\">For this appeal presents an important question at the dawn of the genetic engineering age: what is the appropriate level of environmental review required of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) before it approves the deliberate release of genetically engineered, recombinant-DNA-containing organisms into the open environment? More precisely, in the context of this case, the question is whether to affirm an injunction temporarily enjoining NIH from approving deliberate release experiments without a greater level of environ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>mental concern than the agency has shown thus far.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">In September 1983 three environmental groups and two individuals filed suit against the federal officials responsible for genetic engineering decisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Arguing that NIH had not complied with the requirements of NEPA, plaintiffs sought to enjoin a proposed NIH-approved experiment by University of California scientists that would represent the first deliberate release of genetically engineered organisms into the open environment. They also sought to enjoin NIH\u2019s approval of any other deliberate release experiments. Plaintiffs later added Regents of the University of California as a defendant. On May 18, 1984 the District Court granted the requested relief and enjoined both the University of California experiment and NIH approval of all other deliberate release experiments.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">We emphatically agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that NIH has not yet displayed the rigorous attention to environmental concerns demanded by law. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s injunction prohibiting the University of California deliberate release experiment until an appropriate environmental assessment is completed. We also share the District Court\u2019s view that NIH should give greater consideration to the broad environmental issues attendant on deliberate release of organisms containing recombinant DNA, and to its own responsibility for approving these deliberate release experiments. We find, however, that the part of the injunction enjoining NIH from approving all other deliberate release experiments is, at this juncture, overly broad, and we therefore vacate the part of the injunction that prohibits NIH approval of those experiments. We wish to emphasize, however, that if NIH fails to give appropriate environmental consideration to any other experiment, as it has failed to do with the University of California experiment, injunctive relief would be clearly proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">This case arises against a backdrop of the National Environmental Policy Act, the emergence of genetic engineering, and federal attempts to regulate genetic engineering.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">A. <em>National Environmental Policy Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"ATGkb\">On January 1,1970 the National Environmental Policy Act became law. Recognizing \u201cthe profound impact of man\u2019s activity on the interrelation of all components of the natural environment,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4331(a), Congress sought to \u201cfulfill the responsibilities of each generation as trustee of the environment for succeeding generations,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 4331(b)(1). The major \u201caction-forcing\u201d provision of NEPA is the requirement that \u201call agencies of the Federal government\u201d prepare a detailed environmental analysis for \u201cmajor Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4332(C); S.Rep. No. 91-296, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. 19 (1969). Congress mandated that this detailed statement, long known as an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), include such considerations as \u201cthe environmental impact of the proposed action,\u201d \u201cany adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented,\u201d and \u201calternatives to the proposed action.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">Realizing that NEPA would be toothless if agencies could merely issue a conclusory statement that the action did not significantly affect the environment (and that therefore no EIS was required), the Council <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>on Environmental Quality (CEQ), an entity created by NEPA, issued regulations establishing that, unless the major federal action falls within an agency-established \u201ccategorical exclusion,\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.4 (1983), the agency should support each finding of \u201cno significant impact\u201d with a \u201cconcise public document\u201d called an \u201cenvironmental assessment\u201d (EA). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1501.4(a)-(b), 1508.9. The environmental assessment must \u201c[bjriefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1508.9(1). CEQ regulations apply to all federal agencies. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1501.2; <em>Andrus v. Sierra Club, </em>442 U.S. 347, 351, 99 S.Ct. 2335, 2338, 60 L.Ed.2d 943 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Two fundamental principles underlie NEPA\u2019s requirements: federal agencies have the responsibility to consider the environmental effects of major actions significantly affecting environment, and the public has the right to review that consideration. <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>462 U.S. 87, 103 S.Ct. 2246, 76 L.Ed.2d 437 (1983). NEPA\u2019s dual mission is thus to generate federal attention to environmental concerns and to reveal that federal consideration for public scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">In passing NEPA Congress emphasized its particular concern with the role of new technologies and their effect on the environment. The statute explicitly enumerates \u201cnew and expanding technological advances\u201d as one of the activities with the potential to threaten the environment. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4331(a). The legislative history reveals an underlying concern with \u201c[a] growing technological power * * * far outstripping man\u2019s capacity to understand and ability to control its impact on the environment.\u201d S.Rep. No. 91-296, <em>supra, </em>at 6. One of NEPA\u2019s main functions was to bolster this capacity to understand and control the effects of new technology. <em>See Scientists\u2019 Institute for Public Information v. AEC, </em>481 F.2d 1079, 1089-1090 (D.C.Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">NEPA thus stands as landmark legislation, requiring federal agencies to consider the environmental effects of major federal actions, empowering the public to scrutinize this consideration, and revealing a special concern about the environmental effects of new technology.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">B. <em>Genetic Engineering</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Genetic engineering is an important development at the very cusp of scientific advances. More than a decade ago scientists discovered a method for transplanting deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the principal substance of genes. Although exchanges and mutations of DNA occur in nature, genetic engineering provides the ability to control these fundamental processes of life and evolution. DNA segments can be recovered and cloned from one organism and inserted into another. The result is known as \u201crecombinant DNA.\u201d <em>See generally </em>41 Fed.Reg. 27903-27904 (July 7, 1976), Joint Appendix (JA) 231-232; Office of Technology Assessment, U.S. Congress, Commercial Biotechnology: An International Analysis 33-38 (January 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">Recombinant DNA technology has been limited primarily to small organisms, usually bacteria. This production of new bacteria through altering genetic material has been confined to the laboratory; organisms with recombinant DNA have never been released into the general environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">Broad claims are made about both the potential benefits and the potential hazards of genetically engineered organisms. Use of recombinant DNA may lead to welcome advances in such areas as food production and disease control. At the same time, however, the environmental consequences of dispersion of genetically engineered organisms are far from clear. According to a recent report by a House of Representatives subcommittee, \u201cThe potential environmental risks associated with the deliberate release of genetically engineered organisms or the translocation of any new organism into an ecosystem are best described as \u2018low probability, high consequence risk\u2019; that is, while there is only a small possibili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>ty that damage could occur, the damage that could occur is great.\u201d <em>The Environmental Implications of Genetic Engineering, </em>Report by Subcommittee on Investigations &amp; Oversight to House Committee on Science &amp; Technology, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 9 (1984) (hereinafter cited as <em>Genetic Engineering </em>Report), JA 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">C. <em>Federal Oversight of Genetic Engineering</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Spurred by scientists involved in genetic research, NIH began efforts to oversee genetic engineering in the mid-1970\u2019s. Federal oversight of deliberate release experiments falls into four periods: (1) NIH\u2019s 1976 standards, which prohibited deliberate release of organisms containing recombinant DNA; (2) NIH\u2019s 1978 revision, which gave the NIH Director power to approve deliberate release experiments; (3) the NIH Director\u2019s approval of three such experiments in the early 1980\u2019s; and (4) the District Court\u2019s injunction prohibiting the University of California experiment and enjoining NIH approval of all other deliberate release experiments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">1. <em>NIH\u2019s 1976 standards: prohibition on deliberate release. </em>In 1976 the NIH Director issued \u201cGuidelines for Research on Recombinant DNA Molecules.\u201d 41 Fed. Reg. at 27902, JA 230. The Guidelines were an historic development, representing the first major federal effort to oversee genetic research and the culmination of intense scientific attention to the possible hazards of genetic research.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">In 1974 scientists working in genetic research voluntarily called for a moratorium on certain kinds of experiments until an international meeting could be convened to consider the potential hazards of recombinant DNA molecules. <em>Id. </em>On October 7, 1974 NIH established the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) to consider genetic research issues. And in February 1975 NIH, the National Science Foundation, and the National Academy of Sciences sponsored an international conference at the Asilomar Conference Center in Pacific Grove, California to review the questions posed by the possibility of genetic engineering.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-12\">Finally, in the summer of 1976 the NIH Director announced the Guidelines that would govern NIH-supported genetic research experiments. In broad terms, the Guidelines permitted certain laboratory experiments to go forward under carefully specified conditions; certain other types of experiments were flatly prohibited. Deliberate release \u2014 \u201c[djeliberate release into the environment of any organism containing a recombinant DNA molecule\u201d \u2014 was one of five categories explicitly banned. 41 Fed. Reg. at 27915, JA 243. In announcing the Guidelines the Director noted that deliberate release of organisms with recombinant DNA was not yet feasible and that, if it became feasible, the ban could be reconsidered. <em>Id. </em>at 27907, JA 235. But he stressed that, if such reconsideration occurred, environmental concerns should be paramount: \u201cIt is most important that the potential environmental impact of the release be considered.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-13\">Significantly, NIH prepared an EIS to accompany its Guidelines, JA 244 \u2014 the only EIS NIH has ever completed on the subject of genetic engineering. The EIS did not specifically refer to deliberate release experiments; such experiments were banned. The EIS did, however, note that dispersion of organisms with recombinant DNA molecules loomed as a potential environmental hazard from the permitted experiments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acf\">Should organisms containing recombined DNA be dispersed into the environment, they might, depending on their fitness relative to naturally occuring <em>[sic] </em>organisms, find a suitable ecological niche for their own reproduction. A potentially dangerous organism might then multiply and spread. Subsequent cessa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>tion of experiments would not stop the diffusion of the hazardous agent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">JA 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Thus in 1976 the NIH Guidelines prohibited deliberate release; the Director emphasized the importance of full environmental consideration of any possible future release; and the EIS identified dispersion of organisms with recombinant DNA as a possible environmental hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">2. <em>The 1978 revision: permission to waive the prohibition against deliberate release. </em>In 1978 the NIH Director undertook an effort to revise the Guidelines \u201cin light of NIH\u2019s experience operating under them and in light of [NIH\u2019s] increasing knowledge about the potential risks and benefits of this research technique.\u201d 43 Fed.Reg. 33042 (July 28, 1978), JA 433. Proposed in July and adopted in December, the revision changed the Guidelines in several respects. Most importantly for this appeal, the 1978 revision allowed the NIH Director authority to grant exceptions to the five absolute prohibitions in the Guidelines \u2014 including the prohibition on deliberate release of organisms containing recombinant DNA into the environment. 43 Fed. Reg. 60108 (December 22, 1978), JA 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">NIH announced that the standard governing the use of this waiver authority would be the standard generally applicable to the Director\u2019s exercise of his duties: \u201c[T]he Director shall weigh each proposed action, through appropriate analysis and consultation, to determine that it complies with the Guidelines and presents no significant risk to health or the environment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60126, JA 496. NIH also declared that the Director would exercise his authority \u201cwith the advice of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee after appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60108, JA 478. The Director further stated that his \u201cwaiver decisions [would] include a careful consideration of the potential environmental impact, and certain decisions may be accompanied by a formal assessment or statement. This must be determined on a case-by-case basis.\u201d 43 Fed.Reg. at 33051, JA 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">On the^ subject of deliberate release experiments in particular, the Director suggested that clear standards might be necessary to guide his waiver discretion: \u201cRecognizing the need expressed by * * * commentators for more definitive standards [to govern deliberate release waiver decisions], I will refer the matter to the Recombinant Advisory Committee (RAC) for its consideration. * * * [T]he RAC will be asked to address conditions under which exceptions to various prohibited categories of experiments may be granted.\u201d 43 Fed. Reg. at 60083, JA 471. Thus the Director perceived a possible need for more definitive standards and suggested that such standards might be forthcoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">NIH did not prepare an EIS to accompany its 1978 revision. It prepared two Environmental Assessments \u2014 one for the revision as proposed, 43 Fed.Reg. at 33111, JA 467, and one for the revision as adopted, 43 Fed.Reg. at 60101, JA 471. The assessments said little about the Director\u2019s new waiver authority for deliberate release experiments. The first simply declared, \u201cWaiver decisions will include a careful consideration of potential environmental impact,\u201d 43 Fed.Reg. at 33111, JA 466; the second did not mention the waiver authority-</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">The 1978 revision also extended the coverage of the Guidelines to all experiments at institutions receiving NIH funds for recombinant DNA research, whether or not the particular experiment had received NIH funds. 43 Fed.Reg. at 60123, JA 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">3. <em>Approval of deliberate release experiments. </em>The 1978 revision was the last significant revision of NIH\u2019s guidelines regarding deliberate release experiments. A 1982 revision was largely semantic, 47 Fed. Reg. 17186-17187 (April 21, 1982), JA 503-504; a 1983 revision establishing slightly different procedures for deliberate release involving certain plants, 48 Fed.Reg. 24580 (June 1, 1983), is not part of this appeal. The \u201cmore definitive standards\u201d suggested by the Director never emerged.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Although the guidelines ljave not changed, NIH\u2019s role has begun to change dramatically. For, with the maturation of genetic engineering technology, NIH has been faced with applications for approval of deliberate release experiments.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The NIH Director, acting on the advice of RAC, has approved three deliberate release experiments at institutions receiving NIH funds for recombinant DNA research. On August 7, 1981 the Director approved a request by Dr. Ronald Davis of Stanford University to field-test corn plants containing recombinant DNA molecules. 46 Fed. Reg. 40331 (August 7, 1981). The goal was to increase the corn\u2019s dietary value by improving its ability to store protein. However, the field tests were never conducted because feasibility problems developed. <em>Genetic Engineering Report </em>at 17, JA 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">On April 15, 1983 the Director approved a request by Dr. John Sanford of Cornell University to field-test tomato and tobacco plants with recombinant DNA. 48 Fed. Reg. 16459 (April 15, 1983). The goal was to prove that pollen could serve as a \u201cvector\u201d for insertion of recombinant DNA. Again, however, due to feasibility problems, the experiment never went forward. <em>Genetic Engineering Report </em>at 17, JA 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">On June 1, 1983 the Director gave final approval to the experiment at issue on appeal \u2014 the request by Drs. Nickolas Pano-poulos and Steven Lindow of the University of California at Berkeley to apply genetically altered bacteria to plots of potatoes, tomatoes, and beans in northern California. 48 Fed.Reg. 24549 (June 1, 1983), JA 522. As discussed in greater detail below, the goal was to increase the crops\u2019 frost resistance. Because of the cancellation .of the previous two experiments, the Panopoulos-Lindow experiment would be the first NIH-approved deliberate release experiment actually to be conducted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">In February 1984 a congressional subcommittee report sharply criticized NIH\u2019s method of reviewing deliberate release experiments. The report concluded that \u201cthe current regulatory framework does not guarantee that adequate consideration will be given to the potential environmental effects of a deliberate release.\u201d <em>Genetic Engineering Report </em>at 10, JA 168. In particular, \u201cthe RAC\u2019s ability to adequately evaluate the environmental hazards posed by deliberate releases is limited by both its expertise and its jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The subcommittee report recommended a moratorium on deliberate release approvals until an interagency review panel was established to consider the potential environmental effects of each deliberate release experiment. \u201cEach [deliberate release experiment] could result in major environmental damage or adverse public health effects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 43-44, JA 176-177.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">4. <em>The injunction. </em>In September 1983 three public interest organizations and two individuals filed suit against the three federal officials ultimately responsible for NIH deliberate release decisions; they later added Regents of the University of California as a defendant. The University of California experiment was scheduled to begin on or about May 25, 1984. On May 18 the District Court issued an injunction enjoining the University of California experiment and NIH approval of other deliberate release experiments. The District Court found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed in showing that NIH should have completed at least a more complete environmental assessment, and perhaps an EIS, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>before approving the University of California experiment; it also found them likely to succeed in showing that l\u00bf\u00edH should have completed an Environmental Impact Statement in connection with both its 1978 policy change and its imminent \u201cprogram\u201d of deliberate release approvals.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Both the federal defendants and the University of California Regents have filed appeals; the appeals were consolidated and the case heard by this court on an expedited basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Two principles guide our analysis of this appeal: the standard for judicial review of an agency decision not to prepare an EIS and the standard for appellate review of a District Court decision to grant an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">A. <em>Review of an Agency Decision Not to Prepare an EIS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">That courts must play a cardinal role in the realization of NEPA\u2019s mandate is beyond dispute. As the Supreme Court recently emphasized, the critical judicial task is \u201cto ensure that the agency has adequately considered and disclosed the environmental impact of its actions and that its decision is not arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric, supra, </em>462 U.S. at 97-98, 103 S.Ct. at 2253. Since NEPA requires the agency to \u201ctake a \u2018hard look\u2019 at the environmental consequences before taking a major action,\u201d <em>id. (quoting Kleppe v. Sierra Club, </em>427 U.S. 390, 410 n. 21, 96 S.Ct. 2718, 2730 n. 21, 49 L.Ed.2d 576 (1976)), the judiciary must see that this legal duty is fulfilled. Although the \u201cagency commencing federal action has the initial and primary responsibility for ascertaining whether an EIS is required,\u201d <em>Committee for Auto Responsibility v. Solomon, </em>603 F.2d 992, 1002 (D.C.Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>445 U.S. 915, 100 S.Ct. 1274, 63 L.Ed.2d 599 (1980), the courts must determine that this decision accords with traditional norms of reasoned decisionmaking and that the agency has taken the \u201chard look\u201d required by NEPA. <em>Sierra Club v. Peterson, </em>717 F.2d 1409, 1413 (D.C.Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">B. <em>Review of an Injunction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">We review the decision to grant an injunction as an exercise of the District Court\u2019s discretion. <em>Doran v. Salem Inn, </em>422 U.S. 922, 932, 95 S.Ct. 2561, 2568, 45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975); <em>Brown v. Chote, </em>411 U.S. 452, 457, 93 S.Ct. 1732, 1735, 36 L.Ed.2d 420 (1973). Under this circuit\u2019s long-standing test, the District Court should consider (1) the plaintiff\u2019s likelihood of prevailing on the merits, (2) the threat of irreparable injury to the plaintiff in the absence of injunctive relief, (3) the possibility of substantial harm to other interested parties from the injunctive relief, and (4) the interests of the public. <em>WMATC v. Holiday Tours, </em>559 F.2d 841, 842-843 (D.C. Cir.1977); <em>Virginia Petroleum Jobbers Ass\u2019n v. FPC, </em>259 F.2d 921, 925 (D.C.Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-14\">In reviewing this exercise of discretion, we must be conscious of whether we are reviewing findings of fact, conclusions of law, or determinations about the balancing of the injunction factors. In all three we are deferential to the District Court\u2019s determination about \u201cwhat evidence can properly be adduced in the limited time that can be devoted to a preliminary injunction hearing.\u201d <em>Friends for All Children, Inc. v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp., </em>746 F.2d 816, 835 n. 32 (D.C.Cir.1984). We are most deferential to the District Court\u2019s balancing of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>injunction factors. <em>Id. </em>On questions of fact the usual \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard applies, <em>id.; cf. </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). We are least deferential on questions of law. \u201c[A] greater amplitude of judicial review is called for when the appeal presents a substantial issue that the action of the trial judge was based on a premise as to the pertinent rule of law that was erroneous. * * * When this can be identified, the appellate court furthers the interest of justice by providing a ruling on the merits to the extent that the matter is ripe, though technically the case is only at the stage of application for preliminary injunction.\u201d <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Morton, </em>458 F.2d 827, 832 (D.C.Cir.1972); <em>see also Ambach v. Bell, </em>686 F.2d 974, 979 (D.C.Cir.1982) <em>(per </em>curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the District Court\u2019s injunction as it applies, first, to NIH\u2019s approval of the University of California experiment, and, second, to NIH\u2019s possible approval of all other deliberate release experiments.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">III. The University op California Experiment</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The University Regents raise objections about the District Court\u2019s view that the environmental assessment of the University of California experiment was inadequate; they also deploy a barrage of procedural objections. We will address the adequacy of the assessment and the procedural objections in turn. The federal appellants claim not to appeal the part of the injunction that applies to the U.C. experiment, but they continue to insist that the only flaw in NIH\u2019s environmental assessment is that NIH did not publish the results of its environmental review in a document titled \u201cEnvironmental Assessment.\u201d Statement of counsel at oral argument; <em>see also </em>brief for federal appellants at 5 n. 3. We will address that contention as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">A. <em>The Adequacy of the Environmental Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">1. <em>The proposed experiment. </em>On September 17, 1982 Drs. Lindow and Panopou-los, scientists at Berkeley, submitted a request for NIH approval of an experiment that would inssolve deliberate release of genetically altered organisms in the open environment. NIH approval was required because the University of California receives NIH funds for recombinant DNA research. Lindow and Panopoulos proposed to apply the genetically altered bacteria to various crops, including potatoes, tomatoes, and beans. By changing the bacteria\u2019s genetic composition, Lindow and Panopoulos hoped that the bacteria would change from frost-triggering bacteria to non-frost-triggering bacteria; they further hoped that the engineered non-frost-triggering bacteria would displace the natural frost-triggering bacteria. The ultimate goal was to protect the crops from frost and thus to extend their growing season. Such non-frost-triggering bacteria occur in nature as products of natural mutation, but Lindow and Panopoulos apparently hoped that the genetically engineered organisms would be more stable than the natural mutants. They sought to treat crops at six sites; the workers applying the recombinant-DNA-containing bacteria would wear respirators to reduce the risk of inhalation. Application of Drs. Lindow and Panopou-los, September 17, 1982, JA 728-736.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">2. <em>NIH review. </em>NIH announced the Lindow-Panopoulos request for approval, the RAC meeting at which it would be considered, and the opportunity to comment. 47 Fed.Reg. 41925 (September 22, 1982). No comments were received. At the RAC meeting on October 25, 1982 RAC members raised questions about the number of sites, the lack of adequate information, and the possible effects on rainfall. RAC voted to recommend that the Director approve the project; the vote was seven in favor, five opposed, with two abstentions. RAC Minutes, JA 684-686. The Director decided to postpone approval and suggested further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">Lindow and Panopoulos resubmitted their proposal with some modifications, including a reduction of experiment sites from six to one. On April 11, 1983, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>some discussion, RAC voted to recommend approving the proposal by a vote of 19-0, with no abstentions. RAC Minutes, JA 713-716. The Director then approved the experiment. 48 Fed.Reg. 24549 (June 1, 1983), JA 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">3. <em>NEPA compliance. </em>NIH\u2019s consideration of the Lindow-Panopoulos experiment falls far short of the NEPA requirements. And, despite the government\u2019s apparent belief, the deficiency is not a question of which document contains the environmental analysis. Rather, the deficiency rests in NIH\u2019s complete failure to consider the possibility of various environmental effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Neither the government nor the University seriously disputes that an environmental assessment is necessary. The government has conceded that the approval is a \u201cmajor action\u201d and that it does not fall into a categorical exclusion to the EIS requirements, Federal Defendants\u2019 Response to Plaintiffs\u2019 Second Set of Interrogatories at 17, JA 50; <em>see also Foundation on Economic Trends v. Heckler, </em>587 F.Supp. 753, 767 (D.D.C.1984). The University\u2019s contention here \u2014 and the government\u2019s contention below, as well as its apparent continuing belief \u2014 is that the environmental consideration given by NIH was equivalent to the necessary environmental assessment and that the injunction requires only a document labelled \u201cEnvironmental Assessment.\u201d We thus fear that the University and the government completely misapprehend the District Court\u2019s holding and the requirements imposed by NEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The most glaring deficiency in NIH\u2019s review of the Lindow-Panopoulos experiment is its treatment of the possibility of dispersion of recombinant-DNA-containing organisms. As noted, NIH\u2019s only EIS on genetic engineering specifically identified dispersion as one of the major environmental concerns associated with recombinant DNA research. The consequences of dispersion of genetically altered organisms are uncertain. Some observers believe that such dispersion would affect the environment and the climate in harmful ways. <em>See, e.g., Genetic Engineering Report </em>at 9, JA 167 (\u201cthe risk presented by the deliberate release of a genetically engineered organism is that it may cause environmental changes that perturb the ecosystem it encounters and/or that the organism itself may have negative effects if it establishes itself outside of the specific environment for which it was intended\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">Thus the problem of dispersion would seem to be one of the major concerns associated with the Lindow-Panopoulos experiment, the first experiment that would actually release genetically engineered organisms in the open environment. Yet in the minutes of the RAC meeting \u2014 the only document on appeal that records <em>any </em>NIH consideration of the environmental impact of dispersion \u2014 the entirety of the consideration of dispersion is the following statement: according to a RAC evaluator, \u201cAlthough some movement of bacteria toward sites near treatment locations by insect or aerial transport <em>is possible, </em>the numbers of viable cells transported has been shown to be very small; and these cells are subject to biological and physical processes limiting survival.\u201d RAC Minutes (April 11, 1983), JA 715 (emphasis added). In this sentence, which was taken almost verbatim from the Lindow-Panopoulos proposal, the RAC evaluator thus conceded the possibility of aerial or insect transport, but merely commented that the number of viable cells would be small, and that they were subject to processes limiting survival. Remarkably, therefore, RAC completely failed to consider the possible environmental impact from dispersion of genetically altered bacteria, however small the number and however subject to procedures limiting survival.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>In light of this complete failure to address a major environmental concern, NIH\u2019s environmental assessment utterly fails to meet the standard of environmental review necessary before an agency decides not to prepare an EIS. The argument that this consideration would be adequate if contained in a document labelled \u201cEnvironmental Assessment\u201d simply misconceives the clear requirements of NEPA as articulated by the courts, <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric, supra; Kleppe v. Sierra Club, supra, </em>427 U.S. at 410 n. 21, 96 S.Ct. at 2730 n. 21; <em>Cabinet Mountains Wilderness v. Peterson, </em>685 F.2d 678, 682 (D.C.Cir.1982), and by the Council on Environmental Quality, 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1501.4, 1508.9. An environmental assessment that fails to address a significant environmental concern can hardly be deemed adequate for a reasoned determination that an EIS is not appropriate. <em>See Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. NRDC, </em>435 U.S. 519, 553, 98 S.Ct. 1197, 1216, 55 L.Ed.2d 460 (1978) (\u201cNEPA places upon an agency the obligation to consider every significant aspect of the environmental impact of a proposed action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Appellants also contend that the adequacy of the environmental assessment can be divined from the NIH Director\u2019s final approval \u2014 and his accompanying statement of \u201cno significant risk,\u201d 48 Fed.Reg. 24548 (June 1, 1983), JA 522, as required by the 1978 revision. This contention also reveals a fundamental misunderstanding about the adequacy of an environmental assessment. Simple, conclusory statements of \u201cno impact\u201d are not enough to fulfill an agency\u2019s duty under NEPA. The only consideration of environmental consequences was apparently the RAC review; as shown, that consideration is inadequate to support the Director\u2019s finding. To accept the Director\u2019s conclusory statement would violate principles of reasoned decisionmaking, <em>Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 156, 168, 83 S.Ct. 239, 245, 9 L.Ed.2d 207 (1962), NEPA\u2019s policy of public scrutiny, <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric, supra, </em>and CEQ\u2019s own regulations, 40 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1501.4, 1508.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">It should be stressed that this inquiry into the adequacy of an environmental assessment is ultimately relevant to the agency\u2019s determination that its proposed federal action will not have a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on the environment \u2014 and thus no EIS is required. In that connection, it is notable that NIH never directly addressed the question whether an EIS should be prepared. Such an inquiry is, of course, the ultimate purpose of an environmental assessment. <em>Maryland-Nat'l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. U.S. Postal Service, </em>487 F.2d 1029, 1039-1042 (D.C.Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">To reiterate, NIH must first complete a far more adequate environmental assessment of the possible environmental impact of the deliberate release experiment than it has yet undertaken. That assessment must \u201cprovide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact,\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.9(a)(1). Ignoring possible environmental consequences will not suffice. Nor will a mere conclusory statement that the number of recombinant-DNA-containing organisms will be small and subject to processes limiting survival. Instead, NIH must attempt to evaluate seriously the risk that emigration of such organisms from the test site will create ecological disruption. Second, until NIH completes such an evaluation the question whether the experiment requires an EIS remains open. The University of California experiment clearly presents the possibility of a problem identified by NIH in its EIS as a potential environmental hazard. This fact weighs heavily in support of the view that an EIS should be completed, unless NIH can demonstrate either that the experiment does not pose the previously identified danger, or that its assessment of the previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>identified danger has changed through a process of reasoned decisionmaking. Nor is it sufficient for the agency merely testate that the environmental effects are currently unknown. Indeed, one of the specific criteria for determining whether an EIS is necessary is \u201c[t]he degree to which the possible effects on the human environment are highly uncertain or involve unique or unknown risks.\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.27(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Thus we approve the District Court\u2019s determination that, as a matter of law, plaintiffs are likely to prevail in showing that NIH\u2019s environmental assessment of the University of California experiment \u2014 and its discharge of its statutory duty to consider the propriety of an EIS \u2014 was wholly inadequate. And, in light of the government\u2019s contention, we emphasize as strongly as we can that the problem lay in the adequacy of the assessment itself, not in the document in which the assessment was contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">B. <em>Procedural Objections</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The University appellant raises four procedural objections to the \u2022 District Court\u2019s injunction against the University of California experiment: (1) the District Court lacked power to issue an injunction against the University; (2) plaintiffs did not exhaust their administrative remedies; (3) the District Court\u2019s review of the record was misconceived; and (4) the District Court\u2019s balancing of the various factors regarding the injunction was flawed. None of these arguments carries the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">1. <em>Judicial power. </em>The University claims that the District Court \u201chad no power to enjoin the University, as a private party,\u201d brief for appellant Regents at 49, because NEPA applies only to federal agencies. However, as the University recognizes, it is well established that judicial power to enforce NEPA extends to private parties where \u201cnon-federal action cannot lawfully begin or continue without the pri- or approval of a federal agency.\u201d <em>Biderman v. Morton, </em>497 F.2d 1141, 1147 (2d Cir.1974). \u201c[Wjere such non-federal entities to act without the necessary federal approval, they obviously would be acting unlawfully and subject to injunction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">The University maintains, however, that the Guidelines require only NIH approval as set forth in the NIH Guidelines\u2014 and, since the experiment received that approval, the University discharged its responsibilities under the Guidelines, whether or not a court finds the approval invalid under NEPA. This argument is completely meritless. For an NIH approval to be valid under the Guidelines, the approval must comport with NEPA. This requirement is stated explicitly in the NIH Guidelines, 43 Fed.Reg. 33110 (July 28, 1978), JA 465; even if it were not, approvals by NIH \u2014 federal actions \u2014 would be valid only if the agency discharged its duties under NEPA. Without valid NIH approval <em>under NEPA, </em>the University cannot lawfully go forward with its experiment, and it can thus be enjoined by the court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">We note also that the justification for NIH\u2019s requirement of approval \u2014 a requirement that has not been challenged by the University \u2014 is that the University receives funds for recombinant DNA research. Federal funding has long been recognized as an appropriate basis to enforce NEPA\u2019s requirements on non-federal parties. <em>See Biderman v. Morton, supra, </em>497 F.2d at 1147; <em>Bradford Township v. Illinois State Highway Authority, </em>463 F.2d 537, 540 (7th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1047, 93 S.Ct. 518, 34 L.Ed.2d 499 (1972); <em>Named Individual Members of San Antonio Conservation Society v. Texas Highway Dep\u2019t, </em>446 F.2d 1013, 1028 (5th Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 933, 92 S.Ct. 1775, 32 L.Ed.2d 136 (1972). In view of the University\u2019s commitment to abide by the binding conditions of the Guidelines, we need not decide whether the funding would itself provide a sufficient basis to support an injunction against the University.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">2. <em>Exhaustion. </em>The University appellant argues that plaintiffs\u2019 objections to the University of California experiment should be barred because plaintiffs failed to raise the objections during the period of NIH consideration. The University appellant points out that NIH announced the experiments and the RAC meetings in the <em>Federal Register </em>and invited public comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The general rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies is that \u201cclaims not presented to the agency may not be made for the first time to a reviewing court.\u201d <em>Washington Ass\u2019n for Television &amp; Children v. FCC, </em>712 F.2d 677, 680 (D.C.Cir. 1983). However, this well-established exhaustion doctrine is ultimately an exercise of judicial discretion. <em>Action for Children\u2019s Television v. FCC, </em>564 F.2d 458, 469 (D.C.Cir.1977); <em>Great Falls Community TV Cable Co. v. FCC, </em>416 F.2d 238, 239 (9th Cir.1969); <em>Joseph v. FCC, </em>404 F.2d 207, 210 (D.C.Cir.1968). In \u201cexceptional cases or particular circumstances * * * where injustice might otherwise result,\u201d the reviewing court may \u201cconsider questions of law which were neither pressed nor passed upon by the * * * administrative agency below.\u201d <em>Hormel v. Helvering, </em>312 U.S. 552, 557, 61 S.Ct. 719, 721, 85 L.Ed. 1037 (1941). In this case the issue \u2014 the appropriate environmental review for the first deliberate release of genetically engineered organisms \u2014 is one of great public importance. Indeed, this imminent application of a new technology with unknown environmental consequences is precisely the kind of situation NEPA is intended to address. <em>See Scientists \u2019 Institute for Public Information v. AEC, supra, </em>481 F.2d at 1089. Given the public importance of this issue, we refuse to find that the decision to hear plaintiffs\u2019 challenge is an abuse of judicial discretion, particularly in view of NEPA's clear policy favoring public scrutiny of environmental considerations, <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Additionally, we note that the exhaustion doctrine is premised on a view of fairness to the agency and to the litigants. <em>United States v. L.A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., </em>344 U.S. 33, 37, 73 S.Ct. 67, 69, 97 L.Ed. 54 (1952). The University\u2019s claims of unfairness to NIH and to itself are unconvincing. As noted, the possibility of dispersal was not a surprise: NIH explicitly recognized the possibility, but completely failed to consider its possible environmental impact. There was thus no question of unfairness or surprise; there was simply the lack of consideration to the environmental effects of the admitted possibility of dispersion. In these circumstances, a failure to object during the administrative process should not bar plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">3. <em>The District Court review. </em>The University appellant also attacks the District Court\u2019s review of the record on two grounds: it argues that the District Court improperly failed to review the entire administrative record, and that it improperly cast a burden of rebuttal upon the agency. Neither of these contentions is substantial. The District Court did note that \u201cNEPA does not require this Court to reconstruct the environmental deliberations of an agency for their adequacy when the agency chooses not to follow the steps out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>lined in NEPA.\u201d 587 F.Supp. at 767. However, in context this comment must be read to mean that the agency\u2019s deliberation should be part of the administrative record; the court will not supply reasons that the agency has not revealed in its decisionmak-ing process. <em>See Motor Vehicle Mfrs Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., </em>463 U.S. 29,-, 103 S.Ct. 2856, 2865, 77 L.Ed.2d 443 (1983) (hereinafter cited as <em>State Farm </em>to 103 S.Ct. only). Indeed, the District Court emphasized that it had reviewed both the \u201cformal\u201d and the \u201cinformal\u201d record of the agency decisionmaking process. 587 F.Supp. at 767-768.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Similarly, the University seeks to make much of the District Court\u2019s use of the word \u201crebutted\u201d in its conclusion that \u201cplaintiffs have identified several areas of plausible environmental concerns which are not rebutted\u201d in the agency record. <em>Id. </em>at 767. It is clear, however, that, far from putting a rebuttal burden on the agency, the District Court was merely referring to whether the agency had considered the problem. Thus both arguments can be dismissed as semantic.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">4. <em>Balancing of the injunction criteria. </em>The University also argues that, whatever plaintiffs\u2019 likelihood of success on the merits, the injunction is not justified under the other three criteria that the court must balance in weighing a request for injunctive relief \u2014 the threat of irreparable injury to the plaintiffs, the possibility of injury to other interested parties, and the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">The District Court\u2019s discretion in balancing these factors is broad. \u201cThe nature of the discretion peculiar to the preliminary injunction lies in the latitude given to the District Court to engage in a balancing of the traditional factors * * <em>Friends for All Children, Inc. v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp., supra, </em>746 F.2d at 835 n. 32. The District Court\u2019s determinations about the harm to plaintiffs, the harm to other parties, and the public interest were eminently sound, and far from the abuse of discretion that would justify reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">One point bears further elucidation. The University seeks to minimize the injury that would result if its experiment proceeds without adequate environmental consideration. In doing so the University fundamentally misconceives the nature and significance of NEPA\u2019s requirements. The NEPA duty is more than a technicality; it is an extremely important statutory requirement to serve the public and the agency <em>before </em>major federal actions occur. <em>Jones v. D.C. Redevelopment Land Agency, </em>499 F.2d 502, 513 (D.C.Cir.1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 U.S. 937, 96 S.Ct. 299, 46 L.Ed.2d 271 (1975); <em>Environmental Defense Fund v. TVA, </em>468 F.2d 1164, 1184 (6th Cir.1972); <em>Scherr v. Volpe, </em>466 F.2d 1027, 1034 (7th Cir.1972); <em>Calvert Cliffs\u2019 Coordinating Committee v. USAEC, supra, </em>449 F.2d at 1115. If plaintiffs succeed on the merits, then the lack of an adequate environmental consideration looms as a serious, immediate, and irreparable injury. Although the <em>balancing </em>of this harm against other factors is necessarily particularized, <em>State of Alaska v. Andrus, </em>580 F.2d 465, 485 (D.C.Cir.), <em>vacated in part on other grounds sub nom. Western Oil &amp; Gas Ass\u2019n v. Alaska, </em>439 U.S. 922, 99 S.Ct. 303, 58 L.Ed.2d 315 (1978), the injury itself is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>In conclusion, we find that the University\u2019s procedural objections are meritless. None of those objections prevents us from reaching our central holding: the District Court\u2019s finding that plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that NIH failed to give adequate environmental consideration to the University of California experiment was entirely correct, and the resulting injunction completely proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">IV. The Injunction Against NIH Approval of All Other Deliberate Release Experiments</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The District Court also found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed in showing that NIH should have completed an EIS (1) in 1978, when it revised the Guidelines to make deliberate release possible, and (2) in 1982 or 1983, when it became clear that NIH would be receiving proposals for deliberate release of genetically engineered organisms. The District Court thus enjoined NIH from approving all other deliberate release experiments.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">We share the District Court\u2019s view that the administrative record is almost completely bereft of evidence suggesting that NIH has sought to address the question of deliberate release experiments systematically. We find, however, that as a matter of law we must reverse the District Court\u2019s holding that plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that NIH is now required to undertake an EIS in connection with the 1978 policy change, or a programmatic EIS in connection with the impending requests for approval of deliberate release experiments.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">A. <em>The 1978 Policy Change</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">The District Court found that a review of the 1978 revision \u201csuggests that plaintiffs will prevail on their claims of a violation of either NEPA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332(2)(C), or the Administrative Procedure!;] Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(D).\u201d 587 F.Supp. at 762. The District Court reasoned that the revision \u2014 permitting the possibility of deliberate release \u2014 was a \u201cmajor federal action.\u201d NIH itself decreed the 1978 change a \u201cmajor revision\u201d of the EIS-accompanied 1976 Guidelines. The District Court further found that the administrative record revealed no evidence that the NIH Director had considered the possibility of a significant environmental effect. The first EA merely stated that any approval must \u201cinclude a careful consideration of potential environmental impact,\u201d 43 Fed.Reg. 33111 (July 28, 1978), JA 466; the second EA was silent on the impact of the change; and the Director, in his decision to publish the final Guidelines, deferred elaboration of standards until later. The District Court thus concluded that plaintiffs were likely to succeed in showing that the NIH decision not to complete an EIS accompanying its 1978 revision violated NEPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">The federal appellants and the University vigorously dispute this finding, and they raise several substantive and procedural objections to it. We need not consider most of these contentions. The emphasis on the 1978 revision is misguided for two reasons. First, the policy revision did not irrevocably commit NIH to any decision. Direct release was not then an imminent possibility, and NIH retained authority to grant or deny approval on a case-by-case basis. \u201cNEPA requires an agency to evaluate the environmental effects of its action at the point of commitment,\u201d <em>Sierra Club v. Peterson, supra, </em>717 F.2d at 1414, and the 1978 policy change did not necessarily represent the \u201cpoint of commitment\u201d that triggers NEPA. Indeed, the District Court itself recognized that the 1978 decision could be seen as a \u201cdecision deferred,\u201d 587 F.Supp. at 769, rather than a commitment. Second, significant changes have occurred since 1978, including the maturation of genetic engineering to a point where deliberate release is feasible and imminent. Agency determinations about EIS requirements are supposed to be <em>forward-looking, Nat\u2019l Wildlife Federation v. Appalachian Regional Comm\u2019n, </em>677 F.2d 883, 889 (D.C. Cir.1981), and it makes little sense to rest a judgment on <em>prospective </em>relief on decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>made several years ago under very different circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Given these two circumstances, the focus on the 1978 revision as an independent basis for an injunction and an EIS requirement is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">B. <em>The Programmatic EIS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The District Court found that plaintiffs are likely to prevail in showing that NIH should complete a programmatic EIS. As this court has explained, under NEPA two types of EIS are possible: programmatic and specific. \u201cA programmatic EIS reflects the broad environmental consequences attendant upon a wide-ranging federal program. The thesis underlying programmatic EISs is that a systematic program is likely to generate disparate yet related impacts. * * * Whereas the programmatic EIS looks ahead and assimilates \u2018broad issues\u2019 relevant to [the program], the site-specific EIS addresses more particularized considerations * * <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife Federation v. Appalachian Regional Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>677 F.2d at 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Various standards guide judicial review of whether an agency should complete a programmatic EIS. The Supreme Court has emphasized that the question of preparing a programmatic EIS is initially committed to the agency. <em>Kleppe v. Sierra Club, supra, </em>427 U.S. 390, 96 S.Ct. 2718, 49 L.Ed.2d 576. Under CEQ regulations a programmatic EIS <em>should </em>be prepared if actions are \u201cconnected,\u201d \u201ccumulative,\u201d or sufficiently \u201csimilar\u201d that a programmatic EIS is \u201cthe best way\u201d to identify the environmental effects. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.25. As this court has noted, \u201cTwo considerations are especially helpful in reviewing the responsible officials\u2019 decision not to prepare a programmatic EIS: (a) Could the programmatic EIS be sufficiently forward looking to contribute to the decisionmak-ers\u2019 basic planning of the overall program? and (b) Does the decisionmaker purport to \u2018segment\u2019 the overall program, thereby unreasonably constricting the scope of * * * environmental evaluation?\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife Federation v. Appalachian Regional Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>677 F.2d at 889. Thus a programmatic EIS should be prepared if it can be forward-looking and if its absence will obstruct environmental review.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">The District Court found that \u201cthe federal defendants have passed the point at which a programmatic EIS is required by NEPA and the Council on Environmental Quality\u2019s regulations.\u201d 587 F.Supp. at 764. Though we share the District Court\u2019s view that a programmatic EIS would be <em>helpful, </em>we are not prepared to agree, on the record before us, that, as a matter of law, plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that the absence of a programmatic EIS unreasonably constricts environmental evaluation. If NIH gives adequate environmental consideration to each deliberate release experiment \u2014 and, as noted, that consideration must be far more complete and rigorous than the consideration NIH has thus far undertaken \u2014 then we cannot, at this point, say that such consideration will obstruct environmental review. We thus reverse the District Court\u2019s finding that plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing, at this point, that the governing law requires NIH to complete a programmatic EIS on deliberate release experiments.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">This reversal, however, should not be construed to mean that NIH need give no consideration to the environmental effects of deliberate release experiments beyond the individual experiments. Since NIH has given no serious consideration to whether a programmatic EIS is justified, we cannot evaluate its claims that deliberate release experiments are neither so \u201ccumulative\u201d or \u201cconnected\u201d that a programmatic EIS is required under the CEQ regulations, nor so \u201csimilar\u201d that a programmatic EIS may not be \u201cthe best way to assess adequately\u201d their environmental effects. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.25. Additionally, we note that federal development of a new technology with unknown environmental consequences is the type of action in which programmatic considerations are particularly important. <em>Scientists\u2019 Institute for Public Information v. AEC, supra, </em>481 F.2d at 1089-1090. NIH is about to begin a process of review<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>ing what will be a stream of applications for approval of a new technology with unknown environmental consequences. Under these circumstances, NIH should at least consider whether a programmatic EIS is required to fulfill the agency\u2019s legal obligations under NEPA and the CEQ regulations. We thus conclude that, if NIH does not at least consider the advisability of a programmatic EIS, its approval of individual deliberate release experiments is likely to violate established principles of reasoned decisionmaking. <em>See State Farm, supra, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2867 (agency may not \u201centirely fail[] to consider an important aspect of the problem\u201d). And, unlike NIH\u2019s completely conclusorv statement that it would not prepare a programmatic EIS, 49 Fed. Reg. 697 (January 5, 1984), reasoned consideration of these important aspects of the problem should reflect an articulated, \u201crational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u201d <em>Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, supra, </em>371 U.S. at 168, 83 S.Ct. at 246.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">In short, we vacate the part of the injunction enjoining NIH approval of all deliberate release experiments, but we stress that NIH\u2019s attention to important issues regarding deliberate release experiments will continue to influence whether its individual decisions may be found to reflect the \u201crule of reason,\u201d <em>Committee for Auto Responsibility v. Solomon, supra, </em>603 F.2d at 1003, that measures the adequacy of environmental review.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">NIH, no less than any other federal agency, must ensure that its decisions meet the standards of environmental concern and reasoned decisionmaking required by law. The complexity and uncertainty of the issues before NIH do not diminish these responsibilities one iota. Indeed, \u201cone of the functions of a NEPA statement is to indicate the extent to which environmental effects are essentially unknown. * * * [W]e must reject any attempt by agencies to shirk their responsibilities under NEPA by labeling any and all discussion of future environmental effects as \u2018crystal ball inquiry.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scientists\u2019 Institute for Public Information v. AEC, supra, </em>481 F.2d at 1092.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">We affirm the injunction as it applies to the University of California experiment. We vacate the injunction as it applies to NIH\u2019s approval of all other deliberate release experiments, but we share and support the District Court\u2019s concern that NIH has not yet given adequate consideration to broad and important issues relating to its role in approving deliberate release experiments.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">\n<em>Affirmed in part and vacated in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-6\">.

The University\u2019s arguments defending the NIH review are completely unconvincing. For instance, the University emphasizes that the use of chemically induced non-frost-triggering bacteria has produced \"no untoward environmental consequences.\" Brief for appellant Regents at 42.

JA 829. Similarly, the University points to the presence of non-frost-triggering bacteria in nature. Brief for appellant Regents at 42.

The University argues that this appeal differs from the cases cited in <em>Biderman </em>because the University\u2019s obligation to receive NIH approval arises as a condition of the University\u2019s decision to receive federal funds for recombinant DNA research. However, NIH approval of deliberate release experiments is an explicit, regulatorily-created condition to receipt of federal funds for recombinant DNA research, as the University well knew in accepting the federal funds. Whether the requirement of federal approval arises as a statutorily-created condition, as in the <em>Biderman </em>cases, or as a regulatorily-created condition, as in this case, is of no particular moment to the underlying question of judicial power. Most fundamentally, we reject the notion that a federal court is unable to enjoin a party who proposes to defy an explicit regulatory condition governing receipt and expenditure of federal funds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b228-6\">. For all of its salutary effect on rational government decisionmaking, <em>see </em>S. Breyer &amp; R. Stewart, Administrative Law and Regulatory Policy 63 (1979); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (1982), the <em>Federal Register </em>was never intended to be a means of limiting public discourse and judicial access to those who scrutinize its daily notices. Such a strong-armed invocation of <em>Federal Register </em>publication as a bar to subsequent objection raised in a reasonably timely fashion is particularly inappropriate in the context of a statute like NEPA that seeks to further public attention and debate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b229-9\">. Whatever the District Court\u2019s review, this court has reviewed the entire administrative record \u2014 the researchers\u2019 proposals, the RAC minutes, and the <em>Federal Register </em>notices \u2014 and we fully support the District Court\u2019s findings. We have had no indication that there is anything more to the administrative record. The RAC process, moreover, is relevant only insofar as it reveals the NIH Director\u2019s decisionmaking process. As the NIH Director has made clear, \"It is not the function of the RAC to determine what NEPA and the CEQ regulations require. The RAC is not constituted to interpret points of law and the requirements of NEPA. Specifically, it is not a function of RAC to determine when an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment is required by NEPA.\u201d 49 Fed.Reg. 697 (Jan. 5, 1984). Thus the relevant administrative record is the record that was before the Director at the time of his decision. <em>Walter O. Boswell Memorial Hospital v.

The choice of the document in which to consider these issues is, of course, the agency\u2019s, but the first environmental assessment accompanying a deliberate release experiment may well be an appropriate and convenient forum for NIH to address these concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-13\">We note also that, despite the Director\u2019s comments in 1978 about the helpfulness of general standards in guiding individual experiment decisions, no such standards have yet been implemented. Through post-argument submissions, however, the parties advise us that RAC is now taking steps to develop standards.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b232-11\">MacKINNON, Senior Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ada\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">I am of opinion that the Foundation should have made its original application to NIH. I do not agree that the failure to exhaust can be disposed of by the cases cited holding that exhaustion is \u201cultimately an exercise of judicial discretion.\u201d Opinion <em>supra, </em>156. This is not a case of just failure to exhaust in a pending proceeding before an agency, but a case of a complete failure of the Foundation to present any claim or objection whatsoever to the agency \u2014 NIH. Thus, the normal exhaustion cases where the parties have appeared before the agency are not applicable. However, since the issues in this case are of great importance, new and novel I do not dissent because we are remanding the major issues in the case to the agency where what should have been done by all parties will now be done, and we are re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>versing in other major respects. I have the following additional comments:</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">I can understand how the RAC scientists who are knowledgeable in this field of genetic engineering would approve the experiment by a vote of 19-0 with no abstentions. It would seem an experiment that releases into the environment organisms substantially the same as some already living there, and subject to the same naturally occurring controls, would present no risk. However, the general public and those who have to pass on this action are not knowledgeable in this field and they are easily frightened by new scientific experiments and their possible consequences. It is such lay concerns that must here be satisfied by Environmental Assessments and Environmental Impact Statements. There is considerable merit, moreover, in having all the environmental considerations set forth and discussed in one document rather than compelling those who review such matters to look through the nooks and crannies of a very extensive record to see that all environmental considerations were satisfied. The present record does indicate that those who participated at all stages of this project were concerned with and did consider many, but not all environmental issues, but the proof thereof is scattered throughout the record. An Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement would present the consideration of all relevant environmental issues in one document that would not only ease lay concerns, but facilitate review as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">We would undoubtedly have had a better record in this connection if the Foundation on Economic Trends had not failed to raise its objections while the matter was pending before the National Institutes of Health. Due notice of the pendency of the matter was given in the Federal Register and comment was invited, but none was forthcoming. Had the objections of the Foundation been alertly raised before the agency, the district court and this court would undoubtedly have had a better record to consider and might even have been spared the necessity of ruling on the case. The RAC scientists, by their original vote, had approved a more extensive release. But the closeness of the vote led them to reconsider. The experiment was then reduced in magnitude and in that form was unanimously approved by the RAC scientists. Had the Foundation submitted its objections to the agency, it is thus more than likely, given the demonstrated sensitivity of NIH and its scientists to such matters, that the University and the agency would have responded to any objections and the record here, if the Foundation were not satisfied, would have been more complete and useful. I am thus not so concerned about the fairness to the agency and to the litigants as I am that the Foundation\u2019s delay deprived this court of the normal administrative record and consideration by the district court that are required to meet the issues raised by the Foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The Foundation\u2019s conduct also has delayed this vital experiment for a very considerable period of time. The use of delaying tactics by those who fear and oppose scientific progress is nothing new. It would, however, be a national catastrophe if the development of this promising new science of genetic engineering were crippled by the unconscionable delays that have been brought about by litigants using the National Environmental Policy Act and other environmental legislation in other areas. The protracted litigations involving the Alaska pipeline, nuclear power plants, and the Clean Air Act present only a few examples.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">These concerns extend to the court\u2019s comments concerning the possibility of a Programmatic EIS (pp. 159-160). It is my opinion that because the possibilities of genetic engineering, an industry still in its infancy, extend to so many areas, and because the development of a programmatic EIS would be vulnerable to delaying tactics, composing a programmatic EIS at this time would be neither justified, practical, nor prudent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
