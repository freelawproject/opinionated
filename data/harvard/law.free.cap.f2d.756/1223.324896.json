BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1296-18\">Point Marine, Inc., the owner and operator of M/V POINT DOVER attacks the district court\u2019s judgment imputing on accepted principles the negligence of the vessel\u2019s Master to the vessel owner under the theory of <em>respondeat superior </em>so as to make Point Marine liable for damage to Union\u2019s undersea pipeline. How the application of such accepted principles could arrest the attention of this busy court takes a little doing. It comes about because the time charter between Point Marine and Union provides that the vessel owner shall not be responsible for loss or damage to charterer\u2019s property unless caused by the \u201cactual fault or privity of the owner.\u201d We agree with Point Marine that the use of this time-honored, carbuncle-encrusted, saltwater phrase makes the usual motion of <em>respondeat superior </em>inapplicable under the terms of this charter party and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-19\">\n<em>Anchors Aweigh</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-20\">Union Oil Company of California (Union) is part owner of an undersea pipeline connected to a fixed platform off the coast of Texas at High Island Block A-443. Union time chartered the M/V POINT DOVER from Point Marine, Inc. to transport supplies to several drilling platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Union received a permit to construct a subsea pipeline approximately 16.7 miles in length in the Gulf of Mexico. The pipe was welded on land and in September, 1980, set in place on the sea bottom. The pipeline remained on the sea floor awaiting burial at a minimum depth of three feet before actual oil flow operations could begin. The pipeline extended from the platform in a southwesterly direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-21\">The POINT DOVER approached the platform early in the morning of November 28, 1980 (approximately 4 a.m.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>the weather the POINT DOVER was unable to tie up safely to the platform.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-4\">The trial court determined that POINT DOVER\u2019S Master, Gary Williams, knew that there was a pipeline somewhere in the area connected to the platform although he had no precise knowledge of its location. The Master radioed to the personnel on the platform and was informed that it was safe to anchor to the northwest of the platform. Unfortunately, the Master of POINT DOVER became disoriented and dropped anchor south of the rig. That afternoon the weather cleared and the vessel made her delivery to the platform. The Master then ordered a crewman, Billy Pace, to weigh anchor. The trial court found that as the anchor was coming up crew members heard the grinding of the winch which indicated that the anchor was stuck on a heavy object. Apparently, the crew continued to draw up the anchor for five to ten minutes and during this time they discussed the laboring sound of the winch motor. When the anchor surfaced, Union\u2019s pipeline was caught in the flukes and the Master ordered the anchor line cut.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-5\">The trial court concluded \u2014 and the vessel owner does not dispute \u2014 that the crew\u2019s failure to attempt an earlier \u201cfree fall\u201d of the anchor when there was first notice of the snag constituted negligence which proximately caused Union\u2019s damages. The trial court \u2014 in what is either a non-sequitur or an absence of supporting reason \u2014 further determined that although the time charter provides that the vessel owner shall not be responsible for loss or damage arising without the \u201cactual fault or privity of the owner,\u201d privity of shoreside management was not a prerequisite to liability in this case since the actual fault of the vessel\u2019s Master was established. Essentially, the trial court applied the principle of <em>re-spondeat superior </em>to impose liability on Point Marine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-6\">\n<em>Actual Fault or Privity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-7\">As though the scrivener had the very first edition of Benedict at his side, the time charter contained the following liability provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-10\">Neither the vessel nor OWNER shall be responsible for any loss or damage however arising or resulting, unless caused <em>by want of due diligence on the part of OWNER to make the vessel seaworthy </em>or have it properly manned, equipped, and supplied at the inception of the voyage, or from any cause whatsoever <em>arising without the actual fault or privity of OWNER, </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1297-11\">Point Marine argues that the trial court erroneously concluded that the vessel owner would be liable on the imputed, admitted, Master\u2019s negligence under the usual principle of <em>respondeat superior. </em>Rather, it contends the phrase \u201cactual fault or privity\u201d should be interpreted and applied in light of the usual meaning attributed to the phrase in the vast body of maritime law including its use in the Limitation of Liability Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 183(a), the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(2)(b), and the Fire Statute, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 182. We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1297-12\">In <em>Continental Insurance Co. v. Sabine Towing Co., </em>117 F.2d 694, 1941 A.M.C. 262 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>313 U.S. 588, 61 S.Ct. 1111, 85 L.Ed. 1543, 1941 A.M.C. 1010 (1941), we dealt with a similar phrase in a marine insurance policy. The <em>Continental Insurance </em>policy provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1297-13\">This company hereby undertakes to make good to the Assured or the Assured\u2019s executors, administrators and/or assigns, all such loss and/or expenses as the Assured shall, <em>without fault or privity </em>on the party of the Assured, become liable to pay and shall pay, not exceeding the amount of this policy on account of the liabilities, risks, events, happenings and/or occurrences herein set forth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AR0\"><em>Continental, </em>117 F.2d at 700 n. 12, 1941 A.M.C. at 270 n. 12 (emphasis supplied). Sabine Towing contended, and in that case the district court agreed, that the phrase \u201cwithout fault or privity\u201d should be applied only in connection with willful or intentional acts on the part of the assured. We disagreed and determined that \u201cwithout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>fault or privity\u201d should be given the same meaning and effect as used in the American<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and English statutes<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. In reaching this decision we reasoned that Sabine\u2019s offer of oral testimony concerning the underwriters\u2019 meaning and effect of the words used was inadmissible since this phrase as used in insurance policies or other maritime contracts has a plain and settled meaning in popular and legal usage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1298-4\">In <em>Larsen v. Insurance Co. of North America, </em>362 F.2d 261 (9th Cir.1966), the Ninth Circuit determined that the phrase \u201cnavigation and/or management of the vessel\u201d in an Inchmaree clause<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in a marine insurance policy should be given the same construction as is given under the Harter Act,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 192 and COGSA,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(2)(a). It was argued in that case that the special purpose of the Harter Act and COGSA rendered a similar construction of the phrase in the insurance policy inappropriate. The Ninth Circuit disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-14\">The analysis of <em>Continental </em>and <em>Larsen </em>applies with equal force to give us ample basis for independently reaching a like result here. The phrase \u201cactual fault or privity\u201d in the lore and the law of the sea has a settled meaning as do the familiar terms bo\u2019s\u2019n or fo\u2019c\u2019s\u2019le head. <em>Cf. Empire Seafood, Inc. v. Anderson, </em>398 F.2d 204, 210 n. 4, 1968 A.M.C. 2664, 2671 n. 4 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 983, 89 S.Ct. 449, 21 L.Ed.2d 444 (1968). The construction which Union seeks, would repudiate over a century of legal writing and salty literature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1298-15\">As a part of the accepted jargon of those who do not necessarily go down to sea in ships but spend their lifetimes in legal writing about the calling, we would point out that this phrase is not unique to this charter party. It appears in the Genvoy,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>eral purpose charter party and the Nippon-voy<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 1963 voyage charter party. <em>See </em>2B Benedict, Admiralty, 7th Ed. (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"aun-dedup-0\">We would add that actual fault or privity is not the only time-worn, war-weary maritime term of art used in this charter party, That same clause contains the phrase \u201cdue diligence.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The general maritime law reads into every charter a warranty of seaworthiness. <em>The CALEDONIA, </em>157 U.S. 124, 130, 15 S.Ct. 537, 540, 39 L.Ed. 644, 646 (1895). This warranty is absolute and does not depend upon the knowledge of the owner or diligence to provide a seawor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>thy vessel. <em>Martin v. The SOUTHWARK, </em>191 U.S. 1, 6, 24 S.Ct. 1, 2, 48 L.Ed. 65, 68 (1903). COGSA ameliorated this absolute warranty and substituted an obligation on the part of the vessel owner to use \u201cdue diligence\u201d to make the vessel seaworthy. COGSA, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1303(1). Specifically, the use of the phrase \u201cdue diligence\u201d in this charter party creates rights and obligations as understood by proctors, ex-proctors and former proctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">Moreover, while not directly applicable, it is just one more juridical barnacle to demonstrate that the quills of those who were at work in confecting this charter were dipped deeply in the salty language of the sea which is understood by those on, in or near it, including judges who have come to savor its salty tang.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">The Master\u2019s negligence, gross as it may be assumed, is not the test. The court was wrong in hanging on <em>respondeat superior. </em>What about privity and knowledge?</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-6\">\n<em>Privity and Knowledge of Point Marine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-7\">What is privity or knowledge turns on the facts of each individual case. <em>Gibboney v. Wrigkt, </em>517 F.2d 1054, 1058 (5th Cir.1975). The phrase \u201cactual fault or privity\u201d in light of the principles of the Limitation Act means complicity by managerial levels in the fault that caused the casualty. <em>Empire Seafoods, </em>398 F.2d at 210 n. 4, 1968 A.M.C. at 2671 n. 4. Under these principles the owner is relieved of personal liability when he or managerial persons have not been personally negligent or privy to the negligence of servants or agents. <em>Continental, </em>117 F.2d at 698, 1941 A.M.C. at 268. It is similar to the Fire Statute\u2019s, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 182 use of the phrase \u201cdesign or neglect.\u201d A finding of neglect of owner means personal negligence, or in the case of a corporate owner, negligence of managing officers and agents as distinguished from that of the Master or his subordinates. <em>Consumers Import Co. v. Kabushiki Kaisha Kawasaki Zosenjo, </em>320 U.S. 249, 64 S.Ct. 15, 88 L.Ed. 30, 1943 A.M.C. 1209 (1943); <em>see also Earle &amp; Stoddart, Inc. v. Ellerman\u2019s Wilson Line, Ltd., </em>287 U.S. 420, 424-25, 53 S.Ct. 200, 200-01, 77 L.Ed. 403, 1933 A.M.C. 1, 5 (1932); <em>Westinghouse Electric Corp. v. M/V LESLIE LYKES, </em>734 F.2d 199, 210, 1985 A.M.C. 247, 256 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 577, 83 L.Ed.2d 514 (1984), <em>Complaint of Ta Chi Navigation (Panama) Corp., S.A., </em>677 F.2d 225, 1982 A.M.C. 1710 (2d Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-11\">COGSA, in 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(2)(b), provides that \u201cneither the carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising or resulting from \u2014 (b) fire unless caused by the actual fault or privity of the carrier____\u201d Actual fault or privity as contained in this COGSA provision has been held to be substantially equivalent to \u201cdesign or neglect\u201d in the Fire Statute. <em>Complaint of Ta Chi Navigation (Panama) Corp., S.A., </em>677 F.2d at 228, 1982 A.M.C. at 1714; <em>Asbestos Corp. Ltd. v. Compagnie De Navigation Fraissinet Et Cyprien Fabre, </em>480 F.2d 669, 672, 1973 A.M.C. 1683, 1686 (2d Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-13\">Union urges that the negligence of the Master in becoming disoriented, circling around the rig and in allowing the winch to labor for five to ten minutes was within the privity and knowledge of Point Marine\u2019s shoreside management. We simply cannot understand why. The vessel (and crew) were miles from shore and any shore-based personnel, top or low level. These acts of the Master and the crew \u2014 bewildered or not \u2014 were purely errors in navigation while at sea which, under the facts of this case imposed no liability on the vessel or owner. <em>See Farrell Lines v. Jones, </em>530 F.2d 7, 10, 1976 A.M.C. 1639, 1643 (5th Cir.1976); <em>Jacobus Grauwiller Co. v. Reichert, </em>136 F.2d 904, 1943 A.M.C. 822 (2d Cir.1943); <em>General Foods Corp. v. The MORMACSURF, </em>276 F.2d 722, 1960 A.M.C. 1103 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>364 U.S. 822, 81 S.Ct. 58, 5 L.Ed.2d 52, 1961 A.M.C. 288 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-14\">In determining how to interpret these common phrases we recall that the principal purpose of the Limitation Act is to afford protection to the remote owner who, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>after the ship is underweigh, has no effective control over the vessel, its Master and crew. <em>Tittle v. Aldacosta, </em>544 F.2d 752, 756, 1978 A.M.C. 112, 117 (5th Cir.1977); G. Gilmore &amp; C. Black, <em>The Law of Admiralty, </em>\u00a7 10-20 at 877 (1975); <em>see also Mac Towing, Inc. v. American Commercial Lines, </em>670 F.2d 543, 548 (5th Cir.1982). The disorientation of the vessel\u2019s Master and the weighing of the anchor were errors made by the Master or crew and were intimately connected with the remote navigation of the ship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-4\">Having determined that the phrase \u201cactual fault or privity\u201d should be interpreted in light of the principles of maritime law and these statutes, we conclude that the established errors in navigation do not impose liability on the vessel or owner. <em>Farrell Lines, </em>530 F.2d at 10, 1976 A.M.C. at 1643.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">Union contends that the lack of a chief engineer and the lack of proper navigational charts on board the M/V POINT DOVER rendered the vessel unseaworthy which, of course, would be within the privity of Point Marine\u2019s shoreside management.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-6\">Although Union argues that there were indeed maps available at the time of the casualty which would indicate the position of the pipeline in the area of the platform much doubt remains in the proof. During the discovery phase of this case, Union admitted in response to Point Marine\u2019s request for admissions that there were no maps aboard the platform or commercially available which would show the position of the pipeline. Later it urged, however, that a chart was available through the Bureau of Land Management which showed the position of the pipeline. Union never proved that this Bureau of Land Management chart was reasonably commercially available \u2014 or its likely existence known to the sea-faring trade \u2014 at or before the time of the casualty. It failed to carry its burden of proof. Whatever, the trial court concluded that the predominant cause of the accident was the disorientation of the Master while he was attempting to drop anchor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-8\">Union also urges that the failure to have these nautical charts aboard the vessel was due to a failure to use due diligence to make the vessel seaworthy thus permitting a finding of liability under the terms of the charter party. Although failure to provide a vessel with essential navigational charts may constitute unseaworthiness, <em>see e.g., Com. of Puerto Rico v. The S.S. ZOE COLOCOTRONI, </em>456 F.Supp. 1327, 1333, 1979 A.M.C. 21, 26-27 (D.Puerto Rico 1978), affirmed in part, vacated in part, 682 F.2d 652, 1981 A.M.C. 2185 (1st Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 912, 101 S.Ct. 1350, 67 L.Ed.2d 336, 1981 A.M.C. 2099 (1981); <em>The MARIA, </em>91 F.2d 819, 1937 A.M.C. 934 (4th Cir.1937), Union\u2019s argument fails since there was no proof at trial that a significant chart was reasonably available.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-9\">Union also asserts that there was an inadequate crew aboard the M/V POINT DOVER since there was no chief engineer on board. It argues that (i) the lack of a chief engineer rendered the vessel unsea-worthy which, quite obviously, was within the privity of Point Marine\u2019s management, (ii) failure to have a chief engineer was a violation of 46 C.F.R. \u00a7 157.30-10 (1980), and (iii) the vessel breached its duty to exercise due diligence to make the vessel seaworthy or have it properly manned at the inception of the voyage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-10\">Although the vessel must be manned with a competant crew, a deficiency in manning that has no causal connection to the damages in issue is not significant. <em>Southern Pacific Co. v. United States, </em>72 F.2d 212, 215, 1934 A.M.C. 1185, 1189 (2d Cir.1934). In <em>Southern Pacific, </em>cargo claimants in a limitation proceeding urged that the sailing without a first assistant engineer was statutory fault triggering the application of <em>The PENNSYLVANIA, </em>86 U.S. (19 Wall.) 125, 22 L.Ed. 148 (1874). The court determined that the vessel was entitled to limitation since there was no showing of any causal connection between the lack of the engineer and the collision in that case. <em>See also, Gertrude Parker, Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number><em>v. Abrams, </em>178 F.2d 259, 263, 1950 A.M.C. 29, 34 (2d Cir.1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">Union asserts'that the failure to have a licensed engineer on board the vessel was a violation of 46 C.F.R. \u00a7 157.30-10 (1980)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and as a result, Point Marine breached the charter party and in addition, the violation triggered the application of the Rule of <em>The </em>PENNSYLVANIA.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">Assuming, without deciding the applicability of the regulation,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we conclude that the failure to have a licensed chief engineer on board could not have been a cause of the damage to Union\u2019s pipeline. Had the chief engineer been aboard as urged, he would, or ought to have been, at his accustomed station in the engine room. How one in the engine room could have averted hooking up the pipeline is a mystery of the deep. Although the rule of <em>The PENNSYLVANIA </em>imposes a strenuous burden, it does not negate the clear requirement of causation. <em>Candies Towing v. The M/V B &amp; C ESERMAN, </em>673 F.2d 91, 1983 A.M.C. 2033 (5th Cir.1982).
