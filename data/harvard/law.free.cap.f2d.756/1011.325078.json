WINTER, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1083-22\">After the claimant, James A. Anderson, was successful in the district court in overturning the Secretary\u2019s determination that he was no longer entitled to social security disability benefits, he sought an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>court ruled that the position of the Secretary was \u201csubstantially justified\u201d and denied the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">We think otherwise. We reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for determination of an appropriate award.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">In 1973 Anderson was found to be disabled as a result of schizophrenia and was awarded benefits effective October 1972. The Secretary reviewed his case in February 1974 and September 1975 and determined both times that his disability continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-7\">Another review was undertaken in 1981, and this time an administrative law judge, whose decision became that of the Secretary, decided that Anderson\u2019s disability had ceased in May 1982, because he could engage in nonstressful work and could thus return to his former employment as a laborer in a tin can manufacturing company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-8\">Anderson then filed a pro se complaint in the district court to review and set aside the Secretary\u2019s determination. He subsequently obtained the aid of counsel and his suit was successful. By the time that his ease was heard, we had decided <em>Dotson v. Schweiker, </em>719 F.2d 80 (4 Cir.1983), which held that there was a presumption of Anderson\u2019s continuing disability and that it was the Secretary\u2019s burden to rebut the presumption. Anderson\u2019s lawyer briefed <em>Dotson </em>for the district court; the government\u2019s reply made no mention of <em>Dotson </em>and indeed argued that Anderson had \u201cthe burden of showing that his disability continued past the time of cessation found by the Secretary.\u201d As support for her argument, the Secretary relied on a decision of a sister circuit found to be inapposite in <em>Dotson. </em>In reversing the Secretary, the district court made a careful analysis of the medical evidence. It pointed out that two consulting psychiatrists found no improvement in Anderson\u2019s condition, one indicating that Anderson was not competent to manage his own funds, and that a consulting psychologist expressed the view that Anderson was not competent to work or to handle money.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-15\">The district court found that the only evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s decision was in the periodic summary and mental status evaluation of the VA\u2019s Day Treatment Center, dated November 6, 1981, which diagnosed Anderson\u2019s illness as \u201cschizophrenic reaction, chronic, <em>in remission, </em>in a dependent, limited personality.\u201d (emphasis added). However, another report from the same agency, with regard to Anderson\u2019s condition on April 19, 1982, said, variously, that over the past few months, Anderson \u201chas shown significant emotional decompensation and personality deterioration,\u201d that \u201crehospitalization ... was discussed\u201d, that Anderson\u2019s \u201cchild-likeness [sic] has increased\u201d, that \u201che is capable only of the most limited work in a sheltered setting\u201d, that he is \u201cmore anxious and much more depressed than he was in January\u201d, and that it was \u201cincreasingly difficult\u201d to maintain him in the community. Quite correctly, the district court ruled that the evidence was insubstantial to support the Secretary\u2019s determination that disability had ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-16\">Despite the insubstantiality of the Secretary\u2019s case on the merits, the district court denied the subsequent application for attorney's fees. It concluded that the Secretary had \u201crelied upon an arguably defensible administrative record which, under <em>Guthrie,'</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>established substantial justification for the government\u2019s position.\u201d The dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>trict court further commented that, although the evidence to support the Secretary was not substantial, \u201cthe administrative record was not entirely bereft of evidence in support of the government\u2019s position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">By the terms of the Act a prevailing party is entitled to an award of fees \u201cunless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). The only issue in this case is whether the position of the United States was \u201csubstantially justified.\u201d In <em>Smith v. Heckler, </em>739 F.2d 144 (4 Cir.1984), we held, relying on the legislative history of the Act, that the government could defeat a claim for fees if it showed that its position \u201chad a reasonable basis both in law and fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146. In the instant case, there are before us only two questions of the reasonableness of the Secretary\u2019s legal position \u2014 the legal argument as to burden of proof and whether there was substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s determination. When we apply that test here, we conclude that the government had no reasonable basis for either legal position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-7\">The Secretary\u2019s legal position with respect to her burden of proof was manifestly unreasonable. Even after a controlling precedent in this circuit was called to her attention, she ignored it and, even worse, argued in opposition to it without attempting to show how or why it was inapplicable. In cases in this circuit, the Secretary and her statutory counsel are bound by the precedents in this circuit until they are displaced by higher authority or are overruled by this court. Of course the Secretary is always free to argue reasons why she thinks a case is not controlling, or, if it is controlling, she may argue <em>to this court </em>why she thinks that it should be modified, but there was no such effort made in the instant case. The Secretary argued either out of shocking ignorance or shocking disrespect for the courts before which she appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-9\">We also think that the Secretary\u2019s legal position with respect to the sufficiency of the evidence to support her decision was unreasonable. We reject the standard applied by the district court \u2014 whether there is some evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s position. We think that the test is whether arguably there was substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s position. In this case, we think that there was not. An unexplained, unsupported phrase \u2014 \u201cin remission\u201d \u2014 in a report neither constitutes substantial evidence nor arguably constitutes substantial evidence when all of the Secretary\u2019s other medical evidence points in the opposite direction and when the organization employing the isolated phrase contradicts the correctness of that use by another almost contemporaneous, detailed, graphic report. It would seem elementary, except perhaps to the Secretary, that if the VA Day Treatment Center\u2019s report of \u201cin remission\u201d is to be given credence, there is on this record no ground not to believe the later report from the same agency that indicated Anderson immediately worsened and is but a step from being institutionalized. Thus there was no factual basis from which it could reasonably be argued that Anderson\u2019s disability had ceased, so the Secretary\u2019s legal argument that there was such evidence was not substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-10\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1083-14\">.

However, the repeal does not apply to actions commenced prior to that date.
