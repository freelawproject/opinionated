In the first appeal from his conviction, Zielezinski argued that a separate evidentiary hearing should be held to determine whether his indictment was tainted by his immunized testimony before the grand jury. This court remanded the case to the district court for a hearing at which the government was required to demonstrate that the indictment rested on sources independent of Zie-lezinski\u2019s testimony. <em>United States v. Zie-lezinski, </em>740 F.2d 727, 734 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-21\">Following the hearing, Judge Earl Carroll of the United States District Court for the District of Arizona issued an order upholding Zielezinski\u2019s conviction. The judge found that the government\u2019s sources of evidence were independent of the defendant\u2019s immunized testimony, the government\u2019s conduct did not threaten the integrity of the indictment by the grand jury, and that there was nothing in the record to suggest that the grand jury\u2019s decision was based on an assessment of the defendant\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-22\">The finding of the district court that the government\u2019s evidence is untainted by immunized testimony must be upheld unless clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>722 F.2d 557, 560 (9th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 105 S.Ct. 129, 83 L.Ed.2d 70 (1984). Defendant\u2019s counsel conceded at the hearing that the record includes evidence of the government\u2019s independent sources, but argued, and continues to argue in this appeal, that the indictment was tainted by the grand jury\u2019s assessment of Zielezinski\u2019s credibility during his immunized testimony. Judge Carroll specifically addressed this argument at the hearing. A review of the record discloses nothing that compels a reversal of Judge Carroll\u2019s finding as clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1520-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
