All of the defendant\u2019s convictions are predicated on actions he took while representing a criminal defendant, Betty Powell, in a separate criminal prosecution. After a seven-day trial the jury found the defendant not guilty on two counts of harboring a fugitive and perjury. The district court had previously dismissed the misprision of a felony count before the trial began. On appeal, the defendant raises a host of issues which, for the most part, we need not address. Three of the defendant\u2019s challenges, however, require reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions for the reasons explained herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-17\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"ahr-dedup-0\">The defendant was retained by Ronald Powell to represent his wife, Betty Lou Powell, and her son in a federal criminal prosecution on various drug-related charges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Powell had been a previous client of the defendant in unrelated criminal proceedings. After Mrs. Powell and her son were arrested at the Powell residence on April 23, 1982 in connection with the narcotics charges, Mr. Powell, who was also named in the felony arrest warrant, remained a fugitive until his apprehension on August 10, 1982. On the day of his wife\u2019s arrest, Mr. Powell telephoned the defendant, Frank Prantil, and retained his services for the criminal proceedings against his immediate family. Throughout Mr. Powell\u2019s fugitive status, the defendant periodically telephoned Mr. Powell and met him on at least two occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-18\">During their first meeting after the incarceration of Mrs. Powell, Mr. Powell presented the defendant with a partial payment of the retainer agreement and directed the defendant to the whereabouts of other sources of cash in various bank accounts and at the Powell residence. Mrs. Powell, unable to make a $750,000 bond, remained incarcerated until the completion of her criminal trial. She gave the defendant the power of attorney to collect the funds from the various bank accounts. The defendant also retrieved a substantial sum of money from a floor safe at the Powell residence that had been overlooked at the time of the Powell family arrest. Although questions over the capacity in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>which Mr. Prantil retained custody of these monies (as attorney fees or in bailment for Mrs. Powell) occupied a substantial portion of the defendant\u2019s trial, we need not parse the evidence on this subject here. Pursuant to the retainer agreement negotiated by Mr. Powell, the defendant represented Mrs. Powell for the duration of her criminal trial. The ease was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Charles Gorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Mr. Prantil succeeded in obtaining an acquittal on all but four of the fifteen criminal counts leveled against his client Mrs. Powell.- During the course of his representation of Mrs. Powell, the defendant also sent his sister-in-law, Malvina Schmidt, to meet the fugitive Ronald Powell for reasons not relevant here. Within the same time frame, the defendant, on several occasions, acted as the conduit for negotiations between the fugitive Ronald Powell and Assistant U.S. Attorney Gorder for Mr. Powell\u2019s surrender. During the period when Mr. Powell was a fugitive, the defendant was summoned before a grand jury and questioned by Mr. Gorder concerning his contacts and relationship with Mr. Powell. Three of the defendant\u2019s five perjury convictions rest on responses he made to Mr. Gorder\u2019s grand jury examination. The remaining two perjury charges and the two false statement counts stem from the events surrounding the defendant\u2019s efforts to obtain Mrs. Powell\u2019s release on bond pending the appeal from her criminal conviction. For purposes of this appeal, however, we need only discuss the evidence presented on one perjury count.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">One of the defendant\u2019s perjury convictions rests on grand jury testimony the defendant gave under questioning by Mr. Gorder regarding a trip to Omaha, Nebraska. In his testimony the defendant stated that he was picked up by a blonde woman at the airport in Omaha, Nebraska and this woman took him to meet the fugitive Mr. Powell. The defendant further testified that he did not know the identity of this woman. At trial the government contended that the defendant committed perjury when he denied knowing the name of the woman at the Omaha airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Under the government\u2019s theory, the defendant falsely denied knowing the identity of this blonde woman in order to protect the woman from the grand jury\u2019s investigation. The government unsuccessfully sought to prove that this blonde woman at the Omaha airport was Malvina Schmidt, the defendant\u2019s sister-in-law. The evidence at trial revealed that although the defendant had been met at a different airport by a blonde woman on a different occasion, no one picked up the defendant at the Omaha airport. The evidence did demonstrate that the defendant eventually met his sister-in-law \u25a0 at a restaurant in the Omaha area. Accordingly, on appeal the government has shifted its perjury allegation by recasting the defendant\u2019s denial of knowledge about the name of the blonde woman who met him at the airport into a denial of \u201cknowing who was with [Mr.] Powell in the Omaha area.\u201d In response, the defendant claims his conviction should be reversed because the identity of the woman whom he incorrectly recalled to have met at the Omaha airport is immaterial to any matters then before the grand jury and thus not perjurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">II. ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">The defendant has raised several challenges to his convictions on appeal. We reach only three of his challenges. The defendant\u2019s first allegation of error involves the refusal of the trial court to grant a pretrial motion to have the prosecutor, Mr. Gorder, recused from the case so that the defendant could call Mr. Gorder as a witness. The defendant also claims that the prosecutor exceeded the bounds of proper argument during closing argument and the defendant was thereby prejudiced. The final contention of error challenges the materiality of the defendant\u2019s allegedly perjurious statements regarding the blonde woman at the Omaha airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">The defendant has also raised a claim of insufficiency of the evidence as to counts seven and eight of the indictment which charged the defendant with viola<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>tions of the false statement statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. In essence, the government presented evidence that the defendant attempted to secure the release of his client Betty Powell through the submission of an appeal bond form that the defendant knew was not authorized by the named bond company. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution we find the evidence presented sufficient to enable a rational trier of fact to find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). Nonetheless, for the reasons discussed in the balance of the opinion, we reverse the defendant\u2019s convictions on these and the other counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">A. <em>The Propriety of a Prosecuting Witness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The prosecutor in this case, Assistant United States Attorney Charles Gorder, was also the prosecutor in the previous trial of Betty Powell. Mr. Gorder not only opposed the defendant in that trial but also conducted the examination of the defendant in both the grand jury and bond proceedings that are the subject of defendant\u2019s perjury convictions in this case. Mr. Gorder was also involved in the discussions with the bond agency as to the adequacy of Mrs. Powell\u2019s bond collateral which gave rise to the defendant\u2019s false statement convictions. Finally, on several occasions Mr. Gorder negotiated directly with the defendant for the surrender of Ronald Powell, the fugitive whom the defendant was accused of harboring and giving aid. Thus, although he never took the stand, Mr. Gorder was a witness to, and indeed a participant in, some aspect of all of the events alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The defendant was charged and convicted of being an accessory after the fact to Mr. Powell\u2019s criminal offenses in that the defendant did \u201creceive, relieve, comfort and assist Ronald Lee Powell in order to hinder and prevent his apprehension, trial and punishment,\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3. During trial the principal defense asserted by the defendant to this count, and the harboring a fugitive charge, revolved around the defendant\u2019s efforts to successfully negotiate Mr. Powell\u2019s surrender with Mr. Gorder. Rather than harboring or assisting Mr. Powell, the defendant contended he was actively conducting the ongoing negotiations for Mr. Powell\u2019s timely surrender through direct communications with both Mr. Gorder and Mr. Powell. Obviously, this defense hinges substantially on the availability of evidence detailing the defendant\u2019s role in these surrender negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">Both before and during the trial defense counsel unsuccessfully moved the court to recuse the prosecutor to enable the defense to call him as a witness. After final argument the defendant moved for a mistrial because the prosecutor\u2019s remarks \u201creaffirm[ed] Mr. Gorder\u2019s role as a witness in the ease without cross-examination, because they appeared to be, in the way that they were framed, assertions of personal knowledge based on his dealings with Mr. Prantil.\u201d At every juncture, the prosecutor refused either to recuse himself or to testify. The trial court declined to disturb the prosecutor\u2019s decision and denied, without comment, all of the defendant\u2019s motions on this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">The prosecutor defended his decision, and the trial court concurred, on the grounds that his testimony was unnecessary and cumulative to the defendant\u2019s case. We recognize that a defendant has an obligation to exhaust other available sources of evidence before a court should sustain a defendant\u2019s efforts to call a participating prosecutor as a witness. <em>United States v. West, </em>680 F.2d 652, 654 (9th Cir. 1982). Nonetheless, the defendant\u2019s obligation to resort to alternative means of adducing factual testimony is not absolute. Both the quality and quantity of the alternate sources of evidence are proper subjects for comparison with that sought directly from the participating prosecutor. For example, in this case the prosecutor contends that his testimony on the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>ant\u2019s efforts to arrange for the surrender of the fugitive Ron Powell was unnecessary and cumulative because the defendant could have presented some testimony on this point through an FBI agent who listened to some, but not all, of the relevant discussions. The prosecutor also avers that the defendant himself was available to testify as to any conversations for which there are no other witnesses besides the defendant and the prosecutor. The true worth of the prosecutor\u2019s generous suggestion that the defendant himself testify in order to \u201cexhaust\u201d all other sources of testimony, however, becomes self-evident when the prosecutor subsequently portrays the defendant\u2019s testimony as self-serving and \u201csleazy\u201d in his summation before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Regardless of the prosecutor\u2019s view of the utility of his own testimony, the district judge is charged with the responsibility of making determinations as to the materiality of witness testimony. In so doing, the court must honor the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights under the confrontation and compulsory process clauses of the Sixth Amendment. The unequivocal admonition of the Supreme Court on this point bears repetition here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-5\">The need to develop all relevant facts in the adversary system is both fundamental and comprehensive. The ends of criminal justice would be defeated if judgments were to be founded on a partial or speculative presentation of the facts. The very integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system depend on full disclosure of all the facts, within the framework of the rules of evidence. To ensure that justice is done, it is imperative to the function of courts that compulsory process be available for the production of evidence needed either by the prosecution or by the defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-6\"><em>United States v. Nixon, </em>418 U.S. 683, 709, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 3108, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">The district court in this case was not faced with a defense request to place the participating prosecutor on the stand for purposes of duplicative impeachment. <em>See United States v. Tamura, </em>694 F.2d 591, 601 (9th Cir.1982). Rather, the defendant sought Mr. Gorder\u2019s testimony as to his knowledge of the facts vital to the defendant\u2019s defense to the charge of being an accessory after the fact. After all, Mr. Gorder was both a witness to and a participant in the factual events at issue. The prosecution has not even suggested that the defendant\u2019s efforts to obtain Mr. Gorder\u2019s testimony were motivated by any improper, unstated, purpose. Similarly, the government has not made any claim that Mr. Gorder\u2019s familiarity with the case was such that substitution of alternate counsel would work a hardship on the government\u2019s case. To the contrary, the defendant\u2019s request for Mr. Gorder\u2019s recusal was made well in advance of trial. Even assuming that the government had alleged hardship stemming from the substitution of alternate government counsel, the defendant\u2019s timely demand diminished, if not eliminated, any consequent inconvenience to the government\u2019s case. Accordingly, we find that the district court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s timely motion for the substitution of the participating prosecutor in order to permit the defense to subpoena the prosecutor as a witness. The defendant had a compelling need to call the participating prosecutor as a material witness. The government articulated no legitimate justification for interfering with the defendant\u2019s assertion of his confrontation rights. Finally, although the government attempts to justify its conduct by invoking the advocate-witness rule, proper analysis reveals that the government has evaded, not enforced, this rule and its aims.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">The advocate-witness rule prohibits an attorney from appearing as both a witness and an advocate in the same litigation. This venerable rule is a necessary corollary to the more fundamental tenet of our adversarial system that juries are to ground their decisions on the facts of a case and not on the integrity or credibility of the advocates. Accordingly, adherence to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>time-honored rule is more than just an ethical obligation of individual counsel; enforcement of the rule is a matter of institutional concern implicating the basic foundations of our system of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Other, more specific, policies are served by the advocate-witness rule in the context of a criminal prosecution. <em>See United States v. Birdman, </em>602 F.2d 547, 553-55 (3d Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 1032, 100 S.Ct. 703, 62 L.Ed.2d 668 (1980). First, barring testimony by the participating prosecutor \u201celiminates the risk that a testifying prosecutor will not be a fully objective witness given his position as an advocate for the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnston, </em>690 F.2d 638, 643 (7th Cir. 1982) (en banc). Second, the rule prevents the prestige and prominence of the prosecutor\u2019s office from being attributed to testimony by a testifying prosecutor. <em>Id. See United States v. Cerone, </em>452 F.2d 274, 288 (7th Cir.1971) (prosecutor not disqualified as a witness under the \u201cawesome office\u201d theory so long as prosecutor does not otherwise participate in trial), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 964, 92 S.Ct. 1168, 31 L.Ed.2d 240 (1972). Third, the rule obviates the possibility of jury confusion from the dual role of the prosecutor wherein the trier-of-fact is asked to segregate the exhortations of the advocate from the testimonial accounts of the witness. <em>United States v. Johnston, </em>690 F.2d at 643. Naturally, the potential for jury confusion is perhaps at its height during final argument when the prosecutor must marshall all the evidence, including his own testimony, cast it in a favorable light, and then urge the jury to accept the government\u2019s claims. Hence there is a very real risk that the jury, faced with the exhortations of a witness, may accord testimonial credit to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the rule expresses an institutional concern, especially pronounced when the government is a litigant, that public confidence in our criminal justice system not be eroded by even the appearance of impropriety. <em>Id. See </em>Model Code of Professional Responsibility EC 5-9, 5-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">The advocate-witness rule generally admits of only one solution to avoid the improprieties inherent in advocate testimony. Attorneys must elect in which capacity they intend to proceed, either as counsel or as a witness, and promptly withdraw from the conflicting role. The limited number of exceptions to this prohibition,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rather than undermining the strength of this hard and fast rule, reflect an understanding of the obvious hardships that rigid adherence necessarily places on litigants for the sake of the overriding benefit of our entire system of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">In operation, the advocate-witness rule contemplates that vigilant counsel for both sides will anticipate, if not prevent, a conflict in their roles during litigation. The rule envisions that as soon as the dilemma is anticipated the attorney will promptly discharge his ethical obligations by electing one of the two mutually exclusive paths that lie before him. The rule does not expressly prohibit an attorney from taking into account the relative strategic advantages of proceeding as a witness as opposed to continuing as an advocate when making his election decision. Placing the decision initially in the hands of the attorney-witness, and thus tacitly allowing such tactical considerations to come into play, can perhaps be justified on the policy ground that the attorney is in the best position to minimize the hardship that such a disruption works on his or her client\u2019s interests. When the proposed testimony is offered in support of the client\u2019s own case<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>in-chief, the rule simply forces the attorney to weigh whether his testimony or his advocacy is more valuable to his client\u2019s interests. When, however, the proposed testimony is germane to his adversary\u2019s case, the balance of hardships is no longer in equilibrium. Instead of merely mitigating the hardship to his client\u2019s cause, the attorney may wish to deprive an adversary of the benefits of his testimony by electing to appear as an advocate and not as a witness. Under the veil of \u201cethics,\u201d opposing counsel is deprived of a material witness while the witness, although unsworn, is permitted to be an advocate. This cannot be. The advocate-witness rule is aimed at protecting the integrity of the fact-finding process, not at distorting the process itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">To be sure, courts have generally disfavored allowing a participating prosecutor to testify, at a criminal trial. <em>United States v. West, </em>680 F.2d 652, 654 (9th Cir. 1982). This reluctance is understandable particularly when the defendant seeks to call the prosecutor as a witness. Regardless of who calls the participating prosecutor, there is no absolute bar to calling him as a witness. <em>Id. </em>Recognizing the possibility for abuse, however, this Circuit has required that a defendant demonstrate a \u201ccompelling need\u201d before a participating prosecutor will be permitted to testify. <em>United States v. Tamura, </em>694 F.2d 591, 601 (9th Cir.1982). The \u201ccompelling need\u201d standard is a reiteration of the judicial antipathy toward any deviation from the advocate-witness rule. In the present case, the defendant did not ask the trial court to bend the advocate-witness rule. Instead, the defendant sought the court\u2019s assistance in preserving the distinctions the rule was intended to uphold while affording the defendant access to perhaps the most important witness to the accessory charges, a participant in the transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-14\">Surely the reasoning behind the advocate-witness rule does not contemplate that a material witness will be able to exempt himself from the rigours of the fact-finding process by electing to proceed as an advocate. The irony to which the rule was subjected should have been apparent from the very nature of the prosecutor\u2019s posture before the court. Invoking the \u201ccompelling need\u201d standard, the witness, as an adversary, dutifully informed the court that in his opinion his testimony was of no value to his opponent\u2019s case. Despite defense counsel\u2019s objections to the contrary, the trial court, without comment, ratified the prosecutor\u2019s perspective on the exculpatory value, not the admissibility, of his own testimony. Questions on the materiality of the evidence are exclusively the province of judges, not litigants. As the prosecutor was a material witness and participant, it was the jury\u2019s responsibility, not that of the judge or prosecutor, to evaluate the import of the prosecutor\u2019s proposed testimony on the accessory charges. Permitting the prosecutor to continue in the capacity of an advocate only served to blur the fundamental distinctions that the advocate-witness rule was created to preserve.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>B. <em>The Government\u2019s Summation</em></p>\n<p id=\"A2c\">The defendant challenges his convictions not only on the basis that he was deprived of the prosecutor's testimony regarding matters in which Mr. Gorder participated but also on the ground that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct during his presentation of the government\u2019s summation to the jury. Admittedly, \u201ccounsel are necessarily permitted a degree of latitude in the presentation of their closing summations.\u201d <em>United States v. Potter, </em>616 F.2d 384, 392 (9th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 832, 101 S.Ct. 101, 66 L.Ed.2d 37 (1980) (quoting <em>United States v. Rich, </em>580 F.2d 929, 936 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 935, 99 S.Ct. 330, 58 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978)). Courts must allow the prosecution the freedom to strike \u201chard blows\u201d based on the evidence and all fair inferences therefrom, but courts may not permit \u201cfoul\u201d blows. <em>United States v. Birges, </em>723 F.2d 666 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1926, 80 L.Ed.2d 472 (1984). Given the necessarily wide latitude accorded the government in making its final argument, distinguishing hard blows from foul ones will invariably be a question of degree, and therefore not an easy task for precise measurement. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has admonished that \u201cimproper suggestions, insinuations, and, especially, assertions of personal knowledge are apt to carry much weight against the accused when they should properly carry none.\u201d <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935). Consequently, we review the remarks of the prosecutor in. this case to determine whether he exceeded the bounds of proper argument.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-25\">A review of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks during the closing argument reveals that his statements, although derogatory and gratuitous by themselves, served to compound the prejudice to the defendant that flowed from Mr. Gorder\u2019s ambiguous role as both prosecutor and participant witness. The prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments illustrate the degree of actual prejudice that results when an advocate, through his direct participation in the events under litigation, can argue to the jury based on actual or perceived personal knowledge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>The prosecutor launched a personalized attack on the defendant\u2019s motives. A recurrent theme of the prosecutor\u2019s summation was to portray the defendant as \u201cgreedy,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201ccorrupt,\u201d \u201cdishonest,\u201d and \u201csleazy.\u201d The prosecutor cautioned the jury that the defendant did not meet the minimum standards of attorney behavior demanded by the \u201cadvocacy system of justice.\u201d As such, the prosecutor explained to the jury that \u201cMr. Prantil is the kind of person who gives lawyers a bad name to the general public and it\u2019s your duty as jurors to call him to account.\u201d The prosecutor charged the jury with the responsibility of ridding the ranks of the criminal defense bar of such a \u201ccrook\u201d even though \u201cit\u2019s true, thank God it\u2019s true, that criminal defense attorneys are not crooks as a general rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">These comments came from an individual who was not only an experienced prosecutor but also, as the jury could not fail to appreciate, both a participant in many of the underlying events and Mr. Prantil\u2019s adversary throughout. As previously mentioned, Mr. Gorder had conducted the grand jury examination of the defendant that resulted in three of the defendant's perjury convictions. In his summation of the evidence on these counts, the prosecutor drew the jury\u2019s attention to the complete grand jury transcripts. Mr. Gorder informed the jury that these transcripts demonstrated that the defendant committed perjury \u201cnot just in the specific counts he\u2019s charged with, but in a number of other areas also.\u201d Once again, this is an assertion of personal knowledge of a testimonial rather than an argumentative character.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">We review the entirety of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks under the harmless error rule, Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a), to determine whether it is more probable than not that the improper remarks materially affected the verdict. <em>United States v. Lyman, </em>592 F.2d 496, 499 (9th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 931, 99 S.Ct. 2864, 61 L.Ed.2d 300 (1979); <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>562 F.2d 1138, 1143 (9th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 927, 98 S.Ct. 1494, 55 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978). We can appreciate the delicate position that the prosecutor faced by virtue of his intimate knowledge of the facts in this case. Nonetheless, the prosecutor elected to assume this task, and, taking his comments as a whole, we find that they prejudiced the defendant. In conclusion, we find that the prosecutor exceeded the bounds of proper argument in his summation and it is more probable than not that his improper remarks materially affected the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">C. <em>The Perjury Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623, a false statement before a grand jury does not constitute perjury unless it is material. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623(a), (c)(1). <em>See United States v.

The defendant has questioned the materiality of a certain statement he made before the grand jury which constitutes the predicate for one of his perjury convictions. As previously mentioned, the defendant testified before the grand jury that a blonde woman picked him up at the Omaha, Nebraska airport, drove him to meet Ronald Powell, and transported him back to the airport. The evidence adduced at trial disclosed that no one performed this service for the defendant, but that the defendant did meet his sister-in-law at a restaurant during his trip to Omaha.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>For purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623, false statements to a grand jury are material if they are relevant to any matter before the grand jury and their falsity \u201c \u2018would have the natural tendency to influence the grand jury\u2019s investigations.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Ponticelli, </em>622 F.2d at 989 (quoting <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>540 F.2d 990, 993 (9th Cir.1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1040, 97 S.Ct. 738, 50 L.Ed.2d 751 (1977)). Questions of materiality in a perjury case are legal questions to be determined by courts and not juries. <em>Sinclair v. United States, </em>279 U.S. 263, 298, 49 S.Ct. 268, 273, 73 L.Ed. 692 (1929); <em>United States v. Bridges, </em>717 F.2d 1444, 1448 &amp; n. 18 (D.C.Cir.1983) (collecting eases), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 1310, 79 L.Ed.2d 708 (1984). Hence, we must decide whether the defendant\u2019s testimony was material.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Initially, we decline to accept the government\u2019s contention, raised for the first time on appeal, that the defendant committed perjury by denying knowing who was with Powell in the Omaha area. No question concerning the identity of the person with Mr. Powell in the Omaha area was asked or answered in the grand jury proceedings. Further, the prosecutor\u2019s depiction of Mr. Prantil\u2019s actual remarks as an attempt to conceal the activities of his sister-in-law from the grand jury is somewhat puzzling in light of the fact that Mr. Gorder had, pursuant to Ms. Schmidt\u2019s pri- or agreement to cooperate with the government, full knowledge of her activities in and around the Omaha area. The only grand jury testimony elicited from the defendant focused on who picked up the defendant at the airport and who drove him back. The defendant said that a woman,whose name he couldn\u2019t recall, did so. In our view, this assertion could not have influenced the grand jury\u2019s investigation. The defendant\u2019s inaccurate testimony about a nonexistent woman at the airport could not have launched any further successful grand jury investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">The government\u2019s entire perjury theory on this count of the indictment depends in equal measure on the false premise that there was a woman at the airport and that this woman was the defendant\u2019s sister-in-law, whose identity the defendant wishes to conceal. The defendant, however, could not possibly be testifying falsely so as to shield a nonexistent woman. Similarly, the defendant\u2019s inability to recall the name of this nonexistent woman, a testimonial assertion that is hard to peg as a literal falsehood, could not have influenced the grand jury\u2019s deliberations. Simply put, if there was no blonde woman at the Omaha airport, the defendant\u2019s inability to recall her name is immaterial. Accordingly, because the defendant\u2019s testimony was not material, we hold that the defendant\u2019s conviction on Count Six is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"AYX\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">To conclude, we reverse defendant\u2019s perjury conviction on Count Six of the indictment because the allegedly perjurious statements lack materiality. We reverse and remand the defendant\u2019s remaining convictions on the ground that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to recuse the participating prosecutor as a material witness and on the ground of pros-ecutorial misconduct in the government\u2019s closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-13\">. <em>See United States v, Powell, </em>708 F.2d 455 (9th Cir.1983), <em>rev'd in part, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 105 S.Ct. 471, 83 L.Ed.2d 461 (1984).

For example, during the presentation of the government's case-in-chief as it related to the \u00a7 1001 counts, the prosecutor engaged in the following dialogue with the agent from the bonding company:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-6\">By Mr. Gorder:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-7\">Q.

The government contends that this issue was not adequately preserved for purposes of appeal and therefore can be reviewed only for plain error. We disagree. Defense counsel entered his objections to the language and tenor of the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks by way of a mistrial motion after the government finished its summation. This circuit has recognized this as an acceptable mechanism by which to preserve challenges to prosecutorial conduct in a closing argument in lieu of repeated interruptions to the closing arguments. <em>United States v.
