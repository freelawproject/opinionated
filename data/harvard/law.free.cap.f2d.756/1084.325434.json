We did not intend to so hold. In the context of ruling on the propriety of summary judgment, our intent was to state only that, <em>for purposes of a motion for summary judgment, </em>disputed material issues of material fact (most favorably construed, as required, in favor of the motion\u2019s opponent) without substantial dispute permitted the inference of such illegality. The original panel opinion, 753 F.2d 457, is clarified to this extent. The panel does not find merit in the other contentions advanced in the suggestions for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-5\">Treating the suggestion for rehearing en banc as a petition for panel rehearing, it is ordered that the petition for panel rehearing is DENIED. No member of the panel nor Judge in regular active service of this Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc (Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and Local Rule 35), the suggestion for Rehearing En Banc is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
