WINTER, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1094-23\">The district court denied attorney\u2019s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act to Una Mae Hicks, a claimant who, in the district court, successfully set aside the Secretary\u2019s contrary determination of her eligibility and obtained an award of social security disability benefits. 586 F.Supp. 853. The court denied her claim for attorney\u2019s fees on the ground that the Secretary was substantially justified in arguing that claimant had not proved her inability to engage in her former occupation. Alternatively, the district court ruled that because her attorney was the Client Centered Legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>Services of Southwest Virginia, Inc., a professional corporation funded by the United States through the Legal Services Corporation, an award to it would violate the legislative intent of the Legal Services Corporation Act Amendments of 1977, Pub.L. 95-222, and therefore there existed special circumstances rendering an award of counsel fees to it unjust. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">We conclude that the position of the Secretary in the district court was not substantially justified. We therefore reverse and remand the case so that a proper award may be made. We direct that the award to be made not include fees for legal services in litigating the issue abandoned on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">Claimant, a 54-year-old woman with a fifth grade education, who had been employed for over fifteen years as a maid and sitter, primarily for elderly persons, sought disability benefits as a result of a back injury from a fall on February 25, 1980. An administrative law judge, whose decision was adopted by the Secretary, denied her claim, ruling that she had \u201cthe residual functional capacity to perform light work,\u201d that her former jobs as housekeeper and companion for elderly individuals \u201crequired light physical exertion,\u201d and that as a consequence she was not disabled. From a reading of his opinion, the exact ground on which the AU bottomed these conclusions is difficult to fathom. He apparently relied on his characterization of claimant\u2019s testimony and his own observations during the hearing \u2014 the latter, the now discredited \u201csit and squirm\u201d brand of jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-8\">The district court in reversing the Secretary and awarding benefits correctly analyzed the record made before the AU. It concluded that claimant\u2019s stated inability to perform her previous employment was supported by <em>all </em>of the medical evidence in the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-9\">In this case, all of plaintiff\u2019s treating physicians have agreed that Mrs. Hicks suffers from a severe and painful back problem. The reports of Drs. Henderson and Gage include notations of specific objective manifestations which are consistent with a finding of total disability. The observations of the physicians were also consistent with plaintiff\u2019s testimonial allegations of severe pain and subjective limitations. It is well established that subjective complaints such as pain and physical discomfort can give rise to a finding of total disability, even when those symptoms are not fully supported by objective observable signs. <em>Thorne v. Weinberger, </em>530 F.2d 580 (4th Cir.1976); <em>Brandon v. Gardner, </em>377 F.2d 488 (4th Cir.1967); <em>Higginbotham v. Califano, </em>617 F.2d 1058 (4th Cir.1980). In the instant case, plaintiff\u2019s subjective complaints are consistent with definite medical observations. Plaintiff\u2019s treating physicians have uniformly determined that she suffers from a severe and disabling impediment. Opinions from treating physicians must be accorded great weight, especially when those opinions are buttressed by specific objective findings. <em>Martin v. Secretary, </em>492 F.2d 905 (4th Cir.1974). In light of this combination of circumstances, the court can only conclude that Mrs. Hicks has met her burden of establishing total disability for all forms of substantial gainful employment, as of February of 1980.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1095-10\">In a charitable effort to provide some rationale for the AU\u2019s decision, the district court made these further comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1095-11\">In passing, the court notes that while the Law Judge\u2019s opinion does not so state, the Law Judge must have adopted the findings of Dr. Knickerbocker since that doctor\u2019s report is the only medical analysis which is not clearly consistent with plaintiff\u2019s allegation of total disabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>ty. Dr. Knickerbocker did not list any opinion as to plaintiffs disability one way or the other. Nevertheless, Dr. Knickerbocker\u2019s physical findings do not support the Law Judge\u2019s conclusion that Mrs. Hicks may return to her previous work as a maid and companion to elderly persons. Such work involved bathing, dressing, and feeding disabled persons. (TR 144). Mrs. Hicks\u2019 work involved almost constant walking and standing, and frequent bending and lifting. (TR 144). Plaintiff also performed such routine household duties as vacuuming, laundering, and cleaning. Dr. Knickerbocker observed that Mrs. Hicks could no longer be expected to stand more than three hours in an eight-hour day or to walk more than two hours. It is undisputed that in her prior work, Mrs. Hicks sometimes had to lift an elderly or handicapped person out of a car or out of a bathtub. (TR 32). However, Dr. Knickerbocker opined that plaintiff could no longer lift more than twenty-five pounds. Dr. Knickerbocker related that plaintiff could no longer bend, a function which is clearly necessary for most household work. In short, Dr. Knickerbocker\u2019s report establishes that Mrs. Hicks is disabled for her past relevant work. Furthermore, since Dr. Knickerbocker\u2019s report also indicates that Mrs. Hicks is incapable of standing and walking on a sustained basis, it would seem that even under Dr. Knickerbocker\u2019s report, plaintiff is capable of no more than sedentary exertion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">That evidence and particularly the report of Dr. Knickerbocker demonstrated that claimant could not perform \u201clight work\u201d as defined in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At most, she could perform \u201csedentary work\u201d, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and under the grids a claimant of her age and education with a work history of only unskilled work, is considered to be disabled. <em>See </em>Rule 201.-01 of Appendix 2 to Subpart P following 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1598.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-9\">Before turning to the merits of the appeal, we take notice first of the Secretary\u2019s argument about the scope and standard of review. As we pointed out in <em>Smith v. Heckler, </em>739 F.2d 144, 146 (4 Cir.1984), when the issue is whether the position of the government in litigation was \u201csubstantially justified\u201d so as to insulate the government from an award of fees against it, there are usually both legal and factual components. When the component of the Secretary\u2019s legal position is assayed on appeal, the scope and standard of review are a de novo determination. <em>See, e.g., Boudin v. Thomas, </em>732 F.3d 1107, 1117 (2 Cir.1984); <em>Spencer v. NLRB, </em>712 F.2d 539, 563 (D.C.Cir.1983). <em>Contra Ramos v. Haig, </em>716 F.2d 471, 474 (7 Cir.1983); However, when the reasonableness of the Secretary\u2019s factual position is at issue, the authorities are in disarray. <em>See, e.g., United States v. First National Bank of Circle, </em>732 F.2d 1444 (9 Cir.1984); <em>Spencer, </em>712 F.2d at 561-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-10\">In this case, we do not find it necessary to decide the issue of the scope and standard of review of the Secretary\u2019s factual position because the only issue before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>district court was a legal issue \u2014 was there substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s determination. We therefore review this issue de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-8\">We think that the Secretary\u2019s position was not reasonable. As we view the record, we perceive literally no evidence to support her position. The AU seems to have decided the case on the basis of claimant\u2019s purported testimony, but his summary of the testimony is not an accurate description of what claimant said. The district court wisely ignored this basis of the AU\u2019s decision and assessed the medical report of Dr. Knickerbocker on the assumption that the AU must have relied on it. But as the district court so ably demonstrated, that report established that claimant could not perform \u201clight work\u201d as found by the AU. Since we find no evidence even arguably to support the Secretary\u2019s legal position, we conclude that the district court\u2019s conclusion that her position in the litigation was substantially justified was erroneous and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-9\">We return the case to the district court to make a proper award of attorney\u2019s fees. In making the award, however, we think that the district court may make no allowance for services provided in litigating the issue of whether the Legal Services Corporation Act Amendments of 1977 rendered claimant\u2019s attorneys ineligible for a fee award. That issue was not raised by the Secretary and is not chargeable to her. Conversely, however, the district court should make an allowance for the services of claimant\u2019s counsel before us and in further proceedings before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-10\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1095-12\">. On appeal the Secretary does not attempt to defend this ground of decision. It was a defense raised by the district court, which requested the parties to brief it, and not by the Secretary. Since it has been abandoned, we do not decide it, although Hicks makes a persuasive argument that the district court misconstrued the legislative history of the 1977 Act and failed to give proper consideration to the legislative history of the Equal Access to Justice Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">. (b) Light work. Light work involves lifting no more than 20 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 10 pounds. Even though the weight lifted may be very little, a job is in this category when it requires a good deal of walking or standing, or when it involves sitting most of the time with some pushing and pulling of arm or leg controls. To be considered capable of performing a full or wide range of light work, you must have the ability to do substantially all of these activities. If someone can do light work, we determine that he or she can also do sedentary work, unless there are additional limiting factors such as loss of fine dexterity or inability to sit for long periods of time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1096-12\">. (a) Sedentary work. Sedentary work involves lifting no more than 10 pounds at a time and occasionally lifting or carrying articles like docket files, ledgers, and small tools. Although a sedentary job is defined as one which involves sitting, a certain amount of walking and standing is often necessary in carrying out job duties. Jobs are sedentary if walking and standing are required occasionally and other sedentary criteria are met.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
