WINTER, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1098-12\">Plaintiff Virginia Agricultural Growers Association (VAGA) is an association representing southern Virginia tobacco growers. VAGA seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against the Department of Labor (DOL) and the Virginia Employment Commission (VEC). VAGA claims that DOL\u2019s \u201c50% rule\u201d governing the hiring of seasonal foreign workers is an arbitrary and capricious regulation issued without legal authority. The rule requires employers petitioning the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) for seasonal foreign labor to give a written assurance that they will hire available domestic workers for the same jobs until 50% of the foreign workers\u2019 contract has elapsed. The district court upheld the challenged regulation. <em>Virginia Agricultural Growers Association v. Donovan, </em>579 F.Supp. 768 (W.D.Va.1984). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-13\">I. Statutory and Regulatory Framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-14\">The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 <em>et seq., </em>is the statute governing the admission of seasonal foreign workers into the United States. Section 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii) defines this class of nonimmigrants as workers \u201ccoming temporarily to the United States to perform temporary services or labor, if unemployed persons capable of performing such service or labor cannot be found in this country____\u201d Admission of these \u2018H-2 program\u2019 foreign workers \u201cshall be for such time and under such conditions as the Attorney General may by regulation prescribe____\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1184(a). The question whether to import such labor in any specific case \u201cshall be determined by the Attorney General, after consultation with appropriate agencies of the Government, upon petition of the importing employer.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1184(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-19\">Pursuant to this statutory authority, INS, the Attorney General\u2019s agent for this program, has issued regulations on how employers must petition for seasonal labor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>Employers seeking foreign seasonal laborers must first obtain from DOL either a certification \u201cstating that qualified persons in the United States are not available and that the employment of the [foreign workers] will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed, or a notice that such a certification cannot be made____\u201d If the employer cannot get a certification from DOL then it can present to INS \u201ccountervailing evidence that qualified persons in the United States are not available and that the employment policies of [DOL] have been observed.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.2(h)(3)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-6\">Pursuant to this delegated INS authority, DOL has issued regulations on the issuance of H-2 program certifications. To get DOL certification, employers must make numerous assurances about the employment involved. One is an assurance to \u201cprovide employment to any qualified U.S. worker who applies to the employer until fifty percent of the period of the work contract, under which the foreign worker who is in the job was hired, has elapsed.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 655.203(e). DOL\u2019s only means of enforcing such regulations is the provision that an employer failing to live up to the terms of a certification may not be \u201celigible to apply for a temporary labor certification in the coming year.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 655.210(a). \u201cNo other penalty shall be imposed by the employment service\u201d under DOL regulations on such an employer. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 655.210(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">II. Factual Background.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">The district court opinion sets out the relevant facts, which we summarize. VAGA obtained DOL certifications to support its INS petition for the admission of about 600 H-2 workers. The workers were needed to work during the tobacco harvest starting July 5, 1983, since not enough domestic workers were available. In obtaining these certifications, VAGA agreed to abide by DOL employment policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-11\">After VAGA had contracted for the H-2 labor, VEC asked VAGA to interview and hire about fifty-five U.S. workers under the 50% rule. VAGA announced it would not comply with the 50% rule, and filed this suit. DOL responded by notifying VAGA it would be ineligible for a labor certification the following year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-12\">VAGA offered testimony showing that its member farmers had no open jobs when told to interview and hire the fifty-five U.S. workers. Hiring these workers would as a practical matter have required laying off some H-2 workers. Second, VAGA complained that DOL regulations required its members to pay the laid-off H-2 workers for three-quarters of the contract period anyway.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finally, VAGA introduced evidence to show that the domestic workers hired often did not remain on the job. Hence if VAGA farmers fired H-2 workers to hire domestic workers who then quit, they would face the harvest short-handed and might lose part of their crop.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-13\">III. DOL\u2019s Authority to Issue the 50% Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-14\">The 50% rule, to be valid, must be consistent with the statute under which it is promulgated. <em>Cf. United States v. Lario-noff, </em>431 U.S. 864, 873, 97 S.Ct. 2150, 2156, 53 L.Ed.2d 48 (1977). The grant of authority relied on in issuing the rule, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>need not be specific; it is only necessary \u201cthat the reviewing court reasonably be able to conclude that the grant of authority contemplates the regulations issued.\u201d <em>Humana of Virginia v. Blue Cross of Virginia, </em>622 F.2d 76, 78 (4 Cir.1980) (quoting <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, </em>441 U.S. 281, 308, 99 S.Ct. 1705, 1720, 60 L.Ed.2d 208 (1979)). We conclude that the statutory and INS grant of authority to DOL contemplated the 50% rule issued here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">VAGA argues that the 50% rule is inconsistent with statutory and INS authority in two fundamental respects. First, VAGA claims that the 50% rule contradicts the INA\u2019s basic policy of providing a viable means to obtain supplementary labor. Second, VAGA claims that DOL goes beyond its authorized <em>consultative </em>role by imposing the 50% rule as a condition of obtaining the labor certification employers use to petition the INS for admission of foreign seasonal labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">A. Consistency with INA Immigration Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">\u25a0 VAGA\u2019s argument that the 50% rule contradicts the INA\u2019s underlying policy is grounded on the statute\u2019s goal of admitting needed seasonal foreign labor. VAGA downplays, however, the statute\u2019s concurrent purpose of protecting American labor. Considering the 50% rule in light of both these objectives, we find it consistent with the INA\u2019s basic statutory intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-7\">The INA itself provides that the Attorney General will decide questions of importing H-2 foreign seasonal workers, after consultation with appropriate agencies, on petition of employers. The House Judiciary Committee report explained that the purpose of this provision, \u00a7 101(a)(15)(H) of the Act, was to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-8\">grant the Attorney General sufficient authority to admit temporarily certain alien workers, industrial, agricultural, or otherwise, for the purpose of alleviating labor shortages as they exist or may develop in certain areas or certain branches of American productive enterprises, particu-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ank-dedup-0\">larly in periods of intensified production.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The provision thus delegates to the Attorney General the authority to decide when nonimmigrant workers need to be admitted to alleviate labor shortages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-11\">Congress granted the authority to admit H-2 foreign seasonal workers in the context of an Act that \u201cprovides strong safeguards for American labor.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A safeguard noted in the House Report is \u00a7 212(a)(14), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(14). This provision excludes immigrant labor (as distinguished from temporary nonimmigrant labor) unless DOL certifies that there are not sufficient domestic workers, and that the employment of such immigrants would not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-12\">Another safeguard is the qualification of the Attorney General\u2019s authority to admit temporary foreign workers at issue in this case. The proposed Act originally provided simply that the question of importing H-2 workers \u201cshall be determined by the Attorney General upon petition of the importing employer.\u201d S.716, 82d Cong., 1st Sess. \u00a7 215(c) (1951). Domestic labor representatives, however, objected to this provision, arguing that only the Secretary of Labor had the expertise to determine the need for foreign workers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-13\">[The proposed provision gives] the Attorney General complete discretion to allow aliens to enter this country without any limitation on time or number to do work in the country if there were not available unemployed persons in this country to fill the jobs____ [It is] undesirable to give such authority to a person not thoroughly acquainted with the labor needs of the economy____ In order to protect domestic labor from competition of nonresident aliens, the law should provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>that the Secretary of Labor should be required to make a thorough survey of the labor market, certify the need for the importation of foreign labor, and establish regulations governing the importation and use of such labor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"apx-dedup-1\">Congress then changed the H-2 provisions to require that the Attorney General decide H-2 petitions only \u201cafter consultation with appropriate agencies of the Government.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1184(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-4\">The Attorney General\u2019s agent, INS, has exercised its delegated authority to decide H-2 employer petitions after consultation with appropriate agencies by looking to DOL for advice. Petitioning employers must provide INS with DOL certification (1) that \u201cqualified persons in the United States are not available\u201d and (2) that \u201cthe employment of the beneficiary will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed____\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.-2(h)(3)(i). This regulatory standard for advising on the admission of temporary non-immigrants in essence parallels the statutory standard that DOL uses for considering the admission of immigrants. In this way both the statute and INS regulations provide similar safeguards for American workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-7\">VAGA concedes that the INA provides for some protection of domestic workers, but complains that the INS asks DOL about the availability of domestic workers <em>only at the time of certification. </em>This is incorrect. The INS regulation also asks DOL to certify that the H-2 workers employed <em>\u201cwill not\u201d </em>adversely affect the wages and working conditions of domestic workers. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.2(h)(3)(i) (emphasis added). Thus the INS certification regulation contemplates that DOL will obtain employers\u2019 assurances regarding future employment of domestic workers. Indeed, without employers\u2019 assurances regarding their future conduct, it would be impossible for DOL to predict for INS a given petition\u2019s future effect on domestic employment. DOL regulations require several such assurances, such as complying with applicable laws, cooperating in the active recruitment of domestic workers until the H-2 workers depart for the employer\u2019s place of employment, and guaranteeing workers certain wages and terms of employment. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 655.202, 655.-203. DOL can properly ask for assurances that employers will hire domestic workers at least during part of the contract period, since any domestic unemployment resulting from the use of H-2 workers could reasonably be predicted to have an adverse effect on wages and conditions for domestic workers generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-10\">VAGA also complains that the 50% rule entirely undermines the statutory policy of providing adequate labor. The effect of the rule, VAGA argues, is that producers would have to fire H-2 workers to hire any available domestic replacements. Domestic workers, they argue, are \u201crealistically\u201d an unreliable source of labor because they often quit, and the employer is then left without an adequate labor supply, contrary to statutory intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-11\">We reject this argument. First, the 50% rule requires only that employers accept <em>qualified </em>U.S. workers who apply for jobs during the first half of the H-2 contract period. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 655.203(e). Second, the INS regulations require employers to interview and hire qualified U.S. workers before they petition for the admission of foreign workers, even if there is a business justification for preferring the foreign workers as a class. As the First Circuit has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-12\">We recognize that appellee\u2019s business depends on the proper harvesting of its crop during the brief span of weeks when the apples are ready, and that there may be good reason for appellee\u2019s wish to be able to rely on the experienced crews of British West Indians who have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>performed well in the past, but here that preference collides with the mandate of a Congressional policy. To recognize a legal right to use alien workers- upon a showing of business justification would be to negate the policy which permeates the immigration statutes, that domestic workers rather than aliens be employed wherever possible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\"><em>Elton Orchards v. Brennan, </em>508 F.2d 493, 500 (1 Cir.1974). Since employers must hire qualified domestic workers at the beginning of the harvest despite any preference for foreign labor, we cannot say it is inconsistent to require the same preferment for American workers once the harvest has begun.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">B. Whether DOL Exceeds Its Consultative Role.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">The INA provides for consultation with appropriate agencies before the granting of H-2 petitions. INS has by regulation provided for consultation with DOL to determine whether labor market shortages justify importing seasonal workers. VAGA claims that DOL goes beyond this delegation to usurp INS\u2019s power in mandating a continuing preference for domestic workers. Even if the 50% rule is consistent with the INA, in other words, VAGA argues that it is for INS and not DOL to enact such a provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-7\">We find no merit in this argument. Proof that DOL remains within its consultative role is the simple fact that both INS and DOL regulations reserve for INS the ultimate decision on any petition to admit H-2 foreign seasonal workers. INS regulations provide that, on DOL notice that a certification cannot be made, the employer may present INS with \u201ccountervailing evidence that qualified persons in the United States are not available and that the employment policies of the Department of Labor have been observed.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.-2(h)(3)\u00ae. DOL regulations provide that \u201cthe employer has a right to contest any denial\u201d of a certification \u201cbefore the INS pursuant to 8 C.F.R. 214.2(h)(3)\u00ae.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 655.201(c). Further, the possible denial of such a commendation to INS is DOL\u2019s only means of inducing petitioning employers to abide by their certification assurances. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 655.210(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-10\">INS has countenanced the present 50% rule or a similar one since 1964. Indeed, \u00a7 602.10(i)(3)(iv) of DOL\u2019s 1964 H-2 regulations imposed an even more extensive obligation on employers, requiring an assurance that whenever \u201cdomestic workers become available for jobs in which foreign workers are employed, the domestic workers must be given preference.\u201d 29 Fed. Reg. 19,101 (1964). INS has for over twenty years made no effort to have DOL change its H-2 regulations, but has relied instead on DOL\u2019s labor market expertise and advice. These observations confirm our conclusion that DOL has not usurped any INS authority, but has performed the consultative role that the statute intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-11\">IV. DOL Compliance with APA Procedural Requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-12\">VAGA argues that issuance of the 50% rule was arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with law because of DOL\u2019s failure to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act. VAGA recognizes the challenged rulemaking as informal notice-and-comment rulemaking governed by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553. It nevertheless insists that DOL fails to meet even the relatively limited requirements for such rulemaking. We are not persuaded by this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-13\">Section 553(c) requires (1) that the agency give notice of the proposed rules and consider \u201cthe relevant matter presented,\u201d and (2) that it \u201cincorporate in the rules adopted a concise general statement of their basis and purpose.\u201d Here the agency considered the relevant matter presented by about 170 organizations and individuals during hearings held in six different locations. It also considered about 250 letters received before the hearings. Further, as the district court notes, the agency heard testimony on \u201cthe precise problems VAGA complains of in this lawsuit \u2014 having to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>the H-2 workers % of the work contract whether or not they were needed and terminating them because of the need to hire the domestic crew____\u201d 579 F.Supp. at 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">Second, DOL has set forth a general statement of the basis and purpose for the rules governing employer certification. DOL states that the regulations \u201cshall be construed to effectuate the purpose of the INA that U.S. workers rather than aliens be employed wherever possible____ Where temporary alien workers are admitted, the terms and conditions of their employment must not result in a lowering of the terms and conditions of domestic workers similarly employed.\u201d 43 Fed.Reg. 10,312 (1978), 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 655.0(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-9\">DOL has also specifically discussed its basis for the challenged regulation. \u201cEmployers urged,\u201d DOL noted in issuing the 50% rule, \u201cthat their responsibility in this regard should end at the time of certification.\u201d Worker representatives, on the other hand, \u201curged that the responsibility should continue until the end of the harvest,\u201d as the earlier regulation had provided. DOL stated that it chose the 50% rule as a \u201creasonable middle course\u201d between these competing interests. 43 Fed.Reg. 10,308 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-10\">V. DOL\u2019s Rational Basis for Enacting the 50% Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-11\">VAGA argues that the 50% rule lacks a rational basis and is therefore arbitrary and capricious. In reviewing this challenge to the rule, we may not substitute our judgment for the agency\u2019s. We are limited to determining whether \u201cthere has been a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, 823, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). The 50% rule survives this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-12\">VAGA claims that the 50% rule is arbitrary and capricious because its application threatens an established industry. The trial evidence, it claims, established \u201cbeyond question\u201d that employer compliance with the rule \u201ccould be destructive of tobacco farming in southside Virginia.\u201d VAGA argues that a rule threatening such economic carnage is arbitrary and capricious, citing <em>H &amp; H Tire Co. v. United States Department of Transportation, </em>471 F.2d 350 (7 Cir.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-14\">The district court, however, found only that the rule \u201cmight very well cause a hardship to [VAGA's] members.\u201d 579 F.Supp. at 776. The fact that a regulation may cause economic hardship does not make such a regulation unreasonable. <em>H &amp; H Tire </em>at 354. Further, DOL has applied the 50% rule or its predecessor to agricultural producers for decades. This is not a case where a new regulation not yet in effect threatens to bankrupt an industry, as in <em>H &amp; H Tire, </em>but a rul\u00e9 that agricultural businesses have coped with over the past twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-15\">VAGA also claims generally that DOL has failed to demonstrate a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made in issuing the 50% rule. We disagree. The rule rationally balances the need for an adequate seasonal labor force with the goal of protecting the wages and conditions of domestic workers similarly employed. Given the need to draw some line between competing policies, some \u201creasonable middle course,\u201d we cannot conclude that the DOL\u2019s 50% rule was a clear error of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1099-9\">. The district court and the parties below assumed that the three-quarters guarantee applied to foreign as well as U.S. workers. At oral argument before this court, DOL for the first time raised the issue of whether the three-quarters guarantee applies only to domestic workers. The three-quarters guarantee is contained in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 655.202(b)(6)(i) and 655.203(d)(2)(i). DOL argues that \u00a7 655.202(b)(6)(i) only prescribes the terms of a job offer for U.S. workers and \u00a7 655.203(d)(2)(i) only prescribes the form of newspaper advertisement for the recruitment of U.S. workers. A literal reading of the two sections supports the argument, but VAGA in a postargument brief has tendered evidence of a contrary administrative interpretation applied to a Maine employer of alien loggers and shovel-loader operators. We do not decide the proper interpretation of the regulations. Rather, we assume without deciding that the three-quarters guarantee applies to both foreign and U.S. workers, since resolution of this issue does not alter our ultimate disposition of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1100-9\">.
