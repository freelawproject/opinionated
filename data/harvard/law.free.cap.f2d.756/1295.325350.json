Raymond Burke\u2019s petition was denied by Judge Plunkett in the Northern District of Illinois; David Olbrot\u2019s petition was granted by Judge Baker in the Central District of Illinois. Because both petitioners challenge the same prosecutorial closing argument as so prejudicial as to have denied them their constitutional right to a fair trial, we consolidate the cases here and issue one opinion in which we find that the prosecutor made constitutionally impermissible indirect references in his closing argument to the defendants\u2019 failure to testify. Judge Baker\u2019s order that a new trial for Olbrot take place within 120 days of the mandate reaching his court is affirmed. On remand Judge Plunkett should issue the writ ordering the release of defendant Burke unless he is tried within the 120-day time limit of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-15\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-16\">A. The Incident</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-17\">On October 30, 1976, two masked men attempted an armed robbery at Musket &amp; Henricksen Drug Store in Skokie, Illinois. The pharmacist on duty from midnight until 8 a.m. at the drug store was an off-duty Chicago Police Officer, Edward Thun. Thun was an investigator assigned to the Area 6 Robbery Division of the Chicago Police Department who worked part time at the drug store. At 2 a.m. an acquaintance of Thun\u2019s, Floyd Hannum, an investigator for the Secretary of State\u2019s Office, came in to pick up two prescriptions. Han-num then remained in the store behind the counter conversing with Thun. Hannum had been awake for 21 hours at the time of his visit to the pharmacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-18\">At trial, Thun testified that at 2:45 a.m. one man, allegedly Burke, wearing a Halloween mask that covered his face, approached Thun, drew a .38 caliber revolver, and ordered Thun away from the cash register. As he moved away, Thun grabbed the man\u2019s gun and a struggle ensued. Thun hit the man and his mask became dislodged so that Thun could no longer see the man\u2019s eyes. At that point, Thun was shot in the chest by the second man, who was positioned at the end of the aisle, eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>to ten feet away. The second man, allegedly Olbrot, wore a bag over his head with holes cut out over the eyes and mouth. Thun fell to the floor but remained conscious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">Hannum testified at trial that he also saw two men, one with a rubber face mask and one with a plastic bag over his face. Hannum saw Thun wrestling with the man wearing the mask. When he heard the shot, Hannum ran around the prescription counter behind which he had been standing. Hannum observed Olbrot standing in a crouched position, approximately 20 feet away, holding a gun in his hand. Hannum observed Olbrot for only a few seconds, but he testified that the bag over the man\u2019s face had shifted almost to his nose so that Hannum saw a mustache.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-6\">Hannum testified that both men ran from the drug store and he pursued them. Hannum turned a corner before he reached an aisle leading to the door through which the two men were leaving. At the end of the aisle, Hannum fired his weapon at the two men as they were opening the door. Hannum thought he had wounded Olbrot, but was not sure. Hannum testified that he was again able to see the face of the second man because the bag had moved upward. Hannum also testified, however, that only Burke turned around to fire at Hannum as they were opening the door. Hannum did not see the men outside the drug store. From the corner he saw two people running down the street. They had been customers in the drug store when the assailants first entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-7\">Skokie police officer Robert Heelan, responding to a call about the drug store shooting, attempted to intercept a green Pontiac Firebird heading east on Main Street away from the drug store by making a roadblock with his squad car. The approaching car slowed down but did not stop for the roadblock. Heelan testified that he was able to see the driver through the driver\u2019s window, however, before the car sped off. The car was 20 feet from Heelan when he saw the driver. The intersection was lit by a streetlight and a dim light from a closed restaurant nearby. The driver\u2019s window was rolled down and Heelan was within four feet of the car as it sped by. Heelan saw only one person in the car and identified the driver as Burke. Heelan gave chase but lost the car in Evanston. It was found in Chicago the next day, and Heelan identified it as the car he had chased. The car was registered to Olbrot and a bag similar to the bag worn by Olbrot was found in the back seat. A .38 caliber revolver was found near the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-9\">B. Identification of Olbrot</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-10\">Thun never attempted to identify either suspect. Both Heelan and Hannum, however, were involved in identifying the suspects. Since the process of identification, while not our focus of attention, contributes to the result in this case, we will detail the testimony regarding the identification procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-11\">Several inconsistencies regarding Han-num\u2019s identification of Olbrot were raised at trial. The first Skokie police officer to arrive on the scene of the drug store was Officer Maher. For the purposes of sending a radio broadcast, Hannum described the two men to Maher as \u201ctwo white males approximately five foot nine inches and shorter.\u201d Maher\u2019s written report based on Hannum\u2019s description was that the men were five feet nine inches tall. Olbrot is in fact five feet one inch tall.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-12\">Hannum also testified that immediately after the robbery he gave Officer Maher a signed statement in which he described the assailants as in their \u201c20\u2019s, mid.\u201d In 1976 the year of the attempted robbery, Olbrot was 37 years old. Hannum again recorded his observations in a report directed to his supervisor in Springfield, but in that report he did not\u2018mention that he had seen 01-brot\u2019s face.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-13\">Hannum testified that he was asked by the officers involved in the investigation to go to the Chicago Police Department, Area 6 Robbery Division, to look through mug books. Hannum did not make any pretrial physical identification of Olbrot. When Hannum viewed the mug books on October 31, Olbrot was already a suspect because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>his car had been identified by Heelan. In the first mug book Hannum viewed, he identified the photo of Olbrot as one of the two men involved in the robbery. In the next book Hannum identified a photo of Burke. No police officers were present in the room with Hannum when he looked through the mug books. The Chicago Police Department failed to record the page number on which Olbrot\u2019s photo was found in the mug book and the numbers that would identify the other photos surrounding petitioner. The transcript indicates that such a record is required by Chicago Police Department Identification procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-4\">C. Identification of Burke</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-5\">Burke became a suspect in the attempted armed robbery case when he made a phone call to Paul Martin, a mutual friend of himself and Olbrot, on October 30, 1976. During that phone call, Burke asked Martin if he had seen Olbrot. At the time of Burke\u2019s phone call, about 10:45 a.m., several police officers were in Martin\u2019s home questioning him regarding the drugstore incident. Martin replied to Burke that he had not seen Olbrot, but that there were a lot of police officers present in his house. Officer Cappitelli testified that he then talked to Burke over the phone from the Martin residence and told Burke that he wanted to talk to him about Olbrot. Cappi-telli testified that Burke volunteered the information that Olbrot was supposed to have met him that morning but had not arrived. Cappitelli then called Lieutenant Locallo at Area 6 headquarters and told him to talk to Burke at Burke\u2019s mother\u2019s home. When officers arrived at Burke\u2019s mother\u2019s home at 11:20 a.m., 'Burke was not there.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-6\">Lois Burke, Burke\u2019s estranged wife, also testified at trial that police officers made warrantless searches of her home on October 30, October 31, November 1, and November 2, 1976 in the presence of herself and her three children. Although Mrs. Burke did not give them permission to take anything, on November 1 and 2 she noticed that photographs of Burke were taken from her home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-8\">Area 6 Officer Fornelli testified at trial' that on October 30, 1976, at 6:00 a.m., shortly after the attempted robbery, Hee-lan was shown a mug book by Skokie police officers, but was unable to identify any picture resembling the driver of the car. In Heelan\u2019s report, dated November 4, 1976, he did not state that he viewed a mug book, but that he had \u201cobserved several photos.\u201d Area 6 Officer Paul testified that he could not recall how many pages were in the book nor could he describe the photos, other than to say that Heelan viewed them on October 30, and they were black and white penitentiary release photos. Skokie Officer Hennessey testified that he removed a photo of Olbrot from the book, doctored it by erasing the mustache and changing the hairline, and showed it to Heelan. Heelan did not identify Olbrot as the driver of the vehicle. Heelan testified that while he was attempting to make an identification he was told that a particular photograph was of a suspect named Olbrot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-9\">On October 31, 1976, at 5:00 a.m., Heelan was shown another mug book by Fornelli and Paul and identified a picture of Raymond Burke. Thereafter Heelan was shown another five or six mug shots of other arrestees, plus another picture of Burke. Heelan testified that in this second set of pictures Burke was depicted wearing a tuxedo and \u201cbig tie.\u201d Fornelli testified that he did not inventory the mug book or record the page location of Mr. Burke\u2019s picture or the names of the other persons pictured on the page. Hennessey\u2019s report of the incident does not indicate that Hee-lan was shown mug books but that he was shown \u201cmore photos of the suspects.\u201d Hennessey testified that he dismantled the mug book immediately after the identification of Burke because he wanted the information on the back of the photograph. Fornelli also testified that he did not retain the mug book and could not reconstruct it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-10\">On October 31, 1976 Hannum was taken to Area 6 Chicago Police headquarters where he identified Burke in the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>mug book he viewed. The testimony relating to the procedures used on October 31, 1976 for Hannum\u2019s viewing of mug books is detailed in the section relating to Ol-brot\u2019s identification above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-5\">On November 2 or 3, 1976, Hennessey brought another photograph of Burke for Heelan to identify. Hennessey testified that he had the officer in charge of the I.D. Section isolate Burke from one of the three photographs which were removed from Lois Burke\u2019s residence. Hennessey testified that he would have shown Heelan about six other photographs with the one of Burke since six is the number he normally used. The picture shown Heelan of Burke showed Burke wearing a big tie and a tuxedo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-6\">D. The Surprise Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-7\">On the second day of defendants\u2019 joint jury trial in November 1979 for attempted murder, attempted armed robbery and aggravated battery, the state informed the court and the defense for the first time that Officer Yon Ahn would testify at trial against the defendants. Von Ahn is a Los Angeles Police Officer who had arrested Olbrot in California and who had given a statement saying that Olbrot had told him in a bar about being involved in a robbery of a drug store in Indiana where someone was shot. Before trial the defense had believed that the Indiana statement was the only statement made by Olbrot that the state would attempt to use. On the second day of trial, however, the state indicated that Von Ahn would also testify that Ol-brot had told him that he had committed a robbery in Illinois where a police officer was shot and that Olbrot had taken Von Ahn into the men\u2019s room and shown him a gunshot wound in his right shoulder. The court denied the defense motion for a continuance, but permitted the defense to depose Von Ahn the night before his testimony. During the deposition, Von Ahn stated that he had spoken to an Illinois assistant state\u2019s attorney named Callum and had told him about both of Olbrot\u2019s statements. Callum had been in charge of Olbrot\u2019s prosecution. Von Ahn was allowed to testify at trial about the new statement of Olbrot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-9\">E. Closing Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-10\">At the November 1979 joint trial of Ol-brot and Burke for attempted armed robbery, aggravated battery, and attempted murder, neither Olbrot nor Burke took the stand to testify. In his closing argument, the prosecutor made seven references to the defendants\u2019 failure to testify and to Olbrot\u2019s failure to .exhibit his back. The prosecutor first referred to the evidence on the identity of the car:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-11\">The car was purchased on October 15, 1976 by David Olbrot. David Olbrot also had personal papers in the back seat of that automobile. It is uncontradicted and undenied that the car was his.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1371-12\">Tr. 709. Later, referring to the alleged bullet wound Olbrot was supposed to have received during the attempted robbery, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-13\">Ladies and gentlemen, as sure as the sun rises in the East, that scar is on his back and that is uncontradicted and undenied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1371-14\">Tr. 713. Finally, referring to the testimony of the California Officer Von Ahn, the prosecutor said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-15\">You heard Von Ahn testify. I was there and I got shot. He is saying this months after Lloyd Hannum makes his identification. Corroboration. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about, corroborating everything Lloyd Hannum told you. And that conversation, ladies and gentlemen, is uncontra-dicted and undenied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1371-16\">Tr. 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b1371-17\">Defense counsel moved in limine after the prosecutor\u2019s opening closing argument to prevent the State from \u201cfurther arguments to matters being uncontradicted and undenied. Everything is denied by a plea of not guilty. Other arguments in that regard are specifically intended to cast aspersions on the defendants.\u201d Tr. 718. The court denied defense counsel\u2019s motion but issued a warning to the prosecutor: \u201cI just caution the State to stay away from that type of argument.\u201d Tr. 718.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>The prosecutor, however, continued to make remarks pertaining to the defendants\u2019 failure to testify. In his rebuttal, the prosecutor made the following statement about Hannum\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1372-4\">He came in here and identified them because those are the guys who were in the drug store. Have you heard any evidence that they weren\u2019t in the drug store? Have you heard one thing ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ast-dedup-0\">Tr. 775. At this point, Olbrot\u2019s attorney objected, but the prosecutor finished his statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1372-5\">contradictory of the testimony of Lloyd Hannum?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1372-6\">Tr. 775. The court then sustained defense counsel\u2019s objection, but gave no instruction to the jury regarding the defendants\u2019 constitutional right to remain silent. Later, the prosecutor again stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1372-7\">The evidence in this record is uncontra-dicted. Undenied. Those two men were in the drug store.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1372-8\">Tr. 781. The prosecutor referred to Ol-brot\u2019s alleged wound a second time in his rebuttal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1372-9\">All I know is he has a scar on his back and I cannot make him take his shirt off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1372-10\">Tr. 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-11\">In his final remarks, the prosecutor again referred to the defendants\u2019 failure to testify:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1372-12\">The facts in this case are very, very simple. Those guys are robbers. You haven\u2019t heard one word of evidence that contradicts the State\u2019s case. Defense is built on paper. It\u2019s a paper defense. I implore you do not let them get away with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1372-13\">Tr. 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-14\">At the close of trial, defendants moved for a mistrial based on the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument but the court denied the motion. The court also denied defendants\u2019 motions for a new trial. The court imposed on Olbrot sentences of three to ten years for aggravated battery, six to ten years for attempted armed robbery and fifteen to one hundred years for attempted murder. The court imposed on Burke sentences of three to ten years for aggravated battery, six to twenty years for attempted armed robbery and thirty to ninety years for attempted murder. On May 3, 1982, the Illinois Appellate Court, First District, affirmed the convictions, holding that the closing argument \u201cdid not constitute a material factor in the convictions ... or result in a substantial prejudice to defendants.\u201d 106 Ill.App.3d 367, 387, 62 Ill.Dec. 270, 435 N.E.2d 1242. On October 5, 1982, the Illinois Supreme Court denied petitioner leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-16\">II. REFERENCES TO DEFENDANTS\u2019 FAILURE TO TESTIFY</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-17\">Direct reference by a prosecutor to a defendant\u2019s decision not to testify at trial is always a violation of the defendant\u2019s fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>627 F.2d 110, 111 (7th Cir.1980). Indirect references to the defendant\u2019s failure to testify are constitutionally impermissible if \u201cthe language used was manifestly intended to be or was of such a character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d <em>United States v. Lyon, </em>397 F.2d 505, 509 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom., Lysczyk v. United States, </em>393 U.S. 846, 89 S.Ct. 131, 21 L.Ed.2d 117 (1968) <em>(citing United States v. Wright, </em>309 F.2d 735 (7th Cir.1962), <em>cert. denied, </em>372 U.S. 929, 83 S.Ct. 873, 9 L.Ed.2d 733 (1963)). In <em>United States v. Fearns, </em>501 F.2d 486 (7th Cir. 1974), this court held that two prosecutorial references to \u201cundisputed\u201d testimony were indirect references to the defendant\u2019s failure to testify where \u201c[tjhere were no persons other than the defendants who could have disputed the [prosecution witness\u2019] testimony apart from alibi witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490. Similarly, in <em>United States v. Handman, </em>447 F.2d 853 (7th Cir.1971), we held that a prosecutor\u2019s argument that government testimony remained \u201cintact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>unchallenged and uncontradicted\u201d constituted an indirect reference to the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. <em>Id. </em>at 855. In <em>United States v. Buege, </em>578 F.2d 187, 189 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 871, 99 S.Ct. 203, 58 L.Ed.2d 183 (1978), we found error where a prosecutor repeatedly depicted testimony as uncontradicted \u201cwhere it was highly unlikely that at least a portion of the testimony could have been contradicted by anyone other than the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189. Finally, this court has even recognized that closing arguments regarding \u201cuncontradicted\u201d testimony which could have been contradicted by either the defendant or another witness were nonetheless impermissible because they \u201ccould have called attention to [defendant\u2019s] failure to testify on any issue \u2014 and thus to his failure to contradict much of the testimony which could not have been contradicted by anyone but him.\u201d <em>United States v. Poole, </em>379 F.2d 645, 649 (7th Cir.1967). <em>Cf. United States v. Shue, </em>(7th Cir.1984) (prosecutor violated defendant\u2019s due process rights by referring in his closing arguments to the defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence and implying that the silence was inconsistent with a claim of innocence).</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\">While the bulk of our cases regarding prejudicial prosecutorial remarks have involved federal cases and federal prosecutors, we think the principle at issue applies equally to state cases, such as the one at issue here. In <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965), the Supreme Court held that direct comments by a California state prosecutor regarding the accused\u2019s silence violated the accused\u2019s fifth amendment rights. Moreover, other circuits have granted writs of habeas corpus on the grounds that closing remarks by state prosecutors on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify were unconstitutional and so prejudiced the defendant\u2019s trial as to be beyond the doctrine of harmless error. <em>See, e.g., Hearn v. Mintzes, </em>708 F.2d 1072 (6th Cir.1983); <em>Calloway v. Wainwright, </em>409 F.2d 59 (5th Cir.1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>395 U.S. 909, 89 S.Ct. 1752, 23 L.Ed.2d 222 (1969); <em>Schultz v. Yeager, </em>403 F.2d 639 (3d Cir.1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>394 U.S. 961, 89 S.Ct. 1309, 22 L.Ed.2d 562 (1969). <em>See also Hall v. Wainwright, </em>733 F.2d 766 (11th Cir.1984) (upholding the propriety of federal appellate review of state prosecutor\u2019s comments on petition for writ of habeas corpus, but finding comments at issue were not errors of constitutional magnitude).</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-7\">Seven indirect references to a failure to testify, made after explicit cautionary advice from the presiding judge to \u201cstay away\u201d from such arguments, lead us to conclude that the prosecutor \u201cmanifestly intended\u201d to make a comment about the defendants\u2019 failure to testify. Moreover, there is little doubt that this case comes within the confines of the rule requiring that indirect references \u201cnaturally and necessarily will be taken by the jury as a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d <em>Lyon, </em>397 F.2d at 509. No one other than the defendants could have satisfactorily denied or contradicted the government\u2019s witnesses. Only Olbrot, for instance, could have contradicted Von Ahn\u2019s testimony as to his alleged California conversation with Olbrot. It is true that the two customers who fled the drugstore at the time of the robbery might have been called to contradict Hannum\u2019s testimony as to who was in the drug store, but, as the state admitted during oral argument, there is nothing on the record to indicate that either side knew the identity of these individuals. Moreover, because the jury had only heard two passing references to these individuals, it is unlikely that these customers would have come to mind as possible providers of contradictory evidence or that they had been the force behind the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cuncontradicted\u201d remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-8\">Furthermore, while the fifth amendment is not in fact implicated by Olbrot\u2019s failure to exhibit his back, therefore making statements about Olbrot\u2019s alleged scar less egregious in themselves than the continual reference to \u201cundenied\u201d testimony, we do not think that ends the matter. Remarks about the scar or regarding who was in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>drugstore might have been contradicted by Olbrot\u2019s nontestimonial exhibition of his back or by securing the testimony of the two fleeing customers. Nonetheless, these remarks primarily call attention to the testimony which could have been contradicted only by Olbrot\u2019s and Burke\u2019s testimony. The crucial inquiry in evaluating the prejudice conveyed by indirect reference to \u2022 a failure to testify is a consideration of how the jury would view the closing argument as a whole. A juror is unlikely to be aware of the distinctions between testimonial and nontestimonial evidence, so that the obvious conclusion to be drawn from the prosecutor\u2019s remarks regarding the scar was that the defendant\u2019s failure to show his back was indicative of guilt. Such indirect references to a failure to testify violate the defendant\u2019s fifth amendment rights and are clearly improper. Similarly, repeated references to \u201cuncontradicted\u201d testimony also is likely to cause the jury to view the closing argument as a commentary on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify and as a suggestion to view that failure to testify as indicia of guilt. This, too, is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-4\">III. HARMLESS ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"Aqb-\">Once a constitutional violation is established, the government can only prevail if it sustains the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant would have been convicted absent the prosecutor\u2019s unconstitutional remarks. <em>United, States v. Hasting, </em>461 U.S. 499, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983). To satisfy its burden, the government must do more than demonstrate by circumstantial evidence that the defendant\u2019s guilt exists. Rather, the case against the defendant must be \u201coverwhelming\u201d in order to apply the harmless error rule. <em>See United States v. Shue, </em>746 F.2d 1280, 1287-88 (7th Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Wilkins, </em>659 F.2d 769, 774 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>454 U.S. 1102, 102 S.Ct. 681, 70 L.Ed.2d 646 (1981); <em>United States v. Handman, </em>447 F.2d 853, 856 (7th Cir.1971). <em>See also United States v. Hasting, </em>461 U.S. 499, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-6\">The level of evidence required for a finding of overwhelming guilt is exemplified in <em>Wilkins </em>and <em>Hasting. </em>In <em>Wilkins, </em>a bank robbery case, the defendant was arrested with the stolen money and guns in the getaway car a few blocks from the bank. <em>Wilkins, </em>659 F.2d at 774. Similarly, in <em>Hasting, </em>the Supreme Court relied on the fact that \u201ca more compelling case of guilt would be difficult to imagine.\u201d <em>Hasting, </em>461 U.S. at 503, 103 S.Ct. at 1977. In <em>Hasting, </em>the defendants were promptly picked out of a line-up, there were corroborating eyewitnesses, stolen property was found in one of the defendant\u2019s possession, and there had been identification of the car used and one of the defendant\u2019s fingerprints.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-7\">By contrast, the district court in Olbrot\u2019s case granted the writ because of the \u201ccircumstantial evidence introduced at trial\u201d regarding Olbrot\u2019s alleged scar, and because of the \u201clack of substantial direct evidence to show that [Olbrot] was the second assailant.\u201d The only direct identification of Olbrot was made by Officer Han-num who admitted to seeing the assailant\u2019s face only briefly. The only other witness could not identify Olbrot. Further, Han-num\u2019s original identification of the height of the shorter assailant alleged to be Ol-brot was off by many inches. The identification procedures of the police were tainted by the prosecutor\u2019s remarks that Olbrot had not denied the testimony of Hannum. Similarly, the car in which Burke allegedly was seen was registered to Olbrot. This evidence was tainted by the prosecutor\u2019s remarks that the evidence was undenied since only Olbrot could have explained how Burke came to have his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-8\">The fact that there was some incriminating evidence does not render harmless the prosecutor\u2019s unconstitutional statements. Given the importance of the identification evidence in this case, we hold that the government has not demonstrated that 01-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>brot and Burke would have been convicted absent the prosecutor\u2019s repeated allusions to Olbrot\u2019s and Burke\u2019s failure to testify. The case against Burke and Olbrot hardly can be viewed as \u201coverwhelming\u201d as was the case against the defendant in <em>Hasting. </em>Thus, there is more than a reasonable possibility that the prosecutor\u2019s comments contributed to Olbrot\u2019s and Burke\u2019s conviction. It is not at all clear beyond a reasonable doubt that, absent the prosecutor\u2019s comments, the jury would have returned a verdict of guilty. Therefore, we cannot accept the not reversible error approach of the closing argument adopted by the Appellate Court of Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-5\">Furthermore, the trial judge in this case did not immediately instruct the jury to disregard the prosecutor\u2019s remarks and inform them of the defendants\u2019 right to remain silent. In his final instruction the judge did tell the jury that \u201cthe defendants are not required to prove their, innocence. The fact that the defendant did not testify should not be considered by you in any way in arriving at your verdict.\u201d Tr. 793-94. Such final jury instructions are \u201cordinarily not sufficient,\u201d however, to cure constitutional errors. <em>United States v. Buege, </em>578 F.2d 187, 189 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 871, 99 S.Ct. 203, 58 L.Ed.2d 183 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-6\">IY. DOUBLE JEOPARDY</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-7\">Finally, we address Olbrot\u2019s and Burke\u2019s double jeopardy argument. Defendants argue that under <em>Missouri v. Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 103 S.Ct. 673, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983), their double jeopardy rights were violated because under Illinois law the defendants should not have been convicted of both aggravated battery and attempted murder on the basis of one act. Under Illinois law, aggravated battery is a lesser included offense of attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-8\"><em>Missouri v. Hunter </em>establishes a twofold test for determining whether two statutes describe the same offense for the purpose of double jeopardy analysis. The first element of the test is whether the legislature intended to punish persons twice for a single criminal act. If such legislative intent is established, then sentences under both statutes may be pronounced without violating constitutional double jeopardy principles. If, on the other hand, legislative intent is not ascertainable, then the court is to determine whether the two offenses are the same offense under the \u201coverlapping elements\u201d test of <em>Blockbur-ger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-10\">Defendants argue that because Illinois courts have held that aggravated battery is a lesser included offense of attempted murder and persons are not to be convicted of both crimes on the basis of one act, <em>People ex rel. Walker v. Pate, </em>53 Ill.2d 485, 489, 292 N.E.2d 387 (1973), then the Illinois legislature could not have intended to convict persons of both aggravated battery and attempted murder on the basis of a single act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-11\">The Illinois appellate court in this case, however, rejected defendants\u2019 double jeopardy argument, concluding that two acts were involved in this case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1375-12\">In the case at bar, separate and distinct acts occurred upon which convictions for both aggravated battery and attempted murder are proper. During the robbery attempt, Burke, armed with a revolver, began fighting with Thun. Olbrot then appeared and fired a shot, injuring Thun. These acts clearly constituted separate acts committed during the attempted robbery, for which defendants may be held accountable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1375-13\"><em>People v. Olbrot, </em>106 Ill.App.3rd 367, 377, 62 Ill.Dec. 270, 435 N.E.2d 1242 (1982). We agree that the scuffle is distinct from the shooting, and we therefore reject the defendants\u2019 double jeopardy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-14\">Defendants claim other errors in their trial, particularly with reference to the photographic identification procedures and to procedural matters in the district court, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>given our holding regarding the prosecutor\u2019s statements and the resulting grant of the writ of habeas corpus it is not necessary to discuss these other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-4\">In conclusion then, for the reasons mentioned above we find that the prosecutor committed constitutional error when he made seven references to \u201cuncontradicted and undenied\u201d testimony and to Olbrot\u2019s failure to exhibit his back. <em>Lyon, </em>397 F.2d at 509. We warned in <em>Fearns, </em>and repeated that warning in <em>Buege </em>that \u201cit will usually be rash for the prosecutor to predict\u201d that indirect references to a defendant\u2019s failure to testify are not prejudicial. <em>Buege, </em>578 F.2d at 190 <em>(quoting Fearns </em>501 F.2d at 490). The prosecutor here, as did the prosecutor in <em>Rodriguez, </em>came too close to \u201cthe edge of the precipice.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>627 F.2d at 114. While the prosecutor in this case was not the first to err, we hope that our admonitions regarding closing arguments will not again go \u201cunheeded,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 114, and that prejudicial indirect references to a defendant\u2019s failure to testify will cease to be an issue before this court. We therefore affirm Judge Baker\u2019s grant of Olbrot\u2019s writ of habeas corpus and reverse Judge Plunkett\u2019s denial of Burke\u2019s writ. Judge Baker\u2019s order that a new trial take place within 120 days of the mandate reaching his court is affirmed. Judge Plunkett is hereby ordered to issue a writ releasing Burke unless Burke is retried within the 120 day time limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-5\">AFFIRMED as to 84-1343 and 84-1481; REVERSED as to 84-1430.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
