The complaint is that, they were issued and adopted without complying with the rulemaking procedures and publication requirements <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Administrator of Veterans\u2019 Affairs appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion for summary judgment, and its grant of summary judgment for the plaintiffs. The only issue we find it necessary to resolve is whether the statutory preclusion of judicial review of VA decisions, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211(a) (1982), applies to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">American servicemen were exposed to radiation during cleanup operations after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and at a series of above-ground tests of nuclear weapons conducted between 1946 and 1961. At the time, the health effects of exposure to the levels of radiation involved were poorly understood, and to this day are not fully known. Years after their exposure, veterans continue to file claims with the government for health care and compensation for diseases assertedly resulting from the radiation. To succeed, a veteran must establish that his malady was \u201ccontracted in line of duty,\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 310, 331 (1982) \u2014 which is frequently the critical obstacle, since there is usually no dispute concerning the claimant\u2019s current medical condition. In order to prevail on this issue of so-called \u201cservice connection,\u201d a veteran need only raise a reasonable doubt. 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.102 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-13\">The handling of these radiation claims by the VA and Department of Defense (\u201cDoD\u201d) became the subject of a Congressional investigation in June 1979, following which the agencies issued various documents dealing with the subject: a Memorandum of Understanding between the VA and DoD, issued June 15, 1979, a VA Radiation Program Guide issued August 21, 1979, and VA Radiation Claims Procedures issued September 10, 1979. Two revised versions of the Guide have since been issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-14\">The plaintiffs in this case, a group of veterans, veterans\u2019 wives and veterans\u2019 organizations, challenged as violations of the APA the failure to provide notice and comment procedures for the Program Guide, Claims Procedures and Memorandum, and the failure to publish the latter two in the Federal Register.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On cross-motions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>summary judgment, the District Court found that all three documents were rules within the meaning of the APA, and that the VA\u2019s failure to conduct an informal rulemaking before issuing them rendered them invalid. It denied summary judgment to the government and granted it to the plaintiffs. <em>Gott v. Cleland, </em>Civil No. 80-0906 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 1981) (Order). Subsequent rulings by the District Court clarified or extended the scope of that judgment. In denying plaintiffs\u2019 request for additional individual relief to those claimants who had been denied benefits on the basis of the documents, the court suggested that the VA was obliged to reconsider any such denial if asked by claimants to do so. <em>Gott v. Cleland, </em>Civil No. 80-0906 (D.D.C. Dec. 15, 1981) (Order). Still later, the plaintiffs moved to hold the VA in contempt for continuing to use radiation data obtained from DoD in accordance with the invalidated Memorandum. In a supplemental opinion and order, the District Court denied the contempt motion without prejudice, explained that the methodologies established by the Memorandum were within the scope of its original order, and required the VA to conduct a rulemaking before using them. It also ordered the VA to submit a timetable for compliance within sixty days and to conduct a rulemaking within ninety days. <em>Gott v. Nimmo, </em>Civil No. 80-0906 (D.D.C. Feb. 17, 1982); <em>see also Gott v. Nimmo, </em>Civil No. 80-0906 (D.D.C. July 21, 1982) (Order modifying dates for compliance). The VA moved for clarification of the order, contending that the methodologies had been improperly included because they were outside the scope of the litigation, and for a stay pending appeal. The court denied the motions on March 26, 1982. <em>Gott v. Nimmo, </em>Civil No. 80-0906 (Order). On May 20, the VA and DoD published proposed radiation rules. They have declared that these will be withdrawn if this appeal succeeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">The VA appeals from the grant of summary judgment, from the District Court\u2019s February 17, 1982 order regarding methodology, and from the order of March 26, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">We are confronted at the outset with a jurisdictional problem, raised and argued in the District Court, but not asserted on this appeal<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 though addressed briefly in appellees\u2019 Supplemental Brief. Since we consider it substantial, and since it pertains to our power to decide this case, we feel compelled to address it on our own.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">The appellees brought their suit in district court under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 702-704 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>(1982). These provisions make \u201cfinal agency action ... subject to judicial review,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704, at the behest of \u201c[a] person suffering legal wrong ... or adversely affected or aggrieved ... within the meaning of a relevant statute,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702. These sections do not apply, however, to the extent that \u201cstatutes preclude judicial review.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701(a)(1). As the Supreme Court has most recently expressed the test for such preclusion: \u201c[WJhere substantial doubt about the congressional intent exists, the general presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action is controlling,\u201d but that presumption is overcome whenever \u201ccongressional intent to preclude judicial review is \u2018fairly discernible\u2019 in the detail of the legislative scheme.\u201d <em>Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2450, 2457, 81 L.Ed.2d 270 (1984) <em>(quoting Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 157, 90 S.Ct. 827, 832, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970)). Such intent may be found on the basis of \u201cspecific language or specific legislative history,\u201d \u201ccontemporaneous judicial construction barring review and the congressional acquiescence in it,\u201d or \u201cinferences of intent drawn from the statutory scheme as a whole.\u201d <em>Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2456.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">The statute that appears to preclude review here is 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211(a) (1982), which provides (with exceptions not here relevant) that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-7\">the decisions of the Administrator on any question of law or fact under any law administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration providing benefits for veterans and their dependents or survivors shall be final and conclusive and no other official or any court of the United States shall have power or jurisdiction to review any such decision by an action in the nature of mandamus or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">In the portion of their Supplemental Brief dealing with \u00a7 211(a), appellees assert that this provision is inapplicable here by its terms, since the legal question on which the Administrator\u2019s decision is <em>challenged </em>\u2014 viz., the necessity <em>vel non </em>of rulemaking procedures \u2014 \u201carises under the APA, not \u2018under the statute\u2019 concerning veterans benefits.\u201d Supplemental Brief for Appellees at 4. We reject this analysis, which relies upon a lengthy dictum of this court in <em>Kirkhuff v. Nimmo, </em>683 F.2d 544, 546-48 (D.C.Cir.1982). Central to the reasoning of <em>Kirkhuff </em>was its statement that the Supreme Court, in <em>Johnson v. Robison, </em>415 U.S. 361, 94 S.Ct. 1160, 39 L.Ed.2d 389 (1974), held that constitutional challenges \u201cwere not barred by \u00a7 211(a) because they involved questions of law arising \u2018under the Constitution,\u2019 rather than \u2018under the statute.\u2019 \u201d 683 F.2d at 547, <em>quoting </em>415 U.S. at 367, 94 S.Ct. at 1166. The statement is true, but it does not lead to the conclusion that the <em>Kirkhuff </em>dictum suggests. As our more extended discussion of <em>Robison </em>below will explain, <em>see </em>pages 911-12, <em>infra, </em>the consequence of the fact that the case presented a question (concerning the validity of the statute) \u201cunder the Constitution\u201d was <em>not </em>that therefore it did not present a \u201cquestion of law ... under any law administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 211(a); but rather, that therefore there had been no \u201cdecision of the Administrator\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 211(a), since the Administrator does not consider the constitutionality of the statutes he is directed to administer (as he does consider the compliance of his regulations with the APA). It was, the Court concluded, a decision of the Congress rather than of the Administrator that was under review. The interpretation of \u00a7 211(a) appellees suggest \u2014 requiring that the Administrator\u2019s decision be challenged specifically on a question of law pertaining to the text of the veterans\u2019 benefit statutes \u2014 is unthinkable, since it would open up even individual claims adjudications to review for compliance with the APA\u2019s legal requirement of adequate evidentiary support, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), a result we have of course rejected, <em>see Carter v. Cleland, </em>643 F.2d 1, 5 (D.C.Cir.1980). All that is necessary for \u00a7 211(a) to apply is that the question of law or fact have been decided by the Administrator, and that the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>have been made in the course of applying the veterans\u2019 benefit statutes. In other words, the provision should be read \u201cdecisions of the Administrator (on any question of law or fact) under any law administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration\u201d rather than \u201cdecisions of the Administrator, on any question of law or fact under any law administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, issues of law not decided by the Administrator (Robison) are excluded; as are issues of law decided by the Administrator not in the course of a determination under the veterans\u2019 benefit laws, but in the course of applying independently operative statutes such as the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act not related to the procedure for administrative deci-sionmaking, <em>see Leib v. Veterans\u2019 Administration, </em>546 F.Supp. 758, 759 n. 4 (D.D.C. 1982).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But the Administrative Procedure Act operates (insofar as is pertinent here) only by regulating the manner in which determinations under the benefit laws must be made, and any administrative decision <em>concerning </em>that issue is a decision \u201cunder\u201d the benefit laws in the relevant sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">Supreme Court cases dealing with an analogous statutory provision precluding judicial review support the foregoing analysis. <em>See Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 760-61, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2464-65, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-6\">It would, of course, be fruitless to contend that appellees\u2019 claim is one which does not arise under the Constitution, since their constitutional arguments are critical to their complaint. But it is just as fruitless to argue that this action does not also arise under the Social Security Act [within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h) (1982) ]. For not only is it Social Security benefits which appellees seek to recover, but it is the Social Security Act which provides both the standing and the substantive basis for the presentation of their constitutional contentions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-13\"><em>See also Heckler v. Ringer, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 2013, 2022, 80 L.Ed.2d 622 (1984) (claims that the Secretary of Health and Human Services failed to comply with rule-making requirements of APA and wrongfully decided certain issues by rulemaking rather than adjudication \u201carise[] under\u201d the Medicare Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-15\">It would appear, therefore, that the \u201cspecific language\u201d of \u00a7 211(a) bars us from reviewing the validity of the documents and methodologies in controversy here. In the District Court, however, the appellees argued that application of \u00a7 211(a) may be avoided on two grounds. First, they claimed that the word \u201cdecisions\u201d refers only to adjudications of individual veterans\u2019 claims and not to the promulgation of regulations. Second, they claimed that even if the provision bars judicial review of regulations for some purposes, <em>e.g., </em>to ensure that their substance is not arbitrary or capricious, it does not preclude review to ensure that regulations do not exceed the VA\u2019s statutory authority (which excess they deem to include the issuance of regulations in violation of the APA). We treat each of these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-16\">\n<em>The Contention that All Rulemaking Is Subject to Judicial Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aed\">The principal evidence adduced for the proposition that \u00a7 211(a) reaches no rule-making is the prior version of the statute. From 1957 to 1970, \u00a7 211(a) read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-17\">[T]he decisions of the Administrator on any question of law or fact <em>concerning a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number><em>claim for benefits or payments </em>under any law administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration shall be final and conclusive and no other official or any court of the United States shall have power or jurisdiction to review any such decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aza-dedup-0\">Veterans\u2019 Benefits Act of 1957, 71 Stat. 83, 92 (1957) (emphasis added). The appellees take it as a given that in that earlier version the word \u201cdecisions\u201d referred only to adjudications of individual claims, and contend that the 1970 amendments merely reaffirmed that bar to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">It seems to us far from self-evident that a regulation governing veterans\u2019 benefits would not have been considered a \u201cdecision[ ] ... on [a] question of law ... concerning a claim for benefits\u201d under the earlier version. The language in question dates back to 1940, <em>cf. Daylo v. Administrator of Veterans\u2019 Affairs, </em>501 F.2d 811, 813 n. 10 (D.C.Cir.1974), an era in which the adoption of principles governing adjudications <em>by rule </em>was rare (and thus unlikely to be specifically addressed in such a statute) and in which, under then current notions of ripeness, rules could in any event not be challenged until applied <em>in the course of an adjudication. See generally </em>Scalia, <em>Vermont </em>Yankee:. <em>The APA, the D. C. Circuit, and the Supreme Court, </em>1978 Sup.Ct. Rev. 345, 375-77 (1979). The 1940 enactment was accompanied, moreover, by the statement (in the Senate Finance Committee Report) that it \u201cprovides for the finality of decisions made by the Administrator of Veterans\u2019 Affairs on <em>questions relating to claims </em>under any of the laws administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration.\u201d S.Rep. No. 2198, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. 11 (1940) (emphasis added). In addition, the 1940 version was described in the Senate debate as \u201cnot so much a limitation as a restatement of what is believed to be the law upon the question,\u201d 86 Cong.Rec. 13,383 (1940) (remarks of Sen. George); and the then existing law consisted of \u00a7 5 of the Economy Act of 1933, ch. 3, 48 Stat. 9, which provided that \u201c[a]ll decisions rendered by the Administrator of Veterans\u2019 Affairs under the provisions of this title ... shall be final and conclusive on all questions of law and fact, and no other official or court of the United States shall have jurisdiction to review by mandamus or otherwise any such decision\u201d \u2014 a formulation more equivalent to the current provision than to the 1940-to-1970 version. If the pre-1970 language is to be used to contradict the apparent meaning of the present statute, then it is only fair that the 1933 statute be used to contradict the apparent meaning of the pre-1970 language. In any case, we need not decide this question, since even if the appel-lees\u2019 view of the pre-1970 law is correct, there is nothing to indicate that the 1970 amendment of \u00a7 211(a) was meant, <em>despite its language, </em>to perpetuate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">If we had no specific information on Congress\u2019s intentions in removing the participial phrase \u201cconcerning a claim for benefits or payments,\u201d the natural conclusion would be that Congress meant to make clear, among other things, that the class of unre-viewable decisions included more than individual adjudications. The appellees, however, contend that we do have specific information on Congress\u2019s intentions, which points to one purpose: to overrule a line of cases in this circuit finding that a decision on the part of the VA to terminate benefits was not a \u201cdecision[ ] ... concerning a claim\u201d because it was initiated by the VA, not by a claimant. Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply to Defendants\u2019 Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss, etc., at 10-11 <em>&amp; </em>n. 21 (filed Sept. 4, 1981). <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1166, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 10 (1970), <em>reprinted in </em>1970 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 3723, 3731, rejecting the \u201cfairly tortured construction adopted by the court of appeals in the <em>Wellman [v. Whittier, </em>259 F.2d 163 (D.C.Cir.1958) ], <em>Thompson [v. Gleason, </em>317 F.2d 901 (D.C.Cir.1962) ], and <em>Tracy [v. Gleason, </em>379 F.2d 469 (D.C.Cir. 1967) ] holdings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">Overruling that line of cases was undeniably Congress\u2019s principal purpose in the amendment. The legislative history shows, however, that Congress also thought it was preventing judicial review of regulations\u2014 whether by way of amending the preexist- \u2022 ing law or (as seems more likely) by way of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>clarifying the prior understanding. The same House report relied upon by the ap-pellees sets forth a letter from the VA, which it describes as \u201cdiscussfing] in detail\u201d \u201cthe events that have transpired in recent years which gave rise to this amendment,\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1166, <em>supra </em>at 8, 1970 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3729. That letter, referring to the \u201c353 suits of [the <em>Wellman-Thompson-Tracy </em>] type ... filed in the District of Columbia circuit,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 21, 1970 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3740, stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-4\">suits similar to the several hundred already filed can \u2014 and undoubtedly will\u2014 subject nearly every aspect of our benefit determinations to judicial review, including rating decisions, <em>related Veterans\u2019 Administration regulations, </em>Administrator\u2019s decisions, and various adjudication procedures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 23-24, 1970 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad. News 3742 (emphasis added). It is true that the VA\u2019s letter endorsed an amendment to \u00a7 211(a) different from that which the Committee proposed and Congress adopted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> But that is beside the point. The point is that the <em>Committee, </em>by including the VA\u2019s letter in its Report, referred to the danger of review of regulations as one of the evils that \u201cgave rise\u201d to the amendment which <em>it </em>proposed. This would, of course, be weak legislative history to establish that a statute which referred only to \u201cdecisions ... concerning a claim for benefits or payments\u201d was meant to cover decisions concerning regulations. But it is more than enough to <em>refute </em>an appeal to legislative history to establish that a statute which refers to \u201cdecisions ... on any question of law or fact under any law administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration\u201d does <em>not </em>cover decisions concerning regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">Coverage of regulations is further supported by the basic purposes of \u00a7 211(a), which the Supreme Court has said are twofold: first, to prevent the courts from becoming \u201cinvolve[d] ... in day-to-day determination and interpretation of Veterans\u2019 Administration policy,\u201d with the accompanying prospect of \u201c \u2018judicial review of millions of decisions terminating or reducing many types of benefits\u2019 and second, \u201cto insure that the technical and complex determinations and applications of Veterans\u2019 Administration policy connected with veterans\u2019 benefits will be adequately and uniformly made,\u201d <em>Johnson v. Robison, </em>415 U.S. at 370, 372, 94 S.Ct. at 1167, 1168, <em>quoting </em>H.R.Rep. No. 1166, <em>supra </em>at 24, 1970 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 3742-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-13\">Review of the <em>substance </em>of regulations obviously would frustrate the second of these purposes. Regulations are at least as likely as adjudications to involve \u201ctechnical and complex\u201d policy determinations regarding benefits. In fact the appellees\u2019 principal complaint about the documents at issue here is that they are for all practical purposes final decisions of issues which would otherwise be resolved by adjudication: the health effects of exposure to low levels of radiation, the kinds of diseases radiation may cause, and the best method for calculating the dosages of radiation to which appellees were exposed. It is hard to see why these determinations are too technical and complex to be \u201cadequately\u201d reviewed in the context of individual adjudications, but less so when reviewed in the context of rulemaking; or why the destruction of \u201cuniformity\u201d in these determinations \u2014 presumably attributable to the differing views of the various federal circuits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>as opposed to the unitary view of the Administrator \u2014 is any more tolerable when achieved through review of rules than through review of the same policies adopted in adjudication.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">Moreover, both review of the <em>substance </em>of regulations and review of the <em>procedures </em>by which they are adopted conflict with the first purpose the Supreme Court found Congress was pursuing in enacting \u00a7 211(a) \u2014 avoiding the courts\u2019 embroilment in numerous individual claims decisions. That is evident from considering what would happen in this case if we were to proceed with review of the appellees\u2019 complaint that the documents and methodologies at issue are substantive regulations and therefore should have been adopted in accordance with informal rulemaking procedures. All parties to this litigation agree that whether they are substantive regulations turns on whether they are given a dispositive effect in the adjudication of individual claims. The VA asserts they are not determinative, the appellees the contrary. It is quite impossible to resolve this issue without looking at the actual use of the documents and methodologies in individual proceedings. But even if we were to resolve it on some philosophical basis, and were to conclude that the documents and methodologies <em>are </em>dispositive, <em>are </em>substantive rules and therefore <em>are </em>improperly adopted, it is difficult to imagine any effective order we could issue. In prohibiting the VA from giving them binding legal effect, we would be telling the VA not to do what it believes it is not doing anyway. It would presumably continue to act as it says (though we disagree) it has been acting \u2014 and how would we ever stop that behavior? Our order is a vain act, in other words, <em>unless we can review subsequent adjudications for compliance. </em>And that will always be so, with regard to any regulation that governs the adjudication of claims. Review of such regulations, therefore, either frustrates the first purpose of \u00a7 211(a) described by the Supreme Court, or else requires the courts to issue embarrassingly impotent mandates. The former consequence is not, given the Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement, a permissible assumption of legislative intent; and the latter is not a plausible one.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">Therefore, in light of the language, the legislative history, and the purposes of \u00a7 211(a), we reject the appellees\u2019 argument that it does not bar review of regulations. <em>The Contention that </em>Ultra Vires <em>Rule-making Is Subject to Judicial Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">The appellees advanced in the District Court the further argument that even if some types of judicial review of regulations, such as review to ensure that they are not arbitrary or capricious, or review to ensure that they have adequate evidentiary support, <em>are </em>barred by \u00a7 211(a); the type of review they seek here, merely to assure that the APA\u2019s procedural requirements have been observed, is not barred. They rely for that proposition upon decisions in other circuits holding that \u00a7 211(a) does not preclude judicial review of regulations to ensure that they do not exceed the VA\u2019s statutory authority, <em>citing Wayne State University v. Cleland, </em>590 F.2d 627 (6th Cir.1978), and cases that accept the reasoning of that opinion without additional analysis, <em>University of Maryland v. Cleland, </em>621 F.2d 98 (4th Cir.1980); <em>Evergreen State College v. Cleland, </em>621 F.2d 1002 (9th Cir.1980); <em>Merged Area X (Education) v. Cleland, </em>604 F.2d 1075 (8th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>1979). Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply to Defendants\u2019 Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss, etc., at 12-13 (filed Sept. 4, 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">We note in passing that if there is a meaningful line between unlawful action in excess of authority and unlawful action not in excess of authority, it is not immediately apparent why failure to comply with procedural forms would fall into the former rather than the latter category. And that the <em>Wayne State </em>court, curiously enough, after having established to its satisfaction its power to review only \u201cthe Administrator\u2019s authority to promulgate regulations,\u201d 590 F.2d at 632 (footnote omitted), proceeded to consider not only \u201cwhether the regulations were promulgated in excess of statutory authority\u201d; and not only (as we have said, less logically) \u201cwhether the agency followed necessary procedural requirements in the promulgation of the regulations\u201d; but <em>also </em>whether the regulations were \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law\u201d (which is, of course, <em>everything </em>else). <em>Id. </em>at 632-33. So that if one is guided by what <em>Wayne State </em>ultimately did rather than by what <em>Wayne State </em>initially said, there seems to be no difference between this present argument of the ap-pellees and the argument discussed earlier: all aspects of regulations appear to be reviewable. But no matter. We have examined the appellate cases that (in their formulation at least) limit review of VA rules to the authority for their promulgation, and find them unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\"><em>Wayne State </em>rested upon the assumption that \u201c \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 evidence of congressional intent [is] required by the Supreme Court before a statute will be construed to restrict access to judicial review,\u201d 590 F.2d at 632, <em>citing, inter alia, Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, </em>401 U.S. 402, 410, 91 S.Ct. 814, 820, 28 L.Ed.2d 136 (1971). This assumption is likewise quoted by the only one of the three appellate cases following <em>Wayne State </em>which devotes more than two paragraphs to this issue, <em>see University of Maryland v. Cleland, </em>621 F.2d at 100. Subsequent Supreme Court authority makes clear, however, that a \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d test, in the normal sense in which we and other courts had interpreted that phrase, does not apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADd7\">This Court has ... never applied the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard in the strict evidentiary sense the Court of Appeals thought necessary in this case. Rather, the Court has found the standard met, and the presumption favoring judicial review overcome, whenever the congressional intent to preclude judicial review is \u201cfairly discernible in the statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Data Processing Service v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. at 157 [90 S.Ct. at 832]. In the context of preclusion analysis, the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard is not a rigid eviden-tiary test but a useful reminder to courts that, where substantial doubt about the congressional intent exists, the general presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action is controlling. That presumption does not control in cases such as this one, however, since the congressional intent to preclude judicial review is \u201cfairly discernible\u201d in the detail of the legislative scheme.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-9\"><em>Community Nutrition Institute v. Block, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2457.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">Even apart from its faulty assumption, the reasoning of <em>Wayne State </em>is wanting. It rests its conclusion upon an analysis it claims to derive from <em>Johnson v. Robison, supra, </em>in which the Supreme Court found that \u00a7 211(a) did not bar judicial review of the claim that a portion of the VA statute was unconstitutional. As the <em>Wayne State </em>court interpreted <em>Robison, </em>the Supreme Court reached its conclusion by analyzing the purposes of \u00a7 211(a) and finding that review of adjudications to ascertain whether they were based on an unconstitutional statute would not be contrary to those purposes. But that is not so.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The <em>Robison </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>opinion did not proceed immediately to the issue of whether review would offend the policies of \u00a7 211(a), but began where one ordinarily begins, with the <em>language </em>of the statute. It found that the phrase \u201cdecisions of the Administrator\u201d in \u00a7 211(a) did not appear to apply to review of the constitutionality of the statute under which the Administrator acted, since the terms of the statute were decisions not of the Administrator, but of Congress. 415 U.S. at 367, 94 S.Ct. at 1165. It adduced support for this conclusion from the VA\u2019s practice of refusing to consider the constitutionality of its governing laws on the ground that it lacked authority to do so, a principle generally accepted by other agencies and authorities as well. <em>Id. </em>at 367-68, 94 S.Ct. at 1165-66. Only then, <em>after </em>having assessed the reasonable meaning of the statutory text, did the Court reach a discussion of the policies underlying the statute, introducing that discussion as follows: \u201cNor does the legislative history accompanying the 1970 amendment of \u00a7 211(a) demonstrate a congressional intention to bar judicial review even of constitutional questions.\u201d 415 U.S. at 368, 94 S.Ct. at 1166. As the Supreme Court described its <em>Robison </em>holding in a later case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-4\">We were required to resolve whether this language [of \u00a7 211(a)] precluded an attack on the constitutionality of a statutory limitation. We concluded that it did not, basically because such a limitation was not a \u201cdecision\u201d of the Administrator \u201con any question of law or fact\u201d; indeed, the \u201cdecision\u201d had been made by Congress, not the Administrator, and the issue was one which the Administrator considered to be beyond his jurisdiction ____ Thus the question sought to be litigated was simply not within \u00a7 211(a)\u2019s express language____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-9\"><em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. at 761, 95 S.Ct. at 2465.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">The <em>Wayne State </em>court suggests no similar basis for excluding from the express language decisions regarding regulations\u2019 compliance with statutory requirements. These are assuredly decisions that can and indeed must be made by the Administrator himself. In the absence of a term in the statute permitting such a distinction, all the policy analysis in the world cannot persuade us that \u00a7 211(a)\u2019s bar applies to one sort of review and not another.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-11\">Finally, a powerful analytical objection to the proposed interpretation is that there is no principled reason to limit it to review of regulations. Once it is conceded that the phrase \u201cdecisions ... under any law administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration\u201d does not cover a decision that is <em>ultra vires, </em>there is no basis for declining to review the proper authority (whatever that vague term may mean) for adjudications as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>well. No one thinks that is permissible under \u00a7 211(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">\n<em>The Contentions of the Dissent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">The dissent misreads the legislative history, as our discussion above adequately indicates. Beyond that, however, the dissent uses the legislative history \u2014 as it uses the dicta of <em>Robison </em>\u2014 not to clarify any ambiguity in the statute, but to create a meaning which it never seeks to relate to the text of the statute, and which in fact the text simply will not bear. Only one interpretation of the statutory language other than that which we have adopted is conceivable. It can be argued, contrary to our discussion at pages 906-07, <em>supra, </em>that the phrase \u201cunder any law administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration\u201d modifies the phrase \u201cquestion of law or fact\u201d rather than the word \u201cdecisions,\u201d with the consequence that not all decisions of the Administrator in the course of applying the VA statutes are included, but only those decisions specifically relating to the interpretation or coverage of those statutes. But as we have noted, if that were the correct interpretation, then decisions regarding the application of APA procedures (which is not a question of law under the VA statutes) would be reviewable in adjudications as well as in rulemakings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In order to avoid this consequence, the dissent must import into \u00a7 211(a) an additional limitation \u2014 to wit, limitation of the preclusion of judicial review to individual adjudications as opposed to rulemakings. There is simply no language in the statute on which such a restriction can be hung; in fact, the phrase \u201cdecisions on any question <em>of law </em>\u201d positively tends to negate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">There is, moreover, another factor that contradicts both the dissent\u2019s application of its implausible textual interpretation to this case and its imported extratextual limitation: For simplicity\u2019s sake, we have been speaking as though the issue before us was the application of APA procedures to this alleged rulemaking. <em>See </em>note 2, <em>supra. </em>In fact, however, the APA rulemaking requirements do not apply, since the APA specifically excludes from its rulemaking provisions rules relating to government benefits. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(a). What is technically at issue is the VA\u2019s failure to comply with its own veterans\u2019 benefit regulations, <em>see </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.12 (1984), which of course did not repeal the \u201cgovernment benefits\u201d exception of the APA, but merely adopted the substance of the APA provisions <em>as requirements under the veterans\u2019 benefit statutes. </em>Compliance with those requirements thus presents, technically, a question of law under the veterans\u2019 benefit statutes rather than under the APA. Hence, one cannot argue that review is proper <em>in this case </em>even if one believes that \u00a7 211(a) is limited as the dissent asserts.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The statutory exemption of veter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>ans\u2019 benefits from APA rulemaking requirements also suggests the invalidity of the attempt to limit \u00a7 211(a) to individual adjudications. It is implausible, to say the least, that Congress should have taken such care (unexpressed though it might have been) to single out VA rulemaking procedures, as opposed to VA adjudicatory procedures, for judicial review while at the same time exempting VA rulemaking (though not adjudication) from procedural requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">The dissent\u2019s citations to case authority suffer from the fact that the cases permitting review do not set forth the precise rationale of reviewability adopted by the dissent, nor (as our discussion above has indicated) any intelligible theory of their own \u2014 vacillating among theories that all rulemaking is exempt, <em>e.g., University of Maryland v. Cleland, </em>621 F.2d 98, 101 (4th Cir.1980); <em>Merged Area X (Education) v. Cleland, </em>604 F.2d 1075, 1078 (8th Cir.1979), that only <em>ultra vires </em>rules are exempt, <em>e.g., Wayne State University v. Cleland, </em>590 F.2d 627, 631-32 (6th Cir.1978), and that all unconstitutional action is exempt, <em>e.g., De-vine v. Cleland, </em>616 F.2d 1080, 1084-85 (9th Cir.1980); <em>Plato v. Roudebush, </em>397 F.Supp. 1295, 1302-03 (D.Md.1975). We may note in this connection that the dissent\u2019s allusion to the \u201cserious constitutional problems\u201d which our interpretation entails, Dissent at 921, forms no basis for distinguishing the dissent\u2019s position from our own. If it is a proposition of law that constitutional challenges cannot be excluded from the courts, <em>but see Ex parte McCardle, </em>74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 506, 19 L.Ed. 264 (1869), exceptions would have to be made to the dissent\u2019s interpretation of the statute as well as to our own \u2014 for surely a constitutional issue may arise in the course of adjudications, which are excluded from review even under the dissent\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">A brief word is necessary concerning the dissent\u2019s use of what has become known (with a disappointing lack of sense for the paradoxical) as \u201csubsequent legislative his<em>tory\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., legislative \u201chistory\u201d that postdates the statute in question. The dissent notes that the Senate-passed version of the recently enacted Veterans\u2019 Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act, <em>see </em>note 4, <em>supra, </em>provided that the VA\u2019s rules on radiation compensation standards would be subject to judicial review; and that this provision \u201cwas eventually dropped on the explicit assumption of its leading proponent [Sen. Simpson], relayed to the Senate, that judicial review ... was already available under section 211(a).\u201d Dissent at 926. It seems to us that the use by Senator Simpson and other members of his committee of self-created legislative history to achieve the result they were unable to obtain through the legislative process is precisely the sort of \u201chistory\u201d we should steadfastly reject. If Congress as a whole indeed agreed that judicial review was already available, how to explain Senator Cranston\u2019s statement that \u201c[a]s our negotiations with the House committee on this legislation progressed ... I become [sic] concerned that permanently holding firm to my position on including an express reference to access to court review might prevent our ever reaching an overall compromise\u201d? 130 Cong.Rec. S13598 (daily ed. Oct. 4, 1984). <em>See also </em>130 Cong.Rec. H11160 (daily ed. Oct. 3, 1984) (statement of Rep. Hammerschmidt) (compromise between House and Senate on Dioxin and Radiation Act possible only because \u201c[t]he Senate ... recede[d] from its position on judicial review\u201d). It is difficult to believe that the House would be so adamant about the impropriety of reciting law that already existed \u2014 or that if the adverse implications of redundancy were its only concern, a statement similar to Senator Simpson\u2019s would not have appeared in the record of the House proceedings. From the standpoint of the dissent\u2019s case, one must consider the legislative history of the recent enactment to be at best non-probative, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>more likely an indication that Congress does not desire review of VA rulemaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Finally, we may respond to the dissent\u2019s assertions that \u201cCongress ... relied in its 1984 legislation on the <em>Administrator\u2019s </em>opinion that section 211(a) does not preclude judicial review of unlawfully promulgated VA rules,\u201d Dissent at 927, and that \u201cthe Administrator has <em>consistently </em>indicated to Congress that the no-review clause does not ... preclude judicial review ... [whenever the VA makes any] \u2018decision\u2019 relating to veterans\u2019 benefits law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 928 (emphasis added). As our earlier discussion has indicated, in failing to write a provision for judicial review into the Dioxin and Radiation Act, Congress appears to have relied, not on the Administrator\u2019s \u201cclearcut ... interpretation of section 211(a),\u201d <em>id. </em>at 928, but on the House\u2019s clearcut insistence that it would not pass a bill which included a judicial review provision. Moreover, the word \u201cconsistently\u201d is singularly inappropriate to describe the Administrator\u2019s position over the past 30 years. Of the seven position statements cited by the dissent, Dissent at 927-28, one states that \u201cVA ... regulations <em>in excess of lawful authority </em>\u201d are reviewable, 130 Cong.Rec. S13600 (daily ed. Oct. 4, 1984) (statement of Sen. Cranston, quoting VA Administrator Walters) (emphasis added); a second states that <em>all </em>regulations and \u201c \u2018substantive Agency actions of broad, binding application\u2019 \u201d are reviewable, Letter from Administrator Robert Nimmo to Sen. Alan Cranston (Mar. 29, 1982), <em>reprinted in </em>130 Cong.Rec. S6160 (daily ed. May 22, 1984); a third and fourth suggest, if anything, that review of regulations is precluded by \u00a7 211(a), S.Rep. No. 178, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 93 (1979); H.R.Rep. No. 1166, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 23-24 (1970); a fifth and sixth simply cite cases allowing review of <em>constitutional </em>challenges to VA statutes, rulemakings or adjudications, and endorse legislation explicitly providing for such review, <em>FY 78 Legislative Recommendations of Veterans\u2019 Organizations: Hearings Before the Senate Comm, on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, </em>95th Cong., 2d Sess. 382-83 (1978); <em>VA Administrative Procedure and Judicial Review Act: Hearings Before the Senate Comm. on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, </em>95th Cong., 1st Sess. 6-9 (1977); and the seventh merely notes the (pre-1970) statute\u2019s preclusion of review of individual claims in the course of opposing legislation that would allow review of benefit determinations, <em>Hearings on H.R. 360, 478, 2443 and 6772 Before a Subcomm. of the House Comm. on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, </em>82d Cong., 2d Sess. 1962-63 (1952). Thus, all except the first two are entirely compatible with our holding here, and not a single one reflects the position of the dissent that both constitutional challenges and challenges to APA rulemaking procedures (but not the <em>substance </em>of rules) are permissible. In any case, it is fanciful to regard these diverse pronouncements as a \u201cconsistent\u201d endorsement of anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">The dissent \u201csimply cannot believe that section 211(a) was intended to allow the VA to defy with impunity the traditional, government-wide constraints on agency action\u201d as far as <em>rulemaking </em>is concerned, Dissent at 919 n. 3. Yet it is forced to accept precisely that conclusion (if one considers the absence of judicial review to constitute \u201cimpunity\u201d) with respect to VA <em>adjudications </em>\u2014even though individualized determinations have traditionally been accorded <em>more </em>rather than <em>less </em>judicial protection against agency error than generally applicable rules. <em>Compare Bi-Metallic Investment Co. v. State Board of Equalization, </em>239 U.S. 441, 36 S.Ct. 141, 60 L.Ed. 372 (1915), <em>with Londoner v. Denver, </em>210 U.S. 373, 28 S.Ct. 708, 52 L.Ed. 1103 (1908). <em>See United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. FPC, </em>181 F.2d 796, 798-99 (D.C.Cir.1950). It seems to us that what is truly incomprehensible to the dissent, and to those courts that have improvised assorted nonstatutory limitations upon the scope of \u00a7 211(a), is not the nonreviewability of rules or of APA rule-making procedures in particular, but rather the whole concept of a system of administrative justice, even in a field of government benefits, without general judicial supervision. That concept, however, is pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>cisely what the veterans\u2019 benefit laws enacted, plainly rejecting the judicialization, and even'the lawyerization, of this field. It is reflected not merely in \u00a7 211(a), whose predecessor was first enacted in 1933, <em>see </em>pages 907-08, supra, but in other venerable provisions permitting claimants to be represented by \u201cthe American National Red Cross, the American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, the United Spanish War Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and such other organizations as [the Administrator] may approve,\u201d to which organizations \u201c[t]he Administrator may, in his discretion, furnish, if available, space and office facilities,\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3402(a) (1982) <em>(see </em>ch. 867, \u00a7 200, 49 Stat. 2031 (1936)); and prohibiting any attorney or other person from charging a veteran for assisting in the presentation of his claim, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3403, with compensation payable to such persons by the Administrator limited to \u201c$10 with respect to any one claim,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 3404(c)(2) <em>(see </em>ch. 234, \u00a7 31, 17 Stat. 575 (1873)).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">The scheme envisioned by the legislation is, for modern times at least, concededly an extraordinary one: that an agency which is designed and intended to have the interests of the veterans at heart will dispose of matters relating to their claims in a manner different from the adversarial process familiar to the courts, with a minimum of formality, with assistance from veterans\u2019 organizations, without assistance from compensated lawyers, and with finality. That scheme, and particularly its exclusion of paid counsel and of judicial review, have drawn sharp criticism from some respected quarters. <em>See, e.g., </em>102 Reports of the American Bar Association 533-34 (1983). On the other hand, a recent and much praised treatise based upon a study of the government\u2019s most extensive individual benefits program, the social security disability program, which has adopted full-scale adversarial process and judicial appeal, concludes that \u201cfundamental reasons ... prevent judicial review from having a major beneficial impact on the quality of administrative justice in the Social Security system,\u201d J. Mashaw, Bureaucratic Justice 185 (1983), and observes that the VA system has \u201cmanaged to maintain an acceptable level of satisfaction with its process without significant use of oral hearings, without employing independent ALJs, and without subjecting its judgments to judicial review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">Whatever the pros and cons of that argument, may be, short of the point at which the exclusion of judicial involvement becomes unconstitutional (which is not even asserted here), the debate is to be conducted before Congress, and resolution against the presently prescribed system is to be effected by statutory amendment rather than judicial gerrymandering of the existing provisions. As the Supreme Court made clear in <em>Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2457, our function in cases such as this is not to devise plausible ways of depriving statutory language of its apparent meaning, but rather to give honest effect to the \u201cfairly discernible\u201d intent of Congress to preclude judicial review. There is no indication in the text of the statute that rulemaking is excluded from what some regard as this unthinkable prohibition. Both the language of \u00a7 211(a) and the reason of the matter leave no doubt in our mind that decisions of the Administrator regarding rules applicable in claims adjudications occupy no different status, insofar as judicial review is concerned, than the claims adjudications themselves, and specifically are not reviewable for procedural deficiencies. Accordingly, we vacate the District Court\u2019s entry of summary judgment and remand this case with instructions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b976-9\">. The requirement that substantive rules be published in the Federal Register is contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 (1982), generally known as the Freedom of Information Act. It antedates most of the other provisions of that section, however, and was (in slightly different form) \u00a7 3(a)(3) of the original Administrative Procedure Act. 60 Stat. 238, ch. 324 (1946). Also unlike most of the other provisions of that section, it establishes a procedural prerequisite for the validity of agency action. In this opinion, therefore, we do not adopt the plaintiffs\u2019 characterization of their nonpublication claim as an alleged violation of the Freedom of Information Act, but rather of the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b976-10\">.

That is not clear. While the Administrator will presumably decide to use the new regulations to redetermine claims previously adjudicated by use of the documents and methodologies here under challenge, the legislation does not of its own force affect those earlier adjudications, nor does it explicitly require benefits to be paid retroactively. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3010(a) (1982), providing that as a general rule \"the effective date of an award based on ... a claim reopened after final adjudication ... shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of application therefor.\u201d The prayer for relief in the present case, by contrast, requests the court to \"[djeclare that ... decisions denying disability and death benefit claims ... in accordance with the unlawfully promulgated rules are null and void,\u201d J.A. 33-34; and the District Court in effect granted this relief, declaring that \u201d[c]laims decisions such as these based on invalid rules are not <em>res judicata,\" </em>and that the VA must \"treat any new claims filed by plaintiffs as dating back to when the original claim was filed.\u201d <em>Gott v.

It is not the case, as the dissent asserts, that the adjudicatory procedures specified in the veterans\u2019 benefits laws displace the otherwise applicable provisions of the APA. <em>See </em>Dissent at 919 n. 3. Since displacement of the APA by implication is disfavored, <em>see 5 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 559, those APA informal adjudication requirements that do not conflict with what the VA statutes provide are assuredly not superseded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b985-8\">. The dissent's response to this is that \"the Administrator\u2019s selective defiance of [his] regulations\u201d is \u201cno more related to any provision of the veterans\u2019 benefit statutes than a VA decision to defy the APA\u2019s notice and comment provisions in this case but not the next.\u201d Dissent at 919 n. 3. This suggests that the dissent\u2019s test for establishing that agency action is taken \"under\" the VA statutes for purposes of the judicial review provision is even more uncertain (and more restrictive) than we had supposed. Evidently it is not only insufficient that the action was taken in the course of administering those statutes; but it is also not enough that the provision allegedly violated (here, the rulemaking requirement) was imposed by or under those statutes. Rather, the test seems to be whether <em>evaluation of the violation </em>depends upon some specific provision of those statutes rather than upon some more general principle of law (in the present case, the principle that an agency must comply with its own regulations). It is hard to square this with the dissent\u2019s simultaneous assertion that review for compliance with the APA\u2019s evidentiary requirements, or with the APA\u2019s \"arbitrary or capricious\u201d standard is a \"spectre\u201d entirely of our imagination. Dissent at 920 n. 4. Surely the determination that a particular piece of evidence credited by the agency was entirely unreliable would be based upon general principles of law rather than upon anything peculiar to the VA statutes; similarly, the determination that a particular rule is arbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>trary because it inexplicably contradicts another rule. We confess that our comprehension of the line the dissent wishes to draw is inadequate for any purpose except the conclusion that it makes no policy sense and is assuredly not to be found in the text of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b988-8\">WALD, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AgQU\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">In 1979, the Veterans\u2019 Administration (\u201cVA\u201d) issued three documents concerning the standards and procedures for determining when veterans exposed to radiation by the United States Government are entitled to VA disability benefits. In 1981, the plaintiffs sought a judicial ruling that these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>documents were agency \u201crules\u201d subject to the notice and comment provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553. The district court, noting that the plaintiffs did not seek review of actual individual benefit determinations, agreed that the documents were rules under the APA, invalidated the rules for failure to comply with the APA\u2019s notice and comment provisions, and ordered a formal rulemaking concerning radiation exposure methodology. On appeal, the VA argued that the documents at issue were merely informational guidelines that did not function as agency rules in benefit determinations and were thus not subject to APA rulemaking procedures.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">The majority now finds it unnecessary to decide that issue because it holds that 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211(a) precludes judicial review of virtually <em>all </em>VA decisionmaking pertaining to veterans\u2019 benefits, even a rulemaking conducted in a manner admittedly violative of APA procedures. In my view, the radiation exposure methodology employed by the VA in one of the challenged documents constitutes a \u201crule\u201d within the meaning of section 2(c) of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(4). And I do not agree that section 211(a) \u2014 as interpreted by the Supreme Court in <em>Johnson v. Robison, </em>415 U.S. 361, 94 S.Ct. 1160, 39 L.Ed.2d 389 (1974) \u2014 precludes review of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that such a rule was promulgated in violation of the APA\u2019s procedural requirements. No reliable indicator of congressional purpose identified in <em>Robison </em>suggests an intent to preclude the limited judicial scrutiny sought in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Notwithstanding the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>Court\u2019s recent admonition that courts must not be overly fastidious in requiring \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d to find congressional intent to preclude judicial review, <em>see Block v. Community Nutritional Inst., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2450, 2456, 81 L.Ed.2d 270 (1984), \u201cwhere substantial doubt about the congressional intent exists, the general presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action is controlling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2457; <em>see also Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, </em>387 U.S. 136, 141, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1511, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967). Here I find nothing in the .language, purpose, legislative history or overall structure of section 211(a) that evinces the \u201cfairly discernible,\u201d <em>Block, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2457, congressional intent necessary to overcome the general presumption favoring judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">I. The \u201cPlain Meaning\u201d of the No-Review Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">Our inquiry begins with the language of the statute. <em>See, e.g., Robison, </em>415 U.S. at 367, 94 S.Ct. at 1165. Section 211(a) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-8\">the <em>decisions </em>of the Administrator on any question of law or fact <em>under any law </em>administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration <em>providing benefits </em>for veterans and their dependents or survivors shall be final and conclusive and no other official or any court of the United States shall have power or jurisdiction to review any such decision by an action in the nature of mandamus or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211(a) (emphasis added). The majority reads this language as <em>expressly </em>precluding judicial review whenever the Administrator makes <em>any </em>\u201cdecision\u201d on <em>any </em>question (either of law or fact) <em>relating to </em>the administration of veterans\u2019 benefits law. <em>See </em>Maj.Op. at p. 907. (\u201cAll that is necessary for \u00a7 211(a) to apply is the question of law or fact have been decided by the Administrator, and that the decision have been made <em>in the course of </em>applying the veterans\u2019 benefit statutes.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-12\">The <em>Robison </em>Court, however, indicated that the express language of section 211(a) does not unambiguously admit of the sweeping interpretation urged by the majority. <em>Robison </em>held that section 211(a) does not bar review of constitutional challenges to provisions of the veterans\u2019 benefits laws. Unlike the majority opinion, however, the <em>Robison </em>Court did not conclude that Congress\u2019 intent to preclude judicial review of VA actions depended solely on whether the disputed action resulted from an actual \u201cdecision[ ] of the Administrator.\u201d Instead, the Court explained that the no-review clause applied to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"auu-dedup-0\">\u201cthe <em>decisions </em>of the Administrator on any question of law or fact <em>under </em>any law administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration providing benefits for veterans\u201d ____ The prohibitions would appear to be aimed at review only of those decisions of law or fact that arise in the <em>administration </em>by the Veterans\u2019 Administration of a <em>statute </em>providing benefits for veterans. A decision of law or fact \u201cunder\u201d a statute is made by the Administrator in the interpretation or application of a particular provision of the statute to a particular set of facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b990-14\"><em>Robison, </em>415 U.S. at 367, 94 S.Ct. at 1165 (quoting 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211(a)) (emphasis in original); <em>see also id. </em>at 372, 94 S.Ct. at 1168 (noting that section 211(a) was designed to prevent courts from becoming \u201cinvolved ... in a day-to-day determination and interpretation of Veterans\u2019 Administration policy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-15\">The <em>Robison </em>Court\u2019s reading of section 211(a) thus recognizes at least two interpretations of the no-review clause that would permit judicial review in this case. First, the Court indicated that the applicability of section 211(a) depends not only on whether a VA action results from a \u201cdecision\u201d by the Administrator, but also on whether such a decision was made in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>course of a <em>particular application of a veterans\u2019 benefits statute to a specific factual claim. See Arnolds v. Veterans Admin., </em>507 F.Supp. 128, 130 (N.D.Ill.1981). In doing so, the Court recognized that the express terms of section 211(a) can <em>plausibly </em>be interpreted to preclude judicial review only of those VA decisions applying veterans\u2019 benefits law to actual, fact-bound benefit determinations. <em>See, e.g., University of Maryland v. Cleland, </em>621 F.2d 98, 100-01 (4th Cir.1980); <em>Wayne State Univ. v. Cleland, </em>590 F.2d 627, 631-32 (6th Cir. 1978); <em>cf. Kirkhuff v. Nimmo, </em>683 F.2d 544, 547 (D.C.Cir.1982) (acknowledging this ambiguity in the express terms of section 211(a)). The plaintiffs in this case, of course, do not challenge any actual application of veterans\u2019 benefits law to facts of individual claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">Second, the <em>Robison </em>Court emphasized that section 211(a) can plausibly be read to bar review only where the Administrator makes a decision (of law or fact) <em>under </em>a law, <em>administered </em>by the VA, <em>providing </em>veterans\u2019 benefits. The Administrator\u2019s decision challenged here, in turn, was not made under any law administered by the VA that provides veterans\u2019 benefits. The plaintiffs do not challenge the substance or application of the particular radiation standards adopted; neither do they seek review of the VA\u2019s \u201cdecision\u201d to adopt agencywide standards in the first place. Instead, the only decision at issue here is the Administrator\u2019s decision to deploy agencywide rules <em>without </em>undertaking the notice and comment procedures required by the APA as unequivocally adopted by the VA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In other words, the plaintiffs only seek review of a VA decision interpreting the scope and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>applicability of the APA\u2019s procedural requirements, and the APA, in turn, is certainly not a law administered by the VA that provides for veterans\u2019 benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">The majority nonetheless argues that if we were to limit the preclusion clause to decisions of the Administrator made \u201cunder\u201d veterans\u2019 benefit laws and allow review of VA decisions interpreting the APA, we would have to allow judicial review of individual benefit determinations to ensure that VA evidentiary assessments were not \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d in violation of the APA. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). This is plainly not so. The Administrator\u2019s factual findings and ultimate assessment of the evidence in individual claim adjudications are unmistakably governed by specific, substantive provisions of the veterans\u2019 benefits statutes themselves. <em>See </em>Veterans\u2019 Compensation Act \u00a7 2(13), 98 Stat. at 2726 (requiring the VA to give the claimant the benefit of the doubt in resolving close cases of service connection); <em>see also </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.102 (1984). Although the veterans\u2019 benefit laws in no way \u201cdisplace\u201d otherwise applicable APA provisions, a court could not revi\u00e9w a VA claim adjudication without reviewing a decision of the Administrator involving the interpretation or application of a substantive legal provision of the VA\u2019s organic statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Although the standard of review would be drawn from the APA, the only VA \u201cdecision\u201d under review in that case would be the Administrator\u2019s ' decision to grant or deny benefits pursuant to a provision of the veterans\u2019 benefits laws. That decision, in turn, is clearly \u201ctypical of fact-specific questions that Congress left to the expertise and shielded from judicial scrutiny by section 211(a).\u201d <em>Carter v. Cleland, </em>643 F.2d 1, 19 (D.C.Cir.1980). The APA\u2019s rule-making provisions, by contrast, impose duties on an agency that are independent of the standards contained in the agency\u2019s organic statute. Judicial review to ensure compliance with APA notice and comment procedures will thus not entail court scrutiny of any VA decision concerning its responsibilities under the veterans\u2019 benefit laws themselves as would arbitrary and capricious review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">Nothing in the language of section 211(a) suggests that Congress intended to shield from judicial review all VA interpretations of statutes such as the APA that do not provide veterans\u2019 benefits and are applicable to agencies throughout the executive branch. Indeed, the majority concedes that section 211(a) does not bar \u201cissues of law decided ... in the course of applying independently operative statutes such as the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act [FOIA] not related to the procedure for administrative decisionmaking.\u201d Maj.Op. at p. 907. But the majority would bar review of all interpretations of the APA by the VA regardless of how distorted or freakish they might be. It is by no means obvious to me why section 211(a) dictates that the Administrator\u2019s decisions interpreting, say, FOIA\u2019s exemption for internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>agency decisionmaking concerning veterans\u2019 benefits law, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(5), are reviewable, while his decisions as to whether notice and comment are required in a rulemaking under the APA, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(4), are not. No such refined distinction emerges from the plain language of that section. And there is certainly no indication that Congress intended to establish the VA as the final arbiter of every government-wide statute \u2014 a result that would raise substantial constitutional questions. <em>Cf. Robison, </em>415 U.S. at 366-67 &amp; n. 8, 94 S.Ct. at 1165-66 &amp; n. 8 (noting that section 211(a) should be interpreted to avoid such constitutional questions). At the very least, these plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to vindicate an interest in procedural regularity under the APA is plausibly outside the scope of section 211(a)\u2019s express language. <em>Cf. National Ass\u2019n of Home Health Agencies v. Schweiker, </em>690 F.2d 932, 936-37 (D.C.Cir.1982) (holding that preclusion provision in the Social Security Act does not bar suits challenging the Secretary\u2019s failure to comply with the notice and comment provisions of the APA), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1205, 103 S.Ct. 1193, 75 L.Ed.2d 438 (1983); <em>Humana of South Carolina, Inc. v. Califano, </em>590 F.2d 1070, 1080-82 (D.C. Cir.1978) (same).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">The majority\u2019s sweeping reading of section 211(a) to bar every lawsuit concerning veterans\u2019 benefits other than a direct constitutional challenge to VA legislation breeds other serious constitutional problems as well. Suppose, for example, the VA decided to issue regulations retroactively terminating class-wide benefits without affording the affected claimants any procedural protection. In the absence of section 211(a), a federal court would certainly have jurisdiction to determine the process due the adversely affected individuals under the fifth amendment and the relevant veterans\u2019 benefits statutes. <em>Cf. Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 326-32, 96 S.Ct. 893, 898-901, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). The majority says section 211(a) would preclude judicial review of any such VA action; a class-wide termination regulation, after all, constitutes a decision of the Administrator made in the course of applying veterans\u2019 benefits law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Yet this circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>has clearly indicated that <em>Robison </em>compels a court to reject strictly literalist interpretations of no-review clauses that would preclude judicial review of constitutional challenges to agency procedures.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-4\">[I]f legislation by Congress purporting to prevent judicial review of the constitutionality of its own actions is itself constitutionally suspect, legislation that frees an administrative agency from judicial scrutiny of its adherence to the dictates of the Constitution must pose grave constitutional questions as well. Not only is it daring to suggest that Congress, though subject to the checks and balances of the Constitution, may create a subordinate body free from those constraints; it also beggars the imagination to suggest that judicial review might be less crucial to assuring the integrity of administrative action than it is to make certain that Congress will operate within its proper sphere. If the courts are disabled from requiring administrative officials to act constitutionally, it is difficult to see who would perform that function. We say that a statute purporting to foreclose judicial redress of constitutional violations allegedly perpetrated by an administrative agency must be construed in accordance with the standards articulated in <em>Johnson v. Robison.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-5\"><em>Ralpho v. Bell, </em>569 F.2d 607, 620 (D.C.Cir. 1977) (footnotes omitted); <em>see also Carter v. Cleland, </em>643 F.2d 1, 5 (D.C.Cir.1980) (discussing <em>Ralpho </em>in the context of section 211(a)). The majority casts aside these concerns on the ground that Congress plainly meant it to be so. <em>See </em>Maj.Op. at p. 914. Yet I see manifest ambiguities in the express terms of the no-review clause. And <em>Robison </em>and <em>Ralpho </em>direct us to avoid, whenever possible, sweeping \u201cplain language\u201d constructions of no-review provisions such as the majority\u2019s without first undertaking a searching inquiry into congressional intent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">On balance, then, the argument that the plain language of section 211(a) bars review here ignores patent ambiguities in the statute, substantial constitutional and practical difficulties, and the established presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative action. Faced with these countervailing factors, we should not rest our decision solely on an assertion that the express statutory language of section 211(a) can plausibly be read to preclude review whenever the Administrator makes a decision relating .to veterans\u2019 benefits law. Instead, we are directed to examine the history, purpose and overall structure of section 211(a) in order to determine whether Congress expressed a sufficiently clear intent to overcome the general presumption in favor of judicial review. <em>See Block, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2456.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">II. Section 211(a)\u2019s Legislative History</p>\n<p id=\"AJUC\">Nothing in the purposes or history of section 211(a), in turn, indicates that Congress sought to bar review of an unlawfully promulgated VA rulemaking. To begin with, the <em>Robison </em>Court authoritatively determined that Congress enacted section 211(a) to serve \u201ctwo primary purposes: (1) to insure that veterans\u2019 benefits claims will not burden the courts and the Veterans\u2019 Administration with expensive and time-consuming litigation, and (2) to insure that technical and complex determinations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>applications of Veterans\u2019 Administration policy connected with veterans\u2019 benefits decisions will be adequately and uniformly made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>415 U.S. at 370, 94 S.Ct. at 1167. Judicial review aimed at ensuring VA compliance with the notice and comment provisions of the APA will not contravene either purpose. <em>See generally Evergreen State College v. Cleland, </em>621 F.2d 1002, 1007-08 (9th Cir.1980). Determining the single issue of whether the VA\u2019s radiation methodology constitutes a rule subject to APA procedures will not \u201clead to an inevitable increase in litigation with consequent burdens of the courts and the Veterans\u2019 Administration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>415 U.S. at 371, 94 S.Ct. at 1168. As the district court rightly noted, the plaintiffs do not seek review of individual benefit determinations and they do not challenge the substance of the alleged rules. <em>See Gott v. Nimmo, </em>No. 80-0906, slip op. at 3 (D.D.C. Feb. 17,1982). The only issue raised in this appeal concerns the VA\u2019s responsibility to comply with the notice and comment provisions of the APA \u2014 a matter of procedure and practice common to all members of the relevant class. No rash of litigation will be spawned by our review of this limited, though important, issue. <em>Cf. Wayne State, </em>621 F.2d at 632; <em>Plato v. Roudebush, </em>397 F.Supp. 1295, 1303 (D.Md.1975); <em>see generally </em>Morris, <em>Judicial Review of Non-Reviewable Administrative Action: Veterans Administration Benefits Claims, </em>29 Ad.L.Rev. 65, 68-70, 84-85 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">The majority nonetheless insists that review of this claim will necessarily entangle the judiciary in the day-to-day operations of the VA because courts will have to ensure that the VA complies with any invalidation of its rules. <em>See </em>Maj.Op. at p. 910 (\u201cOur order is a vain act ... <em>unless we can review subsequent adjudications for compliance.\u201d) </em>(emphasis in original). But that is not necessarily so. To the extent that judicial invalidation of the challenged VA standards results in a formal rulemaking, we will ensure that the plaintiffs in this case (various veterans and veterans\u2019 groups) participate, through the notice and comment provisions of the APA, in the formulation of agencywide radiation exposure standards. It is <em>precisely </em>this independent interest in notice and participation that the plaintiffs assert in this case, <em>see Complaint </em>111176-79, 82-83, that the district court found violated by the VA\u2019s actions, <em>see Gott v. Cleland, </em>No. 80-0906, slip op. at 4-5 (D.D.C. Feb. 17, 1982), and that the rulemaking provisions of the APA are designed to protect, <em>see, e.g., Batterton v. Marshall, </em>648 F.2d 694, 703 (D.C.Cir.1980); <em>Pickus v. United States Bd. of Parole, </em>507 F.2d 1107, 1112 (D.C.Cir.1974). Indeed, Congress unequivocally affirmed this independent, class-wide interest in notice and participation in its recent passage of the Veterans Compensation Act which explicitly requires a public, APA rulemaking concerning some radiation exposure standards. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5(c), 98 Stat. at 2729; <em>see also supra </em>note 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">The review sought here will likewise not violate the second purpose of section 211(a); it will not, that is, involve the courts in the substantive complexities of VA policymaking or pose any threat to the uniformity of VA decisionmaking. The plaintiffs in this case do not seek review of a VA factfinding, an interpretation of any veterans\u2019 benefits statute, or an application of a veterans\u2019 benefits law to any particular factual situation. Because those matters are neither threatened nor contested here, judicial review of the VA\u2019s adherence to the rulemaking provisions of the APA will not involve the courts in the agency\u2019s expert functions. <em>See Wayne State, </em>590 F.2d at 331; <em>Plato, </em>397 F.Supp. at 1303; <em>cf. Home Health, </em>690 F.2d at 940-41 (noting that review of medicare regulations to ensure compliance with APA procedures is unrelated to disbursement disputes and therefore will not intrude upon agency expertise); <em>see generally </em>Note, <em>Congressional Preclusion of Judicial Review of Federal Benefit Determinations: Reasserting Separation of Powers, </em>97 Harv.L.Rev. 778, 793-94 (1984). Indeed, determining whether the VA\u2019s radiation exposure methodologies are \u201crules\u201d subject to the APA is peculiarly within the competence of the ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>diciary. <em>Cf. Robison, </em>415 U.S. at 368, 94 S.Ct. at 1166 (noting that constitutional challenges do not implicate agency expertise); Note, 97 Harv.L.Rev. at 794-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">Moreover, the majority cannot point to \u201cspecific legislative history,\u201d <em>Block, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2456, indicating a congressional intent to preclude judicial review of an unlawfully promulgated VA rule. Prior to 1970, section 211(a) read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-5\">The decisions of the Administrator on any question of law or fact <em>concerning a claim for benefits or payments </em>under any law administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration shall be final and conclusive and no other official or any court of the United States shall have power to review any such decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">72 Stat. 1115 (1958) (emphasis supplied). This version of section 211(a) strongly supports the view that the provision was primarily intended to bar judicial review of individual benefit decisions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">The majority suggests that the \u201cnatural conclusion\u201d arising from Congress\u2019 removal of the phrase \u201cconcerning a claim for benefits or payments\u201d is that Congress intended to extend the no-review clause to cover any kind of VA decision \u201crelating to\u201d veterans\u2019 benefits. <em>See </em>Maj.Op. at pp. 908 -09. Yet the <em>Robison </em>Court expressly concluded that the <em>only </em>clear purpose of the amendment was to overrule an erroneous judicial interpretation of the pre-1970 statute. <em>See Robison, </em>415 U.S. at 371-74, 94 S.Ct. at 1167-69. In a series of cases beginning in 1958, this court had held that certain <em>individual </em>claims determinations were subject to judicial review despite section 211(a) by reading the term \u201cclaim\u201d very narrowly. <em>See Tracy v. Gleason, </em>379 F.2d 469 (D.C.Cir.1967); <em>Thompson v. Gleason, </em>317 F.2d 901 (D.C.Cir.1962); <em>Wellman v. Whittier, </em>259 F.2d 163 (D.C. Cir.1958). The House Report accompanying the 1970 amendments clearly states that the language change was designed to reject the \u201cfairly tortured construction adopted by the court of appeals in the <em>Wellman, Thompson, </em>and <em>Tracy </em>holdings.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1166, 91st Cong., 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>Sess. 11 (1970), U.S.Gode Gong. &amp; Admin. News 1970, p. 3731. In particular, Congress feared that judicial review might be extended under those decisions to \u201cmillions of decisions <em>terminating or reducing many types of benefits </em>provided under laws administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration. Such review might even extend to the decisions of predecessor agencies made many years ago.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24, U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1970 p. 3742 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">Thus, as the <em>Robison </em>Court recognized, \u201cthe 1970 amendment was enacted to overrule the interpretation of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and thereby restore vitality to the two primary purposes to be served by the no-review clause.\u201d <em>Robison, </em>415 U.S. at 373, 94 S.Ct. at 1168; <em>see Daylo v. Administrator of Veterans\u2019 Affairs, </em>501 F.2d 811, 819-20 (D.C.Cir.1974) (same). As Senator Tal-madge described the 1970 amendment, its purpose was \u201cto <em>clarify </em>congressional intent that all decisions of the Administrator of Veterans\u2019 Affairs on questions of <em>entitlement </em>to veterans\u2019 benefits are final.\u201d 116 Cong.Rec. 23377 (July 9, 1970) (emphasis added). Similarly, Representative Teague explained that the provision merely <em>\u201creiterates the longstanding policy </em>and requirement found in the VA laws, namely, that in any question of law or fact concerning a <em>claim for benefits </em>under any law administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration the judgment of the Administrator of Veterans\u2019 Affairs shall be final.\u201d 116 Cong.Rec. 26489 (July 30, 1970) (emphasis added). Nothing in the legislative history indicates that Congress intended to restrict judicial review of decisions other than claim determinations, which were the only decisions precluded from review before 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">I proffer this last proposition with full knowledge that the Administrator in 1970 voiced his fear that \u201csuits similar to the several hundred already filed can \u2014 and undoubtedly will \u2014 subject nearly every aspect of our benefit determinations to judicial review, including rating decisions, related Veterans\u2019 Administration regulations, Administrator\u2019s decisions, and various adjudication procedures.\u201d Letter from Donald Johnson to the Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs (June 9, 1970), <em>reprinted in </em>H.R. Rep. No. 1166, 91st Cong., 2nd Sess. 23 (1970). This familiar bureaucratic parade of horribles designed to evoke concern about the breadth of judicial review is not, however, a very reliable indicator of congressional intent concerning the 1970 amendment. Significantly, a few paragraphs later in the letter, the Administrator endorses H.R. 17564, which was not enacted, but which \u201cwould define the term \u2018claim\u2019 to include an <em>application for benefits </em>or payments under any law administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration; the assertion of rights to continuance, nonre-duction, or restoration of any such benefits or payments.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 24. It therefore seems to me that neither Congress \u2014 nor even the Administrator \u2014 intended to do anything more than <em>preserve </em>or <em>restore </em>the original meaning and purpose of the no-review clause, namely that courts were precluded from reviewing actual benefits claims. At the very least, \u201c[njothing whatever in the legislative history of the 1970 amendment, or predecessor no-review clauses, suggests any congressional intent to preclude judicial cognizance of ... challenges ... that cannot be expected to burden the courts by their volume\u201d or to \u201cinvolve technical considerations of Veterans\u2019 Administration policy.\u201d <em>Robison, </em>415 U.S. at 373, 94 S.Ct. at 1169; <em>see also id. </em>at 371, 94 S.Ct. at 1167 (\u201cThe legislative history of the 1970 amendment indicates <em>nothing more </em>than a congressional attempt to preserve [the] two primary purposes\u201d of section 211(a).) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">The legislative history of the recently passed Veterans Compensation Act also reinforces the view that Congress has never intended to preclude judicial review to determine whether a VA rulemaking complies with APA procedures. The Senate-passed version of that act required the VA to conduct a rulemaking on radiation compensation standards and provided that the rule-making would be subject to judicial review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>as provided in the APA. <em>See </em>S.1651, <em>reprinted in </em>130 Cong.Rec. S6148-49 (daily ed. May 22, 1984). The judicial review provision was eventually dropped on the explicit assumption of its leading proponent, relayed to the Senate, that judicial review of a VA rulemaking \u2014 as opposed to an individual claim \u2014 was already available under section 211(a). Senator Simpson, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs and the act\u2019s chief Senate sponsor, expressed full concurrence with the following statement of Senator Cranston, the chief Senate majority conferee who described of the reviewability of regulations under section 211(a) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-4\">As our negotiations with the House committee on this legislation progressed over the last several months, I became concerned that permanently holding firm to my position on including an express reference to access to court review might prevent our ever reaching an overall compromise. However, I would have pursued this issue to and throughout a formal conference had I not concluded, as I will discuss below, that including such express reference to access to court review in the legislation, as the Senate had done, was not necessary to there being access to court to test the Administrator\u2019s compliance with the mandated rulemaking process____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-6\">Mr. President, as the author of the statutory provision in the compromise agreement which will require the Administrator to issue regulations in accordance with the rulemaking provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, section 553 of title 5, United States Code, it has been my unequivocal intent that such court review would be available and, as I noted, I am satisfied that the case law supports that result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">130 Cong.Rec. S13591, S13598 (daily ed. Oct. 4,1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-8\">Senator Cranston also described at length the rationale behind allowing judicial review notwithstanding section 211(a) \u201cwhen the validity of a procedure or a regulation promulgated by the VA, rather than the merits of an individual claim, is</p>\n<p id=\"b998-9\">the primary issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at S13600 (quoting a staff memorandum). As he explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_N\">In these instances, cost or workload concerns have been, found not to bar review, because to the extent that such review does not involve the courts in individual benefit determinations, but simply enables them to pass upon the lawfulness of procedures and regulations, it places only minimal burdens on judicial and administrative resources. Similarly, where the claim is that the regulation or proc[e]dure violates the constitution or authorizing statute, it is peculiarly within the competence of the judiciary and the grant of review has generally been f[o]und not to intrude upon the expert functions performed by the agency. Conversely, the courts have almost universally denied review where the challenge involved only the application of eligibility standards to an individual claim for benefits. Here, both the specter of burdensome litigation and the V.A.\u2019s arguably superior expertise in applying a substantive statutory or regulatory standard to an individual set of facts are often cited to justify preclusion of judicial review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-10\"><em>Id.; see also id. </em>(statement of Sen. Cran-ston) (discussing <em>Wayne State Univ. v. Cleland, </em>590 F.2d 627 (6th Cir.1978)). Indeed, virtually every member of the Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee stated on the floor that the Senate had acted in reliance on the fact that section 211(a) and VA policy allows judicial review of VA regulations. <em>See id. </em>at S13608 (statement of Sen. Specter); <em>id. </em>at S13609 (statement of Sen. Matsunaga); <em>id. </em>at S13610 (statement of Sen. Mitchell). To my knowledge, nothing in the legislative history of the 1984 act indicates the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-11\">Although post-enactment legislative developments are certainly not <em>controlling </em>evidence of the intent of an earlier Congress, <em>see, e.g., Universities Research Ass\u2019n v. Coutu, </em>450 U.S. 754, 778, 101 S.Ct. 1451,. 1465, 67 L.Ed.2d 662 (1981), they can, in appropriate circumstances, be used to show that key committee members shared and acted upon a prevailing view concern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>ing the meaning of a statute they oversaw. <em>See, e.g., Grove City College v. Bell, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 1211, 1219, 79 L.Ed.2d 516 (1984); <em>Bell v. New Jersey, </em>461 U.S. 773, 784-87, 103 S.Ct. 2187, 2193-95, 76 L.Ed.2d 312 (1983); <em>Andrus v. Shell Oil Co., </em>446 U.S. 657, 668-72, 100 S.Ct. 1932, 1939-41, 64 L.Ed.2d 593 (1980); <em>Rettig v. Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp., </em>744 F.2d 133, 149 &amp; n. 43 (D.C.Cir.1984); <em>Office of Communications of the United Church of Christ v. FCC, </em>707 F.2d 1413, 1429 n. 48 (D.C.Cir.1983). In this ease, of course, the clearly expressed belief of the recent 98th Congress that courts can review a VA rule-making is consistent with <em>Robison\u2019s </em>interpretation of the central purposes of section 211(a) and with the view, supported by earlier legislative history, that the statute was primarily aimed at individual benefit determinations. This, I believe, is to some degree probative in establishing that Congress did not express a \u201cfairly discernible\u201d intent to preclude review aimed at ensuring compliance with APA procedures. Given the general presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action, evidence of a current general congressional understanding that unlawfully promulgated regulations are reviewable casts grave doubt on the majority\u2019s tortured conclusion that Congress specifically intended to prevent review of any VA \u201cdecision\u201d relating to veterans\u2019 benefits law when it amended section 211(a) in 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">Taken as a whole, then, the relevant legislative history does not indicate any intent to bar review of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the VA\u2019s rulemaking was procedurally invalid; indeed, it suggests that Congress sought to insulate only individual benefit determinations from court scrutiny.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-12\">III. The Administrator\u2019s Interpretation of Section 211(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b999-13\">Congress, moreover, relied in its 1984 legislation on the <em>Administrator\u2019s </em>opinion that section 211(a) does not preclude judicial review of unlawfully promulgated VA rules. Senator Cranston, for example, emphasized the present Administrator\u2019s statement that \u201c[sjhould the VA promulgate regulations in excess of lawful authority, federal court action is certainly available to the adversely affected veterans.\u201d 130 Cong.Rec. S13598 (daily ed. Oct. 4, 1984). The legislative history of the 1984 act also includes an exchange of letters between Senator Cranston and then-Administrator Robert Nimmo concerning the scope of section 211(a) and its applicability to the very case before us. <em>See </em>130 Cong.Rec. S6159-61 (daily ed. May 22, 1984). The Administrator unmistakably stated to Congress that the VA did not consider section 211(a) a bar to judicial review of VA regulations, procedures or agencywide standards.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-14\">[W]e have not been unmindful of the Committee\u2019s concerns about the scope of section 211(a), particularly in the context of your current consideration of judicial review legislation. I continue to believe that VA regulations should be, and are, reviewable in the Federal courts. This principle was further explained by the Acting General Counsel last summer, when he indicated to the Committee that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>\u201clegislation, regulations, and procedures\u201d are judicially reviewable, as are \u201csubstantive Agency actions of broad, binding application.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-4\">Section 211(a) has been properly limited by the courts so that it does not protect every decision, policy, or action of the VA from judicial scrutiny. Those Agency rules and procedures of broad and binding application which affect the rights of a number of claimants to VA benefits are not protected by section 211(a). The way the VA processes and decides an individual benefit claim is clearly beyond the reach of the Federal courts, however. Because the three written provisions challenged in <em>Gott </em>do not, in our opinion, provide criteria for decision-making and are merely procedural and instructional, they do not dictate the substantive decision in any individual case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">Letter from Robert Nimmo to Alan Cran-ston (March 29, 1982), <em>reprinted in </em>130 Cong.Rec. S6160 (daily ed. May 22, 1984).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus the VA has recently adopted \u2014 and presented to Congress \u2014 precisely the interpretation of section 211(a) rejected by the majority. Similarly, the Administrator has consistently indicated to Congress that the no-review clause does not, as the majority concludes today, preclude judicial review of every VA \u201cdecision\u201d relating to veterans\u2019 benefits law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">The Administrator\u2019s 1984 statement to Congress underscores perhaps the most crucial problem created by the majority\u2019s ruling today. Congress\u2019 reliance on the Administrator\u2019s recent position before the Senate that the no-review clause does not limit judicial review of an unlawfully promulgated VA rulemaking is itself \u201cpersuasive evidence\u201d of the appropriate scope of section 211(a). <em>See Grove City, </em>104 S.Ct. at 1219. The Administrator presented Congress with a clearcut administrative interpretation of section 211(a) and Congress relied on that view in 1984, not only by failing to reject it, but by refraining from taking action in new legislation already passed by one house of Congress to write that interpretation into law. As the <em>Grove City </em>Court reminded, \u201cCongress\u2019 failure to disapprove the regulations is not dispositive, but ... it strongly implies that the regulations accurately reflect congressional intent. Congress has never disavowed this implication and in fact Congress has acted consistent with it on a number of occasions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Of course, the indication of congressional reliance on an agency interpretation is much stronger in this case than it was in <em>Grove City. </em>Congress and the VA have in effect agreed that section 211(a) does not bar <em>every </em>VA decision relat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>ing to the veterans\u2019 benefits statutes as the majority now concludes, and Congress has consistently acted in reliance on that interpretation. <em>See supra </em>note 11. In 1984, moreover, Congress specifically acted on the view that the no-review clause does not bar review of unlawfully promulgated VA regulations. While an agency cannot create jurisdiction through a patently unreasonable reading of a preclusion statute, a reasonable agency position certainly deserves serious consideration when a court is faced with several permissible interpretations. <em>Cf. Chevron, U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). I cannot understand how the majority, with one wave of the judicial wand, can simply ignore the agency\u2019s view and flatly proclaim that the \u201cplain language\u201d of section 211(a) bars review of <em>any </em>VA \u201cdecision\u201d even remotely related to veterans\u2019 benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">Judicial review to ensure that VA rule-makings comply with the notice and comment provisions of the APA would not frustrate any \u201cfairly discernible\u201d congressional intent to preclude court scrutiny of certain VA actions. The specific language of section 211(a), as interpreted in <em>Robison, </em>is not sufficiently unambiguous to carry the burden of demonstrating a specific intent to preclude review of a VA rulemaking to ensure compliance with the APA. The purpose, legislative history and overall structure of the provision, in turn, indicate that Congress did not seek to bar review of a VA rulemaking that admittedly violates the notice and comment provisions of the APA. Moreover, the VA has told Congress that it does not interpret the no-review clause to insulate VA rulemakings from court scrutiny. Given all of this, the case for the majority\u2019s all-preclusive reading of section 211(a) must fail. That interpretation, even if <em>plausible </em>standing by itself, is by no means mandatory and, against the backdrop of legislative history, it falls far short of overcoming the presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action. At bottom, today\u2019s decision not only ignores the relevant indicators of congressional intent but also constitutes rank judicial interference with a reasonable statutory interpretation agreed upon by both political branches of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">Accordingly, I dissent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b989-6\">. During the pendency of this appeal, Congress enacted the Veterans' Dioxin and Radiation Exposure and Compensation Standards Act, Pub.L. No. 98-542, 98 Stat. 2725 (1984) (to be codified at 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 354 &amp; note) [\"Veterans Compensation Act\u201d]. That act requires that the VA undertake a rulemaking, subject to the notice and comment provisions of the APA, aimed at establishing regulations for determining the service connection of disability claims based on radiation exposure during the American occupation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki prior to July 1, 1946. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5(a), 5(c), 98 Stat. at 2727, 2729. The required regulations will presumably displace the current VA methodologies challenged here. Accordingly, the 1984 act obviates a crucial aspect of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the VA must abide by the APA if it chooses to employ agencywide radiation exposure standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">I agree with the majority, however, that this case is not thereby rendered moot. <em>See </em>Maj.Op. at p. 905 n. 4. I should note, however, that the district court expressly <em>denied </em>the plaintiffs\u2019 request to invalidate VA decisions denying benefits under the unlawful rules, <em>see Gott v. Cleland, </em>No. 80-0906 (D.D.C. Dec. 15, 1981) (order) and the plaintiffs have <em>not </em>appealed that order. Contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, <em>see </em>Maj.Op. at p. 905 n. 4, this appeal does not present any question concerning the validity of benefit determinations made under the challenged standards. The plaintiffs in this case also include several veterans allegedly exposed to radiation while participating in atmospheric nuclear weapons testing in the United States; the 1984 act does not clearly require the VA to issue regulations concerning their claims in the near future.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b989-9\">. A majority of the federal courts that have considered the scope of section 211(a) have concluded that the no-review clause should not be interpreted to bar judicial scrutiny of a variety of VA \"decisions\u201d relating to veterans\u2019 benefits law. <em>See, e.g., American Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees v. Nimmo, </em>711 F.2d 28, 31 (4th Cir.1983) (\"[C]ourts are not precluded from considering the VA\u2019s statutory authority for promulgating regulations and the constitutionality of its actions.\u201d); <em>Evergreen State College v. Cleland, </em>621 F.2d 1002, 1007-08 (9th Cir.1980) (section 211(a) does not bar review to determine whether VA regulations exceed its statutory authority); <em>University of Maryland v. Cleland, </em>621 F.2d 98, 100-01 (4th Cir.1980) (same); <em>Merged Area X (Education) v. Cleland, </em>604 F.2d 1075, 1078 (8th Cir.1979) (same); <em>Wayne State Univ. v. Cleland, </em>590 F.2d 627, 631-32 (6th Cir.1978) (same); <em>Arnolds v. Veterans Admin., </em>507 F.Supp. 128, ISO-31 (N.D.Ill.1981) (section 211(a) does not bar review where VA procedures allegedly violate the due process clause); <em>Plato v. Roudebush, </em>397 F.Supp. 1295, 1301-04 (D.Md.1975) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">In each of these cases, courts have emphasized that the issue presented was not whether the VA had correctly decided to grant or deny benefits, but rather whether the VA had exceeded its statutory grant of authority or had acted in violation of rights guaranteed by the fifth amendment. This case presents a far stronger claim for judicial review because the plaintiffs challenge only the VA's decision not to comply with the APA\u2019s procedural requirements \u2014 a decision quite unrelated to any substantive interpretation or application of veterans\u2019 benefits law. In my view, then, we need not conclude that section 211(a) only applies to individual benefit determinations in order to assume jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>in this case. <em>Compare Wayne State, </em>590 F.2d at 631-32. I do, however, believe that the evidence that Congress primarily intended section 211(a) to bar court scrutiny of individual benefit claims is relevant in determining whether Congress expressed a sufficiently clear intent to bar the procedural review asserted here. <em>See supra </em>pp. 905-06, 909, 910-12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b991-5\">. As the majority points out, <em>see </em>Maj.Op. at p. 904 n. 2, the APA\u2019s notice and comment rules do not apply of their own force to government benefit decisions. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(a)(2). The VA has nonetheless adopted the APA's rulemaking provision by regulation, <em>see </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.12 (1984), and thus the VA\u2019s failure to comply with its own regulations is technically the issue in this case. Courts, of course, have long required agencies to abide by their own procedural regulations even when those regulations create more requirements than the Constitution or otherwise applicable statutes. <em>See, e.g., Vitarelli v. Seaton, </em>359 U.S. 535, 79 S.Ct. 968, 3 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1959); <em>Service v. Dulles, </em>354 U.S. 363, 77 S.Ct. 1152, 1 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1957). The majority nonetheless argues that the Administrator\u2019s <em>particular </em>defiance of his own regulations in this case is shielded from judicial review by section 211(a) because the VA\u2019s <em>earlier </em>decision to adopt notice and comment rules can be characterized as a decision relating to veterans\u2019 benefit law. <em>See </em>Maj.Op. at pp. 913-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">This argument flies in the face of this circuit\u2019s consistent treatment of regulations such as the VA\u2019s that voluntarily adopt otherwise inapplicable APA provisions. Along with many other agencies, the VA adopted its notice and comment rule in 1972 on the recommendation of the Administrative Conference of the United States that all agency action, including benefit matters, should be governed by the APA\u2019s notice and comment provisions. <em>See </em>37 Fed.Reg. 3552 (Feb. 17, 1972). According to the VA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-7\">Our implementation of the Conference\u2019s recommendation should result in greater participation by the public in the formulation of the rules and regulations of the Veterans Administration. The public benefit from such participation should outweigh any administrative inconvenience or delay which may result from use of the public participation procedures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-10\"><em>Id. </em>In <em>Rodway v. United States Dep\u2019t of Agriculture, </em>514 F.2d 809 (D.C.Cir.1975), we held that a similar administrative decision to adopt APA notice and comment procedures for government benefits decisions <em>\u201cfully bound </em>the agency to comply thereafter with procedural demands of the APA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 814 (emphasis added); <em>see also Petry v. Block, </em>737 F.2d 1193, 1197 n. 12 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (\"Under <em>Rodway </em>..., the fact that an agency chose to operate under the APA is <em>irrelevant </em>to an analysis of that agency\u2019s compliance with its provisions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">We have thus squarely held that an agency must act as if the APA\u2019s notice and comment provisions are fully applicable to agency rule-makings once it adopts those provisions by regulation. The plaintiffs in this case do not challenge the VA\u2019s decision <em>vel non </em>to adopt a notice and comment regulation. Instead, they contest the Administrator's selective defiance of those regulations in this particular instance. That decision seems to me no more related to any provision of the veterans\u2019 benefit statutes than a VA decision to defy the APA\u2019s notice and comment provisions in this case but not the next. I simply cannot believe that section 211(a) was intended to allow the VA to defy with impunity the traditional, government-wide constraints on agency action embodied in the APA\u2019s rulemak-ing provisions \u2014 whether those constraints are rooted in the APA itself or in agency regulations adopting APA notice and comment procedures. <em>See infra </em>pp. 920-21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b992-6\">. Moreover, the only issue presented in this case is whether the VA violated its own regulations adopting the APA's <em>notice and comment </em>procedures. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b) (requiring public notice in the Federal Register); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 553(c) (allowing comment by interested persons). We most assuredly are not confronted here with any question concerning the availability of judicial review to ensure VA compliance with <em>any </em>other APA provision. There is, accordingly, no basi^ for the majority's assertion that we must accept the proposition that every VA action arguably governed by APA provisions is subject to court scrutiny in order to grant the particular, limited review sought here. <em>See </em>Maj.Op. at pp. 907-08 (raising the spectre of review for compliance with APA evidentiary requirements); <em>id. </em>at 910 n. 8 (same for substantive \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d review); <em>id. </em>at 913-14 n. 12 (same for review to ensure that VA evidence was reliable). Those VA decisions, however, are inextricably intertwined with the VA\u2019s implementation of its organic statute. Because the APA's notice and comment provisions impose constraints on the VA that are essentially <em>independent </em>of the veterans\u2019 benefits statutes, judicial review to ensure compliance, with those provisions, and those provisions alone, does not implicate a decision of the Administrator made <em>under </em>a law, administered by the VA, that provides for veterans\u2019 benefits. Deciding that section 211(a) does not bar review of the Administrator\u2019s decision not to provide notice and allow comment, in other words, will not \u201csuck[ ]\u2019\u2019 the APA \u201cdry of its content.\" <em>Id. </em>at 910 n. 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b993-5\">. In <em>Heckler v. Ringer, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 104 S.Ct. 2013, 80 L.Ed.2d 622 (1984), the Court recently held that a challenge to a Health and Human Services rule disallowing medicare coverage was barred by section 205(h) of the Social Security Act which provides that \"[n]o action shall be brought against the ... Secretary ... under sections 1331 or 1346 of title 28 to recover on any claim arising under\u201d the Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h). The <em>Ringer </em>plaintiffs argued that the Secretary had violated APA procedures, wrongfully decided the coverage issue by rulemaking rather than adjudication, and was required to extend the requested coverage by the medicare statute. Without specifically discussing the APA claim, the Court held that the plaintiffs were barred from seeking immediate judicial review because the plaintiffs essentially sought to recover individual benefits and the Medicare Act created \"both the standing and substantive presentation\u201d of their claims. <em>See Ringer, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2022 (quoting <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 760-61, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2464-65, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">There are, however, significant differences between section 211(a) and the preclusion statute at issue in <em>Ringer. </em>First, <em>Ringer </em>was decided under a no-review clause that bars judicial review of <em>any </em>claim, even a <em>constitutional </em>claim, if the ultimate effect of review would be to grant or deny benefits. <em>See Ringer, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2025-26; <em>Salfi, </em>422 U.S. al 760-61, 95 S.Ct. at 2464-65. <em>Robison, </em>however, at least establishes that section 211(a) has a far narrower scope: it does not bar constitutional challenges and it therefore does not preclude every claim that could possibly affect benefit disbursement. Moreover, the <em>Ringer </em>plaintiffs could have brought all of their claims under a separate jurisdictional provision which requires exhaustion of administrative remedies. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h). Congress\u2019 specific intent to require medicare plaintiffs to seek relief in that alternative administrative and judicial forum has been a decisive factor in the Court\u2019s interpretation of the medicare preclusion provision. <em>See, e.g., Ringer, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2021 (\"We conclude that all aspects of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for benefits should be channelled first into the administrative process which Congress has provided.\u201d); <em>Salfi, </em>422 U.S. at 750-60, 95 S.Ct. at 2459-64. The majority\u2019s interpretation would result in complete preclusion rather than postponement of judicial review, and we cannot assume that the Court would read the phrase \"decisions of the Administrator\u201d in section 211(a) to bar the limited review of an APA violation sought in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b993-11\">. The majority cannot respond that review would in fact be available in the hypothetical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>case,'because it presents a constitutional rather than a statutory challenge. <em>See, e.g., Devine v. Cleland, </em>616 F.2d 1080, 1082-85 (9th Cir.1980) (advancing this argument); <em>Plato, </em>397 F.Supp. at 1301-04 (same); <em>see also VA Administrative Procedure and Judicial Review Act: Hearings before the Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, </em>95th Cong., 1st Sess. 7 (1977) (statement of the Administrator indicating that the VA accepts the view that section 211(a) does not bar review of VA hearing procedures for compliance with the due process clause). As long as the majority rests its interpretation of section 211(a) on the mere presence of a VA \"decision\u201d applying the veterans' benefits laws, only direct constitutional challenges to VA legislation will be possible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b994-11\">. Indeed, had the <em>Robison </em>court thought the phrase \"decisions of the Administrator\" unambiguous and expressly dispositive of section 211(a) in the sense urged by the majority, it would hardly have undertaken its extensive inquiry into the provision\u2019s purposes and legislative history. That inquiry, in turn, strongly supports the availability of judicial review in this case. <em>See supra </em>pp. 922-27.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b996-8\">. Although the majority insists that the <em>current </em>section 211(a) is unambiguously described by its express language, it nonetheless suggests that we should consult the legislative history of the pre-1970 versions of the no-review clause for evidence that Congress really meant \"any decision\" when it adopted the phrase \"decisions ... concerning a claim for benefits\" in 1940. <em>See </em>Maj.Op. at pp. 906-07. I see no justification for this differential approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">The original no-review clause was contained in section 5 of the Economy Act of 1933, Pub.L. No. 73-2 \u00a7 5, 48 Stat. 8, 9 (1933), which created the present Veterans' Administration. That statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-10\">All decisions rendered by the Administrator of Veterans Affairs under the Provisions of this title ... shall be final and conclusive on all questions of law and fact, and no other official and court of the United States shall have jurisdiction to review by mandamus or otherwise any such decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-11\">49 Stat. at 9 (1933). The majority suggests that we read this earlier version to contradict the \"apparent meaning\" of the express reference to \"claims\" that was added in 1940. <em>See </em>54 Stat. 1197 (1940). Yet, the Supreme Court stated in 1934 that section 5 of the Economy Act</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANcU\">concerns <em>only grants </em>to veterans and their dependents \u2014 pensions, compensation allowances, and special privileges, all of which are gratuities. The purpose of the section appears to have been to remove the possibility of judicial review in <em>that class of </em>cases____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-15\"><em>Lynch v. United States, </em>292 U.S. 571, 587, 54 S.Ct. 840, 847, 78 L.Ed. 1434 (1934) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-16\">In support of the 1940 amendment, which added the explicit reference to claims, Senator George stated that \u201cthe bill only confirms what has been the accepted belief and conviction that with respect to any <em>pension </em>[or] <em>gratuity, ... </em>there is no right of action in the courts.\u201d 86 Cong.Rec. 13,383 (Oct. 8, 1940); <em>see Robison, </em>415 U.S. at 369 n. 10, 94 S.Ct. at 1166 n. 10. Similarly, in 1952 hearings on proposed amendments to the no-review clause, the VA clearly indicated that the provision was designed only to bar review of individual, fact-bound benefit claims. <em>See Hearings on H.R. 360, 478, 2442 and 6777 Before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, </em>82d Cong., 2d Sess. 1962-63 (1952) (discussed as evidence of Congress\u2019 pre-1970 intent in <em>Robison, </em>415 U.S. at 370 nn. 10-12, 94 S.Ct. at 1167 nn. 10-12); Plainly, then, nothing in the pre-1970 legislative history of section 211(a) indicates a congressional intent to preclude judicial review of any VA decisions other than individual benefit determinations; there is certainly <em>no </em>suggestion that Congress meant to bar review of rules promulgated in disregard of APA procedures, and that is the only issue presented here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b999-8\">. The Supreme Court has also inferred from a statutory scheme an intent to bar review under provisions analogous to section 211(a) when Congress has provided other avenues to judicial review in the same general statute or when some types of review would frustrate a complex administrative and judicial forum. <em>See Block, </em>104 S.Ct. at 2454-56; <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 750-60, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 2459-64, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975); <em>see also Heckler v. Ringer, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2013, 2022-24, 80 L.Ed.2d 622 (1984) (inferring an intent to bar review under one section of the Social Security Act where claimants had an adequate administrative and judicial remedy under another). Clearly, nothing in the structure of veterans\u2019 benefits law implies that Congress intended to preclude the limited judicial review sought in this case. Allowing the plaintiffs to challenge the VA\u2019s failure to comply with the notice and comment provisions of the APA does not pose any continual challenge to the day-to-day administration and processing of veterans\u2019 claims. Neither will it allow individual claimants to circumvent an administrative forum in order to obtain judicial scrutiny of actual benefit determinations. Similarly, it is clear that no other provision of the veterans\u2019 benefits statutes provides for judicial review of whether the VA is required to follow APA procedures if it chooses to employ agencywide standards for determining radiation exposure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">. The Administrator\u2019s decision in this case not to argue on appeal that section 211(a) bars judicial review of the plaintiffs' claim is, of course, consistent with his position before Congress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">. In its frequent testimony before Congress, the VA has consistently stated that judicial review of every VA decision relating to veterans' benefit law is <em>not </em>precluded by section 211(a) as the majority now concludes. <em>See, e.g., Hearings on H.R. 360, 478, 2442 and 6772 Before a Subcommittee of the Housing Committee on Veterans' Affairs, </em>82d Cong., 2d Sess. 1962-63 (1952) (describing section 211(a)\u2019s predecessor as a bar to review of individual claims); H.R.Rep. No. 1166, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. 10-13 (1970) (discussing the need to preserve the no-review clause\u2019s original purpose by defining the term \"claim\u201d to include any application for benefits) (discussed <em>infra </em>at pp. 924-25); <em>VA Administrative Procedure and Judicial Review Act: Hearings Before the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, </em>95th Cong., 1st Sess. 6-9 (1977) (noting that <em>Robinson </em>at least means that judicial review is available for constitutional challenges to VA regulations and procedures); <em>FY '78 Legislative Recommendations of Veterans\u2019 Organizations: Hearings Before the Senate Commission on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, </em>95th Cong., 2d Sess. 382-83 (1978) (\u201d[T]he Veterans Administration\u2019s current position is that court review should be permitted of <em>all </em>constitutional questions arising under <em>its administration </em>of veterans\u2019 programs.\u201d) (emphasis added); S.Rep. No. 96-178, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 91 (1979) (stating that <em>Robison \u201cshould be </em>logically extended to permit review of <em>all </em>constitutional questions <em>arising under </em>the Veterans\u2019 Administration's administration of veterans\u2019 programs\u201d) (emphasis added). The VA has thus testified that Congress need not act to limit section 211(a) because the current provision allows judicial review of many important VA decisions relating to veterans\u2019 benefits law. At the very least, the VA has repeatedly told Congress that section 211(a) has a far narrower scope than the majority\u2019s interpretation allows.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">. The majority's jurisdictional disposition of this case renders inappropriate any detailed discussion of whether the challenged VA documents in fact constitute \"rules\" subject to the APA. I would hold that at least one of the documents at issue \u2014 the so-called Memorandum of Understanding \u2014 is a rule under the APA, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 511(4), because it operates as a virtually presumptive formula in awarding or denying benefits. <em>See Batterton v.
