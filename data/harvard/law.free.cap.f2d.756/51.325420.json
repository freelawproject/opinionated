On the defendant\u2019s motion the district judge ordered a new trial unless the plaintiff would agree to remit $29,500 of the jury\u2019s award. The plaintiff has appealed from this order, and the defendant has moved to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-18\">An order for a new trial is not a final order appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; and since the plaintiff in this case refused to accept the remittitur, the order from which he is appealing is an order for a new trial, and is not appealable. <em>Allied Chem. Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980) (per curiam). If the plaintiff isn\u2019t satisfied with the outcome of the new trial he can appeal from the judgment entered at the conclusion of that trial and can seek reinstatement of the original jury award. See <em>id. </em>at 36, 101 S.Ct. at 190. We add for completeness that if the plaintiff had accepted the remittitur, he could not appeal at all. <em>Donovan v. Penn Shipping Co., </em>429 U.S. 648, 97 S.Ct. 835, 51 L.Ed.2d 112 (1977) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-19\">Appeal Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
