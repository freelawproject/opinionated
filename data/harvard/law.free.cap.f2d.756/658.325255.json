A citation was issued for violating 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 55.12-14.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> United States Steel contested the citation before an administrative law judge (AU) who concluded there was a violation and assessed a penalty of $345. The Mine Safety and Health Review Commission agreed to review the ease but later recused itself because of an <em>ex parte </em>contact by its staff. United States Steel filed this petition to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The controversy centers on the method of protecting workers from hazardous electrical shocks when handling cables which power the drills and shovels at the Minntac mine. The cables in use normally carry a current of 2,300 volts. Each cable consists of three phase conductors housed in insulating material covered by a braid wire mesh which is in contact with two ground wires. The hazard results from the possible \u201cleakage\u201d of current. Normally, current which escapes from the phase conductors \u2014 due to damaged wire to insulation, or a bad splice \u2014 flows to the ground wires. A ground fault protection system is designed to detect the flow of current in the ground wires and shut off the power.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">While a contrary conclusion might be supported by the evidence presented, the AU\u2019s finding that the ground fault protection system does not constitute \u201csuitable protection\u201d as required by 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 55.12-14 has substantial support in the record as a whole. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706 (1982). The scope of our review is narrow and this court will not substitute its judgment for that of the AU. <em>See Humphrey v. United States, </em>745 F.2d 1166, 1169-70 (8th Cir. 1984). We defer to the AU\u2019s expert interpretation of 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 55.12-14. <em>See E.I. duPont deNemours &amp; Co. v. Collins, </em>432 U.S. 46, 54-55, 97 S.Ct. 2229, 2234, 53 L.Ed.2d 100 (1977). In addition, the AU\u2019s assessment of the $345 penalty was proper under 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 820\u00ae. <em>See B.L. Anderson, Inc. v. Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, </em>668 F.2d 442, 443-44 (8th Cir.1982). The AU\u2019s order is enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">ORDER ENFORCED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-9\">. 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 55.12-14 states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-10\">Mandatory. Power cables energized to potentials in excess of 150 volts, phase-to-ground, shall not be moved with equipment unless sleds or slings, insulated from such equipment, are used. When such energized cables are moved manually, insulated hooks, tongs, ropes, or slings shall be used unless suitable protection for persons is provided by other means. <em>* * *</em></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
