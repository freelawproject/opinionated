Heckler, </em>563 F.Supp. 789 (W.D. Ark.1983). For reversal the Secretary argues that the district court erred in computing the amount of the attorney\u2019s fee and in awarding interest. For the reasons discussed below, we reverse the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-24\">The underlying facts are not in dispute. For a more detailed statement of the administrative and judicial history, see 563 F.Supp. at 790-91. This case involves neither the claimant\u2019s entitlement to disability benefits nor SSI benefits nor the amount of those benefits. Nor does it involve the application of the so-called SSI windfall offset, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-6 (1982),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>amend</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number><em>ed by </em>\u00a7 2615(a) of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1132 (to be codified at 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1320a-6 (West Supp.1984)),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to reduce the <em>claimant\u2019s </em>past-due disability benefits. This case involves only the computation of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Claimant Martha Burnett filed a claim for disability insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act (the Act), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 <em>et seq., </em>on January 18, 1979. On December 17, 1980, she filed a claim for SSI benefits based on disability under Title XVI of the Act, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1381 <em>et seq</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Secretary determined that Burnett was not disabled and denied these claims. In two separate appeals the dis-triet court remanded the case to the Secretary for further proceedings. On August 9, 1982, following additional vocational expert testimony, the Secretary determined that Burnett was in fact disabled and entitied to disability benefits beginning in September 1978 and to SSI benefits from December 1980 through March 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>The Secretary determined that Burnett was entitled to gross retroactive disability benefits in the amount of $8,079.10. Pursuant to the SSI windfall offset, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1320a-6, the Secretary then reduced the $8,079.10 by $2,426.29, the amount of retroactive SSI benefits Burnett would not have received if she had received the disability benefits when they were due instead of retroactively. Thus, after application of the SSI windfall offset, Burnett was entitled to $5,652.81 in retroactive disability benefits. Pursuant to the attorney\u2019s fee award provision, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 406, the Secretary withheld 25% of this reduced amount to cover an award of attorney\u2019s fees and paid the balance of $4,239.60 to Burnett.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">A court may award attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(1) where the claimant receives a favorable administrative decision following a remand of the case to the Secretary for further consideration. <em>See, e.g., Fenix v. Finch, </em>436 F.2d 831, 834-35 (8th Cir.1971), <em>citing Ray v. Gardner, </em>387 F.2d 162, 165 (4th Cir.1967). In his motion for an award of attorney\u2019s fees before the district court, the attorney argued that, pursuant to \u00a7 406(b)(1), he was entitled to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee of up to 25% of \u201cthe total of the past-due benefits\u201d and that the attorney\u2019s fee should be computed as a percentage of the gross retroactive disability benefits due the claimant, unreduced by the application of the SSI windfall offset. The district court agreed and held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aaz-dedup-0\">in cases where Title II [disability] and Title XVI [SSI] benefits are concurrently adjudicated and computed for retroactive periods, the [Secretary] is obligated to compute and pay Title II disability insurance benefits before computation and payment of Title XVI SSI benefits____ [and] that, for purposes of computing the [claimant\u2019s] attorney\u2019s fee only, the [Secretary] has improperly deducted $2,426.29 from past-due benefits as an SSI offset. The total past-due benefits on which an attorney\u2019s fee award should be based is $8,079.10____[and] the claimant\u2019s attorney is entitled to a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee in the amount of 25 per cent, of these past-due benefits or $2,019.75.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">563 F.Supp. at 793. Relying upon the statutory language in \u00a7 1320a-6, the district court determined that Congress intended the SSI windfall offset to apply only when SSI benefits had actually been received during the period for which retroactive disability benefits were due: \u201c \u2018Section [1320a-6] speaks of cases in which a claimant for Title II benefits is <em>subsequently </em>determined to be entitled to those benefits and <em>\u201cwas\u201d </em>an individual to whom [SSI] benefits <em>\u201cwere paid\" </em>for one or more months <em>\u201cduring\u201d </em>the retroactive period.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 792 (citation omitted, emphasis in original), <em>citing </em>unidentified administrative decision <em>reported in </em>5 Soc. Security F. 1, 8-9 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">The district court also noted that because application of the SSI windfall offset reduced the amount of \u201cpast-due\u201d disability benefits from which the Secretary withholds 25% for direct payment of attorney\u2019s fees or from which the court may award up to 25% for attorney\u2019s fees, the SSI windfall offset operated as a disincentive to lawyers to represent disability claimants, a result which was contrary to Congressional intent. 563 F.Supp. at 792-93; <em>see Dawson v. Finch, </em>425 F.2d 1192, 1195 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 830, 91 S.Ct. 60, 27 L.Ed.2d 60 (1970). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-14\">As a preliminary matter, we note that the Secretary is entitled to participate in attorney\u2019s fee matters to protect the claimant\u2019s interest. <em>See, e.g., MacDonald v. Weinberger, </em>512 F.2d 144, 146-47 (9th Cir.1975). \u201cIn view of the humanitarian policy, of the Social Security program to benefit the disabled, ... the Secretary \u2018retains an interest in the fair distribution of monies withheld for attorney\u2019s fees.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lewis v. Secretary of HHS, </em>707 F.2d 246, 248 (6th Cir.1983), <em>citing Moore v. Califano, </em>471 F.Supp. 146, 149 (S.D.W.Va.1979), <em>appeal dismissed mem., </em>622 F.2d 585 (4th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-15\">The Secretary argues that the district court\u2019s computation of the amount of past-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>due benefits is inconsistent with \u00a7 406(b)(1) and the regulations defining the term \u201cpast-due benefits,\u201d improperly requires payment by the Secretary of an attorney\u2019s fee award \u201cin addition to\u201d the amount of past-due benefits, and erroneously applies the SSI windfall offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The Secretary first argues that the district court\u2019s award is inconsistent with \u00a7 406(b)(1) and the regulations defining the term \u201cpast-due benefits.\u201d Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(1) (emphasis added) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1S\">Whenever a court renders a judgment favorable to a claimant under this sub-chapter [referring to Subchapter II] who was represented before the court by an attorney, the court may determine and award as part of its judgment a reasonable fee for such representation, not in excess of 25 percent of the <em>total of the past-due benefits </em>to which the claimant is entitled by reason of such judgment, and the Secretary may, notwithstanding the provisions of section 405(i) of this title, certify the amount of such fee for payment to such attorney out of, and not in addition to, the amount of such past-due benefits. In case of any such judgment, no other fee may be payable or certified for payment for such representation except as provided in this paragraph.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The Secretary has defined \u201cpast-due benefits\u201d by regulation as \u201cthe <em>total amount of benefits payable under Title II </em>of the Act to all beneficiaries that has accumulated because of a favorable administrative or judicial determination or decision, up to but not including the month the determination or decision is made.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1703 (1984) (emphasis added). Thus, the Secretary argues that any adjustments required by the Act which affect the amount of benefits the claimant is entitled to receive, including the reduction required by the SSI windfall offset, must be made in order to determine the \u201ctotal amount of benefits payable\u201d to a disability claimant. For this reason, the Secretary argues that \u201cpast-due benefits\u201d in \u00a7 406(b)(1) refers to the \u201cnet\u201d amount of disability benefits payable to the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Where Congress has entrusted the Secretary with the responsibility for implementing a statutory provision by regulation, the Secretary has the primary responsibility for interpreting statutory terms. <em>See, e.g., Batterton v. Francis, </em>432 U.S. 416, 425-26, 97 S.Ct. 2399, 2405-06, 53 L.Ed.2d 448 (1977). \u201c[0]ur review is limited to determining whether the regulations promulgated exceeded the Secretary\u2019s statutory authority and whether they are arbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Heckler v. Campbell, </em>461 U.S. 458, 466, 103 S.Ct. 1952, 1957, 76 L.Ed.2d 66 (1983). Judicial deference to administrative interpretation is particularly appropriate in cases involving disputed terms in the Social Security Act. <em>See, e.g., Burkhalter v. Schweiker, </em>711 F.2d 841, 844 (8th Cir.1983). Here, Congress has authorized the Secretary to pay authorized attorney\u2019s fees out of past-due benefits directly to attorneys who represent disability claimants and has entrusted implementation of the provision by rule or regulation to the Secretary. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(a) (administrative award), (b) (judicial award). We cannot conclude that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of \u201cpast-due benefits\u201d as the total amount of benefits payable to the claimant, that is, the \u201cnet\u201d amount of disability benefits, is arbitrary and capricious or exceeds the Secretary\u2019s statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">First, computation of attorney\u2019s fees on the basis of the net amount of benefits is consistent with the Congressional goal of insuring that disability benefits are not consumed by attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Cf. Dawson v. Finch, </em>425 F.2d at 1195 (\u00a7 406(b) intended to insure that disability benefits would not be diminished by deduction of attorney\u2019s fee of one-third or one-half of benefits received). Under the Act, the claimant is not entitled to payment of the \u201cgross\u201d amount of retroactive disability benefits. The Secretary when required by the Act must reduce the \u201cgross\u201d amount. The reduction can dramatically affect the amount of benefits payable to the claimant. For example, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a requires the Secretary to reduce a claimant\u2019s disability ben<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>efits if the claimant receives worker\u2019s compensation. <em>See also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.408 (1984). In <em>Cloyd v. Weinberger, </em>527 F.2d 1167 (6th Cir.1976) (order), the claimant\u2019s gross amount of benefits was $2,703.20, but, after reduction for worker\u2019s compensation, the net amount was $746.20. The district court\u2019s award of an attorney\u2019s fee of $1,028.60 was <em>greater </em>than the claimant\u2019s past-due benefits. The court in the <em>Cloyd </em>case reversed the district court award and held that the maximum attorney\u2019s fee allowable under \u00a7 406(b)(1) was $186.55 or 25% of the reduced or net amount of benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 1168. Thus, as noted in <em>Davis v. Secretary of HEW, </em>320 F.Supp. 1293, 1296 (N.D.Miss.1970) (worker\u2019s compensation), recovery of attorney\u2019s fees based on the gross award would \u201cin many cases [cause] a substantial portion of the actual recovery [to] be consumed in counsel fees and the actual \u2018benefit\u2019 to [the] claimant reduced to a merely minimal sum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Here, the reduction required by the Act is the SSI windfall offset. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-6; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.408b (1984). We believe the Secretary\u2019s decision to handle the reduction required by the SSI windfall offset in the same way as the worker\u2019s compensation reduction is reasonable. We recognize that computation of attorney\u2019s fees on the basis of the net amount of disability benefits will necessarily \u201creduce the amount of withheld Title II benefits available for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees\u201d and to that extent is a financial disincentive to attorneys to represent disability applicants. 563 F.Supp. at 792. The Secretary\u2019s approach, however, does produce a public benefit because it preserves a greater portion of the benefits for the claimant. After reduction by the SSI windfall offset, Burnett was entitled to benefits of $5,652.81. As discussed below, \u00a7 406(b)(1) limits direct payment of the attorney\u2019s fee \u201cout of, and not in addition to, the amount of such past-due benefits.\u201d An attorney\u2019s fee award of $2,019.75 (or 25% of $8,079.10) would leave Burnett with the balance of $3,633.06. By comparison, under the Secretary\u2019s approach, an attorney\u2019s fee award of $1,413.20 (or 25% of $5,652.81) would leave Burnett with $4,239.60, or about $606 more in benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Moreover, the statutory language and legislative history suggest that Congress sought to \u201cencourage effective legal representation of claimants by insuring lawyers that they will receive reasonable fees directly through certification by the Secretary.\u201d <em>Dawson v. Finch, </em>425 F.2d at 1196; <em>see also </em>Hearings on H.R. 6675 Before the Senate Committee on Finance, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 512-13 (1965) (attorney complaints that claimants sometimes receive awards without the attorney\u2019s knowledge and do not notify the attorney and do not pay the attorney\u2019s fee). Section 406(a) and (b) reflect a compromise \u2014 the Secretary must withhold and pay a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee directly to the attorney out of the claimant\u2019s past-due benefits, thus guaranteeing payment to the attorney and avoiding collection problems, but the amount of the attorney\u2019s fee that must be withheld and directly paid to the attorney is limited to a maximum of 25% of the past-due benefits. Thus, it is primarily the direct payment feature which provides the attorney with the financial incentive to represent disability claimants and compensates in part for limitation of fees to a maximum of 25% of the past-due benefits in court awards. Under the Secretary\u2019s approach, only the amount subject to withholding and direct payment is affected, not the direct payment feature.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The question whether the amount of past-due benefits subject to withholding must be reduced by the SSI windfall offset was specifically addressed in the preamble to the final regulations implementing the SSI windfall offset provision. Reduction of Retroactive Social Security Benefits, 47 Fed.Reg. 4985, 4986 (1982) (hereinafter Preamble) (codified at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.-408b, 416.1123). The question about withholding is identical to the issue in the present case: whether the amount of past-due benefits out of which the court may award attorney\u2019s fees must be reduced by the SSI windfall offset. The questions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>identical because although the Secretary may <em>authorize </em>an attorney\u2019s fee <em>in excess </em>of 25% of the past-due benefits for services rendered in connection with administrative proceedings, the most the Secretary may <em>withhold </em>and certify for direct payment to the attorney is 25% of the past-due benefits. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(a) (Secretary to prescribe maximum fees which may be charged for services performed in connection with any claim before the Secretary and shall certify for payment maximum of 25% of past-due benefits); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.-1725(b)(2) (administrative authorization of attorney\u2019s fee does not depend on amount of benefit alone; Secretary may authorize a fee even if no benefits are payable), .1730(b)(1) (maximum direct payment of 25% of past-due benefits); <em>see generally </em>3 National Organization of Social Security Claimant\u2019s Representatives, Social Security Practice Guide \u00a7 27.01, at 27-2 (1984) (distinguishing authorization from withholding and payment). <em>But see Morris v. Social Security Administration, </em>689 F.2d 495, 497 (4th Cir.1982) (holding that \u00a7 406(a) limits the amount of attorney\u2019s fees which may be awarded by the Secretary for administrative representation to 25% of past-due benefits). Similarly, the maximum attorney\u2019s fee that a <em>court </em>can award (and which the Secretary can withhold and certify for direct payment) is 25% of the past-due benefits. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b)(1); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1728(b) (authorization), .1730 (a) (payment).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Several commenters had assumed that the Secretary would withhold the amount of an attorney\u2019s fee from retroactive disability benefits <em>before </em>the reduction required by the SSI windfall offset. The Secretary\u2019s response clearly rejected that position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">As for attorney\u2019s fees, the amount of retroactive benefits that is subject to withholding for payment of an attorney\u2019s fee is the total amount of retroactive Social Security benefits <em>payable </em>to the beneficiary (see [20 C.F.R.] \u00a7 404.1703). The amount payable is the amount of retroactive benefits less the amount of any deductions, reductions, or overpay-ments applicable to the retroactive period. Thus, the amount of retroactive benefits <em>payable </em>for purposes of withholding an attorney\u2019s fee is the amount of retroactive Social Security benefits reduced by the amount of any SSI payments received in the retroactive period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AR1\">Preamble, 47 Fed.Reg. at 4986 (emphasis in original). Thus, the amount of retroactive benefits payable for purposes of a court award of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 404(b)(1) is the amount of retroactive disability benefits reduced by the SSI windfall offset or the net amount of disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">The Secretary also argues that the district court\u2019s award violates the provision in \u00a7 406(b)(1) which authorizes the Secretary to \u201ccertify the amount of such fee for payment to such attorney out of, and not in addition to, the amount of such past-due benefits.\u201d We agree. As discussed above, the \u201camount of such past-due benefits\u201d in the present case is $5,652.81. The Secretary withheld 25% of this amount or $1,413.20 for payment of attorney\u2019s fees and paid the balance to the claimant. The district court\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee award of $2,019.75 exceeds the amount withheld by $606.55. The district court could not require the Secretary to pay the attorney $2,019.75 as an attorney\u2019s fee award made pursuant to \u00a7 406(b)(1) because $606.55 of that award represented an amount \u201cin addition to\u201d the amount of past-due benefits. <em>Cf. Ocasio v. Schweiker, </em>540 F.Supp. 1320 (S.D.N.Y.1982) (availability of attorney\u2019s fees against the federal government under Equal Access to Justice Act not limited by \u00a7 406(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">The Secretary also argues that the district court erroneously applied the SSI windfall offset. The Secretary specifically argues that the district court erred in holding that in cases involving concurrent applications for retroactive disability benefits and SSI benefits, the Secretary must compute and pay the disability benefits <em>before </em>computation and payment of the SSI benefits. Because the present case involves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>only computation of attorney\u2019s fees and does not involve application of the SSI windfall offset to reduce the amount of the claimant\u2019s retroactive disability benefits, we do not reach this issue. However, some analysis of the SSI windfall offset was necessary to resolve the attorney\u2019s fee issue and we believe that the Secretary\u2019s argument is correct. <em>See Gallo v. Heckler, </em>600 F.Supp. 1513, 1518-1519 (E.D.N.Y. 1985). The analysis is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The Secretary also argues that the district court erred in awarding interest on the award of attorney\u2019s fees. We agree. Section 406(b) does not contain any provision for an award of interest. The Secretary\u2019s role under \u00a7 406(b) is limited to withholding a maximum of 25% of the past-due benefits and certifying the court\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee award for direct payment to the attorney. The Secretary is only a stakeholder in such proceedings. In any event, to the extent the district court\u2019s award could be characterized as one against the Secretary for payment of attorney\u2019s fees, there is no provision in \u00a7 406(b) for an award of interest. \u201c[IJnterest on claims against the United States cannot be recovered in the absence of an express provision to the contrary in the relevant statute____\u201d <em>United States v.

Eligibility for SSI benefits is determined on the basis of need and either age, blindness or disability and provides a minimum level of benefits. <em>See Schweiker v. Hogan, </em>457 U.S. 569, 582, 102 S.Ct. 2597, 2606, 73 L.Ed.2d 227 (1982) (brief discussion of historical development of SSI program).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b700-5\">. As noted by the district court, the SSI windfall offset provision requires the Secretary to reduce a claimant\u2019s retroactive disability benefits if the claimant received SSI payments for at least one month of the retroactive period; the amount of the reduction of disability benefits is the amount of SSI payments that would not have been paid if the claimant had received the disability benefits when they were due instead of retroactively. <em>Burnett v. Heckler, </em>563 F.Supp. 789, 792 (W.D.Ark.1983); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-6 (1982), <em>amended by </em>\u00a7 2615(a) of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1132 (to be codified at 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1320a-6) (West Supp.1984); <em>see </em>H.R. Conference Rep. No. 861, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 1391, <em>reprinted in </em>1984-6B U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 751, 1385; H.R. Conference Rep. No. 944, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 69, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 1277, 1416; S.Rep. No. 408, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 78, <em>reprinted in </em>1980 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 1277, 1356; <em>see generally </em>3 National Organization of Social Security Claimant\u2019s Representatives, Social Security Practice Guide \u00a7 25.33 (1984). Because eligibility for SSI depends upon financial need in addition to age, blindness, or disability, the amount of monthly SSI payments is inverse- . ly proportional to the claimant\u2019s income and resources for that particular month. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(c)(1) (1982); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.200 (SSI eligibility determined on quarterly basis), .1123(a) (1984). Unearned income like disability benefits is considered \"income\u201d for SSI purposes, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1121(a), but cannot be counted until actually received, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 416.-1123(a). Thus, an SSI applicant who already . receives disability benefits receives a smaller SSI payment than an SSI applicant who does not receive disability benefits. However, before the passage of the SSI windfall offset provision, an SSI applicant who applied for retroactive disability benefits or an individual who applied at roughly the same time or concurrently for both disability and SSI benefits could have received full SSI payments and disability benefits because the Secretary could not reduce the amount of SSI payments to reflect the payment of disability benefits until the claimant actually received the disability benefits. In addition, even if the retroactive disability benefits were paid before SSI, the disability benefits would only be counted as income for SSI purposes during the month they were received and not for any other months in the retroactive period. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.1123. Thus, an individual could have received SSI benefits that would not have been paid if the individual had received the disability benefits during the months they were due rather than retroactively. That \"overpayment\" of SSI benefits is the SSI \"windfall.\u201d The SSI windfall offset prevents this overpayment of SSI benefits by requiring the Secretary to reduce the retroactive disability benefits accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">The Secretary\u2019s practice of awarding SSI benefits before disability benefits ensures that such claimants will receive the same amount of total benefits as those claimants who are receiving SSI at the time they applied for disability benefits. The district court\u2019s direction that the Secretary compute and pay disability benefits before computation and payment of SSI benefits precludes application of the SSI windfall offset. The amended version of the SSI windfall offset provision, effective Feb. 1, 1985, <em>see </em>note 2 <em>supra, </em>which was of course not available to the district court at the time of its decision, sets forth the prerequisites for its application in language that is arguably less misleading than the former version, <em>see </em>note 1 <em>supra. See Gallo v. Heckler, </em>600 F.Supp. 1513 (E.D.N.Y. 1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
