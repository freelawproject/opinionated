The district court rejected Giles\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment, as well as her motion for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the government\u2019s case. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-11\">Giles was charged with conspiring to distribute controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) &amp; 846. At trial, the government presented witnesses who testified that they had purchased the substances from Giles. The jury found Giles guilty. The indictment had charged Giles with conspiring to distribute marijuana, cocaine, and quaaludes \u201con or about April, 1981, and continuing through August, 1982, in Harrison County, in the Southern Division of the Southern District of Mississippi, and elsewhere.\u201d Giles contends that the indictment was impermissibly vague as to the time and place of the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-15\">Giles\u2019s first contention is that the indictment is insufficient because: (1) it uses the phrase, \u201con or about\u201d; and (2) it fails to allege precise dates for the operative period of the conspiracy. Giles relies on <em>United States v. Cecil, </em>608 F.2d 1294 (9th Cir. 1979), to support her argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-16\">In <em>Cecil, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit rejected an indictment that alleged conspiracies which began \u201con or before July, 1975,\u201d and continued until \u201con or after October, 1975.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1297; In <em>United States v. McCown, </em>711 F.2d 1441, 1450 (9th Cir.1983), the Ninth Circuit explained that the indictment in <em>Cecil </em>was insufficient because the phrases, \u201con or before\u201d and \u201con or after,\u201d expanded the time frame of the conspiracy indefinitely. The court in <em>McCown </em>specifically approved the use of \u201con or about\u201d to establish the dates of the criminal activity charged there: <em>Id. </em>Moreover, in <em>United States v. Hultgren, </em>713 F.2d 79, 89 (5th Cir.1983), we approved an indictment that alleged a conspiracy which began \u201con or before February 25, 1982,\u201d and continued until \u201con or about March 2, 1982.\u201d Both the Ninth Circuit and this court, therefore, have approved the use of the phrase, \u201con or about.\u201d The phrase did not render Giles\u2019s indictment impermissibly vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-17\">We also reject the second part of Giles\u2019s argument \u2014 that the indictment was insufficient because it failed to allege precise dates for the conspiracy. In <em>United States v. Sutherland, </em>656 F.2d 1181 (5th Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 949, 991, 102 S.Ct. 1451, 1617, 71 L.Ed.2d 663 (1982), we approved an indictment that alleged dates in language substantially similar to that used here. The indictment in <em>Sutherland </em>charged the defendants with criminal acts \u201cthat occurred between November 1975 and January 1980.\u201d 656 F.2d at 1197. \u201cWithin reasonable limits, the precise date of the offense is not required.\u201d <em>Hultgren, </em>713 F.2d at 89 (citing <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number><em>Tunnell, </em>667 F.2d 1182, 1186 (5th Cir. 1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">Giles challenges the use of the phrase, \u201cand elsewhere,\u201d to describe the location of the conspiracy, and again relies on <em>Cecil </em>to support her argument. The indictment rejected by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Cecil </em>alleged conspiracies in \u201cArizona, Mexico, and elsewhere.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1297. The Ninth Circuit did not state that the geographic description was inadequate, however, or that the use of \u201cand elsewhere\u201d created any deficiency in the indictment. In fact, the court implied that the geographic description was sufficient by referring to the description as one of \u201conly two specific allegations concerning the conspiracies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, other courts have approved indictments containing the \u201cand elsewhere\u201d language. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Roman, </em>728 F.2d 846, 853 (7th Cir.) (\u201cCentral District of Illinois and elsewhere\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 2360, 80 L.Ed.2d 832 (1984); <em>United States v. Yonn, </em>702 F.2d 1341, 1348 (11th Cir.) (\u201cNorthern District of Florida and elsewhere\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 104 S.Ct. 283, 78 L.Ed.2d 261 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-11\">An indictment is not impermissibly vague if it informs the defendant of the charge against her and enables her to raise a double jeopardy defense in any future prosecution for the same offense. <em>Yonn, </em>702 F.2d at 1348 (citing <em>Hamling v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 87, 117, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 2907, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974)). The present indictment sufficiently located the offense by charging Giles with criminal activity \u201cin Harrison County, in the Southern Division of the Southern District of Mississippi, and elsewhere.\u201d In view of the use of the conjunctive, \u201cand,\u201d no conspiracy that was unconnected with the activity in Harrison County could be charged or proved. The description was sufficient to enable Giles to prepare her defense, and to enable her to plead double jeopardy against any later prosecution for the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
