The testatrix executed her ivill on the 29th day of July, 1911, and died on March 28, 1914. Mary C. Bhine, a daughter of the testatrix, was appointed executrix and trustee by the will, and on April 13, 1914, letters testamentary were granted to her. A petition was filed by Benjamin Warton, a son and legatee, who alleges that undue influence was used to obtain the execution of the will. It is not alleged that the testatrix was incompetent. The testatrix employed Mr. Balph L. Smith, a member of the bar, as her counsel, to advise her in the making of the will, and to draft it for her. She visited his office and told him how she desired to dispose of her estate; he took memoranda, and afterwards from these prepared the will in accordance with her request. It was delivered by counsel to the testatrix, who informed him that she desired to have it executed at the office of her family physician, Dr. Davis, a reputable man of this city. At the time and place appointed she appeared, and in the presence of Dr. Davis and Mr. Smith, and no person else, executed the will. There was nothing to show that she was not in good physical and mental condition at that time, or that she had been influenced in any manner in disposing of her estate. After the will was executed, the testatrix took it and kept it in her possession, and after her death it was found folded up in an old ledger in her room. So far as the evidence shows, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>person except the testatrix and her counsel knew anything about the contents of the will until after her death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A30\">In Phillips\u2019 Est., 244 Pa. 35, at page 43, it is said:</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ABtc\">\u201cWhen a will is attacked on the ground of undue influence, it is necessary to bear in mind the meaning of the term......; as a legal phrase it is used as denoting ......something violative of legal duty......The word \u2018influence\u2019 does not refer to any and every line of conduct capable of disposing in one\u2019s favor a fully and self-directing mind, but to control acquired over another which virtually destroys his free agency......In order to constitute undue influence sufficient to void a will, there must be imprisonment of the body or mind...... fraud, or threats, or misrepresentations, or circumvention, or inordinate flattery, or physical or moral coercion, to such a degree as to prejudice the mind of the testator, to destroy his free agency and to operate as a present restraint upon him in the making of the will.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AK5\">The only question with which we are concerned in this case is whether there were sufficient facts shown by the evidence, or offered to be shown, which would measure up to the standard of proof required by the law to make void the will of this testatrix. It is noted that when any fraud, sufficient to deprive a will of its legal efficacy, is shown in any case, its undue influence must be present at the time of the execution of the will, and a careful search and consideration of,the testimony, and the offers to prove facts, reveal nothing which does or could indicate that there was any fraud present Avhen the deceased executed her will. ' The subscribing witnesses are both reputable men, and there is not a suggestion that either one of them knew of anything improper which was done, or attempted to be done by any person, either before or at the time of attesting the will. Great reliance was placed upon the fact that the decedent\u2019s daughter declared that she Avould not go for a lawyer at the request of the testatrix in order that she might rewrite her will in her last sickness, and shortly before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>she died; but while this would be relevant if the petitioner had shown that undue influence had been used at the time of the execution of the will by this daughter, or some other person or persons, thereby causing its execution, and if she or they had kept the testatrix imprisoned in body or mind subsequent to the execution of the will and continuously thereafter until her last sickness, when she requested some person to destroy her will and desired to have another written, and was prevented from so doing, yet without such proof, evidence that the daughter refused to call a lawyer to write a new will, is worthless. The weakness of this case is emphasized when we consider that the testatrix kept the possession of her will from its date until her death, almost three years, during which time it could have been destroyed by her at any time, and this together with the absence of any undue influence causing its execution, makes it impossible to conclude that the prayer of the petition should be sustained.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-4\">The register of wills refused the petition for an issue devisavit vel non.

Nothing can be profitably added to the opinion of the court below dismissing the son\u2019s appeal from the probate of the tvill, and on that opinion his appeal to this court is dismissed, at his costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
