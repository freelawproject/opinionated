A motion to quash a writ of alternative mandamus, which calls attention to defects in substance in the petition, is in effect an application to the court to reconsider its conclusion that the substance of a cause has been shown. The lower court has power to qntertain such a motion and to quash the writ if the substance of a case has not been shown.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b577-8\"><em>Corporations </em>\u2014 Ministerial <em>officers </em>\u2014 President\u2014Directors \u2014 <em>Removal of president </em>\u2014 Legality <em>of directors\u2019 action.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b577-9\">3. Ministerial officers of a corporation, who are not elected by the corporation at large for stated terms, but who are appointed by the board of directors, have no franchise in their office and are re-' movable at the pleasure of the directors without the assignment of any cause, without the giving of any notice, and without trial or investigation into the grounds of removal.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b577-10\">4. In mandamus proceedings to eomuel the reinstatement of the president of a corporation, who alleged that he had been unlawfully ousted from office, it appeared that a by-law of the corporation provided that \u201cAny officer may be removed at any regular meeting of the board of directors, provided there be a majority of the total membership of the board in favor of such removal\u201d; and that at a regular meeting of the board the president had been removed by a majority of the directors. Plaintiff contended that his removal was unlawful. The lower court awarded a writ of alternative mandamus. <em>Held, </em>the court properly quashed the writ upon motion of respondent.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b577-11\">Argued Jan. 8, 1917.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ASCI\">Appeal, No. 325, Jan.

Finally, the petitioner averred that, for many reasons, the action of the board of directors in removing him from the office of president was unlawful; and he prayed for the writ of mandamus. The defendants filed their motion to quash upon the ground that the petition \u201cfailed to set forth in substance a case for mandamus; but that, on the contrary, the said petition does set forth facts and circumstances which deny the right to the remedy sought,\u201d since it shows, inter alia, the defendant, company to be a private manufacturing corporation, whose \u201cby-laws, adopted by and agreed to by the stockholders, of which the complainant is one,\u201d provide that the directors shall have power \u201cto select and elect a president,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>and \u201cat any regular meeting by a majority vote of all the directors......to remove any officer of the corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">At the threshold of this case we are met with the question of jurisdiction; but this seems to be ruled in favor of the remedy by mandamus in Com. ex rel. O\u2019Brien v. Gibbons, 196 Pa. 97, 101, where, speaking by Mr. Justice Mitchell, we said: \u201cIt is very earnestly argued by appellants that mandamus will not lie, and that the 'only remedy is by quo Avarr\u00e1nto against the person elected to fill the supposed vacancy. It would be sufficient ansiver to cite the precedent of Zulich et al. v. Bowman, supra [42 Pa. 83], but the remedy is clear\u2018on principle. There is no contest as to the relator\u2019s original title to his seat under a valid election, but only as to the legality of his ouster. If this was not valid, he never has been ousted at all, and mandamus is the proper remedy to prevent his further unlawful exclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Next, the question arises as to the practice pursued in quashing the writ; but this is sustained in Reese v. Board of Mine Examiners, 248 Pa. 617, 620-1, Avhere, on mandamus, we said: \u201cThe motion to quash called attention tt&gt; \u2018defects in substance,\u2019 and Avas, in effect, an application to reconsider the conclusion that the \u2018substance of a case\u2019 had been shown. Of course, the court had power to entertain such an appeal, and from this aspect the proceedings were regular.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">When the case is considered on its merits, we see no virtue in any of the contentions of the appellant. In Brindley v. Walker, 221 Pa. 287, 293, speaking by Mr. Justice Steavakt, Ave said: \u201cMinisterial officers who are not elected by the corporation at large, for stated terms, but who are appointed by the board of directors,...... have .no franchise in their office, and hence, are removable at the pleasure of the directors, .without the assignment of any cause, Avithout the giving of any notice, and Avithout any trial or investigation into the grounds of the removal.\u201d There, in a mandamus proceeding, one who had been removed from the office of secretary and treasurer of a corporation, by its board of directors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>sought to question their action; but we held that \u201cin removing the appellant from the office of secretary and treasurer the board of director^ was exercising a power which rightfully belonged to it; whether it was wisely or considerately exercised is not for us to determine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A81\">We agree with what is so well said in the opinion of the learned court below: \u201cIt cannot be seriously contended that the meeting of August 16th was special; it fell on the regularly recurring date appointed by longstanding rule of procedure adopted by the directors in the due exercise of their quasi statutory authority; having regard to the provisions of the by-laws on the subject of meetings, it cannot be supposed that those only were regular which had to be held quarterly. True, the action complained of was summary; but the obvious answer to any criticism on that score is that it was had according to law enacted by the parties themselves for their own government \u2014 law that had been made at the outset and subject to which plaintiff must be deemed to have taken title. He took nothing in the nature of a vested right either of person or property, but merely title to office in a private corporation, defeasible at the will of his constituents. One cannot see how he can object that such by-law is unreasonable, unless its enforcement would be to the prejudice of some right either legal or equitable which he acquired by virtue of his acceptance of the office; and no such thing appears. It has to do only with the internal management of the corporate body; it was ordained for that purpose by the corpora-tors themselves, and operates equally on all concerned. If the stockholders are not satisfied with its operation, the remedy is in their own hands; but it is a matter with which the courts do not interfere. On the face of his pleadings.......plaintiff\u2019s removal was neither unlawful nor irregular. It follows that the substance of a case for specific relief by mandamus is Avanting, and objection on that ground may be taken by motion to quash.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A3s3\">The assignments of error are overruled, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
