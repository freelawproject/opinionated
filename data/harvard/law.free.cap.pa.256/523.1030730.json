Ealph C. Stewart, trustee, a creditor, appealed.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b559-7\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were in dismissing exceptions to the adjudication, including an exception to the adjudication refusing the surcharge set forth in the preceding portion of the opinion of the adjudicating judge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b559-8\"><em>Charles C.
