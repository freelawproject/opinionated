(hereinafter Global), established its prima facie entitlement to summary judgment. In opposition, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact that Global engaged in the wrongful conduct required for a cause of action to recover damages for tortious interference with contract based on a client\u2019s termination of a terminable-at-will retainer agreement <em>(see Guard-Life Corp. v Parker Hardware Mfg. Corp., </em>50 NY2d 183 [1980]; <em>Waste Servs. v Jamaica Ash &amp; Rubbish Removal Co., </em>262 AD2d 401 [1999]; <em>Koeppel v Schroder, </em>122 AD2d 780 [1986]).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">In addition, the plaintiff did not assert that the defendants RSKCO, Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York, Continental Casualty Insurance Company, and Bunin &amp; DiGiulio employed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>wrongful means to induce a client\u2019s termination of his retainer agreement with it. Accordingly, the plaintiff failed to state a cause of action to recover damages for tortious interference with contract against those defendants. Thus, the Supreme Court properly dismissed the complaint insofar as asserted against those defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit. Florio, J.P., Schmidt, Rivera and Lifson, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
