Three correction officers testified about the incident. The first officer testified that he was escorting defendant, who was agitated, up a stairwell to his cell for keeplock when defendant punched him and then charged at him; during the ensuing struggle, they fell down a flight of stairs, striking another officer. Defendant continued to throw punches, hitting the second officer in the head until he was subdued by a response team. Defendant claimed self-defense, testifying that the struggle was the result of the first officer\u2019s unprovoked assault on him in the stairwell. Sentenced as a second felony offender to two consecutive seven-year terms of imprisonment and two concurrent seven-year terms of imprisonment, defendant now appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">Initially, defendant\u2019s contention that County Court failed to rule on his pretrial request for a <em>Sandoval </em>ruling is unpreserved, as defendant did not raise this claim at trial <em>(see </em>CPL 470.05 [2]; <em>People v Ricks, </em>269 AD2d 851, 851 [2000], <em>lv denied </em>94 NY2d 952 [2000]). In any event, a review of the <em>Sandoval </em>conference as a whole reflects that the court implicitly granted the prosecutor\u2019s request that, should defendant testify, inquiry could be made of defendant regarding his prior felony convictions and sentences for two robberies and attempted sale of cocaine, with brief, reasonable inquiry into the nature of the crimes, and denied defendant\u2019s request to further limit the inquiry. While the court declined to further delineate the permissible boundaries of the inquiry, indicating it would monitor the questions for compliance, we find the court provided the defense with sufficient advance knowledge of the scope of cross-examination <em>(see People v Sandoval, </em>34 NY2d 371, 375 [1974]).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">As contemplated by that ruling, when defendant testified, of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>fering a sharply conflicting version of the incident, thereby placing his credibility in issue, the prosecutor briefly asked him about his prior convictions, which were not similar to the current charges. The prosecutor carefully used the convictions solely to impeach defendant\u2019s credibility as a witness, and virtually no details were elicited about their underlying facts, and we discern no abuse of discretion (see <em>People v Hayes, </em>97 NY2d 203, 207 [2002]; <em>People v Beverly, </em>6 AD3d 874, 876 [2004], <em>lv denied </em>3 NY3d 637 [2004]; <em>People v Willis, </em>282 AD2d 882, 883 [2001], <em>lv denied </em>96 NY2d 869 [2001]).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Defendant\u2019s claims of prosecutorial misconduct based upon certain comments during summation are not preserved, as no objection was raised to them at trial (see CPL 470.05 [2]; <em>People v Jenkins, </em>300 AD2d 751, 753 [2002], <em>lv denied </em>99 NY2d 615 [2003]). Nor is any remedial action warranted as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice, as the prosecutor\u2019s comments did not constitute improper vouching for the officers\u2019 credibility or denigration of the defense but, rather, constituted fair response to defendant\u2019s testimony and the defense theory, including defense counsel\u2019s summation remarks impugning the officers\u2019 credibility <em>(see People v Ruiz, 8 </em>AD3d 831 [2004], <em>lv denied </em>3 NY3d 711 [2004]; <em>cf. People v Ashwal, </em>39 NY2d 105, 109-110 [1976]).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Additionally, as defendant was convicted after a trial, his challenge to the denial of his motion directed at the sufficiency of the proof before the grand jury is precluded <em>(see </em>CPL 210.30 [6]; <em>People v Young, </em>296 AD2d 588, 589 [2002], <em>lvs denied </em>99 NY2d 536, 538, 541 [2002]; <em>People v Bey, </em>179 AD2d 905, 906-907 [1992], <em>lvs denied </em>79 NY2d 918, 1046 [1992]).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">We have considered defendant\u2019s remaining contentions and find they <em>are </em>either unpreserved or without any merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Cardona, P.J., Crew III, Peters and Carpinello, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
