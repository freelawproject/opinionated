Did the fee of the premises pass under the will of Samuel Dnnshee to his executors\u2014to his four sons living at the time of his decease\u2014or to his heirs at law (which latter would include his granddaughter) ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-7\">II. If the fee passed to the execute is, have they a good and sufficient power of sale under the will, so that their deed alone will vest a perfect title in their grantee; and is the power of sale contained in the will operative, upon the facts as submitted ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-8\">III. If the fee passed to the sons or heirs of Samuel Dnnshee, did the share, interest and estate of John Dunshee, one of said sons and heirs in said premises, pass under the said John\u2019s will to his executors, to his widow Catharine, or to his children thereby named ?</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b455-9\"><em>George S. </em>and <em>John H. Stitt, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcZ\">I. Under the will of Samuel Dnnshee, the executors took all his estate, real and personal, with a power to dispose of, sell the same, and convert the same into money. 1. The power of sale is expressly given in the second and fourth clauses. The second is a devise to the executors of his property, to be disposed of\u201d in a certain way; and by the fourth, after his decease, if he should survive his wife, they are directed to sell the real and personal estate. And in the seventh clause, the executors are directed to distribute the <em>balance of the estate in their hands </em>tC equally to\u201d his four sons. The second clause intends not to pay merely funeral expenses and d.ebts, but a disposition or sale and conversion into money to pay those and also the legacies in the fifth and sixth clauses, and to distribute and divide the balance' as provided in the seventh clause. In the fourth clause, the direction that if he should survive his wife they are to -sell within six months after his death, does not make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>their failure to sell within six months destroy their power of sale. Then* power is not conditioned on being performed wjthin that time. 3. The distribution provided in the seventh clause could not be made unless the estate should be converted into money, and a balance adj usted by the addition to the balance, of the bond held against John and the note against William K; A sale was necessary in order to carry out the provisions of the will. The will of Samuel Dunshee makes a clear, absolute devise of all his property to his executors in trust. (1.) To pay debts. (3.) To pay one-third of the net income to the widow during her widowhood. (3.) To pay certain legacies. (4.) To divide the balance in their hands, with the addition thereto of the bond of John and the note of William K., among his four sons, in the way marked out in the seventh, clause (Meakings <em>v. </em>Cromwell, <em>5 N. Y. </em>[1 <em>Seld.], </em>136).</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-5\">II. The will of John, Dunshee (clause 5) gives to his wife his interest in his father\u2019s estate. The sixth clause is void, because it attempts to create a remainder, after giving his wife the whole estate, and allowing her to use and consume the same (1 <em>Jarman on Wills, </em>332).</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-6\">III. It must,\" therefore, follow: 1. That the executors of Samuel Dunshee\u2019swill have, full power to convey the'land in question; or, 3. If they have not, his three surviving sons and the widow of John Dunshee can convey this property to the defendant, and thereby give \u2022 him a good and valid title thereto.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b456-7\"><em>Joseph C. Levi, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzJo\">I. On the death of Samuel Dunshee, the fee vested, notwithstanding the will, in his heirs at law. 1. The testator obviously intended to. pass the fee to his executors in trust, mainly for the benefit of the widow during her widowhood. 3. The only power of sale contained in the will is contingent, dependent on an event which never happened (Richardson <em>v. </em>Sharpe, 29 <em>Barb., </em>222). 3. ISTo other disposition of the real estate is made. The direction in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>the seventh clause to distribute his estate to his sons, obviously refers to personal property, the proceeds of sales of real estate. 4. The power of sale thus being inoperative, and no other devise made, the real estate passed to the heirs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-5\">II. It was evidently the intention of John Dunshee in his will to give his wife only a life estate, and his four children therein named a vested remainder in fee. 1. This hypothesis is consistent with every part of the will. He was evidently bent on ultimately possessing li'is children of his whole estate. If be had intended to give the whole to his wife, he would not have been so solicitous about the equal division among his children by name; and he forbids enforcing the collection of the very property in question, left in the first instance to the wife, if the same should be \u201c detrimental to the interests of my heirs named herein,\u201d showing that the interests of his wife were subordinate in his mind to those of his children. 2. This intention is further manifest from the similarity of the fifth and sixth clauses (which affect the real estate) to the second, third and fourth clauses (which relate only to personal property). The fifth clause is obviously intended to be uniform with the third, and it is so, lacking only the important words \u201c the use and enjoyment during her life.\u201d The court may and will supply these words in the second line of the fifth clause, which would thereby fix the extent and duration of the wife\u2019s interest in the real estate, as the same words in the third' clause do in the personal property. 3. This intention is still further manifest by the distinction in the will between perishable and imperishable property, (a.) The wife is not to have the absolute disposal of even all the personal property. (5.) The second clause gives her all the perishable personal property. (c.) Then comes a distinct clause-giving her only \u201cthe use and enjoyment, during her life,\u201d of all the imperishable personal property, <em>{cl.) </em>The words \u201cor so much as shall remain thereof,\u201d in the fourth clause, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>obviously refer only to the perishable- property bequeathed in the second clause, (e.) The same distinction is intended to be made in the sixtli clause. 4. It'is a rule in the construction of wills, particularly of those inartificially and obscurely drawn, to. advert, in order to discover the intention of' the testator, to his situation at the time of making the will, as to the number of his children, the different kinds of property of which he was seized, &amp;c. (6 <em>Cruise Dig., 158). (a.) </em>Applying this rule to the case in point, what do we find <em>% </em>Taking John Dunshee\u2019s will by itself, it certainly does not look like'an intended will of real estate. (1.) The word devise is not used. (2.) The fifth and sixth clauses would read equally well for a bequest exclusively of personal property. (5.) Taking the dates, and reading the two wills together, it is evident that John Dunshee, in his own will, did not have real estate in his mind. (1.) <em>Prima facie, </em>his father had provided for an equitable conversion of 'all his real into personal estate, and a division of the proceeds among his sons. (2.) This division was to be made on the mother\u2019s death. She had died but a few years previous, and the real estate was wholly or partly unsold. (3.) If he had meant real estate, he would not have spoken of \u201c enforcing the collection of whatever might be due to him,\u201d or have referred to such estate, as <em>\u201c </em>the amount collected thereon, or so much thereof as shall be then remaining.\u201d These last words refer only to the proceeds of sales of his father\u2019s land\u2014not the land itself (Lynes v. Townsend, 33 <em>N. Y., 558). 5. </em>An intent to exclude the heir must be clear and manifest, and must be collected from the words, not from conjecture. It is the policy of the law (after providing for the widow\u2019s dower), as to the bulk of the estate, and as between the widow and the children or heirs, to favor the latter. They should not be excluded from their father\u2019s estate, unless the intent so to exclude them is clear and beyond doubt. The provisions of the Revised Statutes declaring the rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>of after born unprovided issue are an instance of this (Moone <em>v. </em>Heaseman, <em>Willes, </em>141; Hay v. Earl of Coventry, 3 <em>T. R.. </em>83; Moore <em>v. </em>Denn, 2 <em>Bos. &amp; P., </em>247; 5 <em>Abb. N. Y. Dig., </em>Will; Doe <em>v. </em>Dring, 2 <em>Mau. &amp; S., </em>448; Doe <em>v. </em>Wilkinson, 2 <em>D. &amp; E., </em>209; 33 <em>N. Y., </em>558, <em>supra, </em>and cases there cited). <em>f</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b459-5\">III. But apart from the question of intent, the will itself follows the principles herein enunciated. 1. There is no particular ambiguity; it agrees in all its parts. 2. The sixth clause should be read, \u201cAnd at the decease of my said wife, I direct that said property . . . shall be divided equally,\u201d &amp;c., leaving out the intermediate words, which obviously refer only to perishable or personal property (Pond <em>v. </em>Bergh, 10 <em>Paige, </em>140). 3. A devise to a person, in language which would ordinarily convey the whole estate, and a subsequent provision that upon a contingent event the estate thus given shall go to another person, are not repugnant. The latter clause controls the former, and the generaljvords of conveyance are to be understood in a qualified and not in an absolute sense (Hatfield <em>v. </em>Sneden, 42 <em>Barb., </em>615; Jarman's Rules, 5, 6, 10, 19, 21, cifc\u00e9d in 1 <em>Redf., </em>425.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b459-7\">By the Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014Sutherland, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhG3\">Notwithstandzing the devise and bequest, in words, by the second clause of the will of Samuel Dunshee to his executors and executrix, of all his estate, real and personal, his real estate, on his death, vested in his four sons, John, William K., James and Henry W., subject to the gift, by the third clause, to his wife, of one-third of the income of his estate during her widowhood, and this gift, as to his real estate, was, in substance and effect, a devise of one-third of his real estate to her during her widowhood.
