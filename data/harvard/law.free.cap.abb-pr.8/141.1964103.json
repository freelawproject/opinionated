A. Cohen, one of the defendants herein stated, and represented to deponent, and to other creditors of his (defendant\u2019s) firm that they were perfectly solvent and able to pay their debts in full, and by that means they established a credit for themselves by inducing parties to believe that they were then solvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-5\">Believing such statements and representad ms to be true, the plaintiffs sold and delivered to the defendants the'aforesaid amount of goods, and gave them a credit therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-6\">Deponent further saith that within a few days last past said defendants have suspended payment, and are now endeavoring to procure a settlement and compromise with their creditors, including the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-7\">Said defendants now offer twenty cents on a dollar to compromise their indebtedness. They state their indebtedness exceeds the sum of sixty-five thousand dollars, and that their assets will not pay said twenty cents on a dollar of the same, but if accepted by their creditors, they expect, by the aid of friends, they will be able to pay the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-8\">All this amount of indebtedness has been incurred, and goods constituting -the same purchased, since July 1, 1869, most of it since August 1, 1869, thus showing a deficiency of over forty thousand dollars since their aforesaid statement and representations in August and September last, and for this deficiency they cannot, or will not, account, or give any reasonable explanation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-9\">That it is impossible in their business that they could, during said time, have lost or sunk said amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-10\">Deponent further saith that the creditors of said defendants, with a view to arrive at some explanation of said defendants\u2019 affairs, appointed a committee of four to examine into their affairs and their statements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>The said committee have fully-examined the affairs of said defendants, and their books, so fardas they could get possession of same of have access to them, and have made their report. That the most important book for the proper examination of said defendants\u2019 affaiisby said committee, to wit, their cash-book, cannot be had.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-5\">Said defendants pretending to said committee that they have lost the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-6\">From said report, which deponent believes to be correct and true, it appears that said defendants\u2019 purchases from January 1, 1869, to June 30, 1869, were about twenty-eight thousand dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-7\">Their sales during said time about thirty-one thousand dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-8\">That- their purchases from July 1,1869, to November 30, 1869, were about seventy-two thousand dollars, and their sales about sixty-nine thousand dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-9\">That tlieir cash sales from January 1, 1869, to July 1. 1869, were about seven thousand dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-10\">That their cash sales from July 1, 1869, to December 8, 1869, were over thirty-seven thousand dollar*.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-11\">That during the last five months, and since said statement and representations, the said defendants have increased their purchases and sales by over one hundred per cent, of the preceding six months; and the amount of their cash sales during the last five months are over five hundred and fifty per cent, of the preceding six months, and yet a deficiency appears in their assets amounting, as deponent believes, to over forty thousand dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-12\">That the greater part of the sales of defendants since August last have been for cash. That all bills receivable received by them have been converted into cash, and the accounts and claims due them have been collected in previous to their suspension.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-13\">That the amount of cash collected and received, so far as can be ascertained from defendants\u2019 books, without said cash-book (lost as is pretended), is over eighty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>seven thousand dollars, for which they only account .or fifty-eight thousand dollars. _ _</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-5\">_ _ That deponent believes the cash receipts to have been much larger than said committee report; that there is, in their opinion, a deficiency of from twenty thousand dollars to twenty-five thousand dollars, for which said defendants cannot account. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-6\">For \u2022 the reasons aforesaid, deponent alleges and charges that said defendants, with the intent to cheat and defraud the plaintiffs and other creditors, made said false and fraudulent statements, and incurred said indebtedness to deponent\u2019s firm and other cieditors, with a view to cheat and defraud them, and that they have secreted and concealed a large portion of their assets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-7\">And he prays an order of arrest against said defendants. __</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-8\">That-deponent has reason to believe, and fears that said defendants are about to leave this State ; and further, deponent saith not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-9\">\n<em>[Signature.]</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-10\">\n<em>[Jurat.]</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-11\">The affidavit of Otto Jaffe was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-12\">\n<em>[Title of the cause, &amp;c.]</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-13\">Otto Jaffe, being duly sworn, saith he is one of the creditors of the defendants, and one of the committee of four who investigated the affairs of said defendants mentioned in the preceding affidavit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-14\">That the reference in said affidavit to the report and investigation of said committee in the affairs of said defendants are true to the best of deponent\u2019s belief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-15\">That, in'the opinion of deponent and said committee, there is a deficiency of over twenty thousand dollars unaccounted in the assets of said defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-16\">, That said defendants pretend to have lost their cash<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>book.

It is not enough to show fraud, that two or three or four months after a debtor states himself to be solvent, he states that he is now unable to pay more than twenty per cent.; and that is all the affidavit amounts to. Especially when the statement is not alleged to have been made with any purpose of misleading, and appears to have been loosely made; and it is not alleged the parties were misled. The allegation that he has contracted sixty-five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>thousand dollars of debts since July, which he now says he can only .pay twenty per cent, of, amounts to nothing. It is not averred <em>how much value </em>he got for the sixty-five thousand dollars, or what it was for, nor does the statement that <em>\u201c it is impossible to lose so much in defendants' business'' </em>help the case. The rule for the requisites of an affidavit in such a case is well stated by Barbour, Ch. J. (Smith <em>v. </em>Jones, 4 <em>Robt., </em>655). The principle announced would repeal the act to abolish imprisonment for debt quite as effectually as if expressly repealed by the legislature. It must be noticed the action is on contract,. and not for a tort, as the summons shows. The affidavits, moreover, state the sale was on credit, but not on what credit; they state the debt to be <em>due </em>(which is a conclusion of law), not that the credit has expired. , They fail, therefore, to show a cause of action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-5\">II.' Affidavits in which the deponents are made to state so many things as these do which the deponents cannot know, or which are wholly immaterial, should be very strictly construed against the party putting them forward. They should not be sifted carefully to see if, mixed up with the extraneous matter, there are not matters enough stated to hold. The deponents themselves may have been misled by the mass of verbiage into supposing they were only swearing to belief to the matters they have stated positively. If the ground <em>on </em>which the learned justice denied the motion is correct, no such interpretation should be sifted out of these affidavits. Their credibility is wholly destroyed by the extraneous matter.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-6\"><em>D. </em>McMahon, for the respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvH\">I. It is no objection to the facts averred in the affidavits on which the order of arrest was granted, that they are in whole or in part based on information derived from others, if the sources of the information are given (Crandall <em>v. </em>Bryan, 5 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>162). In this case, so far as the fraudulent disposition of property is concerned, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>only the sources of information are given, viz: the defendants\u2019 books, and also the committee man, yet, in addition, the affidavit of the committee man is also given (City Bank <em>v. </em>Lumley, 28 <em>How. Pr., </em>397; Blasan v. Bruno, 33 <em>Barb., 520).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-5\">II. Where a deficiency in value is shown in a .merchant\u2019s stock, it must be inferred that either the defend-1 ants intentionally misrepresented such value, or after-wards made away with a large portion of their property with the design of defrauding their creditors (Wilmerding <em>v. </em>Mooney, 11 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>283).</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-6\">III. The papers presented on an application for an order of arrest on the ground of fraud, need not make1 out every fact entering into the fraud by evidence' which would be competent to establish it on a final recovery (Crandall <em>v. </em>Bryan, 5 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>162).</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-7\">IV. An assertion of solvency, to wit: <em>\u20181 </em>that he. was good and able to pay all that he should contract' for,\u201d is good as a foundation for an order of arrest on' the ground of fraudulently contracting the debt, where' it appeared that the plaintiff sold the goods relying4 . on that representation (Freeman <em>v. </em>Leland, 2 <em>Abb. Pr., </em>479).</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-9\">V. An allegation of solvency, followed soon after by a failure and inability to pay,\u2014such an assignment-held, in the absence of an explanation on the part of the defendant, evidence of the latter\u2019s fraud in incurring the obligation entered*into on the faith of solvency (Scudder <em>v. </em>Barnes, 16 <em>How. Pr., </em>534).</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-10\">VI. Here the defendants make no explanation of their affairs; but move solely on the plaintiffs\u2019 papers. This fact is telling against them.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AES\">By the Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014Ingraham, P.
