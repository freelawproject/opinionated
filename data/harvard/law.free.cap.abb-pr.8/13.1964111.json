It was tried before the court without a jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-12\">The defenses were, that the premises had been taken for the purposes of a public street (Church street; it having been held that the taking of the property for Church street did not divest the title of the landlord so as to prevent him collecting rent for the buildings on the land taken); that on May <em>2, </em>1868, summary proceedings for holding over, &amp;c., were commenced before Justice Quinn, and that on the 7th and 9th of May the issues were tried, and the case finally submitted for adjudication ; and on May 19 that the counsel for the landlord (the plaintiff in this case), without notice to the tenant (the defendant in this case), moved to discon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>timie the proceedings, and that the motion was granted, and the proceedings discontinued.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b26-5\"><em>Daniel Marvin, </em>for the plaintiff;</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4U\">Relied on Carlisle <em>v. </em>McCall, 1 <em>Hilt., </em>399.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b26-6\"><em>Requier &amp; Thomson, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b26-8\">After the discontinuance, the landlord commenced like proceedings before City Judge Russel, for the same purpose, and thereupon the tenant commenced his suit, praying for a perpetual injunction against the landlord, and the court granted a temporary injunction, with the usual order to show cause, &amp;c.; and on the motion to make the injunction perpetual, rendered the following decision;</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">Ingraham, J.\u2014The order of Justice Quinn, discontinuing proceedings, was, I think, the same as a final judgment, which could be reviewed on <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">That proceeding and decision may be .set up in bar of any new proceeding for the same cause, and, if disregarded, the decision on that point can, in like manner, be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">There is no more propriety in granting this injunction than there would be in enjoining an action for the same cause, as has been previously decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-12\">Motion denied, with ten dollars c'osts.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-13\">In the mean while, the proceeding before Judge Russel had been discontinued, and after the decision, like proceedings were commenced before the same judge, and therein, after trial, a warrant was issued and the tenant dispossessed. These proceedings were reviewed on certiorari, and on January 7, 18G9, were reversed by the general term of the supreme court, first district, upon the grounds stated in Judge Ingraham\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b26-7\">Daly, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AY\">After a cause is submitted to a justice for his final decision, it is no longer in the power of the plaintiff to submit to a nonsuit, or in the power of the justice to grant one. The cause, having been tried,, is submitted for a final disposition upon the merits, and no other disposition of it can be made. If the justice, after that, enters an order which he calls a nonsuit, it will be regarded as a judgment for the defendant, and will be a bar to another action for the same cause,- or of any action for another trial of the same question between the same parties ; and in the application of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>rule it makes no difference whether it was in a formal action or in summary proceedings (Elwell <em>v. </em>McQueen, 10 <em>Wend., </em>521; Peters v. Diossy, 3 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>115; Demarest v. Darg, 32 N. <em>Y., </em>290; White v. Coatsworth, 6 <em>Id. </em>[2 <em>Seld.], </em>137).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">In this case the matter in controversy was Med upon \u2022 the merits, and was submitted to the justice for his decision. He did not pass upon the merits, but, as he testifies, after he had the case under advisement to make up his judgment, the counsel for the landlord appeared before him, and moved to discontinue the proceedings, and the justice, without any notice or intimation to the defendant or his counsel, discontinued the proceedings, as he says, and made an entry that they were discontinued, upon the motion of the attorney for the landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">This he had no power to do. It is said in Hess v. Beekman (11 <em>Johns., 457), </em>that \u201cwhile the cause is under advisement, the justice ought to hold no communication with either of the parties;\u201d that \u201cthey are not in court for any purpose except to receive judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">The case having been tried and submitted, the defendant has a right to have the matter decided, the demisi\u00f3n or judgment, if in his favor, being a bar to any further suit or proceeding against him for the same cause, and of this right he cannot be deprived by the justice discontinuing the proceeding, -whether upon his own motion or upon the request of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">The act of the justice in discontinuing is and can only be treated as a decision in favor of the defendant, which, however informal or imperfect it may be, is and must be a bar to any further suit or proceeding for the same 'matter. If this were not the conclusion, and it were held that the proceeding was not discontinued by the act of the plaintiff and the justice, after the matter in controyersy between the parties had been tried and submitted to the justice for a final decision, it would be equivalent to contradicting what has been repeatedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>held, that a nonsuit can not be granted after the cause has been submitted to the justice or to the jury, and that if a judgment of nonsuit is afterwards rendered, either by the .justice or upon the verdict of the jury, it is equivalent to a judgment for the defendant upon the merits, and, will be so regarded (Felter v. Mulliner, <em>2 Johns., </em>181; Hess <em>v. </em>Beekman, 11 <em>Id., </em>457; Young <em>v. </em>Hubbell, 3 <em>Id., </em>430; Platt <em>v. </em>Storer, 5 <em>Id., </em>346; Elwell <em>v. </em>McQueen, 10 <em>Wend., </em>519; Peters <em>v. </em>Diossy, 3 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>115).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">When the case is submitted upon summary proceed-, ings, there must be an. adjudication, for the only power of review is upon a <em>certiorari, </em>to be awarded by the su-. preme court; and by the statute the <em>certiorari </em>is for the examination of any adjudication made upon any appli-. cation authorized by the act providing for summary proceedings <em>(2 Rev. Stat., </em>516, \u00a7 47). . If th\u00bf- matter put in issue by the affidavit denying the facts upon-which the summons issued, has been _tried_and sub-, mitted, and the justice afterwards makes any final disposition of the case other than granting the warrant to dispossess, it is an adjudication in favor of the defend-ant, to which the maxim applies, <em>nemo bis debetvexari pro eadem causa, </em>as fully ,as to any formal decision or j ndgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Judgment will accordingly be rendered for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
