An action was commenced by Duffy, the plaintiff, as assignee, against Louis Wunsch, when the defendant, William Wunsch, agreed that if Duffy, the plaintiff, could be induced to stop his suit, he, the defendant, would pay the balance then due. He then paid part on account, leaving forty dollars due. On this agreement of the defendant, that suit against Louis Wunsch was discontinued ; and the defendant subsequently failing to pay the balance due, this action was commenced and recovery had against him below.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b126-7\"><em>G.

Throop (p. 203) states the distinction substantially as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b125-14\">Whenever the promisor undertakes to respond for any debt or damages for which it is conceded that the third person is also liable, the promise is within the statute, though it may be for the payment of a' definite sum, while the debt or damages for which the third person is liable are indefinite in amount, or even grow out of a wrong committed by him. The promises to pay on discontinuance, which are not within the statute, are those where it clearly appears that the third person <em>\u2018 </em>never was liable to the <em>particular </em>debt,\u2019 although the promise related to and is closely connected with some debt- or demand which the promisee is or claims to be entitled to enforce aaainst him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b126-9\">By the Court.\u2014Ingalls, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACX\">This appeal presents but one question. Whether the verbal promise oftlie defendant to pay the debt which his brother had coni tracted for his own benefit, and on his own account, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>from which the defendant derived no advantage, was void by the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The Revised Statutes (2 <em>R. S., </em>135, \u00a7 2 [5 ed., vol. 3, p. 221]) provide as follows: \u201cIn the following cases every agreement shall be void, unless such agreement, or some note or memorandum thereof, expressing the consideration <em>be in </em>writing, and subscribed by the party to be charged therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u201c 1st. Every agreement that by its terms is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">\u201c2nd. Every special promise to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">The above section was amended in'|1863, so that .the consideration for the agreement need not be expressed therein. It is not pretended that there was any note or memorandum of the defendant\u2019s promise, or that the defendant received any consideration, or derived any benefit on account of his promise to paythe debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Nor that the plaintiff parted with any thing of value,\" or incurred any liability or obligation in consequence of such promise, unless it be_ inferred that he became liable to pay the. costs of the action, which was commenced against the brother of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">There is no proof that he paid the costs of such action. It is very clear that the debt remained uncanceled against Louis Wunsch, and could be collected of him if responsible, so the defendant, at most, became surety for his brother. We are clearly of opinion that the agreement of the defendant was void, not being in writing. It was not an agreement to pay his own debt, but that of his brother, and without any consideration whatever running to the defendant. If it be assumed that the discontinuance of the cause against Louis Wunsch furnished an adequate consideration for the defendant\u2019s promise, the difficulty still remains, because the agreement was not in writing. The case at bar is not, in principle, distinguishable from Mallory v. Gillett, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>21 <em>N. Y., </em>413; Pfeiffer v. Adler, 37 <em>N. </em>Y., 164; Brown <em>v. </em>Weber, 38 <em>N. Y., </em>187.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The judgment should be reversed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
