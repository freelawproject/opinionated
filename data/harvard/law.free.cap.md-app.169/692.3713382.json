The petition at issue here was filed in the Circuit Court for Harford County by Christopher Martino, d/b/a Do-i1&gt;-All Construction, Inc. (\u201cMartino\u201d), the appellant, seeking to establish a mechanic\u2019s lien against \u201cthe property located at 2310 Cullum Road, Bel Air, Maryland 21015-6539\u201d for renovations and repairs Martino had performed there as a subcontractor. The property is owned by Manoochehr and Dottie Ferris Arfaa, the appellees, and the work performed by Martino on the Arfaas\u2019 property was done exclusively on their fire-damaged home.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Based upon the Arfaas\u2019 answer to Martino\u2019s petition, the circuit court dismissed the petition, concluding that the petition failed to include \u201ca description adequate to identify the building,\u201d as required by Maryland Code (1974, 2003 Repl. Vol.), Real Property Article (\u201cRP\u201d), \u00a7 9-105(a)(l)(iv). Because Martino was by that point beyond the time for filing a new lien claim pursuant to RP \u00a7 9-105(a), the circuit court further concluded that the subcontractor could not supplement the building description by amending the petition pursuant to Maryland Rule 12-303, and consequently, it was the opinion of the circuit court that \u201cthe petition to establish a mechanic\u2019s lien should be dismissed as a matter of law.\u201d Because we disagree that Martino\u2019s description of the building was insufficient to satisfy the pleading requirements of RP \u00a7 9-105, we shall vacate the judgment of the circuit court and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Facts and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Dr. and Mrs. Arfaa own a residential property that has a street address of \u201c2310 Cullum Road,\u201d in Bel Air, Harford County, Maryland. According to a print-out from the on-line records of the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation (\u201cSDAT\u201d), a copy of which was attached as an exhibit to Martino\u2019s petition, the Arfaas\u2019 property has a mailing address of 2310 Cullum Rd, Bel Air MD 21015-6539. The SDAT print-out provides the following additional details regarding the subject property. The property was acquired by a deed dated 08/23/1985, having a recording reference of [Liber]1283/[folio]283. The property consists of 73.77 acres of land, and appears on tax map 57, grid 2E, as parcel 50. The property is improved by a primary structure, which, as of the then most recent update of the assessment records, was a two-story brick building built in 1920, having 4,552 square feet of enclosed space. The print-out made no mention of any accessory structures or additional buildings on the parcel of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">On August 21, 2002, the Arfaas\u2019 house at 2310 Cullum Road was damaged by fire. The Arfaas hired Belfor USA Group, Inc. (not a party to this case) to oversee the repairs and renovations that were planned for their property. As the Arfaas\u2019 general contractor, Belfor entered into a contract with the Keith Parker Construction Company (not a party to this case) to perform the repair and renovation work. Parker Construction hired Martino as a subcontractor to perform a substantial portion of the renovation work on the 2310 Cullum Road house.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">As of July 18, 2003, Martino had completed approximately nine weeks of work on the Arfaas\u2019 property. According to Martino\u2019s petition, the work performed by his company as a subcontractor \u201cincluded extensive demolition work, reconstruction of numerous walls and rooms, framing of windows, framing of doorways, hallways, framing of chimney, construction of walls, installation of roof trusses, furring of hardwood floors, installation of] subflooring, construction of exterior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>walls, construction of dormers, installation of skylights, etc.\u201d Martino invoiced Parker $93,145 for work and materials, but was paid only $23,650, which covered only the first three weeks of work and left an unpaid balance due Martino in the amount of $69,495.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">On October 7, 2003, as required by RP \u00a7 9-104, Martino served the Arfaas with a notice of Martino\u2019s intention to claim a lien in the amount of $69,495. Attached to the notice were copies of invoices addressed to \u201cKeith Parker Construction,\u201d totaling $69,495. Although the invoices varied by week number and amount, they were otherwise identical in form and content. They stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">This is an invoice for week [number] of demolition and rehabilitations on Dr. ARFAA\u2019s [sic] Home!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">There is a list of things that were done this past week, and the amount for the invoice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\">The amount for this invoice is [amount].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-9\">See pages attached!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">On December 29, 2003, within 180 days after the last day Martino performed work on the Arfaas\u2019 property, Martino filed in the Circuit Court for Harford County a petition to establish a mechanic\u2019s lien. The petition stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-11\">NOW COMES the petitioner, Christopher Martino, d/b/a Do-It-All Construction, Inc ----and hereby petitions the Court to establish a mechanic\u2019s lien on the property located at 2310 Cullum Road, Bel Air, Maryland 21015, pursuant to Md.Code, Real Property, \u00a7 9-105 (2003). In support of this petition, the Petitioner hereby avers that the following facts are true to the best of his knowledge:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-14\">1. The property located in Harford County at 2310 Cullum Road, Bel Air, Maryland 21015-6539 is owned by Dr. Manooehehr Arfaa and Mrs. Dottie Arfaa (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Arfaas\u201d). <em>(See </em>Exhibit A [the printout from the records of SDAT]).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>2. This property is further identified as Map 57, Grid 2E, Parcel 50 by the Maryland Department of Taxation and Assessments. <em>(Id.).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-4\">3. The property owned by the Arfaas is under renovation as a result of an insurance loss....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">7. Work was completed by [appellant] on or about July 18, 2003, and this Petition is timely filed in accordance with Md.Code, Real Property, \u00a7 9-105 (2003).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">10. The work performed by [appellant] included extensive demolition work, reconstruction of numerous walls and rooms, framing of windows, framing of doorways, hallways, framing of chimney, construction of walls, installation of roof trusses, furring of hardwood floors, installed subflooring, construction of exterior walls, construction of dormers, installation of skylights, etc. <em>(See </em>Exhibit B; <em>see also </em>Exhibit C, Photographs of work in progress).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-7\">12. A copy of the Notice to Owner or Owner\u2019s Agent of Intention to Claim an [sic] Lien ... is attached hereto as Exhibit B. Additionally, evidence of the service by certified mail on the named property owner is included in Exhibit B. Additionally, a copy of the Notice was posted on the property in accordance with Md.Code, Real Property, \u00a7 9-104 (2003)....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\">WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court impose a mechanic\u2019s lien in the amount of $69,495.00 on the property located at 2310 Cullum Road, Bel Air, Maryland 21015-6539 located in Harford County, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">Attached to the petition was the Maryland SDAT record describing the property, an affidavit of Martino, the notice to the Arfaas of the subcontractor\u2019s intention to claim a lien, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>construction notes, invoices, and change orders. Exhibit C to the petition consisted of 47 pages of photocopies of photographs of the building in various stages of construction. There were three photographs on each page, <em>ie., </em>141 photographs in all. The photographs depicted several views of the structure, and, as a group, show a very substantial\u2014and possibly unique\u2014home with distinctive architectural features such as very large columns, or pillars, at one facade.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">On February 4, 2004, the Arfaas filed an answer to the petition, in which they denied having hired Martino, and further asserted that they had paid Belfor for any work claimed by Martino. In their answer, the Arfaas emphasized: \u201cDr. and Mrs. Arfaa are <em>NOT </em>in control of the business practices between Belfor USA/Inrecon and their subcontractors. <em>If the Petitioner was not paid by Keith Parker Construction Company, it has NO association with Dr. and Mrs. Arfaa\u2019s bona fide purchases of the value of the work completed at their property where they hold legal title.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) The Arfaas also attached to their answer a number of exhibits regarding their contractual relationship with Belfor.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">On many of the exhibits attached by the Arfaas, their mailing address appears to be \u201c2310 Cullum Rd., Bel Air, Md. 21015.\u201d Moreover, one of the exhibits, the work authorization for Belfor to proceed with the repairs, includes this reference to the subject property: \u201c[The Arfaas] represent ] that [ ]they are owners of ... the hereinafter specified property ... and hereby authorize and direct Belfor USA Group, Inc. (\u2018Contractor\u2019) to provide all labor, equipment and materials required to properly repair the specified real property, contents or structure commonly known as: 2310 Cullum Rd., Bel Air, MD. 21015.\u201d In other exhibits attached by the Arfaas, including correspondence from Dr. Arfaa to Belfor, the renovation project is referred to as \u201cJob: 2310 Cullum Road, Bel Air, MD.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">The exhibits attached to the Arfaas\u2019 answer also indicate that the Arfaas paid Belfor in excess of the amount claimed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>Martino subsequent to October 7, 2003, the date Martino served the Arfaas with notice of Martino\u2019s intent to claim a lien. Indeed, Dr. Arfaa\u2019s letter to Belfor dated January 7, 2004, not only enclosed a progress payment of $50,000, but also advised Belfor that the Arfaas had been served with Martino\u2019s petition, and disclaimed any \u201cresponsibility to pay for such monies owed to [Belfor\u2019s] subcontractors.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">On February 20, 2004, the circuit court ordered the Arfaas to show cause show why a lien should not attach to the property described in Martino\u2019s petition in the amount requested by that petition. The court scheduled a hearing for April 13, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Before the April 13th hearing began, Mrs. Arfaa, who served as counsel for the Arfaas, hand-delivered to Martino\u2019s counsel a sworn \u201cAmended Answer to Petition for Mechanic\u2019s Lien.\u201d The amended answer asserted in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-7\">Neither the Petitioner\u2019s Notice or Petition describe the building upon which they desire a Mechanic\u2019s Lien, but merely state they want a Mechanic\u2019[s] Lien on the property at 2310 Cullum Road, Bel Air, Maryland 21015. The Arfaa[s\u2019] property consists of 73 + acres and it contains three separate buildings. The Petition must be dismissed as a matter of law because ... it fails on its face to describe the building or buildings and its location on the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-8\">... Additionally, the Petitioner\u2019s Petition for a Mechanic\u2019s Lien cannot be amended by leave of the court because it is beyond the 180 days deadline or [sic] any such amendment would materially alter the property that is the subject of the pleading.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Also on April 13, 2004, the court heard brief argument on the legal issues, and held the matter <em>sub curia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">On June 8, 2004, the court issued a written memorandum and order that dismissed Martino\u2019s petition. After observing that, \u201c[i]n general, the burden is on the claimant to establish its entitlement to a mechanic\u2019s lien,\u201d the court found that Martino had not satisfied that burden because his \u201cpetition fail[ed] to adequately identify the building upon which the lien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>is sought.\u201d Although the petition included numerous exhibits, including invoices for the work performed, pictures of the work performed, and affidavits of service, the court noted that, \u201c[w]ithin these exhibits, there is nothing which describes the building upon which the work was performed in a manner sufficient to identify the specific building.\u201d The court observed that the only reference to a specific building on the property was a statement in the affidavit of service that a copy of the \u201cNotice to Owner or Owner\u2019s Agent of Intention to File a Lien\u201d was served by posting on \u201cthe door of the <em>residence </em>located at 2310 Cullum Road\u201d (emphasis added). That, the court declared, \u201cis not sufficient.\u201d \u201c[I]t is not clear from the pleadings,\u201d the court explained, \u201cwhich of the three buildings on the property qualifies as the \u2018residence\u2019 of the [Arfaas],\u201d and therefore, the court concluded, the petition does not \u201csatisfy the requirement of a \u2018description adequate to identify the building\u2019 of Real Property \u00a7 9-105(a)(l)(iv).\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Further, the court held, the petition could not be amended to more fully identify the building, because the time for filing such a \u201cmaterial\u201d amendment had run. <em>See </em>RP \u00a7 9-112; Maryland Rule 12-303. Accordingly, the court dismissed the petition as \u201cfacially defective.\u201d It noted, however, that Martino\u2019s \u201cclaim for work done and/or materials furnished is still viable and this case should proceed to trial or other disposition on that claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Thereafter, Martino filed a motion for reconsideration. After that motion was denied by order dated July 28, 2004, Martino filed a Motion for Entry of Final Judgment. In that motion, Martino conceded that, apart from his claim for a subcontractor\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien, \u201che does not have any direct contract claim against the Arfaas. For this reason, there is nothing left to adjudicate between the Plaintiff and these Defendants.\u201d Opposing that motion, the Arfaas argued that the court\u2019s \u201c[o]rders of June 8 and July 28, 2004 [were] final judgments disposing of all of the in rem claims between all of the parties \u2014 \u201d The circuit court apparently agreed with Martino on this point, and, on October 12, 2004, entered \u201cfinal judgment,\u201d after which Martino noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">We must first review the timeliness of Martino\u2019s notice of appeal. After explaining why the appeal was timely filed, we shall review the requirements of RP \u00a7 9\u2014105(a)(1)(iv), and explain why we conclude that Martino\u2019s petition set forth a legally adequate description of the land and building.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">1. Timeliness of Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The Arfaas assert that Martino\u2019s appeal was not timely filed. If they were correct, we would be without jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Accordingly, we have reviewed the circuit court\u2019s orders and the docket entries to determine whether this appeal was timely filed. We have concluded that the appeal was timely, not because of the purported entry of \u201cfinal judgment\u201d on October 12, 2004, but rather because of the operation and effect of Maryland Rule 2-601. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Rule2-601(b) directs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-8\">The clerk shall enter a judgment by making a record of it in writing on the file jacket, or on a docket within the file, or in a docket book, according to the practice of each court, <em>and shall record the actual date of the entry. That date shall be the date of the judgment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">(Emphasis added.) Consequently, it is not the date that the judge signs an order that controls the deadline for filing an appeal; nor is it the time-stamp date that is placed upon the order when it is filed with the clerk\u2019s office that controls. Pursuant to the plain language of Rule 2-601 (b), the date of the judgment is the actual date on which the judgment is entered on the docket, and it is that date that begins the 30 day period for filing a notice of appeal pursuant to Rule 8-202(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">In the present case, the circuit court judge signed an order reflecting that Martino\u2019s petition was \u201cdenied\u201d on June 8, 2004. That order bears a stamp reflecting that the signed order was also \u201cfiled\u201d on June 8, 2004. The docket entries, however, indicate that that order was entered on the docket on June 11, 2004. That latter date would have begun the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>for Martino to note an appeal if he had not filed a motion for reconsideration within ten days after June 11, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">As permitted by Rule 2-535, Martino did file a motion for reconsideration of the court\u2019s June 8 order. That motion bears a stamp reflecting that it was filed with the clerk\u2019s office on June 17, 2004. Because that motion was filed within ten days after entry of the judgment on the docket, Rule 8-202(c) provides that the time for Martino to file a notice of appeal was extended until 30 days after disposition of the motion. <em>See </em>Committee Note to Rule 8-202, stating: \u201cA motion filed pursuant to Rule 2-535, if filed within ten days after entry of judgment, will have the same effect as a motion filed pursuant to Rule 2-534, for purposes of this Rule. <em>Unnamed Atty. v. Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n, </em>303 Md. 473, [486,] 494 A.2d 940 (1985); <em>Sieck v. Sieck, </em>66 Md.App. 37, [42-44,] 502 A.2d 528 (1986) .\u201d <em>Accord Alitalia v. Tornillo, </em>320 Md. 192, 200, 577 A.2d 34 (1990) (\u201ca Rule 2-535 motion, if filed within 10 days of the entry of judgment by the court, will be treated as a Rule 2-534 motion and have the same effect on appeal time\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Rule 8-202(c) specifies that a post-judgment motion must be \u201cfiled,\u201d rather than \u201cdocketed,\u201d within the ten day time limit of 2-534 in order to stay the deadline for noting an appeal. Accordingly, Martino\u2019s motion for reconsideration, \u201cfiled\u201d on June 17, 2004, suspended the time for noting an appeal even though the motion was not docketed until September 15, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">The circuit court denied the motion for reconsideration by signing an order that was dated July 28, 2004. That order bears a stamp reflecting that it was \u201cfiled\u201d with the clerk on July 28, 2004. Pursuant to Rule 2-601(b), however, the effective date of that order as a judgment was the date it was entered on the docket, <em>i.e., </em>September 15, 2004. Martino\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on October 14, 2004, within 30 days after the clerk docketed the disposition of the motion for reconsideration. Accordingly, Martino\u2019s appeal was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">Before filing his notice of appeal, however, Martino, on September 17, 2004, filed a motion \u201cpursuant to Maryland Rule 2-602(b) for the entry of final judgment,\u201d contending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>that the court\u2019s comment about the possibility of Martino pursuing alternative claims \u201cfor work done and/or materials provided\u201d left open an unresolved claim in the case. The Arfaas disagreed with that assertion, and so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The only complaint filed by Martino in this case\u2014the petition\u2014has a single specific claim for relief, <em>viz.: </em>\u201cPetitioner respectfully requests that this Court impose a mechanic\u2019s lien in the amount of $69,495.00 on the property located at 2310 Cullum Road, Bel Air, Maryland 21015-6539 located in Harford County, Maryland.\u201d Consequently, notwithstanding the circuit court\u2019s comment about not foreclosing the possibility of Martino pursuing alternative claims, no alternative claims for relief were ever asserted in the complaint in this case. The court\u2019s denial of the petition for a mechanic\u2019s lien, therefore, disposed of all pending claims against all served parties, and no further order pursuant to Rule 2-602 was required. Nor did the entry of such a surplus order in this case extend the time for filing an appeal. Because we have determined that Martino\u2019s notice of appeal was timely for other reasons, however, the entry of the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d order, docketed October 13, 2004, was a harmless nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">2. Sufficiency of Mechanic\u2019s Lien Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Martino contends that the circuit court erred in dismissing his Petition for Mechanic\u2019s Lien for failing to adequately describe the building as required by RP \u00a7 9-105(a)(l)(iv). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">RP \u00a7 9-105(a) describes the information that must be included in a petition seeking a mechanic\u2019s lien. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-9\">... The proceedings shall be commenced by filing with the clerk, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-10\">(1) A petition to establish the mechanic\u2019s lien, which shall set forth at least the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-11\">(i) The name and address of the petitioner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-12\">(ii) The name and address of the owner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>(iii) The nature or kind of work done or the kind and amount of materials furnished, the time when the work was done or the materials furnished, the name of the person for whom the work was done or to whom the materials were furnished and the amount or sum claimed to be due, less any credit recognized by the petitioner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-5\">(iv) A description of the land, including a statement whether part of the land is located in another county, and a description adequate to identify the building; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\">(v) If the petitioner is a subcontractor, facts showing that the notice required under \u00a7 9-104 of this subtitle was properly mailed or served upon the owner, or, if so authorized, posted on the building. If the lien is sought to be established against two or more buildings on separate lots or parcels of land owned by the same person, the lien will be postponed to other mechanics\u2019 liens unless the petitioner designates the amount he claims is due him on each building;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\">(2) An affidavit by the petitioner or some person on his behalf, setting forth facts upon which the petitioner claims he is entitled to the lien in the amount specified; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-8\">(3) Either original or sworn, certified or photostatic copies of material papers or parts thereof, if any, which constitute the basis of the lien claim, unless the absence thereof is explained in the affidavit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">The circuit court accepted the Arfaas\u2019 argument that Martino\u2019s petition was fatally deficient with respect to its description of the specific building upon which a lien was sought. After noting that the Arfaas had stated in their answer that \u201cthere are three separate buildings located on the property at 2310 Cullum Road,\u201d the court further observed that \u201c[t]he Petitioner continually references the <em>property </em>upon which the work was completed, yet at no point does the petition specify a <em>building </em>upon which the work was performed and the materials were furnished.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The court concluded that, even with the exhibits, \u201cit is not clear from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>pleadings which of the three buildings on the property qualifies as the \u2018residence\u2019 of the [Arfaas].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">In response to Martino\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the circuit court maintained its position that the petition was inadequate as a matter of law, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">While the photographs attached to the petition may help to clarify the building upon which the lien was intended to be sought by the Petitioner, the photographs do not situate the building in a \u201creasonable local[e]\u201d on the 73 acres of the Defendants\u2019 property, as noted in <em>Scott &amp; Wimbrow v. Wisterco Inv., Inc., </em>36 Md.App. 274, 373 A.2d 965, 969-70 (1977). Further, the Court\u2019s reliance in the previous opinion on <em>Mervin L. Blades &amp; Son, Inc. v. Lighthouse Sound Marina and Country Club, </em>37 Md.App. 265, 377 A.2d 523 (1977) was not improper. In that case, a mechanic\u2019s lien was denied when a claim for a lien against a \u201cbuilding or buildings\u201d was found noncompliant with the Maryland statutes. Here, the lien describes the \u201cproperty\u201d of the Defendants as the subject of the lien. Further, the photographs attached do not clearly distinguish the residence of the Defendants from any of the other buildings on their property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">We described the standard for appellate review of a grant of a motion to dismiss a mechanic\u2019s lien claim as follows in <em>Gravett v. Covenant Life Church, </em>154 Md.App. 640, 645, 841 A.2d 342 (2004):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\">\u201cThe proper standard for reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss is whether the trial court was legally correct.

State Bd. of Dental Exam\u2019rs, </em>351 Md. 66, 71-72, 716 A.2d 258 (1998) (citations omitted). In reviewing the complaint, we must \u201cpresume the truth of all well-pleaded facts in the complaint, along with any reasonable inferences derived therefrom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72, 716 A.2d 258; <em>see also Bennett Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, Inc. v.

State, </em>346 Md. 706, 709, 697 A.2d 1371 (1997).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">In our view, in light of the legislature\u2019s express statement in RP \u00a7 9-112 that the mechanic\u2019s lien statute \u201cis remedial and shall be so construed to give effect to its purpose,\u201d the circuit court erred in concluding that Martino\u2019s description of the building was so woefully inadequate as to require dismissal of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The need for a liberal construction of the mechanic\u2019s lien law for the protection of subcontractors was explained by Judge Wilner, writing for the Court of Appeals in <em>Winkler v. Jerome, </em>355 Md. 231, 246-47, 734 A.2d 212 (1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">The mechanic\u2019s lien law has historically been construed \u201cin the most liberal and comprehensive manner in favor of mechanics and materialmen.\u201d <em>T. Dan Kolker, Inc. v. Shure, </em>209 Md. 290, 296, 121 A.2d 223, 226 (1956) and cases cited therein. Indeed, the law itself provides that it is remedial and is to be construed to give effect to its purpose. \u00a7 9-112. The need for a liberal construction is particularly important with respect to subcontractors who, though benefitting the owner and enhancing the value of the owner\u2019s property by the provision of their labor or materials, have no direct contractual relationship with the owner and therefore cannot otherwise subject the owner\u2019s property or assets to the payment of their claims. That bent of the statute in favor of subcontractors has always been subject to the caveat, however, that, as a mechanic\u2019s lien was unknown at common law and is purely a creature of statute, it is \u201cobtainable only if the requirements of the statute are complied with.\u201d <em>Freeform Pools v. Strawbridge, </em>228 Md. 297, 301, 179 A.2d 683, 685 (1962); <em>Aviles v. Eshelman Elec. Corp., </em>281 Md. 529, 536, 379 A.2d 1227, 1231 (1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>The Court further stated in <em>Winkler, id. </em>at 251-52, 734 A.2d 212:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-4\">We adhere to the view that, in general, the burden is on the claimant to establish its entitlement to a lien and that the owner bears no ultimate burden to negate that entitlement. We also believe, however, as we held in <em>Reisterstown Lumber v. Tsao, supra, </em>319 Md. 623, 574 A.2d 307, that the mechanic\u2019s lien law should not be construed in such a way as to make the burden on the claimant so difficult as effectively to withdraw the remedy that the Legislature has clearly provided....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Accordingly, we are called upon to interpret the statute in a manner that does not absolve the subcontractor of his obligation to satisfy the statutory requirements for obtaining the lien, and at the same time, does not make that burden so onerous that the remedy is effectively withdrawn. The specific statutory requirement as to which the circuit court found Martino\u2019s petition lacking was the requirement that the petition include \u201c[a] description of the land, including a statement whether part of the land is located in another county, and a description adequate to identify the building.\u201d Mindful that this case was disposed of on the Arfaas\u2019 motion to dismiss, we agree with Martino that his petition was sufficient to state a prima facie claim that he was entitled to a subcontractor\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien on the property known as 2310 Cullum Road, Bel Air, Maryland 21015-6539 located in Harford County, Maryland. The petition\u2019s inclusion of the mailing address for the Arfaas\u2019 residence (with both a street number and a 9 digit zip code), as well as a tax map parcel number, and a print-out from the SDAT with unique descriptive information, together with 141 photographs depicting distinctive features of the subject structure, were sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. <em>Cf. Johns Hopkins Hosp. v. Pepper, </em>346 Md. 679, 698, 697 A.2d 1358 (1997) (\u201cUnder our liberal rules of pleading, a plaintiff need only state such facts in his or her complaint as are necessary to show an entitlement to relief. Md. Rule 2-303(b)\u201d). The photographs incorporated by reference into the petition were as effective in describing the distinctive features <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>of the subject building as a narrative description would have been. <em>Cf. </em>Rule 2\u2014303(d) (\u201cA copy of any written instrument that is an exhibit to a pleading is a part thereof for all purposes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The Arfaas\u2019 reference in their answer to \u201cthree separate buildings\u201d on the property was a red herring. The Arfaas never described the other two buildings, never asserted that there are three \u201chouses\u201d at 2310 Cullum Road, and never asserted that more than one building on their property resembled in any way the structure shown in the 141 photographs. That structure was a distinctive, large home, with large columns on one facade. Given the fact that the Arfaas\u2019 property was referred to as \u201cagricultural\u201d on the SDAT print-out, the other two buildings may well have been a barn and a storage shed. (And the structure shown in the 141 photographs could not be confused with such ancillary buildings.) At most, the Arfaas\u2019 reference to additional buildings on the property introduced disputed facts beyond the four corners of the petition, and was not a reason to enter a final order denying the lien pursuant to RP \u00a7 9-106(b)(2). <em>Cf. Tyson v. Masten Lumber &amp; Supply, </em>44 Md.App. 293, 303, 408 A.2d 1051 (\u201cAt that [show cause hearing] stage, the court is to decide whether there is a genuine dispute of a material fact.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>287 Md. 758 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Similarly, the Arfaas\u2019 emphasis of the fact that their lot was a 73+ acre parcel was not a sufficient reason for the circuit court to deny the lien altogether. Even though the lien statute still refers to establishing a lien against the \u201cbuilding,\u201d there is generally no separate registration of title for building improvements in Maryland (notable exceptions being condominiums and time shares), and the transfer of ownership of a house such as the Arfaas\u2019 is generally effected by a conveyance of title to the underlying land. Accordingly, a conveyance of the Arfaas\u2019 house would normally be accomplished by a deed conveying the same 73 + acre parcel they purchased in 1985 \u201ctogether with the improvements thereon.\u201d In the wake of modern subdivision laws enacted over the past few decades, if less than the entire acreage is to be conveyed, an owner of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>large parcel of land must subdivide the parcel in order to convey a legal lot. Consequently, we cannot say, based upon the record in this case, that Martino\u2019s petition claiming a lien against the Arfaas\u2019 entire parcel was either an excessive claim or defectively imprecise.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Additionally, the mechanic\u2019s lien statute and Maryland Rules set forth a procedure for defining the boundaries of the land to be subject to the lien if the entire parcel on which the subject building is located contains more land than is reasonably necessary for the use and enjoyment of the building. The boundaries of the property to which the lien will attach can be designated pursuant to RP \u00a7 9-103, which provides, in part <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">(a) A lien established in accordance with this subtitle shall extend to the land covered by the building and to as much other land, immediately adjacent and belonging in like manner to the owner of the building, as may be necessary for the ordinary and useful purposes of the building. The quantity and boundaries of the land may be designated as provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-7\">(b) An owner of any land who desires to erect any building or to contract with any person for its erection may define, in writing, the boundaries of the land appurtenant to the building before the commencement of construction, and then file the boundaries for record with the clerk of the circuit court for the county. The designation of boundaries shall be binding on all persons. If the boundaries are not designated before the commencement of a building, the owner of the land or any person having a lien or encumbrance on the land by mortgage, judgment, or otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>entitled to establish a lien in accordance with this subtitle may apply, by written petition, to the circuit court for the county to designate the boundaries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Implementing RP \u00a7 9-103, Maryland Rule 12-308 sets out the procedures to be followed to designate the boundaries of the subject parcel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>In <em>Bounds v. Nuttle, </em>181 Md. 400, 410, 30 A.2d 263 (1943), the circuit court applied the principle of limiting the amount of land to which the lien would attach. In that case, the entire tract of land was 30.45 acres, but the parties stipulated, after having the property surveyed, that 1.75 acres \u201cwas the proper amount of land to be sold for the ordinary and useful purposes of the new building.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Similarly, in <em>Filston Farm Co. v. Henderson, </em>106 Md. 335, 372-76, 67 A. 228 (1907), the Court of Appeals held that the land subject to the mechanic\u2019s lien established in connection with the construction of a school building should be limited to 200 acres, rather than the entire 1,293 acres owned by the school. The Court noted that \u201cthe extent of the lien should be determined by the ordinary and probable uses to which [the building] will be put.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 374, 67 A. 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The Court of Appeals declined to reverse an order for the sale of property subject to a mechanic\u2019s lien when the property owner alleged too much property had been liened in <em>Fulton v. Parlett, </em>104 Md. 62, 64 A. 58 (1906). Pointing out that the owner had failed to take advantage of the statute\u2019s procedures for designating boundaries, the Court held that the material-man\u2019s claim for a lien against excess land at the time the lien was filed was not fatal to the validity of the lien, stating, <em>id. </em>at 69-70, 64 A. 58:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">It is insisted that the decree is wrong because more land was directed to be sold than was necessary for the ordinary and useful purposes of the buildings. Not only does a mechanics\u2019 lien attach to the buildings but it extends also to the ground covered by such buildings and to so much other ground immediately adjacent thereto and belonging in like manner to the owner of such buildings as may be necessary for the ordinary and useful purposes of such building. <em>Code </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>1904, <em>Art. </em>63, <em>sec. 4. </em>The manner in which the quantity and the boundaries of such contiguous ground shall be ascertained is prescribed by <em>secs. 5, 6, 7 </em>and <em>8. </em>By <em>sec. </em>5 the owner of the land may, prior to the commencement of the work on the building, define in writing the boundaries of the curtilage appurtenant to the building and file the same with the Clerk of the Circuit Court for the county in which the land lies, \u201cand such designation of boundaries shall be obligatory upon all persons concerned.\u201d In default of such designation by the owner, then under <em>sec. 6, </em>\u201cit shall be lawful for the owner * * * or for any person * * * entitled to a hen by virtue of this article, to apply by petition in writing to the Judge of the Circuit Court for the county * * * to designate the boundaries;\u201d and <em>sec. 7 </em>directs what shall be done when such a petition has been filed. In the pending case the owner did not designate under <em>sec. 5 </em>any boundaries prior to work being commenced on the buildings; nor did the owner or the claimant file a petition under <em>sec. 6 </em>to have the boundaries defined in the manner prescribed in <em>sec. 7. </em>By <em>sec. 8 </em>it is declared that \u201cif any proceedings shall be instituted to enforce any hen under this article before the boundaries of the lot, land or curtilage which ought to be appurtenant thereto shah be designated, it shall be lawful for the Court upon apphcation to stay such proceedings until such designation shall be made * * *.\u201d No apphcation was made to the Court under this section. There was [sic] three opportunities open to the owner for marking the boundaries of the curtilage which ought to be appurtenant to the buildings, and not one of them was availed of. If the decree should be reversed because the boundaries had not been designated, then the failure of the owner to exercise a right in this particular which she ought to have resorted to before the decree was signed, will be treated as an error in the decree itself. The owner\u2019s own default would then vacate the decree. It was within the power of the owner before the decree was passed to prevent its passage until after the boundaries had been defined if she had proceeded under <em>sec. 8; </em>and her neglect to rely on the provisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>that section cannot be assigned as a valid reason for reversing the decree. There was evidence adduced tending to prove that the whole of the tract of land owned by Mrs. Fulton was necessary for the ordinary and useful purposes of the buildings and improvements, and there was also evidence to the contrary. The decree directed only the six acre parcel to be sold. We cannot say there was any error in this; and the owner must be held to have waived all objection to the decree founded on the omission to demark the boundaries, because she neglected to invoke in due season the provisions of the sections to which we have alluded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The Court of Appeals applied a similar rule in <em>Caltrider v. Isberg, </em>148 Md. 657, 130 A. 53 (1925), again holding that the fact that the lien claimant had filed for a lien against more land than was necessary for the ordinary and useful purpose of the subject dwelling houses did not invalidate the lien. Noting that the chancellor had dismissed the lien claim because of \u201c[insufficiency of description of the property,\u201d the Court of Appeals stated that that reason \u201cis not in our opinion valid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 663, 130 A. 53. The Court continued, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3_\">The claim as filed describes several lots by numbers designated upon a plat duly recorded among the land records of Harford County, the liber and folio being given, and also refers to the deeds by which they were conveyed. It was not necessary to state specifically that they were contiguous lots, and the fact that they may have contained more land than was necessary does not affect the validity of the lien. Provision is made by sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 of article 63 of the Code for having proper boundaries fixed on proper application by the owner both before and pending proceedings for the enforcement of a mechanic\u2019s lien and, if he fails to avail himself of these provisions, he cannot avoid the lien merely because too much land is claimed. <em>Fulton v. Parlett, </em>104 Md. at 70, 64 A. 58.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">In holding that Martino\u2019s petition was inadequate as a matter of law, the circuit court relied primarily on two 1977 cases that were decided by this Court in the wake of the 1976 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>revisions to Maryland\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien statute, made necessary by the ruling in <em>Barry Properties v. Fick Bros., </em>277 Md. 15, 353 A.2d 222 (1976). In <em>Barry, </em>the Court of Appeals declared unconstitutional the provisions in the former statute that (a) made the lien effective immediately upon performance of the work and (b) permitted the claimant to simply file a statement of the lien with the clerk of court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The year after <em>Barry Properties </em>was decided, two cases from this Court held that the respective lien claimants had failed to provide adequate descriptions in their petitions of the property that was to be subject to the liens. <em>Mervin L. Blades &amp; Son v. Lighthouse, </em>37 Md.App. 265, 377 A.2d 523 (1977), and <em>Scott &amp; Wimbrow v. Wisterco Inv., Inc., </em>36 Md.App. 274, 373 A.2d 965, <em>cert. denied, </em>281 Md. 743 (1977). In the <em>Scott &amp; Wimbrow </em>case, the contractor filed a petition claiming a lien \u201cagainst \u2018the structures at Lighthouse Sound, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>St. Martins Neck, Maryland,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 277, 373 A.2d 965, and attached a deed containing metes and bounds descriptions of three parcels. The parcel denominated \u201cLighthouse Sound\u201d consisted of 713 acres. No photographs or further description of the subject buildings were included in the petition. This Court agreed with the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that the description of the buildings was so lacking in specificity that the owner\u2019s demurrer was properly sustained. In the <em>Mervin Blades </em>case, which involved the same Lighthouse Sound property, the claimant alleged in its petition that it had furnished labor and materials \u201cin connection with the construction of \u2018a main core and tennis court building or buildings,\u2019 \u201d and referred to a deed as providing the property description, which, this time was described as 770 acres of land. <em>Id. </em>at 271, 377 A.2d 523. No photographs or narrative description of the building or buildings were provided. Again, the circuit court sustained a demurrer, and this Court affirmed, noting that, in the petition, \u201c[tjhere is utterly no description of any building, from which anyone could undertake to identify a building.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274, 373 A.2d 965.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">As noted previously, Martino\u2019s petition included significantly more information describing the Arfaas\u2019 renovated house than the lien claimants provided in either of the Lighthouse Sound cases. Unlike the claimants in those cases, Martino\u2019s petition included street addresses with street numbers and the nine-digit zip code used by the postal service, and by the Arfaas themselves, in describing the location of their home. The addresses, combined with the information in the SDAT printout and the 141 photographs, were sufficient to enable interested parties to identify the land and the building that were the subject of the lien claim. We conclude that Martino sufficiently pled a prima facie claim for a subcontractor\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien. Accordingly, we shall vacate the judgment of the circuit court and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">JUDGMENT VACATED. CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-8\">. We have found no case that addresses the interplay between RP \u00a7 9-103 and any applicable local subdivision regulations that specify what must be done in order to legally subdivide a parcel of property into two or more legal lots. We need not resolve any conflict between the provisions at this stage of this case. It is sufficient for our purposes to note that the mere fact that the lien claimant seeks to impose a lien upon a large parcel of land surrounding the building is not, in and of itself, a fatal defect in the petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b732-5\">.

That lien, created by operation of law, lasted for six months and could be extended simply by the contractor or subcontractor filing a claim with the clerk of the circuit court. <em>See Barry Properties v. Fick Bros., </em>277 Md. 15, 19, 353 A.2d 222, 226 (1976).
