The court found that appellant was liable for insurance coverage under six separate policies for injuries that children of a tenant suffered as a result of lead-based paint poisoning at a property that appellant insured for a property management <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>company and the tenant\u2019s former landlord. Appellant presents three issues for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">1. Did the trial court err in its May 3, 2005 Declaratory Judgment Order in concluding that continuing exposure to lead-paint at the same property over multiple Policy years constituted multiple occurrences despite Policy language that \u201c[ajll bodily injury ... resulting from ... continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general conditions shall be considered to be the result of one occurrence\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">2. Did the trial court err in its May 3, 2005 Declaratory Judgment Order in holding that the limitation of liability language in the Policy provisions was ineffective to preclude \u201cstacking\u201d of occurrence limits in Policies covering successive years and triggered by a \u201ccontinuing injury\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">3. Did the trial court err in its May 3, 2005 Declaratory Judgment Order in holding that coverage for later years were [sie] triggered by injuries that had already manifested and been diagnosed prior to the inception of such coverage?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">We answer all three questions in the negative. We shall affirm the decision of the circuit court, but nevertheless, remand for entry of a declaratory judgment in accordance with the Maryland Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">Appellant\u2019s appeal of its declaratory judgment action before the circuit court is part of an underlying personal injury tort claim. Antonio Jones and Erieka Jones<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Jones children), by their mother, Carrie Holmes, and Holmes individually, sued Mid-Atlantic Funding Company, Darius Funding, Inc., and Phillip Hanson. Hanson was an insured of appellant. The Jones children allege they suffered lead-induced injuries as a result of their exposure to lead-based paint while tenants at real property owned by Hanson and located at 1229 North <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Central Avenue in Baltimore City (the Property). Holmes and the Jones children resided at the Property from May of 1984 through 1990, and the children were diagnosed with the following elevated blood-lead levels measured in micrograms (ixg) per deciliter (dL) of blood.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">Antonio Jones</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">Date Blood-Lead Level</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Au_\">October 17,1986 37 ixg/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqB\">December 10, 1986 33 n,g/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbC\">December 30, 1986 34 ixg/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9z\">January 20,1987 34 ixg/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4v\">April 2,1987 38 ixg/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayl\">March 11,1988 32 ixg/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1A\">August 8,1988 62/59 ixg/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay4\">October 5,1988 39/41 ug/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7T\">March 6,1989 33 ixg/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-26\">Ericka Jones</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-27\">Date Blood-Lead Level</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amc\">October 17.1986 25 ug/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqR\">December 10, 1986 19 ue/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-C\">December 30, 1986 21 ug/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATq\">January 20,1987 22 na/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVh\">April 8,1987 28 uug/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGt\">November 16. 1987 32 u-g/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD4\">January 27,1988 26 ixg/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>March 11,1988_29 u,g/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">July 28.1988_40/44 ng/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">August 8.1988_40/44 uig/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">January 5.1989_27 ixg/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">February 1,1989_25/20/22 ug/dL</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">Appellant issued separate liability insurance policies, three each to Hanson and Consumer Management Corporation (CMC), the property management company for the Property, during the Jones children\u2019s tenancy that covered 1985-1990. CMC\u2019s insurance policies were in effect during the following periods:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">\u2022 October 1,1985 to October 1,1986</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-11\">\u2022 October 1,1986 to October 1,1987</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-12\">\u2022 October 1,1987 to October 1,1988</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Al9\">Hanson\u2019s policies covered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-13\">\u2022 March 2,1987 to March 2,1988</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-14\">\u2022 March 2,1988 to March 2,1989</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-15\">\u2022 March 2,1989 to March 2,1990</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-16\">The coverage dates for the second and third CMC policies and the first and second Hanson policies overlapped from March 2, 1987 to October 1, 1988. Each of the six policies contained a policy limit of recovery totaling $500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-17\">The primary controversy devolves upon how the policies should be construed and accordingly, the amount of coverage, if any, of the policies. On August 18, 2004, appellant filed a Complaint against appellees Hanson, Holmes and the Jones children seeking declaratory relief and interpretation of the policies. Appellant argued that coverage for the alleged injuries suffered by the Jones children should be denied because they were seeking damages in their tort lawsuit in excess of the $500,000 limit of the Hanson policies. Appellant also contended, in the alternative, that coverage under the second and third Hanson policies should be denied because the injuries alleged by the Jones children occurred prior to the inception of those policies. Additionally, Hanson\u2019s knowledge of the injuries constituted a known loss which, appellant averred, precluded coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>On March 2, 2005, appellant moved for summary judgment, reiterating its argument from its Complaint. Appellant also claimed that it was entitled to a declaration that coverage was only available under one of the three CMC policies because Holmes and the Jones children allege one occurrence of the lead-based injury, the policies limit coverage per occurrence, and the \u201cbodily injuries alleged ... manifested and were a known loss prior to the inception of the [third CMC policy].\u201d Appellees countered that there were several facts in dispute and that the court should deny appellant\u2019s motion. On March 30, 2005, the court conducted a hearing (Pierson, J., presiding), and denied appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The court then conducted a bench trial on April 28, 2005. The parties stipulated to the blood-lead levels listed above, appellant\u2019s issuance of the subject policies and the \u201crelevant terms\u201d contained therein to Hanson and CMC, and the declaration pages listing $500,000 as the policy limit. The parties also agreed that Peter and Julia Ben Ezras<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cwere listed as additional insureds on one or more of the policies issued by [appellant to CMC],\u201d and that if Hanson were called to testify at trial, he \u201cwould testify that he did not receive notice of the alleged exposure to lead paint of [the Jones children] on the premises, of [the Property] until he was served with the Complaint in the underlying [tort] action in 1995.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Appellant presented the following arguments at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGL\">... There are two policy lines here. One is a series of three policies that were issued to [CMC]. And the first policy was issued 10-1-85 to '86. There was the second [CMC] policy which was 10-1-86 to '87, and then 10-1-87 to '88. So there\u2019s three [CMC] policies. They\u2019re the earlier in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>time. All of them would ensure liability arising from conditions on the premises of 1229 Central Avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-4\">The second line of policies which I\u2019ll call the Hanson line of policies, they incept later. 3-2-87 is the date of issuance of the first Hanson policy and that runs 3-2-87 to '88 and the middle policy, 3-2-88 to '89, and then a third Hanson policy, 3-2-89 to '90....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">Your Honor, it is necessary to juxtapose the lead test which are also part of these stipulations with the policy periods. And significantly the first lead test does not occur and there is no lead reading for either of [the Jones children] before 10-17-86. That is after the first [CMC] policy expired. So our position is that there is no coverage under the [first CMC] policy. There is no evidence at all in this case that there was injury during that policy period or that there was any occurrence that could trigger that policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFcV\">THE COURT: You\u2019re talking about if we say there are three policies to [CMC], you\u2019re talking about just the first of those or all three of them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">[Appellant\u2019s counsel]: I\u2019m talking about\u2014I\u2019m focusing now just on the first [CMC] policy, the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">THE COURT: The one that ran from '85 to '86.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\">[Appellant\u2019s counsel]: That\u2019s correct. Because there\u2019s no evidence of any elevated lead level of injury in that policy period, and this is in the current (inaudible) policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-9\">Your Honor, the lead levels which are shown on th [sic] the graphs then span from October 17 of '86 and in the case of Erica [sic] [Jones], the last reading is in February of '89. In the case of Antonio [Jones], the last reading is in March th [sic] actually March 6 of '89.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-10\">With respect to the Hanson policies, Your Honor, both of [the Jones children] were diagnosed with lead injury before the first Hanson policy was issued. They were diagnosed and had a number nd [sic] of lead readings prior to March 2 of 1987. So with respect to the Hanson policies, it is [appellant\u2019s] position that there is no coverage available because at the time the first Hanson policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>issued, there was no fortuitous event that could occur, rather the injury had been-the lead paint elevated lead levels had been diagnosed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-4\">And Your Honor, this is not a matter of manifestation trigger, and I\u2019m steering away from the use of manifestation because this is a different issue. This is known loss and fortuity. And in this case, we have the [Jones children] in a brief to the Court of Appeals saying that [CMC] knew of the presence of lead and the fact that children had been exposed to lead and injured by lead in 1986 and prevailing on that argument in the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">And now they\u2019re going to stand up and alleging it in their complaint and attempting to prove it all throughout the 10 years or so of this case. And now they\u2019re going to stand before you and tell you that there was no known loss here. Your Honor, we don\u2019t believe that a party should be allowed to blow hot and cold as it benefits them in litigation. And we do not-we believe that [Holmes and the Jones children], are estopped from arguing against the proposition that they state in their brief in the Court of Appeals that Ms. Holmes testified to under oath in her deposition that\u2019s alleged in their complaint. And that is that [CMC] knew of the lead injury in 1986, that it was the agent for [Hanson], and that his knowledge is imputed to [Hanson] [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">This is an argument being made against [Holmes and the Jones children], and we believe that under the <em>Kramer v. Globe Drilling </em>case and the eases that follow it, [Holmes and the Jones children] are judicially estopped making it contrary to this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">THE COURT: What\u2019s the consequences of that with respect to this [sic] last two policies of [CMC]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">[Appellant\u2019s counsel]: ... With respect to the last two policies of [CMC], it is [appellant\u2019s] position that the limit of liability provision in those policies limit the availability of coverage to one per occurrence limit which is $500,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>And alternatively with respect to the Hanson policies, it is [appellant\u2019s] position that if this Court finds that there is coverage available at all under the Hanson policies, notwithstanding the fact that this was a fully manifested and diagnosed injury prior to the first policy being issued, that limit of liability provision in the Hanson policy similarly limits the availability of coverage under those policies to one $500,000 per occurrence limit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-4\">And for the Court\u2019s purposes, the pertinent language in the [CMC] policy which is found in the coverage part that Your Honor has says, \u201cFor the purpose of determining the limit of the company\u2019s liability, all bodily injury and property damage arising out of continuance [sic] or repeated exposure to substantially the same general condition shall be considered as arising out of one occurrence.\u201d Your Honor, that language is particularly applicable to a situation here where the allegations are that these children were injured by continued or repeated exposure to one condition, and that\u2019s the presence of lead\u2014chipping and peeling lead paint at [the Property].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">All of the allegations in the complaint and all the claims in the case arise from one condition. And it is the position of [appellant] that the anti-stacking provision, the limit of liability language in their policies deem that\u2014all of their injuries combined to one occurrence, subject to one per occurrence limit per policy line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">Now Your Honor, that outcome is absolutely consistent with the Court of Appeals opinion in the <em>CSX Transportation v. Continental </em>case at which time the Court of Appeals, Judge Bell, held that in order to determine the number of occurrences under Maryland law in the vast majority of courts that have considered that issue, one looks to the cause of the injury. And this is not\u2014the holding in CSX is absolutely consistent with the limits of liability provision, but it is Maryland common law. And under the Court of Appeals binding decision in CSX, it was held that in that case, it was a noise induced hearing loss case. And in that case, the Court held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>sources of noise determined the number of occurrences, so it would be the source of the injury, the cause of the injury. And the CSX case is very clear about that. This case made one cause of the injury, chipping and peeling paint, so even if the policies didn\u2019t include the anti-stacking provision, we have one cause of injury, one occurrence, and it\u2019s the chipping and peeling paint at [the Property].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\">So Your Honor, we say under CSX, there was only one occurrence here. Under each policy line, we say that the limit of liability provisions in each policy also preclude there being more than one occurrence limit available. We say that there is no coverage available under the Hanson policies for injuries that were diagnosed and manifested prior to any of those policies being issued, and alternatively under the Hanson policies at most there would be only one per occurrence limit available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">And Your Honor, we also say that under the Riley case, under Bausch &amp; Lombe [sic], under Hartford [sic] Mutual, [Hanson, Holmes and the Jones children] had the burden of proving injury in a policy period and could only do that through expert testimony which was not presented in this case, and therefore they\u2019ve not proven injury in any policy period. Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Counsel for Holmes and the Jones children responded:</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">First I want to talk to you about the last thing [counsel for appellant] talked about which is the so-called burden of proof issue. Your Honor, the case law is (inaudible) that who has the burden of proof depends on the state of the pleadings and fundamental fairness. And Your Honor, in this case, [appellant] came into court and told the Court that the issue of whether the complaint of injuries occurred under any of the covered policy periods has not been raised. And it is [appellant\u2019s] position, not to them, that this factual issue would be resolved in the underlying tort case and is therefore improper to address herein. Talk about going hot and cold, now we\u2019re coming into court and saying, oh, I didn\u2019t mean what I said. [Holmes and the Jones children] do have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>the burden of proof. They do have to prove injury during the policy periods in this case. Well, they can\u2019t have it both ways, Your Honor.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">[Holmes and the Jones children] do not have the burden of proof in this case, [appellant] has the burden of proof in this case. They\u2019re coming to court and saying Your Honor, we want a declaration that we don\u2019t have to provide coverage. Why don\u2019t we have to provide coverage? Because there hasn\u2019t been an occurrence during each policy period. Why hasn\u2019t there been a [sic] occurrence during each policy period? Because they can\u2019t prove injury. Well, they have to come into court and prove those things....</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">[appellant] can\u2019t have it both ways. They can\u2019t say it hasn\u2019t been raised. It\u2019s a matter for the tort case. And they come in on the day of trial and say, yes, you got to prove it. So that\u2019s the procedural issue that I think the Court needs to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Now Your Honor, the Riley case looked at this exact policy language virtually. And what [appellant] failed to acknowledge I guess is that this\u2014each of these policies cover bodily injury during the policy period. That\u2019s the [CMC] language. The Hanson policy talked about the endorsement period, but it\u2019s the same thing. If there is bodily injury during a policy period, then the coverage is triggered. It\u2019s our allegation that there has been a bodily injury during each policy period. And therefore, all six of these policies are triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">... The first argument [counsel for appellant] talked about is the fortuity, or the known loss argument, which I believe applies to the Hanson policies, [counsel] argues, in that the argument is, well, because these children had been poisoned by lead prior to the time that the Hanson policies had been incepted, it\u2019s not a known loss and therefore there can be no coverage under those policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">The problem is, Your Honor, is that that argument ignores the language of the policies themselves which says that if there is a bodily injury during a policy period, there has been an occurrence. And it\u2019s our proffer to the Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>a, that they did not meet their burden and prove there wasn\u2019t a bodily injury during each of these policy periods, or in the alternative, that there will be proof that there was bodily injury during each of these policy periods in the underlying tort case. But again, Your Honor, we assert that the declaration is to be made today because [appellant] as the moving party [has] not met [its] burden of proof as to lack of bodily injury during a policy period.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">But regardless, it\u2019s irrelevant whether there was a poisoning prior to the time the Hanson policy incepted. Because think about it this way, Your Honor. Suppose, as pretty much occurred in this case, that a new landlord bought the property mid-stream during a tenant\u2019s tenancy. And the tenant had levels prior to the time the tenancy begins and continued to have elevated levels after the new ownership took place. And that new owner had an insurance policy. Do you think that the insurance company could come into court and say, well, these kids had lead levels before? We don\u2019t care if you were negligent and allowed chipping and peeling paint to remain in the property and allowed them to continue to be exposed to lead. They already had lead poisoning before you took possession of the property, and before you bought our policy, so therefore we\u2019re not going to provide coverage. That makes no sense, and that\u2019s pretty much an argument that Riley\u2014you\u2019ll see when you read the case\u2014addresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Riley talks about a situation a little bit different when there\u2019s four consecutive policy years but four different insurance companies that provide the coverage. And they said pretty much the same argument, that there would be coverage under those situations, even if it was four separate carriers. And that\u2019s what we have here. We have a landlord who took possession of the property. He had an insurance company. The kids were still being exposed to lead. It doesn\u2019t matter, Your Honor. There\u2019s still an occurrence. There\u2019s still bodily injury during the policy period.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>I\u2019ve argued this same case with [counsel for appellant]. I think this is the third time now. She does a great job of trying to take one argument and segregate it into four separate arguments, but really it\u2019s the same. Was there a bodily injury during the policy period? If there is a bodily injury during the policy period, then the policies are triggered. Known loss is irrelevant. Otherwise the Riley case would not mean anything because they said across successive policies they stacked. And therefore, if policies stacked, they stack. [Hanson\u2019s] knowledge of what the injury [was to the Jones children] is irrelevant to this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">So [counsel for appellant\u2019s] argument concerning judicial estoppel I\u2019ll address and say I don\u2019t believe we are es-topped. These are mere allegations. Pleadings can be made in the alternative. And number one, it\u2019s not\u2014it\u2019s the testimony of [Hanson and CMC] who are saying they didn\u2019t have knowledge. It\u2019s not Ms. Holmes saying I am now changing my mind and saying I did not notify them. It\u2019s the testimony that was introduced in the deposition of Mr. Caplan [of CMC], and the stipulation of Mr. Hanson, and then the subsequent stipulation again of Mr. Caplan to say I didn\u2019t have notice. It\u2019s not us taking a different position at all. It\u2019s [Hanson and CMC] taking the same position they\u2019ve taken all along. That\u2019s evidence in this case, and [Holmes and the Jones children], have a right to rely on that. So that addresses the known loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">I don\u2019t think it\u2019s irrelevant. If Your Honor does find it\u2019s relevant, I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re barred by judicial estoppel from asserting that [Hanson and CMC] argued that there was no notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Your Honor, with regard to the CSX case, Your Honor, the CSX case was a case where a railroad, CSX, had a policy\u2014they were self-insured. But they had a retention limit where they would pay the first part, and then the carrier would come in and pay anything over a certain dollar amount of claim for each claim that was made. And what occurred was there was a huge, huge number of hearing loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>claims from railroad workers being injured in the yard. The railroad wanting all those claims to be one occurrence said this is one occurrence. Therefore, we only have to pay our self-retention limit once, and then you, insurance company, have to pay the remainder of all these claims. On the other hand, the carrier argued that each individual worker\u2019s hearing loss claim was a separate claim, and that the self-insured retention limit as to each individual claim would have to be paid by the railroad before the insurance would kick in.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">And indeed the Court of Appeals, Judge Bell, did say that in those circumstances, the cause test did apply. However, Your Honor, the case is distinguishable because that did not deal with coverage across successive policy periods, okay? That each individual railroad worker, yes, indeed was a different claim. That\u2019s all the case held.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Utica Mutual case, Your Honor, the Harford County case, Your Honor, the Riley case, Your Honor, are all individual\u2014I\u2019m sorry\u2014are all environmental exposure cases where it would specifically [sic] that environmental injury, and now the Riley case, lead paint injury across successive policy periods, the policies stack. CSX was not a stacking case, Your Honor. It simply wasn\u2019t.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">With regard finally, Your Honor, to the limits of liability provision. On that, Your Honor, I believe the Riley case is indeed on all force [sic]. Bodily injury during a policy period shall be one occurrence. And if there\u2019s a bodily injury during a subsequent policy period, that\u2019s one occurrence. And if there\u2019s another policy period and a bodily injury during that policy period, that\u2019s an occurrence. These are occurrence policies. When you read my memorandum that was attached to my motion for summary judgment, Your Honor, it outlines pretty well the history of trigger law, for lack of a better way to put it, in insurance cases in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">The cases that said that manifestation is the sole trigger are no longer good law. And I outline all those cases.... Riley specifically said that in this exact circumstance, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>policies stacked. For all those reasons, Your Honor, I request that you issue a declaration that there is coverage under all six of these policies, and that [appellant] must indemnify [Hanson and CMC] in the tort case equivalent. Thank you.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Counsel for Hanson maintained that</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">... the only evidence before Your Honor is that the insured, the person that contracted with the insurance company, did not have knowledge of the situation and therefore it was not a known loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">With regard to the Hanson policies, if you note the times of exposure with regard to Antonio Jones and Erica [sic] Jones, Antonio Jones has actual lead levels in each of the three policy periods for Hanson. With Erica [sic] Jones, there are lead levels in two, the first two, of the Hanson policy periods, two different policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">With regard to the third, again I believe that that issue still has to be determined by expert testimony and may in fact be provided at the underlying tort litigation. But we have all three policies in play with regard to Antonio Jones and two of the three just using the lead levels with regard to Erica [sic] Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">From the insured\u2019s point of view with regard to the so-called stacking issue, Riley----If indeed Mr. Hanson had gone to three separate insurance companies during these three years of policy coverage, would it be that he had only one limit of liability? If indeed he stayed with the same company, should he be prevented from having the policy limits for each of those three policies?</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">The language in those policies would have to be pretty stringent to prevent him from receiving the same coverage if he had gone to three different insurance companies. And with regard to this policy, I don\u2019t believe that language is there to give the insurer the notification that if indeed he wants coverage in those policy limits for each of those claims during each of those policy years, he has to go to three separate insurance companies. The language just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>isn\u2019t strong enough to state that is what he would have to do to get the coverage that he thought he had.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">It would just be blatantly unfair for an insured if indeed he had coverage for 20 years if he stayed with the same company, due to loyalty or price or whatever, that he would have one policy limit for the entire 20-year period....</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">On May 3, 2005, in its Declaratory Judgment Order, the court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">Pursuant to Md.Code Ann., <em>Cts. and Jud.

Although this Court has limited authority to determine independent and separate questions of policy coverage prior to the tort trial, the issue of whether the present claims fall within the potential coverage of any of these policies depends on a factual issue that must be resolved in the underlying tort suit. <em>7416 Baltimore Ave. v. Penn-America, </em>83 Md.App. 692, 697-701, 577 A.2d 398, <em>cert. denied, </em>321 Md. 164, 582 A.2d 499 (1990).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">In the present action, the Court finds that the parties have presented a justiciable controversy concerning [appellant\u2019s] duties and obligations under each of the six policies in question, which involves issues independent and separable from the claims of [Holmes and the Jones children]. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number><em>Howard v. Montgomery Mutual Ins. Co., </em>145 Md.App. 549, 560, 805 A.2d 1167[,] <em>cert. denied, </em>372 Md. 431, 813 A.2d 258 (2002). The issues to be resolved here involve the number of \u201coccurrences\u201d at issue where [the Jones children] claim, continuous or repeated exposure to lead paint over the course of several policy periods; whether the Limit of Liability provisions in the policies preclude stacking of policies issued to a single insured; and whether coverage is available under any policy issued after the claimed injuries were diagnosed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">Based on the record before the Court and its review of the relevant authorities, the Court is persuaded that exposure to lead paint plus proof of bodily injury constitutes an \u201coccurrence\u201d under each of the insurance policies in question, which would give rise to coverage. Moreover, the Court believes that the Limit of Liability provisions in the policies do not preclude stacking each of their liability caps upon proof of continuing exposure and bodily injury during sequential policy periods. Finally, the Court holds that [Hanson and CMC\u2019s] \u201cknown loss\u201d is not determinative of liability coverage for policy periods after [the Jones children\u2019s] initial blood-lead level diagnosis in October, 1986. Again, the Court declares that the test for coverage under any one of the six insurance policies here is exposure to lead paint plus proven bodily injury during the relevant policy period. <em>Cf. Riley v. United Services Automotive Assoc., </em>[161 Md.App. 573, 871 A.2d 599,] 2005 WL 742896 (Md.App.[2005]) and cases cited therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">Accordingly, the court declares that the Limit of Liability provisions in the three Hanson insurance policies and in the three [CMC] policies limit coverage to one occurrence for bodily injury resulting from continuous or repeated exposure to lead paint for each of the six relevant policy periods. The court further declares that these provisions do not preclude stacking of the liability caps if [the Jones children] can prove continuing exposure and bodily harm during more than one policy period. Finally, the Court declares that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>\u201cknown loss\u201d is not determinative of the availability of coverage for any of the applicable insurance policy periods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\">Therefore, [Hanson, CMC, Holmes and the Jones children\u2019s] access to insurance coverage under any one of the six policies in question here will, of necessity, be determined in the underlying tort action.

Appellant specifically posits that the policy language, reviewed in conjunction with case law, should have led the court to conclude that the Jones\u2019 exposure amounted to a single occurrence, and that the policy language precluded the \u2018stacking\u2019 of the occurrence insurance limits. Additionally, appellant contends that the court erred in finding that insurance coverage is available despite the lead-induced injuries being diagnosed and known to Hanson, as landlord, and CMC, as property manager, prior to the inception of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>coverage.

As to the use of \u201coccurrence\u201d policies, we further observed in <em>[Mutual Fire, Marine &amp; Inland Ins. Co. v.] Vollmer, </em>306 Md. [243] at 255, 508 A.2d 130, [(1986)] that in the area of environmental contamination it is nearly impossible to identify the time of the tortious \u201coccurrence\u201d and the effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>long-term exposure upon the character of the injury, citing <em>Stine v.

Occurrence and Trigger</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The crux of appellant\u2019s argument is that, in consideration of the policy language and lead-induced injuries, if the Jones children are entitled to coverage, they should only receive insurance coverage for a single occurrence of exposure to lead, and not several occurrences over multiple years, thereby triggering coverage under the successive policies and cap limits. Looking to the pertinent language of the policies, each of the CMC policies contain the following definitions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">\n<em>Limits of Liability</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">Regardless of the number of (1) insureds under this policy, (2) persons or organizations who sustain bodily injury or property damage, or (3) claims made or suits brought on account of bodily injury or property damage, the company\u2019s liability is limited as follows ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-10\">For the purpose of determining the limit of the company\u2019s liability, all bodily injury and property damage arising out of continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general conditions shall be considered as arising out of one occurrence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-11\">\n<em>Bodily Injury</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-12\">Bodily injury means bodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by any person which occurs during the policy period....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>\n<em>Occurrence</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">Occurrence means an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Appellant\u2019s policies issued to Hanson each included the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">\n<em>Limit of Liability</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">Regardless of the number of insureds, claims made or persons insured, our total liability under Coverage L [for Premises Liability] stated in this endorsement for all damages resulting from any one occurrence shall not exceed the limit of liability for Coverage L stated in the Declarations [of $500,000].

Fischer, <em>Insurance Coverage for Mass Exposure Tort Claims: the Debate over the Appropriate Trigger Rule, </em>45 Drake L.Rev. 625, 652 (1997).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">The policies do not refer to a \u201ctrigger\u201d; \u201cthe term \u2018trigger\u2019 is merely a label for the event or events that under the terms of the insurance policy determines whether a policy must respond to a claim in a given set of circumstances.\u201d <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v.

In <em>Owens-Illinois, </em>the New Jersey Supreme Court reviewed a number of theories for the trigger of policy coverage, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIH\">The most frequently offered theories for the trigger of coverage are (1) the exposure theory, (2) the manifestation theory, and (3) the continuous-trigger theory ... [and] [a]t least two other less-frequently followed theories exist. One is the \u201cinjury-in-fact\u201d (or \u201cdamages-in-fact\u201d) approach, which holds that coverage is triggered by a showing of actual injury or damage-producing event____ Under that theory, coverage is triggered by \u201ca real but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>undiscovered injury, proved in retrospect to have existed at the relevant time * * * irrespective of the time the injury became manifest.\u201d ... [Ajfter an injury ... it may be inferred ... that the harm actually began sometime earlier ... [and fjinally, the \u201cdouble-trigger\u201d theory holds that injury occurs at the time of exposure and the time of manifestation, but not necessarily during the intervening period. <em>Id., 138 N.J. </em>at 449-51, 650 A.2d at 980-81 (citations, footnotes and internal quotations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-5\"><em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v.

Co., </em>145 Md.App. 256, 297-98, 802 A.2d 1070 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">As trigger theories have developed, so too has the case law pertaining to trigger and activation of insurance coverage for the insured due to the occurrence of an event or series of events, if there is demonstrable proof of a triggering event and an injury. In the case of <em>Harford Mut. Ins. Co. v. Jacobson, </em>73 Md.App. 670, 536 A.2d 120 (1988), we reviewed a lead-induced injury case in which a tenant filed a personal injury suit against the estate of Israel Shapiro, which listed the rental property at issue as an estate asset. In <em>Jacobson, </em>evidence showed that the child tenant\u2019s injuries and diagnosis of lead poisoning took place prior to the inception of insurance coverage by appellant insurance company. <em>Id. </em>at 674, 536 A.2d 120. We were persuaded by cases that utilized the following test: \u201cThe date of an \u201coccurrence\u201d for purposes of determining coverage under an insurance policy is the date when the harm is first discovered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 684, 536 A.2d 120. As a result, we adopted the manifestation of injury trigger as a standard for lead paint cases and held the insurer was not liable to indemnify its former insured. <em>Id. See also Mraz v. Canadian Universal Ins. Co., Ltd., </em>804 F.2d 1325, 1328 (4th Cir.1986) (holding \u201cthat in hazardous waste burial cases ... the occurrence is judged by the time at which the leakage and damage are first discovered.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The Court of Appeals began to chip away and depart <em>from </em>the <em>Jacobson </em>holding with its decision in <em>Lloyd E. Mitchell, Inc. v. Maryland Cas. Co., </em>324 Md. 44, 595 A.2d 469 (1991), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>which was a case that involved injuries due to exposure to products containing asbestos. \u201cRelying primarily on\u201d the holdings in <em>Jacobson </em>and <em>Mraz, </em>the trial court found that the insurance company was not required to indemnify its former insured, a manufacturer of asbestos-containing materials, as a matter of law, where the alleged injuries did not manifest until after the general liability policies lapsed. <em>Id. </em>at 50, 595 A.2d 469. The Court vacated the trial court\u2019s entry of declaratory summary judgment for appellee insurer and held that the court erred in \u201cadopting, as the <em>sole </em>trigger of coverage, the manifestation theory of coverage, namely, that coverage is not afforded until harm actually becomes manifest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 595 A.2d 469. (emphasis in original). Significantly, the Court scrutinized the \u201cplain meaning of the term \u2018bodily injur/ \u201d and concluded that because \u201c \u2018bodily injury\u2019 occurs when asbestos is inhaled and retained in the lungs, ... at a minimum, coverage under the policy to provide a defense and indemnification of the insured is triggered upon exposure to the insured\u2019s asbestos products during the policy period by a person who suffers bodily injury as a result of that exposure.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In 1992, the Court, in the case of <em>Harford County v. Harford Mut. Ins. Co., </em>327 Md. 418, 420, 610 A.2d 286 (1992), examined the issue of whether, \u201cin the context of alleged environmental property damage,\u201d the applicable insurance policies are \u201ctriggered for the policy periods when the damages take place, as opposed to the policy period when the damages are first discovered or \u2018manifested.\u2019 \u201d The environmental property damage occurred as a result of seepage and leakage from five of the count/s landfills that contaminated the underlying groundwater over several years. <em>Id. </em>at 422, 610 A.2d 286. In rejecting the manifestation theory, the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">Notwithstanding the difficulty that may be encountered in determining exactly when contaminants from a landfill may cause property damage, we hold that \u201cmanifestation\u201d is not the sole trigger of coverage in environmental pollution cases. Rather, we conclude that coverage under the policies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>may be triggered during the policy period at a time earlier than the discovery of manifestation of the damage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 435-36, 610 A.2d 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The decision of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland in the lead paint case of <em>Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Am. Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co., </em>811 F.Supp. 210 (D.Md.1993) further eroded the <em>Jacobson </em>adoption of the manifestation trigger theory. Although the Court was primarily charged with determining which insurance company was liable for contributing to the settlement amount for the injured child tenant, Judge J. Frederick Motz expounded upon the trigger issue and stated, \u201cit is clear to me that the transition from <em>Mraz </em>to <em>Harford County </em>demonstrates that exposure plus bodily injury (even if unmanifested) is now sufficient under Maryland law to trigger coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">We revisited the manifestation trigger theory in an asbestos-related injury case, <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>145 Md.App. 256, 802 A.2d 1070 (2002). After reviewing the facts and the case law discussed above, we were persuaded to adopt the \u201cinjury-in-fact\u201d trigger theory, as used in <em>Harford County, supra, </em>as the \u201cappropriate trigger of coverage rule for asbestos-in-building property damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 297, 802 A.2d 1070. We concluded that \u201c[njeither the initial exposure (in this case the installation of asbestos in the City\u2019s schools), nor the discovery (manifestation) of the injurious effects of the ACBMs [Asbestos-Containing Building Materials], comports with the \u201coccurrence\u201d language of the CGL [Comprehensive General Liability] policies, which is predicated in part on \u201cthe continuous or repeated exposure to conditions\u201d that is implicated by the continuing presence of asbestos in the City\u2019s buildings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303, 802 A.2d 1070. Additionally, we specifically rejected trigger theories based upon manifestation, and held that use of the \u201cinjury-in-fact\u201d theory would not \u201cpreclude coverage under subsequent policies when there is continued exposure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 297, 802 A.2d 1070. We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>The \u201cinjury-in-fact\u201d and \u201ccontinuous\u201d trigger theories are not mutually exclusive, but instead may in an appropriate circumstance be complimentary in the appropriate context. As noted by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio [in an environmental pollution case]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-4\">With one possible caveat, the appropriate trigger theory for this case is a continuous trigger rule that employs injury-in-fact as the initial triggering event.... The caveat ... is that in order to justify application of the continuous trigger rule, [the insured] has to show that the damage was continuing in nature, as opposed to one-shot or episodic. Otherwise, the policies will be triggered by injury-in-fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\"><em>GenCorp., Inc. v.

Rita Riley, et. al., </em>393 Md. 55, 899 A.2d 819 (2006) <em>(Riley II), </em>the Court granted <em>certiorari </em>to determine the following issue: In a lead paint case, does a limit of liability provision in each of four liability policies limit the insurer\u2019s liability coverage to a single per occurrence limit when bodily injury spans more than one policy period?</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">In that case, as in this case, the landlord\u2019s insurer had brought a declaratory judgment action against the landlord and former tenants to determine whether the limits of liability for one policy were the limits of liability for lead-induced injuries suffered by the child tenants over four successive policy periods. The Court of Appeals reviewed our decision in <em>Riley v. United Services Auto. Association, </em>161 Md.App. 573, 871 A.2d 599 (2005) <em>(Riley I), </em>in which we reversed the trial court\u2019s decision, holding that an expert\u2019s opinion regarding the bodily injuries that the children suffered was admissible on the trigger issue, despite the fact that there was no published <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>research on injury, if any, if a child has blood-lead levels below ten \u00a1xg/dL. <em>Id. </em>at 587, 871 A.2d 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">To guide the trial court on remand, we had responded to appellee insurer\u2019s question on cross-appeal: \u201cDid the circuit court err in declaring that USAA\u2019s policies provided $600,000 of coverage, instead of $300,000?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 576, 871 A.2d 599. Regarding trigger of insurance coverage and successive policies, we followed <em>Utica Mutual, supra, </em>and agreed with the <em>Scottsdale </em>Court, concluding that \u201ccontinuous injury, not solely manifestation, is the appropriate trigger in lead paint poisoning cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 590. With respect to continuous injury triggering successive policies and the limits of liability under each policy, also known as stacking, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">The circuit court concluded that the policies\u2019 limit of liability provisions, while susceptible to the reading given by appellee, are equally susceptible to appellant\u2019s interpretation that, while any one policy would pay no more than $300,000 per occurrence, a continuing injury may trigger sequential policies, stacking each of the policies\u2019 liability caps. We agree, and again, we begin our analysis with a counterfactual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">In the underlying case, assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the Carpenters win a total judgment of $3 million for injuries sustained during the four insurance periods, and further assume that Hooper had procured the four policies from four different insurers. In such a case, obviously each insurers\u2019 per-occurrence liability limits would not apply to limit the availability of coverage from the other policies; Hooper would have $1.2 million dollars of coverage toward his liability to the Carpenters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">Appellee\u2019s interpretation of the per occurrence liability limitation would alter the amount of insurance available, merely on the aleatory circumstance of whether Hooper had changed insurers over the course of the Carpenters\u2019 tenancy. Under our hypothetical, Hooper would enjoy the full benefit of the aggregate $1.2 million dollars of coverage he purchased; under appellee\u2019s theory, Hooper would only have $300,000 of coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Appellee\u2019s interpretation is not compelled by the language of the insurance agreements. When the liability limitation section states, \u201cOur total liability under Coverage E for all damages resulting from any one occurrence will not be more than\u201d $300,000, it can be read to mean \u201ctotal liability under <em>this policy\u201d </em>rather than \u201ctotal liability under all policies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-4\">Additionally, because appellee\u2019s interpretation would substantially alter liability allocation in continuous injury cases, we believe appellee\u2019s interpretation is not what was expected by the parties when they made those contracts. <em>Cf. Scottsdale, </em>811 F.Supp. at 216 (\u201c[T]he purpose of the [limitation of liability] clause in question is not to apportion coverage between insurers providing coterminous coverage.

The limit-of-liability provision in each of the policies states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\">Limit of Liability. Our total liability under Coverage E for all damages resulting from any one occurrence will not be more than the limit of liability for Coverage E as shown in the Declarations. This limit is the same regardless of the number of insureds, claims made or persons injured. All bodily injury and property damage resulting from any one accident or from continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions shall be considered to be the result of one occurrence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">There is no reference here to subsequent policies. The plain language of the policies defines \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions, which results, during the policy period, in bodily injury or property damage.\u201d (Emphasis added). While \u201cpolicy period\u201d is not defined within the \u201cdefinitions\u201d section of the policy, on the \u201cDeclarations Page\u201d at the beginning of each policy the words \u201cPOLICY PERIOD\u201d appear, followed by the dates that the policy covers. Each policy in the record contains a set \u201cpolicy period.\u201d The customary, ordinary, and accepted meaning of a policy period is the period in time that is covered by the policy. It appears from the language of the contact that occurrences that happen during a policy period are covered. While USAA insists that its intent to prevent the stacking of multiple policies is clearly manifested in the language of the policy, it is clear that a reasonably prudent person could also read the policies to mean that each separate policy is implicated by a continuing occurrence. These contradictory interpretations of the same language clearly demonstrate the ambiguity in the policy. We find no error in the Circuit Court\u2019s determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">USAA erroneously contends that <em>Hiraldo v. Allstate Insurance Company, </em>8 A.D.3d 230, 778 N.Y.S.2d 50 (2004), <em>leave to appeal granted by Hiraldo v. Allstate Ins.

Co., </em>5 N.Y.3d 508, 806 N.Y.S.2d 451, 840 N.E.2d 563 (2005), addressed the exact issue as in the instant case. In <em>Hiraldo, </em>a child was exposed to lead paint chips and caused to suffer injury over the course of several years and several homeowner\u2019s insurance policy periods. <em>Id. </em>at 51. Allstate Insurance Company insured the landlord of the premises where the infant resided under a Landlord Policy. <em>Id. </em>The infant suffered brain damage as a result of lead poisoning, which was first diagnosed in August of 1991 when he was one year old. Continuously elevated lead levels were found in the infant\u2019s blood on seven occasions, with a final diagnosis in January 1993. <em>Id. </em>Allstate contended that, while it insured the premises in question for a $300,000 liability limit per person, and two subsequent renewal policies identical to the initial policy, the provisions of the applicable policy clearly limited the plaintiffs to the recovery of the limit of one policy period, <em>i.e., </em>$300,000. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Hiraldo </em>court held that the plain language of the policy determined that the infant\u2019s injuries arose out of a single occurrence and constituted one loss, and Allstate \u201cclearly intended to limit the number of policies that would be available to satisfy a judgment in a continuous exposure case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51-52. Thus, the limits of liability provision did apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">The \u201cLimits of Liability\u201d provision in the policy in <em>Hiraldo, </em>while similar to the provision in the instant case, contains one important difference. The provision reads: \u201cRegardless of the number of insured persons, injured persons, claims, claimants or policies involved, our total liability ... coverage.... \u201d <em>Hiraldo, </em>778 N.Y.S.2d at 51 (emphasis added). Unlike the provision in the instant case, the <em>Hiraldo </em>provision clearly indicated that liability was limited regardless of the number of policies implicated. In the instant case, USAA made no reference to the implication of the limit of liability provision in the event of multiple policies. In its affirmance of <em>Hiraldo, </em>the Court of Appeals of New York even cited to the interme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>diate appellate court\u2019s opinion in the instant case and distinguished it, noting that \u201c[s]ome courts have held that successive policy limits may be cumulatively applied to a single loss, where the policies do not clearly provide otherwise .... <em>Riley v. United Servs. Auto. Assn., </em>161 Md.App. 573, 871 A.2d 599 [Ct.Spec.App. 2005].\u201d This is clearly not the situation present in the instant case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><em>Riley II, </em>393 Md. at 80-82, 899 A.2d 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The foregoing quote from the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Riley II </em>is dispositive of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In light of the foregoing, patently, there is no reason to disturb the circuit court\u2019s ruling regarding multiple occurrences over a continuous period. The decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Riley </em>makes clear that the law in Maryland is that, in cases such as the matter before us, proof of repeated exposure to lead, which, in turn, results in lead-based poisoning injuries that continue for several years with continuous exposure, the continuous injury or injury-in-fact trigger is applicable and thus triggers insurance coverage during all applicable policy periods. As we explained in <em>Utica Mutual, supra, </em>in rejecting the manifestation trigger in the context of asbestos-related injuries, the injury-in-fact trigger would not \u201cpreclude coverage under subsequent policies when there is continued exposure.\u201d <em>Utica Mutual, </em>145 Md.App. at 297, 802 A.2d 1070. In that case, because \u201c[t]he continued presence of [asbestos-containing building materials] in the buildings may cause continuous property damage during the coverage periods of policies that take effect subsequent to the moment that the City initially discovered the harmful effects of asbestos,\u201d we concluded that the continuous damage constituted an occurrence within each applicable policy period, so long as the asbestos remained in the buildings. <em>Id. </em>at 302, 802 A.2d 1070.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Appellant argues that the circuit court should have followed the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>CSX Transp., Inc. v. Cont'l Ins. Co., </em>343 Md. 216, 680 A.2d 1082 (1996), where the Court examined the propriety of the trial court\u2019s jury instructions in a case involving insurance claims by railroad workers suffer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>ing from noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>CSX </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">In <em>CSX, </em>the Court listed and discussed cases where courts have viewed occurrences as based upon the cause or causes of damage, and \u201cnot the number of injuries or claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233, 680 A.2d 1082. In its brief, however, appellant neglects to mention that the Court utilized this cause test because the insurance policy at issue contained language in the limit of liability provision that required further Court interpretation than the policy before this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">For the purpose of determining the limit of [the insurance company\u2019s] liability, all personal injury ... arising out of continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general condition <em>existing at or emanating from one location or source </em>shall be considered as arising out of one occurrence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 223, 680 A.2d 1082 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">The specific facts of that case, in addition to the unambiguous construction of the word \u201csource\u201d and its relation to \u201ccause,\u201d led the <em>CSX </em>Court to hold that the trial court did not err in \u201cexcluding extraneous evidence to prove its meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250, 680 A.2d 1082. The source of the injuries to the Jones children, however, is not at issue here. Additionally, the cause analysis<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> required in cases of NIHL is inapposite to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>the analysis that courts undergo in lead paint poisoning cases in light of the continuous trigger theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Appellant also cites <em>Hiraldo v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>8 A.D.3d 230, 778 N.Y.S.2d 50 (2004), <em>aff'd, Hiraldo v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>5 N.Y.3d 508, 806 N.Y.S.2d 451, 840 N.E.2d 563 (2005), where the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York, that state\u2019s intermediate appellate court, held an infant\u2019s lead-induced injuries arose out of a single occurrence, and coverage was limited pursuant to Allstate\u2019s policy limit of liability under one policy period.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As noted, <em>supra, </em>the Court of Appeals, in <em>Riley II, </em>rejected appellant\u2019s argument that <em>Hiraldo </em>was apposite because, there, the language of the policy limited liability, regardless, <em>inter alia, </em>of the number of policies involved.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The New York Court of Appeals affirmed the intermediate court\u2019s holding to limit liability based upon the \u201cnoncumulation clause\u201d contained in the Allstate policy, \u201c[rjegardless of the number of ... policies involved.\u201d <em>Hiraldo, </em>5 N.Y.3d at 513, 806 N.Y.S.2d 451, 840 N.E.2d 563. The Court held that, because Allstate provided the noncumulation of other policy language in the subject policy, it clearly limited its liability to the $300,000 cap of the one policy period under which the injury allegedly occurred, thereby precluding stacking of sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>eral policies. <em>Id,.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As noted by the Court of Appeals in <em>Riley II, </em>no such clause or language appears in either of the CMC policies or the Hanson policies issued by appellant. Therefore, the <em>Hiraldo </em>cases do not apply to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Here, the Jones children were tested and found to have elevated blood-lead levels during their tenancy at the Property. The levels as shown, <em>swpra, </em>demonstrate that the children suffered bodily injury, under insurance definitions, at several times throughout their tenancy, that spanned most of the years covered by appellant\u2019s policies. The levels remained dangerously elevated while the children were continuously exposed to flaking and chipping lead-based paint. The injuries suffered constitute occurrences under the policies and, in light of <em>Utica Mutual </em>and the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Riley, </em>each elevated level indicates a bodily injury, which would then constitute an occurrence under each insurance policy period that corresponds to the injury for each child. Consequently, the court did not err in reaching its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">b. Policy Stacking</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Our decision in <em>Utica Mutual, </em>and the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Riley II, </em>also compel us to hold that the court did not err in declaring that the policy provisions did not preclude stacking of the corresponding limit amounts of $500,000 each. As noted above, we have held that the injury-in-fact or continuous trigger did not preclude coverage under successive policies where there was proof of continued exposure and injury. Appellant cites cases in which courts have rejected stacking of liability limits; nonetheless, the cases are distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Appellant refers us to <em>Ins.

We specifically rejected the all-sums approach<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> adopted in <em>Keene, </em>stating, \u201cTo compress long-term damage of a continuing nature into a single policy period, which would effectively be called for under the \u2018joint and several\u2019 or \u2018all sums\u2019 approach is \u2018intuitively suspect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Utica Mutual, </em>145 Md.App. at 311, 802 A.2d 1070 (citation omitted). With respect to <em>Forty-Eight Insulations, Inc., </em>we referred to <em>Forty-Eight </em>when, in <em>Utica Mutual, </em>we \u201cconcluded that prorata allocation by \u2018time on the risk\u2019 is more consistent with the injury-in-fact/continuous trigger of coverage employed here\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 313, 802 A.2d 1070.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">What is particularly noteworthy is that these cases involved several insurance carriers and their duty to indemnify, whereas here, we are examining appellant\u2019s duty to indemnify in this matter as the sole insurance carrier. From a pro rata standpoint, appellant was on the risk here 100 percent of the time. The circuit court was not asked to declare which carrier as between appellant and several other insurance carriers was liable under its policy limits. Moreover, in <em>Utica Mutual, </em>we explained that we are not applying the \u201cpro-rata allocation method employed by the New Jersey Supreme Court, which was proration on the basis of policy limits, multiplied by years of coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314, n. 55, 802 A.2d 1070 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As a result, the court properly found that stacking of the liability caps was not precluded, so long as the Jones children are able to demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>strate continuous exposure and injury spanning the applicable policies.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">c. Manifestation and the Known Loss Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Appellant asserts that <em>Jacobson </em>is still good law insofar as our conclusion that \u201cany possibility of trigger <em>ends </em>upon manifestation.... \u201d According to appellant, the cases decided subsequent to <em>Jacobson, </em>discussed <em>swpra, </em>have abrogated the idea that manifestation of \u201can injury was the sole trigger of coverage,\u201d but nothing else. As a result, appellant avers that it should not have to indemnify Hanson and CMC under any policy where the Jones children\u2019s injuries manifested prior to the inception of coverage for a given policy. Additionally, in its Reply brief, appellant maintains that the continuous trigger theory \u201cdoes not mandate coverage <em>after </em>manifestation.\u201d Appellant also claims that, because there is evidence that Holmes testified to notifying Hanson and CMC of the children\u2019s lead poisoning before the policies came into effect, that notice constituted known loss, precluding indemnification. Furthermore, judicial estoppel should prevent Hanson and CMC from contending that they were not put on notice of the lead poisoning. We are not persuaded by appellant\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">We recognize that the decisions subsequent to <em>Jacobson </em>did not specifically hold that in every set of circumstances, adoption of the continuous trigger theory supplanted evidence of manifestation of an injury without proof of repeated exposure and injuries. Our application of the continuous trigger in these cases, lead-induced injury cases particularly, in effect, abrogated appellant\u2019s assertion also.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Part of our reasoning for adopting the injury-in-fact/continuous theory was based on the special nature of environmental pollution cases that had a continuing or repeated exposure impact, such as cases involving asbestos or lead paint. In lead paint poisoning cases, like <em>Riley I </em>and <em>II </em>and the case <em>sub judice, </em>there was evidence that the injured parties had not only sustained an initial exposure to lead and a corresponding injury, but the repeated elevated blood-lead levels demonstrated that exposure continued over a period of time. It would logically follow that these tenants would also suffer new injuries as a result of the later episodes of exposure. Consequently, as we previously held, so long as the tenants were continually exposed and injured subsequent to the manifestation of their initial injuries, these novel injuries, with the requisite proof of exposure, would trigger coverage under sequential policies. Moreover, we have refused to apply any theory based in manifestation or discovery of an injury in conjunction with the continuous trigger theory within the context of lead-paint poisoning cases and, refuse to do so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">In regard to the doctrine of known loss, we referred to the decision rendered by the Illinois Supreme Court, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-6\">By its very nature, insurance is fundamentally based on <em>contingent risks </em>which may or may not occur.... If the insured knows or has reason to know, when it purchases a CGL policy, that there is a substantial probability that it will suffer or has already suffered a loss, the risk ceases to be contingent and becomes a probable or known loss [which is ordinarily uninsurable]. <em>Outboard Marine Corp. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., </em>154 Ill.2d 90, 103, 180 Ill.Dec. 691, 697, 607 N.E.2d 1204, 1210 (1992) (emphasis in original). As to the \u201cknown loss\u201d and \u201cfortuity\u201d doctrines, the latter \u201cholds that \u2018insurance is not available for losses that the policyholder knows of, planned, intended, or is aware are substantially certain to occur.\u2019 \u201d The \u201cknown loss\u201d rule is a variant, holding that an \u201c \u2018insured may not obtain insurance to cover a loss that is known before the policy takes effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>PA. v.

Because we have concluded that the manifestation trigger theory is inapplicable here, appellant\u2019s known loss argument also fails. Furthermore, we are persuaded by the assertion of counsel for Holmes and the Jones children that they, as plaintiffs in the underlying tort matter, intend to seek damages for separate injuries that occurred during the policy periods of successive policies. As such, Hanson and CMC\u2019s purported knowledge of injury and loss would have to be shown for each injury as averred by Holmes and the Jones children to preclude coverage. In light of the facts of this case, these circumstances further highlight the inapplicability of the known loss doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">In addition, Hanson and CMC have always averred that they did not receive notice of the injuries allegedly suffered by the Jones children while tenants at the Property. For purposes of the declaratory action, the parties stipulated that, if Hanson or a CMC officer were called to testify, they would state that they did not become aware of the injuries to the Jones children until the tort complaint was filed in 1995. These stipulations simply fail to bolster appellant\u2019s case to establish known loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">Assuming <em>arguendo, </em>that a judicial estoppel<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> argument was brought before the circuit court, <em>see Md. Rule </em>8-131(a)(2006) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>(pronouncing that an \u201cappellate court will not decide any other issue [except subject matter and personal jurisdiction] unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court .... \u201d), appellant appears to mistake the assertions that were alleged by appellees to this action. As we stated, Hanson and CMC never changed their stance that they were not notified of the alleged injuries until the complaint filing. Holmes testified that she notified Hanson about the injuries at the onset of the exposure and, according to appellant, his \u2018knowledge\u2019 should be imputed to CMC. Her testimony, however, does not operate to modify the arguments of Hanson or CMC to, in effect, estop either from claiming that they did not have notice of these injuries prior to the inception of any coverage period. Therefore, we reject appellant\u2019s estoppel argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">d. Declaratory Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Notwithstanding the fact that neither party raised this issue, we shall briefly discuss declaratory judgments and the court\u2019s Declaratory Judgment Order in the instant case.

To be sure, therefore, the NIHL suffered by each claimant was caused by hazardous noise and, in that sense, resulted from a common cause; however, the proximate cause of each individual case of NIHL may well be quite different, depending upon the source of the noise, the location at which the exposure occurred, the timing of the exposure, and, perhaps to some extent, the intensity of the exposure. It simply is not true that common cause is synonymous with proximate cause. This point is perhaps best made by drawing an analogy to the familiar context of automobile accidents caused by driver negligence. While driver negligence is the common cause of all such accidents, determining the proximate cause of a particular negligent driver\u2019s accident involves a factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>analysis of all the relevant circumstances, including the driver\u2019s specific negligence, where and when the accident occurred, etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX8\"><em>CSX Transp., Inc. </em>at 248, 680 A.2d 1082.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b539-7\">.
