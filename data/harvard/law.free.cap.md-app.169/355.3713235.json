(\u201cLessee\u201d) appeals the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County\u2019s grant of summary judgment to JLH Properties II, LLC (\u201cLessor\u201d) in a landlord-tenant proceeding instituted pursuant to Maryland Code (1974, 2003 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 8-101 of the Real Property Article. Lessee presents three questions for our review, which we have consolidated into the following:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment to Lessor because genuine disputes of material fact exist concerning the amount of rent due under the lease?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">We answer that question in the affirmative and shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">In May 2003, Lessee and Lessor entered into a three year commercial lease agreement (the \u201cLease\u201d). Lessee covenant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>ed to pay $600 per month in rent, and Lessor covenanted to furnish Lessee an office suite located at 14610 Main Street, in Upper Marlboro, Maryland (the \u201cProperty\u201d). The Lease also provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">7. L[essee] agrees that in case of fire or other casualty resulting in damage to the premises, they will give immediate notice thereof [to] the L[essor], who shall thereupon, with expedition and in a good and workmanlike manner, after said damage, enter upon and undertake such repair and rehabilitation, as is necessary to restore said premises to their original condition before such damages, with reasonable dispatch, provided that the necessary labor and materials are available to the L[essor] for restoring said premises to their original condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">In the event that said demised premises are subject to repair and rehabilitation within a reasonable time, <em>the rental herein shall be abated in the proportion that the amount of space which is not available to and usable by L[essee] as a result of such casualty and or the work and labor incidental to its rehabilitation bears to all of the space in the demised premises.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">In the event that said demised premises shall at any time during the demised term be totally destroyed by fire or other casualty, or shall be rendered partly untenantable, and the repair and rehabilitation of said demised premises shall be of an extent requiring more than ninety (90) days for its completion, then this Lease, at the option of either L[essee] or L[essor] may be terminated and the obligation to make rental payments thereupon shall cease as of the date of such damages or destruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">10. It is further agreed that if the rent aforesaid shall at any time be in arrears and unpaid for more than ten (10) days, a late fee of ten percent (10%) and all attorney\u2019s fees; costs of litigation/collection or any other expense incurred in collecting unpaid rent or possession of the leased premises shall become rent which is immediately due for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>of this lease and will be added to the rent, should L[essee\u2019s] failure to pay rent not be cured within ten (10) days of its receipt of written notice of any default from L[essor]....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6M\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Lessee was aware that there was some water damage to the Property, but it agreed to the Lease and commenced occupying the Property shortly afterwards. Lessee contends, however, that, after moving in, it immediately noticed \u201craw waste water\u201d seeping into the Property. Due to the problems associated with the raw wastewater seepage, including a foul odor and appearance, Lessee asserted that, after \u201ctwo to three months,\u201d the Property became one-hundred percent \u201c[u]nusable as a law office.\u201d As a result, Lessee claims to have contacted Lessor and demanded that the full rental be abated. Lessee ceased paying rent in September 2003, but did not request termination of the Lease, did not remove personalty from the Property, and did not return the keys to the Lessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">On April 28, 2004, Lessor filed a complaint in the District Court of Maryland for Prince George\u2019s County seeking repossession of the Property and unpaid rent pursuant to Maryland Code (1974, 2003 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 8-401 of the Real Property Article (\u201cR.P.\u201d). The complaint was apparently dismissed because it named Taiwo Agbaje, personally, as the tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Subsequent to Lessor\u2019s filing in the District Court, Lessee filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, alleging, among other things, breach of contract, intentional misrepresentation, and negligent misrepresentation (the \u201cBreach of Contract Case\u201d). In its complaint, Lessee alleged, in relevant part, that it had informed Lessor of the wastewater problems, that Lessor had promised to repair the problems, and that the persistent odor and damage associated with the wastewater rendered the Property unusable as a law office. Beginning in October 2003, Lessee ceased paying rent, and between October 2003 and March 2004, Lessee and Lessor agreed that no rent was due as long as the water damage persisted. According to the complaint, instead of \u201crepairing the plumbing problem\u201d in March 2004, Lessor replaced the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>damaged carpet in the Property with ceramic tiles. Lessee claimed that it suffered damage as a result of Lessor\u2019s failure to abate the water problem, including loss of business and damage to files and a filing cabinet.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">On June 23, 2004, Lessor filed a second complaint in the District Court properly naming Lessee as the tenant. In its amended complaint, Lessor sought $6,540 in total accrued and future rent (the \u201cEjectment Case\u201d). On June 30, 2004, Lessee filed a response, in which it denied liability and requested a jury trial. The Ejectment Case was removed to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, apparently without objection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">On October 15, 2004, Lessor moved for summary judgment in the Ejectment Case. Lessee opposed Lessor\u2019s motion for summary judgment and moved to consolidate the Ejectment and Breach of Contract cases, maintaining that the two causes arose from the same factual circumstances. In support of its motion, Lessee attached, as an exhibit, its complaint in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Breach of Contract Case and the affidavit of Taiwo Agbaje, the law firm\u2019s \u201cmanaging attorney.\u201d In his affidavit, Agbaje claimed, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">3. That [Lessor] is not owed any rent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">4. That on or about May 15, 2003, [Lessee] entered into a lease agreement for office space at 14610 Main Street Suite 103 with [Lessor] for $600 per month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">5. That [Lessor] received over $2000 in rent payments from [Lessee].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">6. That [Lessor] has not and did not provide a tenantable space to [Lessee] for the monies received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">7. That beginning from the inception of the [L]ease, the [Property] repeatedly and continuously experienced waste water and raw sewage flooding for over a year which rendered the [Property] not tenantable and which problem was not repaired by the [Lessor] despite repeated notice and which caused the [Lessee] damages in excess of $50,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-10\">8. That this led to [Lessee] bringing a suit for damages against the [Lessor], [a] copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2, and is scheduled for a jury trial before th[e] [circuit] [e]ourt in [the Breach of Contract Case.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-11\">9. That [Lessor] is not entitled to possession because no rent is owed and [Lessor] has not provided tenantable space to [Lessee] for monies already received from [Lessee].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACF\">On November 10, 2004, Lessor filed a response to Lessee\u2019s opposition to summary judgment. Lessor also opposed the consolidation of the two cases, claiming that there were no common questions of fact or law. According to Lessor, the <em>\u201cin rem </em>proceeding for summary ejectment concerns completely different and undisputed facts, law, and subject matter at issue in the <em>in personam </em>breach of contract and tort proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">A hearing on Lessor\u2019s motion for summary judgment commenced on January 7, 2005. During the hearing, Lessee did not dispute that it had continuously occupied the Property, in some capacity, since May 2003 but had not paid rent since September 2003. Rather, Lessee argued that it had notified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Lessor of the wastewater problem and that no rent was due under the Lease because the wastewater problems rendered the Property subject to repair and rehabilitation and wholly unusable. Lessor asserted that, not only was it entitled to accrued and future rent, but also late fees, and attorney\u2019s fees under the Lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">According to the circuit court, Agbaje\u2019s affidavit offered in opposition to the motion for summary judgment failed to demonstrate that Lessee was entitled to rent abatement. The court opined that, in order for Lessee to claim one-hundred percent abatement, Lessee needed to formally request termination of the Lease. With regard to Lessee\u2019s assertion that it was entitled to abate rent under the Lease, the court determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">What, in effect, would be a counterclaim or defense to the rent you have chosen instead to raise in a separate legal action. Whatever damages you recover in the other action may offset the judgment entered in this case, but it is not [the] court\u2019s obligation to consolidate these cases and delay the proceedings unnecessarily.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">In an oral opinion, the court awarded judgment of possession in favor of Lessor and awarded $9,600 in accrued rent, plus an additional $960 in late fees. A record of the January 7 hearing was not entered into the docket until January 19, 2005, when the court\u2019s written order granting summary judgment to Lessor was also finally entered. The docket entries reflect that Lessee\u2019s motion for consolidation was denied as \u201cmoot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Meanwhile, on January 12, 2005, Lessee filed a \u201cMotion for New Trial,\u201d in which it alleged that the court erred in granting summary judgment to Lessor because there were disputes of material fact concerning whether Lessee was entitled to abate rent under the Lease. Additionally, Lessee claimed that the court erred in not consolidating the Breach of Contract Case and the Ejectment Case. Attached as exhibits to its \u201cMotion for New Trial\u201d were a copy of the complaint in the Breach of Contract Case, a copy of the Lease, pictures pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>porting to show the Property in disrepair, the affidavit of Reginald McFadden, who is an experienced \u201chandyman,\u201d and a letter purportedly written by Lessor\u2019s counsel, William Monks.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The letter purportedly written by Monks stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">This office represents [Lessor] with regard to the leasehold of [Lessee] for the premises at 14610 Main Street, Suite 103, Upper Marlboro Maryland. In response to your letter of January 7, 2004, [Lessor] will not abate any further rent. In accordance with the terms and provisions of your lease, the rent shall be paid in advance on the first (1st) day of the month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">[Lessor] has made all repairs and abated your rent in accordance with paragraph 7 of the lease. While the water damage caused by the negligence of the first floor tenant was unfortunate, the lease anticipated such maintenance issues and [Lessor] made the appropriate rent abatement in accordance with the terms and provisions of the [L]ease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">Your failure to pay the January 1st rent put you in breach of the [L]ease. Should my client have to file suit to recover this rent, we will move the Court for all costs and expenses of litigation, including charges for reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">On January 27, 2005, the court denied Lessee\u2019s \u201cmotion for new trial or reconsideration.\u201d This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Lessor contends that, \u201c[b]eeause the trial court\u2019s denial of [Lessee\u2019s] motion for new trial was the final order under Maryland Rule 8-202(c), [Lessee\u2019s] appeal of the gran[t] of summary judgment is not properly before the [C]ourt.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">In the instant case, Lessee filed its post-trial motion on January 12, 2005. Although the motion was entitled \u201cMotion for New Trial,\u201d therein Lessee claimed that the circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>erred in granting summary judgment to Lessor because there were genuine disputes of material fact resolved by the court at the January 7 hearing. Lessee requested \u201can order granting a new trial,\u201d and \u201cany other relief that may be just and proper.\u201d Accordingly, as noted by the circuit court in denying the motion, Lessee\u2019s post judgment motion more properly should have been entitled a \u201cMotion for New Trial and or Revision of Judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">In addition, we recognize that the post-judgment motion was filed before the docket sheet indicated the disposition of Lessor\u2019s motion for summary judgment and before a written order disposing of the Ejectment Case was entered. Nevertheless, at the January 7 hearing, the circuit court indicated that it granted summary judgment in favor of Lessor, and the court\u2019s written order granting Lessor\u2019s motion for summary judgment is dated January 7, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-601, it is the responsibility of the clerk of the circuit court to promptly enter the court\u2019s judgment in the docket. Here, the court\u2019s judgment was not entered until January 19, 2005. As the Court of Appeals recently explained in <em>Tierco Maryland, Inc. v. Williams, </em>381 Md. 378, 400-01, 849 A.2d 504 (2004), where a post-judgment motion is filed within ten days of the court\u2019s judgment, but before the judgment is entered, while technically premature because of the clerk\u2019s failure to timely enter the order, the post-judgment motion should be treated as if timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Therefore, because Lessee filed a timely post-judgment revisory motion within ten days of the court\u2019s judgment, its motion should be treated as a Rule 2-534 Motion to Alter or Amend. <em>See Alitalia Linee Aeree It\u00e1liane v. Tornillo, </em>320 Md. 192, 200, 577 A.2d 34 (1990) (noting that, regardless of the title, a revisory motion filed within ten days of the court\u2019s judgment \u201cwill be treated as a Rule 2-534 motion and have the same effect on appeal time\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Maryland Rule 8-202(e) provides, in relevant part, where a party files a timely Rule 2-534 motion, \u201cthe notice of appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>shall be filed within 30 days after entry of (1) a notice withdrawing the motion or (2) an order denying a motion pursuant to Rule 2-533 or disposing of a motion pursuant to Rule 2-532 or 2-534.\u201d The court\u2019s order denying Lessee\u2019s Rule 2-534 motion was entered on January 31, 2005. Lessee filed its notice of appeal on February 7, 2005, within thirty days. Accordingly, Lessee\u2019s appeal was timely and we may consider the merits of the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Maryland Rule 2\u2014501(f) states that a court \u201cshall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d We review \u201ca trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo.\u201d Remsburg v. Montgomery, </em>376 Md. 568, 579, 831 A.2d 18 (2003). <em>See also Todd v. Mass Trans. Admin., </em>373 Md. 149, 154, 816 A.2d 930 (2003); <em>Beyer v. Morgan State Univ., </em>369 Md. 335, 359, 800 A.2d 707 (2002); <em>Schmerling v. Injured Workers\u2019 Ins. Fund, </em>368 Md. 434, 443, 795 A.2d 715 (2002). \u201cThe trial court will not determine any disputed facts, but rather makes a ruling as a matter of law. The standard of appellate review, therefore, is whether the trial court was legally correct.\u201d <em>Williams v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>359 Md. 101, 114, 753 A.2d 41 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">When reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we first determine whether a genuine dispute of material fact exists \u201cand only where such dispute is absent will we proceed to review determinations of law.\u201d <em>Remsburg, </em>376 Md. at 579, 831 A.2d 18. \u201cIn so doing, we construe the facts properly before the court, and any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 579-80, 831 A.2d 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\u201cFinally, [i]n reviewing [the circuit court\u2019s] decision to grant a motion for summary judgment, we evaluate \u2018the same material from the record and decide[ ] the same legal issues as the circuit court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Campbell v. Lake Hallowell Homeowners </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number><em>Ass\u2019n, </em>157 Md.App. 504, 518-19, 852 A.2d 1029 (2004) (quoting <em>Crews v. Hollenbach, </em>126 Md.App. 609, 624, 730 A.2d 742 (1999)) (alterations in Campbell). We \u201cuphold the grant of a summary judgment only on the grounds relied on by the trial court.\u201d <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 80, 660 A.2d 447 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Before considering Lessee\u2019s arguments, we consider whether there is a final judgment in this case. At the January 7, 2005 hearing, the court declined to address Lessor\u2019s requests for interest and attorney\u2019s fees, stating that the issues were \u201cstill pending.\u201d Real Property \u00a7 8-401 permits a landlord to recover late fees, but there is no provision that permits the court to award litigation costs or attorney\u2019s fees. The Lease provided that rent was to include all attorney\u2019s fees and litigation costs incurred in collecting unpaid rent. We are persuaded, however, that, despite the characterization of such damages as rent, attorney\u2019s fees and costs were not recoverable in this case. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">In <em>University Plaza Shopping Ctr., Inc. v. Garcia, </em>279 Md. 61, 367 A.2d 957 (1977), the Court of Appeals considered whether costs incurred by a landlord to adapt the premises for a tenant\u2019s use and which the lease defined as \u201crent\u201d could be collected by the landlord in a summary ejectment proceeding. The court noted that \u201crent\u201d is not defined by statute, but is generally defined as \u201cpayment for the tenant\u2019s use, possession and enjoyment of land.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 65-66, 367 A.2d 957. Citing <em>Theatrical Corp. v. Trust Co., </em>157 Md. 602, 146 A. 805 (1929), and <em>Feldmeyer v. Werntz, </em>119 Md. 285, 289, 86 A. 986 (1913), the <em>Garcia </em>Court noted that the payment of taxes, insurance premiums, and required improvements could be considered rent depending upon the parties\u2019 agreement. In the context of a commercial lease, the Court held that \u201ccharges which may be definitely ascertained, paid by the tenant, and going to his use, possession and enjoyment of rental commercial premises, are rent if such was the intention of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>367 A.2d 957. The Court determined that the work performed in adapting the rented property for the tenant\u2019s use was rent and could be collected in a summary ejectment proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">More recently, in <em>Shum v. Gaudreau, </em>317 Md. 49, 562 A.2d 707 (1989), the Court of Appeals again considered what types of damages could be recovered by a landlord in a summary ejectment proceeding. In that case, a landlord prevailed in an ejectment proceeding and was awarded possession of the property and one month\u2019s rent. Approximately one month later, the landlord filed a breach of contract action against the tenant, seeking recovery for damages to the property and costs incurred for maintenance services both before and after the tenant\u2019s departure. The lease at issue required the tenant to return the property in the same condition as when it was received and defined \u201crent\u201d to include all \u201crepairs and renovations to the leased premises\u201d that the landlord incurred in returning the property to its original condition. <em>Id. </em>at 64-65, 562 A.2d 707. In the breach of contract case, the tenant argued that, because the definition of rent in the lease included repair costs, the landlord could have recovered those costs in the ejectment proceeding. And, because the landlord failed to seek those damages in the ejectment proceeding, the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>precluded recovery in the breach of contract case.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The <em>Shum </em>Court determined that, generally, contract damages could not be sought in a R.P. \u00a7 8-401 ejectment proceeding. According to the Court, the resolution of \u201cpossible complexities of proof\u2019 as to contract damages would be inimical to the purpose of the ejectment statute, to provide a speedy repossession of the premises and a straightforward calculation of damages. <em>Shum, </em>317 Md. at 60, 562 A.2d 707. The Court then went on to consider the situation where the lease defined contract damages <em>as rent. </em>Relying upon the definition of \u201crent\u201d in <em>Garcia, </em>the <em>Shum </em>Court determined that only those repairs and maintenance costs that could fairly be attributed to the tenant\u2019s \u201cuse, possession and enjoyment\u201d could be collected in a summary ejectment proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 64, 562 A.2d 707. Therefore, the costs associated with improv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>ing the property for the tenant\u2019s use were collectable in the ejectment case, and the landlord\u2019s claim in the breach of contract case to those damages was barred by <em>res judicata. </em>But, those costs associated with returning the property to its original condition were not \u201cdesigned to enhance [the][t]en-ant\u2019s use and enjoyment of the premises, but rather to put the property in proper shape for reletting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67, 562 A.2d 707. As a result, recovery for those costs was not precluded in the breach of contract case.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Here, the attorney\u2019s fees that Lessor incurred in the ejectment proceeding did not relate to the Lessee\u2019s use and enjoyment of the Property. Moreover, it is well settled that to recover attorney\u2019s fees and expenses claimed as damages for a breach of contract the plaintiff must prove entitlement to such damages \u201c \u2018with the certainty and under the standards ordinarily applicable for proof of contractual damages.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Porter Hayden Co., </em>116 Md.App. 605, 703, 698 A.2d 1167 (1997) (quoting <em>Bankers &amp; Shippers Ins. Co. v. Elec. Enters. Inc., </em>287 Md. 641, 661, 415 A.2d 278 (1980)). The plaintiff must establish that the fees sought are reasonable, and, without a specific and detailed accounting of the services actually performed, \u201cthe reasonableness, <em>vel non, </em>of the fees can be determined only by conjecture or opinion of the attorney seeking fees and would therefore not be supported by competent evidence.\u201d <em>Maxima Corp. v. 6933 Arlington Dev. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>100 Md.App. 441, 453-54, 641 A.2d 977 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">As the <em>Shum </em>Court explained, such a complex factual inquiry would frustrate the expedited design of the summary ejectment statute. Although Lessor may be entitled to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred in connection with the Lessee\u2019s alleged breach of its contractual obligation to pay rent, if any, in a breach of contract proceeding, such fees are not \u201crent\u201d and, therefore, are not recoverable in a R.P. \u00a7 8-401 summary ejectment proceeding. Even though the circuit court reserved on the issue of costs and attorney\u2019s fees, such an award was not recoverable in this case. As a result, we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>persuaded that the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is a final judgment for the purposes of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Lessee contends that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment because there were genuine issues of material fact concerning whether the wastewater problems at the Property implicated the abatement provision in the Lease. According to Lessee, its duty to pay rent was dependent upon Lessor fulfilling its obligation to keep the Property in repair. Moreover, Lessee claims that the Property is located in a \u201cmulti-use building containing residential dwelling units and small office space\u201d and that the plumbing and utility room from where the wastewater entered were used in common with the dwelling units, thereby implicating R.P. \u00a7 8-211. According to R.P. \u00a7 8\u2014211(i), where notice of \u201cserious and substantial defects and conditions\u201d is provided to the landlord and the landlord fails to undertake repair, \u201cthe tenant may refuse to pay rent and raise the existence of the asserted defects or conditions as an affirmative defense to an action for distress for rent or to any complaint proceeding brought by the landlord to recover rent or possession of the leased premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Lessor contends that there are no genuine disputes of material fact, noting that Lessee admits to having executed the Lease, to taking and retaining possession of the Property, and to not paying rent since September 2003. According to Lessor, Lessee\u2019s covenant to pay rent was independent of the abatement provision of the Lease and that, in any event, as a matter of law, Lessee cannot claim that the Property was one-hundred percent unusable while continuing to occupy it and pay no rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">\n<em>A. Real Property \u00a7 8-211</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">We first consider Lessee\u2019s contention that R.P. \u00a7 8-211 applies to the instant case. Lessee did not raise this issue before the circuit court in its opposition to Lessor\u2019s motion for summary judgment or at the January 7 hearing. The argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>ment was raised for the first time in Lessee\u2019s motion to alter or amend. Accordingly, Lessee\u2019s argument that the instant case is controlled by an application of R.P. \u00a7 8-211 has not been preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Appellate review is governed by Maryland Rule 8-131 (a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">Ordinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court, but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">This Court does, however, have discretionary authority under Rule 8-131 to review matters not previously raised at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Recently, in <em>Jones v. State, </em>379 Md. 704, 843 A.2d 778 (2004), the Court of Appeals considered whether this Court exceeded its discretion by excusing a procedural default in an appeal from a post-conviction proceeding. Interpreting Rule 8-131, the Court of Appeals stated that the primary purpose of the Rule is to \u201censure fairness for all parties and to promote the orderly administration of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 713-14, 843 A.2d 778. Moreover, the Court noted that when \u201cpresented with a plausible exercise of this discretion, appellate courts should make two determinations concerning the promotion or subversion of 8-131(a)\u2019s twin goals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 714, 843 A.2d 778. The <em>Jones </em>Court determined that \u201cthe appellate court should [first] consider whether the exercise of discretion will work unfair prejudice to either of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cSecond, the appellate court should consider whether the exercise of its discretion will promote the orderly administration of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 715, 843 A.2d 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">An application of the two-part test to the instant case reveals that discretionary review is unwarranted. First, exercising discretionary review in this case would unfairly prejudice Lessor. As the Court of Appeals has explained: \u201cThe interests of fairness are furthered by \u2018requir[ing] counsel to bring the position of their client to the attention of the lower <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>court at trial so that the trial court can pass upon, and possibly correct any errors in the proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Bell, </em>334 Md. 178, 189, 638 A.2d 107 (1994) <em>(quoting Clayman v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>266 Md. 409, 416, 292 A.2d 689 (1972)). Second, requiring matters to be resolved by the trial court prior to appeal permits a potential error to be corrected and the risk of subsequent trials avoided. We, therefore, decline to consider the application of R.P. \u00a7 8-211 to the instant case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">\n<em>B. Contractual Defenses to Payment of Rent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">Under Paragraph Seven of the Lease, upon notice by Lessee of damage to the Property, Lessor covenanted to undertake repair and rehabilitation of the Property and restore it to its original condition \u201cwith expedition and workmanlike manner.\u201d More importantly for Lessee, in the event that the Property was subject to repair and rehabilitation, Lessee was permitted to abate rent \u201cin the proportion that the amount of space which is not available to and usable by Lessee as a result of such casualty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Lessor contends that, under <em>Brady v. Brady, </em>140 Md. 403, 117 A. 882 (1922), its obligation to keep the Property in a state of repair was independent of Lessee\u2019s covenant to pay rent. Therefore, any failure by Lessor to keep the Property in a state of repair did not relieve Lessee of its obligation to pay the $600 monthly rental. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">In <em>Brady, </em>the Court of Appeals considered whether a tenant\u2019s obligation to pay rent was dependent upon the landlord\u2019s obligation to pay ground and water rent and other \u201cexpenses necessary to the upkeep of the [leased] property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407, 117 A. 882. The lease in <em>Brady </em>provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>\u201cAnd the said Walter E. Brady doth hereby covenant that he will pay one-third of all taxes, ground rent, water rent, fire insurance premium and all other legal charges or necessary expenses on or repairs to said property, except repairs to said trestle, during the term of this lease, or any renewal thereof; the other two-thirds parts thereof to be paid by the owners of the other two-undivided-third parts of said premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 405, 117 A. 882.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Through their course of dealing, the tenant, also the owner of an undivided interest in the property, would provide statements in which he indicated the amount of rent due. He would thereafter deduct the rental amount from the amount the landlord agreed to pay to maintain the property. Where the amount of rent exceeded the maintenance fee, the tenant forwarded a check to the landlord for the balance. Eventually, the landlord\u2019s obligation to pay one-third of the maintenance on the property exceeded the amount of the rental due, leaving the balance in favor of the tenant. Accordingly, the tenant billed the landlord, who disputed the bills and demanded a full rental payment from the tenant. When the tenant refused, the landlord filed an action in ejectment for nonpayment of rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">According to the <em>Brady </em>Court, the crux of the issue was whether \u201cthe covenant on the part of the [tenant] to pay rent is to be construed in connection with the [landlord\u2019s] covenant to pay one-third of all taxes, ground rent, water rent, and other expenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407, 117 A. 882. In concluding that the landlord\u2019s duty to repair was not independent of the tenant\u2019s duty to pay rent, the Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">If we are dealing with the usual covenant on the part of a landlord to keep the leased premises in repair, the covenant would, under the weight of authority, be considered as entirely independent of the covenant to pay rent, and a failure to repair would be no defense to any action founded upon nonpayment of rent. And it is to covenants of that character that the cases relied upon by the appellant refer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>But whether such a covenant on the part of the landlord is to be considered as independent of or dependent upon the lessee\u2019s covenant to pay rent depends upon the intention of the parties. And if they are independent this rule as stated in Mr. Tiffany\u2019s treatise on the law of landlord and tenant applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\">\u201cThat is, if a particular stipulation by the landlord, and that by the tenant for the payment of rent are \u2018dependent,\u2019 then the non-performance by the landlord is a defense to the claim for rent, while it is otherwise if the stipulations are \u2018independent.\u2019 This is merely an application of a general principle applicable to all contracts or instruments containing executory stipulations by both parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">And it is said in Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">\u201cWhere the lessee is expressly authorized by the lease to make deductions from the rent, the balance represents all that is due to the lessor under the reservation of rent, and it is only such balance that he is entitled to recover, whether by distress or by action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 407-08, 117 A. 882 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Here, we are persuaded that Lessee\u2019s covenant to pay rent was not independent of Lessor\u2019s covenant to keep the Property in a state of repair. As in the language relied upon by the <em>Brady </em>Court, the Lease expressly permits Lessee to abate rent in proportion to the amount of usable space remaining as a result of Lessor\u2019s failure to repair and rehabilitate the Property. Only the rental for that proportion of the Property that was \u201cavailable to, and usable by Lessee\u201d was due, and \u201cit was only such balance that [Lessor] [wa]s entitled to recover.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>140 Md. at 408, 117 A. 882.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">The Restatement (Second) of Property \u00a7 11.1 provides that, where a tenant is entitled to abatement, the tenant may assert that right in an ejectment proceeding brought by the landlord. Comment b states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEB\">b. <em>Manner of accomplishing rent abatement. </em>Frequently the rent abatement will be accomplished in a judicial pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>ceeding brought by the landlord to evict the tenant for failure to pay the rent. In this proceeding, if the tenant is entitled to abate the rent, he is entitled to defend against eviction by establishing his right to abate the rent and paying to the landlord the amount of the abated rent as judicially determined in the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\">If the tenant has paid the rent stipulated to in the lease during the period of time when he was entitled to an abatement of rent, he is entitled to sue for the excess he has paid to the landlord and the judicial proceeding will establish the proper amount of the abated rent for the period of the landlord\u2019s default.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">Reporter\u2019s note 5 to section 11.1 explains, in pertinent part: Where the tenant is entitled to an abatement of rent and has paid the rent as properly abated, such payment must be a valid defense to the landlord\u2019s suit to recover possession on the ground of nonpayment of rent. If it were the case that the tenant could be dispossessed even after paying rent, the rent abatement remedy of this section would be meaningless.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Moreover, not permitting a tenant to assert a contractual abatement provision as a defense in an ejectment proceeding would result in unnecessary litigation. Pursuant to R.P. \u00a7 8-401(e), which applies \u201c[i]n any action of summary ejectment,\u201d a tenant has a right to redeem the leased premises prior to eviction by paying \u201call past due amounts,\u201d in addition to costs and fees. Assuming that a tenant was actually entitled to rent abatement, but could not assert that right in an ejectment proceeding, the tenant would be required to pay the full rental specified in the lease in order to assert his or her statutory right of redemption. To recoup the excess paid, the tenant would be required to file a collateral breach of contract action against the landlord. Such a result does not further judicial economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">We hold that, where a lease provides for an abatement of rent, the tenant may assert the abatement provision in an ejectment proceeding instituted under R.P. \u00a7 8-401. Courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>in other jurisdictions have similarly held that, where a tenant is entitled to abatement, it can be asserted as a defense to an action by the landlord for possession or ejectment. <em>See Hsu v. Thomas, </em>387 A.2d 588 (D.C.Ct.App.1978); <em>Academy Spires, Inc. v. Brown, </em>111 N.J.Super. 477, 268 A.2d 556 (1970); <em>Morbeth Realty Corp. v. Velez, </em>73 Misc.2d 996, 343 N.Y.S.2d 406 (Civ.Ct.1973); <em>Miller v. Ritchie, </em>45 Ohio St.3d 222, 543 N.E.2d 1265 (1989); <em>Pugh v. Holmes, </em>486 Pa. 272, 405 A.2d 897 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Here, Lessee raised the issue of abatement both in its opposition to Lessor\u2019s motion for summary judgment and at the January 7 hearing. In its affidavit offered in opposition to summary judgment, Lessee claimed that it repeatedly notified Lessor of the wastewater problems at the Property. Moreover, due to the wastewater problems, the Property was rendered \u201cnot tenantable\u201d and was in such a state of disrepair that it was entirely unusable. Under the Lease, Lessee was only required to pay rent in proportion to the amount of the Property that was actually usable for its intended purpose as a law office. The issue of whether the Property was rendered unusable, and if so, to what extent, and thus, the amount of the rental owed, were questions of fact improperly resolved by the circuit court on a summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Real Property \u00a7 8-401(c) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">(2)(i) If, when the trial occurs, it appears to the satisfaction of the court, that the rent, or any part of the rent and late fees are actually due and unpaid, the court shall determine the amount of rent and late fees due as of the date the complaint was filed, if the trial occurs within the time specified by subsection (b)(3) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">(ii) 1. If the trial does not occur within the time specified in subsection (b)(3)(i) of this section and the tenant has not become current since the filing of the complaint, the court, if the complaint so requests, shall enter a judgment in favor of the landlord for possession of the premises and determine the rent and late fees due as of the trial date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>2. The determination of rent and late fees shall include the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">A. Rent claimed in the complaint;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">B. Rent accruing after the date of the filing of the complaint;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">C. Late fees accruing in or prior to the month in which the complaint was filed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">D. Credit for payments of rent and late fees made by the tenant after the complaint was filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">(iii) The court may also give judgment in favor of the landlord for the amount of rent and late fees determined to be due together with costs of the suit if the court finds that the residential tenant was personally served with a summons, or, in the case of a nonresidential tenancy, there was such service of process or submission to the jurisdiction of the court as would support a judgment in contract or tort.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">In the instant case, clearly the Lessor was subject to the jurisdiction of the court. Once the issue of Lessor\u2019s liability was resolved, the circuit court had authority under R.P. \u00a7 8-401(c) to award a monetary judgment against Lessee. Because the amount of the rent actually due was the subject of a material dispute of fact, however, the amount of damages was also in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">Lessee filed a breach of contract action, but, in that case, it is seeking recovery for excess rent paid, expectation and consequential damages, and actual damage to its personalty. Lessee would not have been entitled to recovery of those damages in the ejectment proceeding, and the fact that Lessee sought to recover damages for breach of contract does not preclude it from asserting the contractual abatement provision defining rent in the instant ejectment proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">JUDGMENT REVERSED. CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-14\">. Lessee posed the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-15\">I. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment as a matter of law because there were material factual issues in dispute, which barred summary judgment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-16\">II. The trial court erred as a matter of law in granting summary judgment where the appel[l]ant testified about repair problems rendering the office space 100 percent unusable and mandating a full abatement of rent as expressly provided for in the lease agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-17\">III. The trial court erred in granting [a] money judgment to appellee for rent of $9,600, late fees of $960 and costs when there was no personal service upon appellant?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b384-7\">. The appropriateness of the removal is unclear from this record. The District Court has exclusive original jurisdiction in an ejectment proceeding between a landlord and tenant brought under R.P. \u00a7 8-401. Such actions are excepted from the $5,000 \"amount in controversy\u201d provisions of C.J.P. \u00a7 4\u2014402(d) establishing concurrent jurisdiction in the circuit court. Courts and Judicial Proceedings \u00a7 4\u2014401(e) establishes a right to a jury trial \"[i]n a civil action in which the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 exclusive of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Real Property \u00a7 8-601 relates to jury demands in such cases and R.P. \u00a7 8-604(a)-(f) subjects a jury trial request to review by the District Court. That review is limited to the timeliness of the demand, the amount in controversy, and the existence of a valid waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Here, the claim for money damages was less than $10,000 and Lessee's pleadings indicate \"the value of the right to possession\u201d of the Property was $0. <em>See Bringe v. Collins, </em>274 Md. 338, 347, 335 A.2d 670 (1975) (considering the right to a jury trial in landlord-tenant actions, and concluding that \"[flor a party in a landlord-tenant action to be entitled to a jury trial, there must be a claim for money damages over [the statutory or constitutional limit at which the right to a jury trial attaches] or a claim that the value of the right to possession exceeds [the statutory or constitutional limit]\u201d). <em>See also Carroll v.
