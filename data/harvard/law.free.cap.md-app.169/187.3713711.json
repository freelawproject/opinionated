The effect of the grant of summary judgment was a partial reversal of an order of the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) awarding credit to the County, on a weeks-eredit rather than dollar-credit format, for compensation benefits paid to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">Appellant raises one question for our review, which, as rephrased, is:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-11\">When a claimant reopens a claim for worsening of condition, and the award is increased from a first-tier injury to a second-tier injury, is credit to the employer to be made on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>the basis of dollars paid, or the number of weeks for which compensation was paid?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">For the reasons discussed herein, we shall affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Since the underlying facts are not at issue in this case, we recount them only briefly. On January 9, 2001, appellant, a master electrician for the Montgomery County Board of Education, suffered a compensable injury to his lower back while lifting a heavy transformer. Appellant filed a claim for benefits with the Commission on January 31, 2001, under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cAct\u201d). <em>See </em>Md.Code, Lab. &amp; Empl. (\u201cL.E.\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 9-101 <em>et seq. (1999 </em>Rep. Vol., 2005 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">On April 18, 2002, the Commission held a hearing on appellant\u2019s claim and, on May 2, 2002, issued its first award of benefits based on a finding that appellant had sustained a permanent partial disability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s subsequent awards to appellant and the procedural history of this case, are detailed, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">STANDARD of REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">In <em>Stanley v. American Fed\u2019n of State &amp; Local Mun. Employees Local No. 553, </em>165 Md.App. 1, 13, 884 A.2d 724 (2005), we noted that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-10\">[ujnder Maryland Rule 2-501 (f), summary judgment may be granted \u201cif the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIe\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>We review a circuit court\u2019s order granting summary judgment <em>de novo. </em>We determine whether there is any dispute of material fact, and, if there is none, we then determine whether the court was legally correct in its ruling.

Thus, we review the circuit court\u2019s decision <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\n<em>Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">\u201cThe [Act] was originally enacted in 1914 to compensate employees for the loss of earning capacity resulting from accidental injury, disease, or death occurring during the course of employment.\u201d <em>Philip Elecs. N. Am. v. Wright, </em>348 Md. 209, 215, 703 A.2d 150 (1997) (citing <em>DeBusk v. Johns Hopkins, </em>342 Md. 432, 437, 677 A.2d 73 (1996)). Pursuant to L.E. \u00a7 9-501, persons accidentally injured at work may be entitled to a variety of benefits from their employers, regardless of fault. <em>See also Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt. City v. Johnson, </em>156 Md.App. 569, 586, 847 A.2d 1190 (2004), <em>aff'd </em>387 Md. 1, 874 A.2d 439 (2005). \u201cThe Act essentially is remedial, social legislation designed to protect workers and their families from various hardships that result from employment-related injuries.\u201d <em>Livering v. Richardson\u2019s Rest. &amp; PMA, </em>374 Md. 566, 574, 823 A.2d 687 (2003). In <em>Johnson, supra, </em>156 Md.App. at 587-88, 847 A.2d 1190, we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">The Act was conceived to protect workers and their families, among others. But, as the Court of Appeals has explained several times, including in <em>Polomski, </em>344 Md. at 76, 684 A.2d 1338 \u201c[although the Act\u2019s name suggests that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>intended solely for the benefit of employees, the preamble to the 1914 Act, and, indeed, [the Court\u2019s] previous holdings, reveal otherwise.\u201d The Court has made clear that, \u201c[i]n reality, the Act protects employees, employers, and the public alike.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">(Internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Among the benefits available to employees is monetary compensation for permanent partial disability. <em>See </em>L.E. \u00a7 9-625. Section 9-627, the so-called \u201clisted member\u201d provision, specifies the number of weeks of compensation to which a claimant is entitled, depending upon which part of the claimant\u2019s body is injured. Appellant\u2019s injury fell under the \u201cother cases\u201d category of injuries covered specifically by subsection 9-627(k).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under this sub-section, appellant could receive a maximum of 500 weeks of compensation, dependent upon the percentage of his disability. See L.E. \u00a7 9-627(k)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Pursuant to L.E. \u00a7 9-627(k)(4), compensation is paid \u201cat the rates listed for the period in \u00a7\u00a7 9-628 through 9-639[.]\u201d These sections establish a tier structure for determining the actual amount of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Section 9-628 states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>(e) <em>On or after January 1, </em>2000.\u2014Except as provided in subsections (f) and (g) of this section, if a covered employee is awarded compensation for less than 75 weeks in a claim arising from events occurring on or after January 1, 2000, the employer or its insurer shall pay the covered employee compensation that equals one-third of the average weekly wage of the covered employee but does not exceed $114.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Section 9-628 is considered the first tier level.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Section 9-629 is considered the second or middle tier and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">Compensation for period equal to or greater than 75 weeks but less than 250 weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">If a covered employee is awarded compensation for a period equal to or greater than 75 weeks but less than 250 weeks, the employer or its insurer shall pay the covered employee weekly compensation that equals two-thirds of the average weekly wage of the covered employee but does not exceed one-third of the State average weekly wage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">The third tier, \u00a7 9-630, covers serious disabilities and provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-10\">Serious disability\u2014Compensation for 250 weeks or more.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-11\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, if a covered employee is given an award or a combination of awards resulting from 1 accidental personal injury or occupational disease for 250 weeks or more under \u00a7 9-627 of this subtitle:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-12\">(i) the Commission shall increase the award or awards by one-third the number of weeks in the award or awards, computed to the nearest whole number;

Under L.E. \u00a7 9-628, the rate of compensation was $114 per week for 50 weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\"><em>Order </em>II\u2014On January 9, 2003, the Commission, by stipulation of the parties/<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ordered an increase in the rate of industrial loss of the use of the body as a result of permanent partial disability to 24%, 14% related to the accidental injury (a 4% increase over Order I) and 10% due to a preexisting condition. The rate of compensation for this injury remained the same, $114 per week, because the percentage of injury, 14%, kept the claim within Tier 1; the total number of weeks to be compensated increased, however, from 50 from 70 (14% multiplied by 500 equals 70 weeks). <em>Order </em>III\u2014On May 26, 2004, in response to appellant filing a petition to reopen his claim due to a worsening of his condition, pursuant to L.E. \u00a7 9-736/[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>found that appellant\u2019s partial permanent disability to the body was 33%, 23% due to accidental injury (a 9% increase) and 10% due to a pre-existing condition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That resulted in an increase in the award from 14% to 23%; thus, <em>appellant\u2019s compensation award moved from a Tier 1 level injury to a Tier 2 level injury </em>(23 percent multiplied by 500 equals 115 weeks).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Under Order III, appellant was entitled to 115 weeks of compensation, subject to an offsetting credit for payments of dollars made by the County under Order II, which translated to 70 weeks of compensation under Tier 1 for a total of $7,980. By ordering a dollar-credit for the amount previously paid under Order II, rather than a weeks-credit, the County calculated that it was potentially liable for a windfall to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The purported windfall was calculated as follows: In Order III, the total compensation awarded was $25,645 (115 weeks multiplied by $223). The amount of money awarded, and paid, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>under Orders I and II was $7,980 (70 weeks multiplied by $114). Under a dollar-credit formulation, therefore, appellant was still owed $17,665 ($25,645 minus $7,980). Under the County\u2019s weeks-credit calculation, since it had previously paid 70 weeks of compensation, Order III required that it pay only 45 more weeks of compensation at the Tier 2 level, for a remaining payment of $10,035 (45 weeks multiplied by $223). Thus, the amount at issue in this appeal is the difference between the dollar-credit ($17,665) and the weeks-credit ($10,-035), or $7,630. The Commission did not adopt the County\u2019s position; thus, the County sought judicial review of Order III in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">On November 9, 2004, the County filed a motion for summary judgment challenging Order III, not on the basis of the increased percentage of disability awarded to appellant, but on the Commission\u2019s determination of the form of credit due the County for payments previously made. Appellant likewise moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">On February 8, 2005, after a hearing on the cross-motions for summary judgment, the circuit court granted the County\u2019s motion, ruling from the bench that the County was entitled to a credit for the number of weeks of benefits paid, rather than the amount of dollars.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On that same date, the court memori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>alized its oral opinion with a written order. Appellant noted this timely appeal of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Appellant maintains that the legislatively mandated method for calculating the credit to be awarded in cases of re-opening differs when the subsequent award is increased to Tier 3, rather than to Tier 2, as in the case <em>sub </em>judice.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Our holding follows the Court of Appeals\u2019 most recent guidance in <em>Ametek v. O\u2019Connor, </em>364 Md. 143, 771 A.2d 1072 (2001). In order to provide context for our discussion of that holding, and given that our holding in this case departs from previous decisions of this Court, we begin with an analysis of the significant case law in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">In <em>Norris v. United Cerebral Palsy, </em>86 Md.App. 508, 511, 587 A.2d 557 (1991), this Court addressed the question of a weeks-credit where the claimant\u2019s reopening resulted in an increased compensation award from Tier 1 to Tier 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Norris\u2019s award for partial permanent disability, under \u201cother cases,\u201d rose from 10% to 30%.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>On his petition for reopening, the Commission awarded the employer a dollar-credit, \u201cfor the amount previously paid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The circuit court disagreed and, applying the language of then Art. 101 \u00a7 36(3)(a)(iii), ordered a weeks-credit. <em>Id. </em>at 513, 587 A.2d 557. Thus, the question before this Court then was, in large part, the same as the one before us now.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The <em>Norris </em>Court discussed the legislative intent in placing the \u201ccap language\u201d \u201cproviso\u201d within subparagraph (iii) alone and not other subsections of the statute. The Court noted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaK\">As we have already indicated, the language of the proviso is not at all ambiguous; in fact, it is clear, unambiguous and susceptible of only one meaning. When, however, one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>considers its location, <em>i.e., </em>being placed at the end of subparagraph (in), an element of ambiguity is introduced.<footnotemark>[11]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 516, 587 A.2d 557 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Ultimately, given this ambiguity, the <em>Norris </em>Court found \u201cit appropriate to apply the rule of statutory construction which requires that the benefit of the doubt be given to the worker\u201d and held that the employer was only entitled to a dollar, rather than a weeks, credit for previous payments made to Norris.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">In <em>Philip Elecs., supra, </em>348 Md. at 212, 703 A.2d 150, the Court of Appeals was called upon to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADi\">determine whether, after an award [pursuant to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Maryland Code (Repl.Vol.1991, 1997 Supp.) ] to a claimant is reduced pursuant to a petition for judicial review, the employer is entitled to a credit for the total amount of money paid to the claimant before the reduction of the original award, or whether the appropriate credit is the number of weeks the employer paid benefits prior to the reduction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Wright, the injured employee, had been awarded compensation for a knee injury (an \u201cother cases\u201d injury) under L.E. \u00a7 9-627(k) at the Tier 3 level.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Both Wright and Philip Electronics filed for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s award. <em>Id. </em>at 213, 703 A.2d 150. The jury returned a verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>finding that Wright had suffered loss of use of her body at a <em>lower </em>level than that found by the Commission, entitling her to compensation at the Tier 2 level.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>\u201cSignificantly, the Commission also gave Philip Electronics a credit for the amount of the monetary payments made under the Commission\u2019s original order....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Notably, in this case of a reduction in benefits, the economic incentives, and the litigating positions of the employer and employee, were effectively reversed from the case <em>sub judice </em>and from other similar cases. On remand the Commission ordered a dollar-credit. When again before the circuit court, Wright claimed that the Commission erred in awarding Philip Electronics a dollar-credit rather than a weeks-credit for payments made under the Tier 3 designation. The circuit court affirmed the Commission\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 213-14, 703 A.2d 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">This Court reversed the judgment of the circuit court, holding that Philip Electronics was entitled to a weeks-credit, not a dollar-credit. <em>Id. </em>at 214, 703 A.2d 150. The Court of Appeals affirmed this Court, noting that \u201cthe language of \u00a7 9-627(k), as well as the language of \u00a7 9-629 and \u00a7 9-630, clearly and unambiguously demonstrate a legislative commitment to the payment of permanent partial disability benefits within a weekly framework.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218, 703 A.2d 150. Citing previous decisions construing the Act, the Court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">Taken together, [previous cases] and the plain language of the Act stand for the proposition that the General Assembly intended that an employer\u2019s credit for the payment of permanent partial disability benefits be based upon the number of weeks of compensation previously paid, absent clear legislative expression to the contrary. Accordingly, we hold that when a claimant\u2019s initial award by the Commission is reduced pursuant to a petition for judicial review, an employer shall be entitled to a credit for the number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>weeks of benefits actually paid in accordance with the original order, rather than a credit based upon the amount of money previously paid to the worker.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 225-26, 703 A.2d 150. The Court also found that a weeks-credit comported with the fundamental purpose of compensation for injured employees \u201cto receive the weekly payment of benefits for the allotted number of weeks,____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226, 703 A.2d 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">This Court has addressed two similar cases, each of which further illuminate our discussion. First, in <em>Ametek, Inc. v. O\u2019Connor, </em>126 Md.App. 109, 111, 727 A.2d 437 (1999), we were faced with determining \u201chow to calculate the credit due to an employer/insurer for benefits paid to a claimant prior to an increase in the claimant\u2019s award that resulted from judicial review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">O\u2019Connor, an employee of Ametek Inc., had been granted Tier 1 compensation by the Commission, which was then increased to Tier 3 following a trial in the circuit court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the employer urged that the credit be applied on a weeks-credit rather than a dollar-credit basis. <em>Id. </em>Noting that the Act is a remedial statute to be \u201cliberally construed in favor of employees,\u201d we outlined the Court of Appeals\u2019 reasoning in the <em>Philip Elecs. </em>case, among others,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> focusing on the Act\u2019s benevolent purposes rather than strictly on the <em>Philip Elecs. </em>Court\u2019s eventual holding awarding a weeks-credit. <em>Id. </em>at 118-19, 727 A.2d 437. We stated that we</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>ha[d] not uncovered any case suggesting that ... a claimant should receive less in benefit dollars than he or she is otherwise entitled to recover ... Instead, ... the Act is liberally construed so as to minimize hardship to the employee and his or her dependents. Consequently, absent a clear legislative directive, the approach that inures a benefit to the employee is ordinarily favored.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 122, 727 A.2d 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">We concluded by stating that, \u201cwhen an award is increased upon judicial review, the Employer is not entitled to a credit based on the number of weeks for which benefits were paid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 123, 727 A.2d 437. Rather, the employer is entitled to a credit for the total amount of money actually paid to the claimant prior to the increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Our next consideration of the subject occurred in <em>Anne Arundel County v. Tierney, </em>132 Md.App. 149, 751 A.2d 35 (2000). Tierney was originally awarded compensation for permanent partial disability based upon a 19.5% loss of use of a leg. <em>Id. </em>at 151, 751 A.2d 35. Tierney sought to reopen, and succeeded in showing a worsening of his condition, resulting in an increased award. <em>Id. </em>The Commission, on remand, credited the employer \u201cfor benefits previously paid based on a calculation of a dollar amount.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152, 751 A.2d 35. The employer argued for a weeks-credit, reasoning that the case differed from our decision in <em>Ametek </em>because the employee\u2019s compensation award was increased due to a re-opening rather than upon judicial review of the original award. <em>Id. </em>at 152-53, 771 A.2d 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Relying on our decision in <em>Ametek, </em>and again distinguishing <em>Philip Electronics, </em>we found that a weeks-credit was inappropriate where an employee \u201csought and obtained an increase\u2014 not a decrease\u2014in permanent partial disability benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154-55. The <em>Tierney </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">We are confronted, as we were in <em>Ametek, </em>with a case in which the claimant is asking for an increase in benefits due to a worsening condition. Appellants\u2019 contention that <em>Ametek </em>is distinguishable from the instant case is not persuasive. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>That the instant appeal involves a reopening of a claimant\u2019s case as opposed to an appeal from a final judgment, is of no moment; as a consequence, the procedural distinction precludes the court from using the dollar approach, as long as that approach benefits the employee. The Act is a remedial statute and, as stated, <em>supra, </em>must be construed in favor of the injured claimant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">Under the circumstances of this case, and because appellee\u2019s claim involves an increase in disability benefits, we perceive no error by the Commission, or the circuit court, in determining that appellants are entitled to a credit in a fixed dollar amount, rather than a weekly credit. We stated, in <em>Ametek, </em>that workers\u2019 compensation cases must always be determined on a case-by-case basis; using the dollar approach is more beneficial to appellee and is consistent with the benevolent purpose and the legislative intent of the Act. Perceiving no material factual distinction, we accordingly adopt our ultimate holding in <em>Ametek.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 156-57, 751 A.2d 35 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Our analysis in these cases was undone by the Court of Appeals in <em>Ametek v. O\u2019Connor, </em>364 Md. 143, 771 A.2d 1072 (2001).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In <em>Ametek, </em>the Court framed the issue as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AER\">whether, after a claimant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation award is increased on judicial review, the employer and insurer are entitled to a credit for the total amount paid to the claimant pursuant to the award or just a credit for the number of weeks the employer/insurer paid benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 144-45, 771 A.2d 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">As we noted, O\u2019Connor was awarded Tier 3 compensation after petitioning for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s original award of Tier 1 compensation. We affirmed the circuit court, which reversed the Commission, and ordered a dollar-credit to the employer. The Court of Appeals, however, disa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>greed, noting that its decision in <em>Philip Electronics </em>controlled the result. <em>Id. </em>at 148, 771 A.2d 1072. The <em>Ametek </em>Court summarized its decision in <em>Philip Electronics as </em>follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\">[They] focused on the language of \u00a7 9-627(k), that of \u00a7 9-628 and \u00a7 9-629, \u00a7 9-630 being inapplicable, discerning from the language of those sections a clear and unambiguous demonstration of a legislative commitment to the payment of permanent partial disability benefits within a weekly framework, and that such an intent is consistent with the purposes sought to be achieved by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Our clear holding was that \u201cany credit for previous payments should ... be expressed by \u2018weeks.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 149-50 (footnotes and internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Further, the Court noted that, \u201c[i]n other words, the analysis applicable to cases involving the subsequent reduction of a workers\u2019 compensation award <em>\\i.e. Philip Electronics </em>] is just as compelling when applied to those cases in which the award has subsequently been increased <em>[i.e. Ametek </em>].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Despite the recognized benevolent purposes of the Act, and the fact that any uncertainty in the Act itself would be construed in O\u2019Connor\u2019s favor, the <em>Ametek </em>Court could not disregard the obvious weeks-based framework of the Act. First, there was <em>no danger </em>that O\u2019Connor would go without compensation for the remainder of her increased award term; rather, she would merely not receive increased compensation for the award term that had already passed. <em>Id. </em>at 156, 771 A.2d 1072. Second, though the benefit of the <em>Ametek </em>Court\u2019s decision would rest with the employer, there was no reason that equitable considerations militated otherwise. <em>Id. </em>at 157, 771 A.2d 1072. The Court noted that O\u2019Connor, too, \u201cwas \u2018a party to this political equation,\u2019 [and received] the valuable benefit of being relieved \u2018from the vagaries of tort liability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157, 771 A.2d 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Thus, the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">Just as predictability and administrative ease are important from the standpoint of the timing of actions, so too are they important in establishing the rules governing the award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>permanent partial disability benefits. It simply will not do to have different rules, depending upon whether it is the claimant or the employer to whom the result is inequitable. <em>Whether a credit is the amount the employer has paid or for the number of weeks the employer has paid should be determined on some principled and consistent basis and not made to depend upon which of the parties it will benefit. </em>As the petitioner submits, \u201cThe Act should not be interpreted differently depending on the outcome in different claims.\u201d[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 157, 771 A.2d 1072 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">With that predicate in mind, we turn to the case <em>sub judice. </em>Although the particular factual scenario presented by the case <em>sub </em>judice\u2014benefits increased from Tier 1 to Tier 2 by virtue of a worsening of claimant\u2019s condition\u2014has yet to present itself for appellate review, our distillation of the case law reveals three questions that, when answered, characterize each of the above-described holdings construing the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\"><em>First: did the claimant initially seek judicial review of the claim, after the Commission\u2019s compensation award, through an appeal (e.g. Ametek) or did the claimant reopen the claim due to a worsening of condition under L.E. \u00a7 9-736 (e.g. Philip Electronics) ?</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In the instant case, unlike <em>Ametek, </em>we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>are dealing with an increase that occurred under a reopening due to a progressive worsening of condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\"><em>Second: has there been an increase (e.g. Ametek) or a reduction (e.g. Philip Electronics) in benefits awarded to a claimant? </em>The answer to this question will determine which party is advocating a weeks-credit, see <em>Philip Electronics, </em>or a dollar-credit, see <em>Ametek. </em>Given the transient incentives presented by this variable, and given the fact that despite the remedial nature of the Act, the result is not meant to benefit the employee in every circumstance. The Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Ametek </em>makes clear that a determination of this question is immaterial to whether a weeks-credit is to be awarded. Thus, an equity argument is not determinative of the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\"><em>Third: if the case involves an increase in benefits, was the increase to Tier 2 or Tier 3? As </em>noted, appellant\u2019s argument centers on the fact that in the case <em>sub judice, </em>unlike <em>Ametek, </em>the increase in compensation placed the ultimate award at a Tier 2 level rather than a Tier 3 level.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Through the lens of these questions, we see that appellant presents a factual scenario that differs, in two ways, from the Court of Appeals most recent pronouncement in <em>Ametek. </em>First, the <em>Ametek </em>Court addressed a modification of an award following an appeal to the circuit court, rather than a modification predicated upon a reopening. Second, <em>Ametek </em>involved an increase of benefits to Tier 3 rather than Tier 2. Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>makes a vigorous argument that L.E. \u00a7 9\u2014630(d), providing for a weeks-eredit upon a reopening modification to a Tier 3 level, does not apply to his case. As appellee notes, however, L.E. \u00a7 9-630(d) was not discussed by the Court of Appeals in <em>Ametek. </em>In fact, this omission occurred for good reason, for L.E. \u00a7 9-630(d) explicitly applies to petitions to reopen, not appeals.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, it is safe to say that on this discrete point, <em>Ametek </em>envelopes appellant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Appellant\u2019s argument continues, however, that the absence of similar language in L.E. \u00a7 9-629 to that in to L.E. \u00a7 9-630(d) indicates a legislative intent to treat benefits rising from Tier 1 to Tier 2 differently than benefits rising from Tier 1 or Tier 2 to Tier 3. That argument poses the question of whether it would be logical to treat a petition to reopen an award, due to an aggravation of condition, and resulting in a lesser benefit, more favorably than an appeal of an initial determination of a condition, resulting in a greater benefit. We believe that such a result would be illogical.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">As noted in <em>Ametek, </em>applicable provisions of the Act are framed in a weeks format. Appellant\u2019s reasoning would have us apply a dollar-credit format in, essentially, only one situation, a petition to reopen a compensation award resulting in Tier 2 benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">For the reasons noted by the Court of Appeals in <em>Ametek, </em>we cannot embrace such inconsistency in interpreting the Act. Thus, we hold that the circuit court was correct in finding that the County was entitled to a credit for the number of weeks paid to appellant, rather than the amount of dollars paid to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Discerning Legislative Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">In his reply brief, appellant raises issues of legislative intent and argues that the County\u2019s weeks-credit position, as adopted by the trial court, is inconsistent with the intent of the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Sound principles of statutory construction have been set forth by our Court many times. In <em>Johnson, supra, </em>156 Md.App. at 592-95, 847 A.2d 1190, Judge Hollander noted the following canons of statutory construction, within the specific context of the Act, citing numerous cases for each proposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">The seminal tenet of statutory construction compels us to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">The interpretation of a statute is a judicial function. The statutory text is our starting point. Generally, we give the words of the statute their \u201cordinary and common meaning within the context in which they are used.\u201d In other words, to determine the ordinary meaning of a term or word used in a statute, \u201cit is imperative\u201d that we consider \u201cthe context.\u201d To achieve that objective, we must incorporate \u201cthe overall purpose of the statute into its interpretation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">When the statutory language is \u201cclear on its face and in its context, then we do not ordinarily need to turn to the Legislative history.\u201d In contrast, when the statute is ambiguous, we ordinarily consider the language \u201cin light of the ... objectives and purpose of the enactment.\u201d In this regard, \u201cwe may ... consider the particular problem or problems the legislature was addressing, and the objectives it sought to attain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">To the extent \u201creasonably possible,\u201d we read a statute so \u201cthat no word, phrase, clause, or sentence is rendered surplusage or meaningless.\u201d Moreover, when the statute is part of a general statutory scheme or system, \u201c \u2018all sections must be read together ... to discern the true intent of the legislature.\u2019\u201d Therefore, we must not examine the provisions of the statute as if they are \u201cisolated, independent sections.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>In our effort to effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intent, we may consider \u201c \u2018the consequences resulting from one meaning rather than another, and adopt that construction which avoids an illogical or unreasonable result, or one which is inconsistent with common sense.\u2019 \u201d Moreover, \u201cabsurd results in the interpretive analysis of a statute are to be shunned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">As we consider the statutory scheme and the specific provisions that are at issue here, we are mindful of the broad social and remedial purposes that undergird the Act. We also take note of the legislative directive that \u201c[t]he title shall be construed to carry out its general purpose.\u201d L.E. \u00a7 9-102(a). Therefore, it must \u201cbe construed as liberally as possible in order to comply with the legislative command, contained in \u00a7 9-102(a).... \u201d Moreover, in regard to workers\u2019 compensation cases, the Legislature has expressly rendered inapplicable the general rule that \u201ca statute in derogation of the common law is to be strictly construed____\u201d L.E. \u00a7 9-102(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">Because the Act\u2019s \u201ccore values ... have never been abandoned,\u201d the \u201cbenevolent objective of workers\u2019 compensation statutes is the polar principle in determining the rights of the parties.\u201d Indeed, the Act\u2019s provisions are liberally construed in favor of claimants in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes. Consequently, ambiguities or uncertainties in the Act are generally resolved in favor of a claimant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">Nevertheless, regardless of our sympathies, we may not \u201cstifle the plain meaning of the Act, or exceed its purposes, [just] so that the injured worker may prevail.\u201d This means that we may not create \u201cambiguity or uncertainty in the Act\u2019s provision where none exists so that a provision may be interpreted in favor of the ... claimant.\u201d Simply put, we may not add or delete words so as \u201c \u2018to give the statute a meaning not otherwise communicated by the language used.\u2019 \u201d Nor may we extend coverage \u201cbeyond that which is authorized by the provisions of the Act.\u201d [S]ee <em>Engel &amp; Engel v.

In the 2005 legislative session, bills were introduced in the House of Delegates and the Senate to amend L.E. \u00a7 9-629 by adding language similar to that now contained in L.E. \u00a7 9-630(d). If enacted, proposed House Bill 635 and proposed Senate Bill 828 would have combined to cause L.E. \u00a7 9-629 to read as follows:<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">(A) If a covered employee is awarded compensation for a period equal to or greater than 75 weeks but less than 250 weeks, the employer or its insurer shall pay the covered employee weekly compensation that equals two-thirds of the average weekly wage of the covered employee but does not exceed one-third of the State average weekly wage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">(B) <em>If a covered employee receives additional compensation for a disability on a petition to reopen a claim, the addi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number><em>tional compensation may not increase the amount of compensation previously awarded and paid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">H.B. 635, 2005 Leg., 420 Sess. (Md.2005); S.B. 828, 2005 Leg., 420 Sess. (Md.2005) (emphasis added). Further, the proposed legislation stated that the express purpose of both bills was, in part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">for the purpose of providing that if a covered employee receives additional compensation for a disability on a petition to reopen a certain claim, the additional compensation may not increase the amount of compensation previously awarded and paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Appellant also points to a fiscal and policy note (\u201cfiscal note\u201d) accompanying each of the two proposed bills.

However, since under L.E. \u00a7 9-630(c) [now L.E. \u00a7 9-630(d)?] the Commission is not permitted to increase the amount of compensation previously awarded and actually paid, the benefits for serious disability are limited to only those weeks of compensation that remain unpaid as of the date of second award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-13\"><em>Manual, supra, </em>at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">Notably, for the purposes of our discussion, in support of the first proposition, the Manual cited only our decisions in <em>Tierney, supra, </em>132 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Md.App. 149, 751 A.2d 35 and <em>Norris, supra, </em>86 Md.App. 508, 587 A.2d 557 for support.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
