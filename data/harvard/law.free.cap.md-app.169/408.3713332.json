Clark (\u201cClark\u201d), appeals the decision of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City granting summary judgment in favor of Mayor Martin O\u2019Malley and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (\u201cthe Mayor\u201d). Clark presents one question, which we have rewritten as follows:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-13\">Did the circuit court err in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>For the following reasons, we shall reverse the circuit court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">In February 2003, the City of Baltimore and Clark entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d) \u201cto employ the sendees of Clark as the Police Commissioner of Baltimore City.\u201d The City Council confirmed Clark\u2019s appointment on March 3, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Relevant provisions of the MOU include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ava\">SECTION 1. <em>EMPLOYMENT</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAn\">The City hereby engages the services of Clark to act as the Police Commissioner of the Baltimore City Police Department to serve the remaining term of the last Commissioner until June 30, 2008 (\u201cInitial Term\u201d). During the Initial Term Clark shall receive a salary of One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000) per annum to be paid biweekly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">SECTION 2. <em>ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION/SEVERANCE PAY.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-8\">A. The Commissioner recognizes that he may be terminated by the City pursuant to the removal provisions by the Mayor in Baltimore City Code of Public Local Laws (\u00a7 16-5[e])<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark> and nothing in this Agreement shall affect the rights of the Mayor in that respect. However, except as stated in Section 3<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark> and for just cause as defined below, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Clark shall be entitled to receive the additional compensation/severance pay as provided in section 2.B. of this Agreement regardless of the reasons for the termination of employment by the Mayor or City. Just cause for the purpose of this section shall be defined as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">(1) Gross dereliction of duty; as to any one incident or series of conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">(2) Illegal use of intoxicants or drugs; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">(3) Indictment of a felony or any other crime involving moral turpitude or theft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">B. If Clark is willing and able to perform employment duties under this Agreement and the employment of Clark is (1) terminated in the Initial Term by City for any reason other than for just cause as defined in Paragraph 2.A.; or (2) in the event Clark is forced to resign following a formal or informal suggestion by the Mayor that he resign; or (3) that Clark\u2019s salary is reduced below his present annual salary without Clark\u2019s written consent; or (4) in the event, for any reason whatsoever other than for just cause as above defined the Mayor does not reappoint and the Council confirm the reappointment of Clark to a full six-year term immediately following the Initial Term, City agrees to pay Clark a lump sum payment, as and for additional compensation/severance, equal to six (6) months aggregate salary, including retirement benefits calculated as the employer\u2019s share of retirement benefits at the time of termination or non-reappointment as defined herein. Clark shall also be fully compensated for any accrued sick leave, vacation, compensatory time and any other accrued benefits at the time of termination or failure of reappointment. Should Clark not be reappointed or terminated without just cause, Clark agrees that the additional compensation/severanee lump sum payment set out above shall satisfy all obligations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>City has to Clark as a result of the termination/non-reappointment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">SECTION 12 <em>RIGHT TO TERMINATE WITHOUT CAUSE</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">Either party may terminate this contract at any time, by giving forty-five (45) days prior written notice to the other. Notwithstanding the above sentence the provisions of Section 2B remain in force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">SECTION 13 <em>NOTICES</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">Notices pursuant hereto shall be effective when hand-delivered or when mailed by certified mail. All notices to the City shall be addressed to the City at the Office of Law\u2014 All notices from the City to Clark shall be addressed to an address to be named by Clark not more than 10 days after the execution of this contract and updated from time to time when his address changes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">On November 10, 2004, the City Solicitor delivered a letter to Clark giving him forty-five days\u2019 notice of his termination as Police Commissioner, and relieving him of his duties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-11\">This notice is sent on behalf of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (the \u201cCity\u201d) pursuant to Sections 12 and 13 of the Memorandum of Understanding (\u201cMOU\u201d) between you and the City dated February 19, 2003. This notice shall serve as the City\u2019s 45-day notice of termination of your employment. Thus, your employment shall terminate 45 days from today. However, as the Mayor announced this morning, you have been relieved of all official duties as of 8:30 a.m., November 10, 2004, and therefore, your further access, if any, to Police Department facilities, equipment, or documents will be subject to the specific, prior authorization of Acting or Interim Police Commissioner Hamm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-12\">The City will begin immediately to do a calculation of the salary and benefits to which you may be due under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>February 19 MOU and will advise you of the details once appropriate calculations are made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">On November 16, 2004, Clark filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, seeking declaratory relief, injunctive relief, money damages, and reinstatement to his former position as Police Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">On December 13, 2004, the Mayor moved to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. The court held a hearing on January 31, 2005, after which it denied summary judgment, finding a genuine dispute of material facts related to the Mayor\u2019s issuance of notice of termination to Clark.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Clark filed an amended complaint on December 28, 2004. The Mayor again moved for summary judgment on February 10, 2005, asserting that admissible evidence clearly established that there was no genuine dispute of material fact with respect to notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The court held a hearing on April 4, 2005. After argument by counsel, the court found that the MOU is a valid and unambiguous contract, and that Clark had been properly terminated after proper notice was given pursuant to sections 12 and 13 of the MOU. The court thereby granted the Mayor\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The Court issued a declaratory judgment on April 4, 2005, stating that the Mayor had properly terminated Clark without cause, and with proper notice. Clark noted this appeal on April 5, 2005. Additional facts will be provided as necessary to our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">The circuit court may grant a motion for summary judgment \u201cif the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Maryland Rule 2-501(f). \u201cThis Court reviews the same material from the record and decides the same legal issues as the circuit court.\u201d <em>Lopata v. Miller, </em>122 Md.App. 76, 83, 712 A.2d 24 (1998). Accordingly, \u201c[w]hen reviewing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>grant of summary judgment, we first determine whether a genuine dispute of material fact exists.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Baltimore Sun Co., </em>164 Md.App. 497, 507, 883 A.2d 1008 (2005). \u201cIf the record reveals that a material fact is in dispute, summary judgment is not appropriate.\u201d <em>Serio v. Baltimore County, </em>384 Md. 373, 388, 863 A.2d 952 (2004). \u201cIf we determine that no genuine issue of material fact is present, then we must decide \u2018whether the [trial] court reached the correct legal result.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crews v. Hollenbach, </em>126 Md.App. 609, 625, 730 A.2d 742 (1999) (quoting <em>Chicago Title Ins. Co. v. Lumbermen\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co., </em>120 Md.App. 538, 547, 707 A.2d 913 (1998)). \u201cIn making our analysis, we do not accord deference to the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions.\u201d <em>Lopata, </em>122 Md.App. at 83, 712 A.2d 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\n<em>I. Is there a Final Judgment ?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">At oral argument, Clark asserted that the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment applied to only count 10 of his amended complaint, which alleged \u201cBreach of Contract\u2014Termination Without Cause/Contract.\u201d To the contrary, we conclude that the court\u2019s judgment pertained to all of Clark\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Clark\u2019s amended complaint included ten counts. In count 1, Clark argued that the Mayor\u2019s removal of him was illegal because it violated section 16-5(e) of the Code of Public Local Laws of Baltimore City (2005) (\u201cPLL\u201d), and sought declaratory and injunctive relief. In counts 2, 3, 4, and 5, Clark sought a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, a writ of <em>quo warranto, </em>and a writ of mandamus based on the Mayor\u2019s alleged violation of PLL \u00a7 16-5(e). Clark also based his count 5 request for a writ of mandamus on the argument that his termination violated his due process rights under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. In count 6, Clark sought a writ of certiorari based on the Mayor\u2019s alleged violations of PLL \u00a7 16-5(e) and Article 24. In count 7, Clark asked for declaratory and injunctive relief based on the alleged violation of his rights under Article 24. In counts 8 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>9, Clark averred that the Mayor breached the terms of the MOU by terminating him without cause. In count 10, Clark asserted that his termination without cause violated the terms of the MOU because he was not given proper notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">After the hearing on April 4, 2005, the court announced its judgment at follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">Counsel, the court has had an opportunity to review the papers. The court\u2019s had an opportunity to review the contract, the notice that was provided on November 10th, 2004, the statutory references that were made in the plaintiffs papers to the public local law and the city charter as well as to the Maryland Declaration of Rights and consider all of the arguments that were presented this morning and I\u2019m prepared to rule. On the basis of the record the court has before it, for purposes of this summary judgement [sic] motion, this court does not see that there are material facts in dispute at this point nor does the court find either conflict in the contract provisions or ambiguity in the contract provisions. And the court is prepared to enter declaratory judgment holding that the contract between the Police Commissioner Clark and the Mayor and City Council dated February 2003 ____is a valid contract^] that pursuant to Seetion[s] 11 and 12 of that contract appropriate notice was given to the Police Commissioner on November 10, 2004, that he was lawfully terminated without cause[,] and that the defendants are entitled to summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">The circuit court\u2019s declaratory judgment, issued April 4, 2005, stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-10\">2. The Memorandum of Understanding between Clark and the City is a valid and binding contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-11\">3. Section 12 of the Memorandum of Understanding unambiguously provides both parties with a right to terminate without cause upon giving forty-five days prior written notice to the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-12\">4. Section 12 is a valid and binding provision of the Memorandum of Understanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>5. On November 10, 2004, the defendants sent a notice to Clark, through counsel, that Clark\u2019s employment as Police Commissioner would be terminated without cause in forty-five days pursuant to Section 12 of the Memorandum of Understanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">6. Clark received the forty-five days prior notice of termination to which he was entitled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">7. The City properly exercised its right to terminate Clark\u2019s employment without cause pursuant to Section 12 of the Memorandum of Understanding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">It is a long-standing rule that \u201cthe right to seek appellate review of a trial court\u2019s ruling ordinarily must await the entry of a final judgment that disposes of all claims against all parties.\u201d <em>Maryland State Bd. of Educ. v. Bradford, </em>387 Md. 353, 382, 875 A.2d 703 (2005). Maryland Rule 2-602(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">Except as provided in section (b) of this Rule/<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark> an order or other form of decision, however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all of the claims in an action (whether raised by original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim), or that adjudicates less than an entire claim, or that adjudicates the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties to the action:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">(1) is not a final judgment____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">Indeed, \u201c[tjhere can be no final judgment until every claim is resolved.\u201d <em>Tierco Maryland, Inc. v. Williams, </em>381 Md. 378, 393, 849 A.2d 504 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">Here, the court found that the Mayor had a valid contractual right to terminate Clark without cause because the MOU \u201cis a valid and binding contract.\u201d Thus, the court\u2019s grant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>summary judgment and subsequent declaratory judgment clearly resolved all of Clark\u2019s claims that were based on arguments that his termination violated PLL \u00a7 16-5(e) or the terms of the MOU. Specifically, the court\u2019s judgment disposed of counts 1-4 and 8-10 in their entirety, and counts 5 and 6 to the extent they were based on the Mayor\u2019s alleged violation of PLL \u00a7 16-5(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Counts 5 and 6 were based in part, and count 7 was based in its entirety, on Clark\u2019s assertion that his termination violated his due process rights under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Article 24 protects, among other things, an individual\u2019s interest in procedural due process. <em>Samuels v. Tschechtelin, </em>135 Md.App. 483, 523, 763 A.2d 209 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u201cTo be successful in an action alleging denial of procedural due process in violation of a property interest, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he had a protected property interest, that he was deprived of that interest, and that he was afforded less process than was due.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A colorable property interest in a position of employment requires \u201c \u2018a legitimate claim of entitlement\u2019 \u201d to continued employment. <em>Id. </em>at 524, 763 A.2d 209 (quoting <em>Bd. of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972)). That claim must be grounded on a source apart from Article 24 itself, \u201c \u2018such as state law-rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits,\u2019 \u201d or \u201c[a] public employment contract.\u201d <em>Samuels, </em>135 Md.App. at 524, 527, 763 A.2d 209 (quoting <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701). The circuit court\u2019s finding that the City \u201cexercised its right to terminate Clark\u2019s employment without cause pursuant to Section 12 of the Memorandum of Understanding,\u201d constituted an implicit finding that Clark did not have a legitimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>property interest in continued employment and, thus, that he had received any process due to him under the circumstances. The court\u2019s judgment resolved all of Clark\u2019s claims that were based on an alleged violation of his due process rights and was an appealable final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\n<em>II. Was there a Genuine Dispute of Material Fact?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Clark contends that the circuit court abused its discretion in granting summary judgment prior to the completion of discovery. In addition, he argues that certain material facts are genuinely disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">A <em>Grant of Summary Judgment Prior to Completion of Discovery</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Clark argues that the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment prior to the completion of discovery \u201ceffectively terminated the Scheduling Order without a full factual record having been developed,\u201d and that \u201c[discovery would have established a full evidentiary record that the Court should have had before ruling on a dispositive Motion for Summary Judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">To be sure, the circuit court may \u201cdeny a motion for summary judgment so that a more complete factual record can be developed.\u201d AJ. <em>Decoster Co. v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </em>333 Md. 245, 262-63 634 A.2d 1330 (1994). Maryland Rule 2-501(d) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">If the court is satisfied from the affidavit of a party opposing a motion for summary judgment that the facts essential to justify the opposition cannot be set forth for reasons stated in the affidavit, the court may deny the motion or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or discovery to be conducted or may enter any other order that justice requires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">\u201c \u2018The timing of a summary judgment ruling, i.e., whether it is to be postponed pending completion of discovery or denied in favor of submission to the fact-finder, falls within the trial court\u2019s discretion and will be reviewed only for abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chaires v. Chevy Chase Bank, </em>131 Md.App. 64, 88, 748 A.2d 34 (2000) (quoting Paul V. Niemeyer &amp; Linda M. Schuett, Maryland Rules Commentary 95 (2d ed.1992, Supp. 1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Clark did not submit an affidavit pursuant to Rule 2-501(d). In his brief, he focuses primarily on the court\u2019s scheduling order, and argues that he was \u201csubstantially prejudiced\u201d by the grant of summary judgment prior to the completion of discovery in accordance with the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The status of the scheduling order, in and of itself, has no direct bearing on whether the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment prior to the completion of discovery was an abuse of discretion. Maryland Rule 2-501 (a) provides that \u201c[a]ny party may make a motion for summary judgment on all or part of an action on the ground that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d The court could consider the status of discovery under a scheduling order in its decision to grant or deny summary judgment, but the rule is not limited by such an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Given Clark\u2019s failure to support his allegations that there were disputes of material fact with \u201can affidavit or other written statement under oath,\u201d Md. Rule 2-501 (b), or an affidavit \u201cthat the facts essential to justify the opposition cannot be set forth for reasons stated in the affidavit,\u201d Md. Rule 2-501(d), we are not persuaded that the circuit court erred or abused its discretion in considering the motion for summary judgment prior to completion of discovery under the scheduling order.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">\n<em>B. Clark\u2019s Assertion of Genuinely Disputed Material Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">In the memorandum in support of his motion for summary judgment, and at the motion hearing, the Mayor asserted that the material facts surrounding Clark\u2019s termination were not in dispute: that the City entered into the MOU with Clark, the terms of which included a right on the part of either party to terminate Clark\u2019s employment without cause upon forty-five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>days\u2019 written notice; that Clark was given notice of termination required by section 12 of the MOU on November 10, 2004; and that Clark was sent a check that would have satisfied the terms of the MOU in the event of termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">In support of his motion, the Mayor submitted the affidavit of the City Solicitor, who stated that he wrote and delivered the notice letter to Clark on November 10, 2004. The Mayor also submitted the affidavit of Lieutenant Robert Haukdal, the Acting Director of the Fiscal Section of the Baltimore Police Department. Haukdal stated in his affidavit that, after Clark\u2019s termination, the City continued to pay his biweekly salary of $5,769.24 through December 25, 2004. He also stated that the City sent Clark a check in the amount of $8,513.22 for \u201cunused vacation time and comp time,\u201d and \u201ca check for $49,318.76, reflecting Mr. Clark\u2019s aggregate salary for six months ($75,000), minus deductions.\u201d The relevant payroll records and photocopies of the checks that were sent to Clark were included.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">In his response, Clark argued that, because the Mayor\u2019s answer to the amended complaint was in the form of general denials, \u201cDefendants by their own pleading have put at issue every material fact concerning every claim alleged in Plaintiffs Complaint.\u201d Clark asserted that there were disputes of material fact surrounding the notice of termination, arguing in his response memorandum that the notice was \u201cinefficient and defective\u201d because it was issued by the City Solicitor, rather than the Mayor, and because the Board of Estimates took no part in his termination. He asserted that whether the notice satisfied the contractual requirement of forty-five days was also in dispute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Clark further contended in his memorandum that, with regard to his claim of deprivation of due process, \u201c[i]t is disputed whether Plaintiff received ... notice and was given an opportunity to be heard before his removal and termination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Clark submitted no affidavits or other documents demonstrating the alleged factual disputes. At the hearing, counsel noted that \u201c[w]e did submit a[ ] verified] complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Maryland Rule 2-501(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">Any party may make a motion for summary judgment on all or part of an action on the ground that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The motion shall be supported by affidavit if it is (1) filed before the day on which the adverse party\u2019s initial pleading or motion is filed or (2) based on facts not contained in the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The party moving for summary judgment shoulders the burden of proof that no genuine dispute of material fact exists. <em>Carter v. Aramark Sports &amp; Entm\u2019t Servs., </em>153 Md.App. 210, 224, 835 A.2d 262 (2003). The movant may satisfy that burden by \u201cidentify[ing] portions of the record that demonstrate absence of a genuine issue of material fact,\u201d <em>Nerenberg v. RICA of S. Maryland, </em>131 Md.App. 646, 660, 750 A.2d 655 (2000), or \u201cby placing before the court facts that would be admissible in evidence or otherwise detailing the absence of evidence in the record to support a cause of action.\u201d <em>Bond v.

The court cannot treat bald allegations in a response as creating a disputed fact, any more than it can assume that contentions made in an opening statement or closing argument dispute evidence introduced at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The Mayor\u2019s motion for summary judgment alleged specific facts that were not in dispute. He submitted affidavits and other evidence in support of his motion. In his response, Clark merely propounded a number of arguments alleging factual disputes. With respect to each of his arguments, however, Clark either failed to identify with particularity the disputed facts, failed to demonstrate that the facts were in dispute, or failed to support the alleged dispute with affidavits or other documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Clark\u2019s contention that the Mayor\u2019s general denial of most of the averments in the second amended complaint places all of the facts alleged in the complaint in dispute patently does not \u201cidentify with particularity\u201d the supposed factual disputes. Md. Rule 2-501(b). Similarly, his argument in his brief to this Court that \u201c[a]ll of the facts as alleged underlying [his due process] claims are disputed\u201d does not demonstrate any error by the circuit court in its application of Maryland Rule 2-501(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">The Mayor does not dispute that the City Solicitor, rather than the Mayor, delivered to Clark the notice of termination. Likewise, it is undisputed that the Board of Estimates did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>participate in Clark\u2019s termination. Thus, Clark has not raised a genuine dispute as to those facts. It is the legal implications, and thus the materiality, of those facts that is in dispute. <em>See O\u2019Connor v. Baltimore County, </em>382 Md. 102, 111-12, 854 A.2d 1191 (2004) (stating that a dispute over whether employment regulations enacted by the County violated the County charter is not a factual dispute).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Clark likewise failed to raise a factual dispute as to whether he received proper notice. The Mayor contends that Clark was terminated without cause upon forty-five days\u2019 notice in accordance with the MOU. It is unclear whether Clark continues to assert that there is a dispute regarding whether the notice itself satisfied the terms of the MOU. It appears that he argues that notice was insufficient due to the timing of the delivery of that notice based on the fact that the Mayor had announced his termination several hours before the notice was delivered, a fact that is not disputed. In his brief to this Court, he states that \u201c[tjhose material facts were disputed by Defendants in their Answer, but then essentially admitted in their Motion for Summary Judgment.\u201d Thus, Clark seems to recognize that the facts surrounding the timing of the delivery of the notice are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Despite his argument that the timing of the notice was disputed, he failed to \u201cidentify and attach the relevant portion of the specific document, discovery response, transcript of testimony (by page and line), or other statement under oath that demonstrates the dispute.\u201d Md. Rule 2-501(b). Moreover, the effectiveness of the notice under the terms of the MOU is not a factual dispute, but, rather, the basis for Clark\u2019s legal argument that the Mayor breached the terms of the MOU. <em>See O\u2019Connor, </em>382 Md. at 111-12, 854 A.2d 1191.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">We perceive no error in the circuit court\u2019s finding that there is no genuine dispute of material fact.

The Mayor\u2019s Power to Remove the Police Commissioner</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Clark presents four somewhat related arguments with regard to the Mayor\u2019s authority to remove the Police Commissioner and name a new Police Commissioner. First, Clark claims that, because he took an oath of office upon his appointment as Police Commissioner, he is a public officer who could not be removed by the Mayor at will. Second, he asserts that the Police Commissioner is independent from the \u201cinterference and control\u201d of the Mayor. Third, he argues that the Mayor may remove a police commissioner only in accordance with the PLL, which provides for removal of the Commissioner only for cause. Finally, he contends that, because he was not legitimately removed from his position, the Mayor had no authority to appoint a new Police Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The Mayor, in response, contends that he has the power to enter into a contract with a police commissioner that provides for removal without cause. He also argues that the matters of appointing and removing the Police Commissioner are \u201cpeculiarly local in character,\u201d and that a decision limiting his power to do so would improperly impinge on the City\u2019s authority over its Police Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Article XI-A of the Constitution of Maryland provides for limited self-government by the various counties and Baltimore City.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-9\">Ratified by the voters in 1915, Art.

The Police Commissioner was designated the head of the department: \u201cThe affairs and operations of the department shall be supervised and directed by a commissioner of police, who shall function as the chief police and executive officer of the department, and be known as the Police Commissioner of Baltimore City.\u201d PLL \u00a7 16-4 (1969). The General Assembly also codified the appointment and removal of the Commissioner by the Governor. PLL \u00a7 16-5(a) (1969) provided that \u201c[t]he Police Commissioner of Baltimore City shall be appointed by the Governor of Maryland for a term of six years.\u201d Section 16-5(e), entitled \u201cRemoval,\u201d stated: \u201cSaid Commissioner shall be subject to removal by the Governor for official misconduct, malfeasance, inefficiency or incompetency, including prolonged illness, in the manner provided by law in the case of civil officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">In 1976, the General Assembly modified sections 16-5, 16-6, and 16-9 of the PLL \u201c[f]or the purpose of providing that the Police Commissioner of Baltimore City be appointed by the Mayor of Baltimore City.\u201d Laws of Maryland 1976, ch. 920.

Hundreds of victims of property destruction brought suit against the City, invoking the Riot Act of 1835, which provided for suits against local governments to recover damages that resulted from riots. The City argued that because the police department is an agency of the State, and it had no direct control over the department, it could not be liable under the Riot Act. The Court agreed that the department is a State entity and beyond the control of the City government:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">[I]t may be fairly stated that The Police Omnibus Act of 1966, [ch. 203 of the Acts of 1966,] the Act which affects the instant ease, does not differ greatly from its predecessor acts insofar as separating the City from any control over the police department is concerned. In The Police Omnibus Act of 1966, control of the department is vested in the State with immediate supervision and direction of the department under a police commissioner who is appointed by the Governor. Further support for the autonomy of the police department is found in Article 2, Section 27 of the Charter of the City which provides that, \u201c(N)o ordinance of the City or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>act of any municipal officer shall conflict, impede, obstruct, hinder, or interfere with the powers of the Police Commissioner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-5\"><em>Silver, </em>263 Md. at 450, 283 A.2d 788 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\"><em>Clea v.

The Court, in <em>Clea, </em>again held that the City did not incur <em>respondeat superior </em>liability for the tortious acts of police officers. The Court grounded its holding on the department\u2019s status as a State agency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">By Ch. 367 of the Acts of 1867, the General Assembly of Maryland made the Police Department of Baltimore City a state agency; its officials and officers were designated as state officers.

Additionally, the Governor was empowered by local law to fill vacancies on the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The Court noted that the Governor\u2019s authority to remove commissioners coincided with his constitutional authority to remove civil officers generally:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">\u201cThe Governor may <em>suspend </em>or arrest any military officer of the State for disobedience of orders or other military offense; and may <em>remove </em>him in pursuance of the sentence of a Court Martial; and may <em>remove </em>for incompetency or misconduct all civil officers who received appointment from the executive for a term of years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-8\"><em>Cull, </em>114 Md. at 79, 78 A. 820 (quoting Md. Constitution art. II, \u00a7 15). But, neither the general constitutional authority to remove civil officers, nor the specific statutory authority to remove Police Commissioners, included the power to suspend the Commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Accordingly, the Court held that the Governor had no such power:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-10\">[The] language of [Md. Constitution art. II, \u00a7 15] itself must be admitted to be at least suggestive, for when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>same section authorized the Governor to <em>\u201csuspend </em>or arrest\u201d a military officer for causes given, and to <em>remove </em>him in pursuance of the sentence of a court-martial, and then, when it deals with civil officers, only authorizes him to <em>\u201cremove\" </em>them, the maxim, <em>\u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius \u201d </em>naturally suggests itself. There is no other power of removal of these officers expressly given to the Governor, either by the Constitution or by statute, and there is not only no express power of suspending them given him, but a striking contrast is made between his powers in reference to military officers and those concerning civil officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">If the people of the State of Maryland, who framed the Constitution through their representatives and then by their votes ratified it, are to be judged by their actions, they have unmistakably declared that it is not their will that those occupying important public offices be deprived of them, merely because they are <em>charged </em>with incompetency or misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 79-80, 83-84, 78 A. 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The Baltimore City Police Department is a State agency governed by the enactments of the General Assembly. The Mayor enjoys no inherent authority over the department or the office of Police Commissioner. The authority given to the Mayor in Article IV of the Charter to appoint municipal officers, and to remove officers \u201cat pleasure,\u201d does not relate to the Police Commissioner. Both the Mayor\u2019s power of appointment and removal of the Police Commissioner are governed by PLL \u00a7 16-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">The General Assembly did nothing more than transfer to the Mayor the same power of removal previously held by the Governor. <em>Compare </em>PLL \u00a7 16-5(e) (1969), <em>with </em>PLL \u00a7 16-5(e) (2005). Patently, the Mayor\u2019s authority to remove a Police Commissioner appointed pursuant to law is the same as that of the Governor\u2019s prior to 1976. Like the Governor, the Mayor may only remove the Commissioner \u201cfor official mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>conduct, malfeasance, inefficiency or incompetency, including prolonged illness, in the manner provided by law in the case of civil officers.\u201d PLL \u00a7 16-5(e) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Article II, section 10 of the Constitution of Maryland empowers the Governor to \u201cnominate, and, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoint all civil and military officers of the State, whose appointment, or election, is not otherwise herein provided for, unless a different mode of appointment be prescribed by the Law creating the office.\u201d Article II, section 15 states that the Governor \u201cmay remove for incompetency, or misconduct, all civil officers who received appointment from the Executive for a term of years.\u201d The Court of Appeals has stated that \u201c[t]he term \u2018civil office,\u2019 \u201d in Article II, \u201cseems to be synonymous with \u2018public office\u2019 \u201d. <em>Nesbitt v. Fallon, </em>203 Md. 534, 544, 102 A.2d 284 (1954).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHME\">\u201cIt is well established that a position is held to be a public office when it has been created by law and casts upon the incumbent duties which are continuing in their nature and not occasional, and which call for the exercise of some portion of the sovereignty of the State. The most important characteristic of a public office, as distinguished from any other employment, is the fact that the incumbent is entrusted with a part of the sovereign power to exercise some of the functions of government for the benefit of the people.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_m\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Buchholtz, </em>178 Md. at 283, 13 A.2d 348).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Maryland Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-307 of the State Government Article (\u201cState Gov.\u201d), sets forth the manner in which the Governor may remove a civil officer. Section 3-307(a) states that the Governor may act upon \u201cthe filing of a complaint against a civil or military officer.\u201d The Governor is required to provide the officer with \u201ca copy of the complaint,\u201d and \u201cnotice of the time when the Governor shall hear the complaint.\u201d State Gov. \u00a7 3-307(a)(l). The Governor is also authorized to compel the attendance of witnesses at the hearing, provide for payment of fees and expenses to witnesses, determine who must pay costs, and enforce any such orders. State Gov. \u00a7 3-307(a)-(b). Removal of a civil officer by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Governor therefore requires, at a minimum, notice of the complaint against the officer and a hearing. It follows that the Mayor\u2019s power to remove a Police Commissioner under PLL \u00a7 16-5(e) is also limited to removal for cause, and requires notice of the cause and a hearing as provided for in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\n<em>B. Effect of the Employment Contract</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Clark argues that, because the Mayor\u2019s power of removal is limited to removal for cause, the provision in the employment contract giving the Mayor the \u201cright to terminate without cause\u201d is unenforceable. In the alternative, he argues that the Mayor breached the contract by failing to provide sufficient notice of termination under the terms of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">The Mayor asserts that the contract is unambiguous, valid, and enforceable, and that the City provided the requisite forty-five days\u2019 notice of termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">We have said that, \u201c \u2018[a]s a general rule, parties are free to contract as they wish.\u2019 \u201d <em>White v. Simard, </em>152 Md.App. 229, 248, 831 A.2d 517 (2003), <em>aff'd, </em>383 Md. 257, 859 A.2d 168 (2004) (quoting <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>307 Md. 631, 643, 516 A.2d 586 (1986)). Nevertheless, \u201c \u2018a contract conflicting with public policy set forth in a statute is invalid to the extent of the conflict between the contract and that policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Medex v. McCabe, </em>372 Md. 28, 39, 811 A.2d 297 (2002) (quoting <em>McCabe v. Medex, </em>141 Md.App. 558, 566, 786 A.2d 57 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">Section 2 of the MOU expressly provides that Clark could be removed by the Mayor in accordance with PLL \u00a7 16-5(e), and states that \u201cnothing in this Agreement shall affect the rights of the Mayor in that respect.\u201d But, it then purports to define \u201cjust cause\u201d differently than the statutory provisions, and in section 12, provides that \u201c[e]ither party may terminate this contract at any time, by giving forty-five (45) days prior written notice to the other.\u201d Together, these provisions expand the Mayor\u2019s removal authority beyond that granted by the General Assembly. They are, therefore, invalid. As a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>matter of law, the Mayor was not entitled to summary judgment based on the invalid terms of the MOU. To be sure, the appointment and removal of a Police Commissioner may be \u201cpeculiarly local in character,\u201d but the Police Commissioner is the head of a State agency. The Mayor\u2019s power of removal has been limited by the General Assembly. The appropriateness of this policy is a matter for the General Assembly, not this Court, to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Under PLL \u00a7 16-5, the Police Commissioner may be involuntarily terminated by the Mayor only for cause as defined by PLL \u00a7 16-5(e).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This case involves an appointment subject to a written contract between the parties\u2014a contract in which certain rights and obligations not contemplated by the Public Local Law were accepted by each party.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For example, in exchange for certain financial commitments made to the appointee, the City was not bound to a fixed term of years that it could shorten only for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The City contends that some modification of the statutory terms of employment fixed by the statute was necessarily within the contemplation of the legislature and therefore within the authority of the parties to accomplish by contract. Whatever validity, if any, that argument may have with respect to other aspects of the MOU, it does not extend to the very basic elements of the term of office and grounds for removal from office. Everything in the history of this office and the actions of the General Assembly with respect thereto suggests that the State did not intend to authorize the City to assume the degree of control over the State\u2019s police agency that would flow from what is essentially a loss of tenure otherwise provided by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Thus, the circuit court erred in holding as a matter of law that the entire contract between the parties was valid and enforceable.

The Mayor contends that Clark is barred from arguing that the MOU is unenforceable based on \"familiar principles of estoppel or waiver,\u201d to the effect that \"[a] party who, like Clark, accepts the benefits of a contract, cannot subsequently disavow the existence, validity or effect of the contract.\u201d Some courts have recognized an exception to the general rule, however, that \u201c[w]here the contract is void as against public policy or against an express mandate of the law, a person who has accepted a benefit thereunder will not be estopped to defend against the contract when it is sought to be enforced against him.\u201d <em>McMullin v. McMullin, </em>926 S.W.2d 108, 111 (Mo.Ct.App.1996) (quoting 31 C.J.S. Estoppel \u00a7 110). In <em>McGinley v.

The circuit court did not consider estoppel and waiver in its grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The Mayor also urges us to affirm the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment with respect to Clark's claim for monetary damages. Section 2.B. of the MOU states that, in the event Clark was terminated other than for just cause, forced to resign, had his salary reduced, or was not reappointed other than for just cause, he was to be paid \"a lump sum payment, as and for additional compensation/severance, equal to six (6) months aggregate salary,\u201d along with compensation for accrued benefits.

Because the court ruled that section 12 of the MOU was valid and enforceable, and that Clark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>had been properly terminated under that provision, it did not address whether section 2.B. limits Clark\u2019s claim for damages.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
