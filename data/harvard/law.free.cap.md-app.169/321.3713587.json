Miller, appellee, against the Comptroller of Maryland (the \u201cComptroller\u201d), appellant, concerning the Comptroller\u2019s method of computing compensable<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> work time when an employee travels from home directly to a remote work site, rather than to the regularly assigned office. Appellee claimed she was entitled to compensation for all of her travel time, without deducting the time normally spent commuting to the office. The Comptroller was of the view that appellee was not entitled to compensation for the time she would have otherwise spent commuting to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">Appellee pursued her grievance at a contested case hearing conducted by an Administrative Law Judge (the \u201cALJ\u201d) at the Office of Administrative Hearings (the \u201cOAH\u201d). The ALJ concluded that the Comptroller\u2019s policy was arbitrary and unsupported by law. However, the ALJ \u201cdenied and dismissed\u201d Ms. Miller\u2019s grievance because she failed to present evidence as to the remedy she sought. The Circuit Court for Baltimore City affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision rejecting the Comptroller\u2019s policy, but remanded the matter to OAH to determine the specific relief to which Ms. Miller was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">On appeal, the Comptroller asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Did the circuit court err in affirming the OAH decision that an employee temporarily assigned to a remote work site may properly treat as compensable work time the amount of time involved in her normal commute from home to assigned office?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">For the reasons that follow, we shall reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Ms. Miller began working for the Comptroller in August 2001 as a Financial Compliance Auditor in the Field Audit Section of the Compliance Division. At the time, it was the Comptroller\u2019s policy that an employee who was required to travel directly from home to a remote work site, without a stop at the employee\u2019s assigned office, would be entitled to compensable work time for travel only if the travel time exceeded by at least thirty minutes the employee\u2019s normal commute time. Conversely, if the travel time was less than half an hour beyond the normal commute time, the employee would not be compensated.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Ms. Miller testified at the OAH that, when she submitted her application for employment with the Comptroller, she indicated that she wanted to work within a reasonable commuting distance of her home. She explained, \u201cI didn\u2019t want excessive commute time.\u201d According to Ms. Miller, her normal commute time from her home to her assigned office is \u201chalf an hour.\u201d About thirty days after appellee commenced working for the Comptroller, she began going on field audits, which required travel to remote sites.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">In August 2003, Ms. Miller met with Phillip Deitchman, a labor relations specialist with the Maryland Classified Employee Association. According to Ms. Miller, they discussed the issue of compensation for off-site travel, and Mr. Deitch<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>man informed her, \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to pay you the moment you leave home to when you return.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Accordingly, Ms. Miller submitted a grievance to the Comptroller, dated August 7, 2003, alleging that she was \u201cnot compensated properly for travel between her home and temporary work location, which was different from her normal assigned office.\u201d Further, the grievance stated: \u201cManagement\u2019s action is arbitrary, capricious, and has no factual basis.\u201d Appellee sought payment \u201cfor all time traveled between home and temporary work location.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">In connection with the first step of the grievance process, Linda Tanton, the Director of the Compliance Division, issued a decision on September 12, 2003.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ms. Tanton sustained the grievance, in part; she authorized compensation for all travel time in excess of Ms. Miller\u2019s normal commute time, even if the excess travel time did not exceed the normal commute time by thirty minutes. However, Ms. Tanton limited appellee\u2019s award to the period of thirty days prior to the filing of the grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">On September 24, 2003, twelve days after the first step decision, the Comptroller formally changed the policy for compensation for travel time. Under the revised policy, an employee is considered to be on work time for any time in excess of the employee\u2019s \u201cnormal one-way commute time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Nevertheless, Ms. Miller appealed the decision because it did not deem as compensable work time the entire period of travel from the employee\u2019s home to a temporary work site. She also challenged the decision to limit the award to the preceding thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">The second step of appellee\u2019s grievance, \u201cEmployee Petition Of Grievance Appeal,\u201d led to a \u201cManagement Decision\u201d by Deputy Comptroller Stephen M. Cordi, dated November 12, 2003. He affirmed Ms. Tanton\u2019s decision regarding the work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>time policy. However, pursuant to Maryland Code (1993, 2004 Repl.Vol., 2005 Supp.), \u00a7 12-203(b) of the State Personnel and Pensions Article (\u201cS.P.P.\u201d), Cordi modified the award to limit compensation to the twenty-day period preceding the filing of the grievance on August 7, 2003. Cordi explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">In support of the request for a longer period of award, Ms. Miller\u2019s representative has directed my attention to a case involving two inspectors of the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation in which the Circuit Court for Baltimore City overruled an Administrative Law Judge\u2019s award of 30 days compensation in a commuting compensation case and award of 5 years. In an unreported decision, the Court of Special Appeals vacated the circuit court decision and remanded the case to the Administrative Law Judge to put the reason for limiting the award to 30 days on the record. Shortly thereafter, the Administrative Law Judge issued a decision specifying that the award was limited to 30 days because Section 10-206 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article, in effect at the time of the grievances in question, specified that grievances must be filed within 30 days of the act generating the grievance or when the grievant first knew or should have known of the act generating the grievance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">After the filing of the grievances in the foregoing case, the General Assembly replaced Section 10-206 with Section 12-203(b) which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">A grievance procedure must be initiated by an employee within 20 days after: (1) the occurrence of the alleged act that is the basis of the grievance; or (2) the employee first knew of or reasonably should have known of the alleged act that is the basis of the grievance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">In light of the foregoing, Ms. Tanton\u2019s award is hereby modified to conform with the 20-day requirement of Section 12-203(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">As to the substance of the grievance, that is whether Ms. Miller is entitled to compensation for the time for all of her travel to temporary work locations or just the time in excess of normal commute time, Ms. Tanton ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>An employee is entitled to compensation during work time. Pursuant to COMAR 17.04.11.02B(l)(j), \u201cwork time includes time during which an employee ... [tjravels between home and the work site other than the assigned office, in accordance with the Standard Travel Regulations under COMAR 28.02.01.\u201d I believe that the Department of Budget and Management, in adopting this definition of work time, is equating the determination of what is and is not work time, contrasted with commute time, to the similar determination made by the Board of Public Works in its Standard Travel Regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">The travel regulations provide that reimbursement for State-owned, State-leased, and privately-owned vehicles is subject to policies issued by the Department of Budget and Management, which has adopted \u201cState Vehicle Fleet Policies and Procedures.\u201d As most recently adopted in June 2002, Section 5 of that document sets forth the policy regarding private mileage reimbursement. Paragraph 5.01.05 states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">\u201cReimbursement is based on the principle that the employee should be reimbursed for all official business mileage accumulated in a private vehicle which is beyond the normal round trip mileage incurred from the employee\u2019s home to the permanently assigned office/work station and back home again.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Paragraph 5.01.01(1) further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">\u201cA State employee who leaves home to conduct business without stopping at the assigned office may be reimbursed for all mileage directly connected with the business trip, which is in excess of the commute miles normally traveled, i.e., total official miles driven minus normal daily commute miles. In this situation, the driver has not driven his normal daily commute and therefore must subtract it from the total official miles driven.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">I believe that COMAR 17.04.11.02B(l)(j), incorporating the Standard Travel Regulations, is intending to apply the quoted mileage reimbursement concept in determining whether an employee is on work time or commute time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Applying that concept to this situation, for those days when Ms. Miller does not travel to her assigned office, she would properly be viewed as being on work time for all time directly connected with the business trip, in excess of her normal commute time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">Having reviewed the regulations in question, I have concluded that Ms. Tanton\u2019s analysis is correct and thereby adopt her decision. That decision has the effect of providing parallel treatment for office and field personnel and avoids the necessity of management having to require field employees to report to the office first (and last) whenever the audit site is closer to the office than the employee\u2019s home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">The award is modified as set forth above, but the grievance is otherwise denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Unhappy with the outcome, Ms. Miller filed a third step appeal to the Secretary of the Department of Budget and Management (the \u201cDBM\u201d), who delegated the case to the OAH. The ALJ conducted an evidentiary hearing on April 20, 2004, at which Ms. Miller testified. James Loftus, Assistant Director of the Comptroller\u2019s Compliance Division, testified on behalf of the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Ms. Miller maintained that, if she was not traveling directly to her assigned office, she was \u201con the clock\u201d from the moment she got in her vehicle until she arrived at the remote work site. Moreover, she claimed that the Comptroller\u2019s travel time policies, both before and after the revision of September 24, 2003, violated Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 17.04.11.02B(l)(j), which states: \u201cWork time includes time during which an employee ... [t]ravels between home and the work site other than the assigned office, in accordance with the Standard Travel Regulations under CO-MAR 23.02.01.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Nevertheless, Ms. Miller conceded that, under the interpretation she advanced, she would earn compensable time even if assigned to a remote work site that required less travel time than her regular commute to her assigned office. In particular, she maintained that if, as a result of a work assignment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>a remote location, she had only a fifteen minute drive to the remote work site instead of her normal commute of thirty minutes from home to office, she would earn compensable time of thirty minutes for a round trip. Yet, she acknowledged that she earned no compensatory time for the entirety of her normal thirty minute home-to-offiee commute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The following exchange is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">[ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL]: So you would be asserting your right to compensatory time of 30 minutes in this hypothetical when your overall work day from beginning to end was in fact a half an hour shorter than your normal work day, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">[MILLER]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Ms. Miller described how she learned of the Comptroller\u2019s initial policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">I had asked specifically my supervisor what the travel policy was and he handed me that memo, and I said, \u201cWell, I have an audit,\u201d and I said, \u201cIf I go on that beltway in the morning, I\u2019ve sat in traffic to go one mile and wait\u2014and sat for 25 minutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-10\">I said, \u201cI have to meet\u2014my manager\u2019s supposed to be at this tax site at 8:30,\u201d and I now want to leave a quarter after 7:00, which with a half-an-hour commute would give me the extra half and [sic] hour plus 15 minutes. So I would have gotten under the old policy, the\u2014the memo indicated, 45 minutes compensatory time, and my supervisor said, \u201cOkay.\u201d That Monday I left home at quarter after 7:00 to meet. The beltway was tied up, it was snowing and I got to the taxpayer\u2019s site at 25 of 9:00. I thought my timing was pretty good on doing that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-11\">The next day I went into the office and I asked my supervisor how to put the time down on the time card, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>because they wouldn\u2019t pay me for when I left home, they were going to discount that first half hour, and he said, \u201cI\u2019ll have to get back to you.\u201d Well, time cards weren\u2019t due until the next week, no big deal as far as I was concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">The following Tuesday time cards are due and he says, \u201cWhere\u2019s your time card,\u201d and I\u2014I reminded him he was going to get back and tell me what hours to put in and then he told me they weren\u2019t going to pay me, they weren\u2019t approving compensatory time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The Comptroller argued that Ms. Miller\u2019s position could lead to the \u201cabsurd\u201d result of an employee who normally commutes thirty minutes at both ends of the day obtaining compensation for fifteen minute trips at each end of the day, and yet \u201cputting in a 30-minute shorter day.\u201d Moreover, the Comptroller claimed that, even if its current policy is inconsistent with law, S.P.P. \u00a7 12-203(b) limits to twenty days its liability for back pay or compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Appellant advanced the position expressed by Mr. Cordi in his \u201cManagement Decision\u201d dated November 12, 2003. The Comptroller conceded that its policy prior to September 24, 2003, was incorrect and inconsistent with the law, but asserted that its revised travel time policy was correct under COMAR 17.04.11.02B(l)(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Loftus testified that the Comptroller\u2019s revised work time policy was based upon the mileage reimbursement policy that already applied to State employees. He explained that, under the revised policy, if an employee with a normal commute time of thirty minutes were assigned to a remote work site located fifteen minutes from the employee\u2019s home, that fifteen minute trip \u201cwould be all commute time, no work time.\u201d The same result would occur if the employee with a normal commute of thirty minutes was assigned a remote work site thirty minutes from home. However, if the employee with a normal commute time of thirty minutes was assigned to a remote work site forty-five minutes or ninety minutes from home, the employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>would be paid for fifteen minutes or one hour, respectively.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">The Comptroller introduced a letter of February 8, 2000, from Andrea M. Fulton, Executive Director of the Office of Personnel Services and Benefits within DBM, to Mr. J. Alan Baker, Director of the Personal Services Administration of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. It stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">In accordance with Code of Maryland Regulation (COMAR) 17.04.011.02B(l)(j), any time that an employee travels between home and a work site other than the assigned office is considered work time. When such situations occur, we believe it is appropriate to deduct the employee\u2019s normal commute time from the actual travel time. The amount of the employee\u2019s actual travel time that exceeds the employee\u2019s normal commute time should be considered work time and the employee should be compensated, as appropriate under the personnel regulations concerning overtime, for this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">On June 4, 2004, the ALJ issued his decision, concluding, in part, that the Comptroller\u2019s revised policy \u201cis arbitrary and inconsistent with law and regulations.\u201d He reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">No statute directly addresses how executive branch agencies are to define, and compensate employees for, \u201cwork time,\u201d \u201ccommute time\u201d or \u201ctravel time.\u201d [COMAR 17.04.11.02B(j) provides, \u201cWork time includes time during which an employee ... [t]ravels between home and the work site other than the assigned office, in accordance with the Standard Travel Regulations under COMAR 23.02.01.\u201d]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">The Board of Public Work\u2019s Standard Travel Regulations apply to all executive branch State employees. COMAR 23.02.01.02B(14) provides as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">(14) \u201cTravel status\u201d means the condition of a State employee while traveling on State business. An employee is not in travel status while commuting from home to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>employee\u2019s assigned office, regardless of the length of time of that commute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Thus, by promulgated regulation, it is the policy of all executive agencies in the State (unless otherwise exempted) that an employee traveling from home to a field site, and not to the employee\u2019s assigned office, is on \u201cwork time\u201d and in \u201ctravel status.\u201d An employee is to be paid or compensated for \u201cwork time.\u201d <em>See, </em>COMAR 17.04.11.02B(l)(a) through (Z) (list of instances that qualify as compensable work time). When traveling to a field site, an employee is working for the State, \u201con the clock\u201d so to speak, from the time the employee leaves the residence or the place from which the normal commute to the assigned office would begin.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">In the instant case, under its revised policy (Joint Ex. #2) the Agency automatically, subtracts out (refuses to compensate for) time equal to an employee\u2019s normal, estimated commute time from home to the employee\u2019s assigned office and back home again when the employee travels to a field site. The Agency argues that the policy is analogous to the Private Mileage Reimbursement policy contained in the Department of Budget and Management\u2019s Vehicle Fleet policy (Joint Ex. # 3, p. 17-18). That policy is one in which mileage equal to an estimated, average round trip commute to an assigned office is subtracted out of the total miles traveled to and from a field site, for purposes of reimbursing an employee who uses a personal automobile for travel to a field site. With regard to reimbursing travel time, the Agency currently subtracts out the estimated, round trip travel time to the assigned office on those days when an employee does not commute to the employee\u2019s assigned office.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">.... There is no direct legal authority to allow the Agency to deduct from an employee compensation for the work time while on travel status. Moreover, if an employee has two or more residences, or two or more places from which an estimated commute to the assigned office begins, the automatic deduction policy becomes unmanageable. The Agen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>cy attempted to argue that if the travel time to a field site were shorter than the estimated commute time to the assigned office, then the employee would somehow be unjustly compensated and therefore that interpretation of the law and regulations would lead to an absurd result. I am not persuaded by the agency\u2019s argument on that point. I conclude that [Ms. Miller] has met her burdens to show that the Agency misapplied the statewide policy in formulating its own travel time policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Nevertheless, the ALJ said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">In the instant case, [Ms. Miller] offered no credible evidence regarding the calculation of uncompensated work hours that she alleges were wrongly denied by the Agency. She has not offered evidence of the extent, if any, of uncompensated work hours.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The ALJ concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Discussion, I conclude, as a matter of law, that [Ms. Miller] demonstrated that the Agency\u2019s revised travel time policy did not conform to law and regulation. COMAR 17.04.11.02. I further conclude, however, that [Ms. Miller] did not meet her burdens with regard to demonstrating that she is entitled to compensation for certain, uncompensated work time. Md.Code Ann. State Pers. &amp; Pens. \u00a7 12-401(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Although the ALJ rejected the Comptroller\u2019s arguments on the merits, he \u201cdenied and dismissed\u201d the grievance, because Ms. Miller had not presented evidence regarding the remedy she sought. Thereafter, Ms. Miller petitioned for judicial review, and the Comptroller cross-petitioned. The circuit court agreed with the ALJ that the Comptroller\u2019s revised policy was not supported by law. On the question of remedies, however, the court remanded the case to OAH</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-10\">for further proceedings to determine what, if any, compensation should be awarded Petitioner Miller for travel she undertook to any remote work site. Consistent with all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>other aspects of the decision of the Administrative Law Judge, Petitioner Miller\u2019s grievance will be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Before discussing the parties\u2019 contentions, it is helpful to review the pertinent statutory and regulatory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Title 17 of COMAR is captioned \u201cDepartment of Budget and Management.\u201d Subtitle 04 is titled \u201cPersonnel Services and Benefits.\u201d Chapter 11 pertains to \u201cLeave.\u201d Section 02 of Chapter 11 is titled \u2018Workweek, Overtime and Compensatory Time.\u201d COMAR 17.04.11.02B states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-10\">B.

It avoids a windfall to employees assigned to a remote work site located closer to their homes than their assigned office and is consistent with federal law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">Appellant notes that COMAR 23.02.01 contains regulations adopted by the Board of Public Works regarding travel for official business, (y.10) According to the Comptroller, \u201cwork time,\u201d as defined under COMAR 17.04.11.02B(l)(j), comports \u201cwith the Standard Travel Regulations under COMAR 23.02.01.\u201d Therefore, asserts appellant, \u201cby express regulation\u201d DMB \u201chas adopted the criteria for determining what is and is not reimbursable business mileage, as set forth in the State\u2019s Standard Travel Regulations, as the criteria to be used in determining work time.\u201d The Comptroller adds that, \u201c[w]ere this not so, the phrase in COMAR 17.04.11.02B(l)(j) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>\u2018in accordance with COMAR 23.02.01\u2019 would be mere surplus-age. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The Comptroller points out that COMAR 23.02.01.01C(2) provides that the travel regulations do not apply to \u201cState-owned, State-leased, or privately owned motor vehicles [used] to conduct official business for the State.\u201d Rather, \u201c[r]eimbursement to employees or officials who use State-owned, State-leased, or privately owned motor vehicles to conduct official business for the State is within the jurisdiction of the State Fleet Administrator, Department of Budget and Fiscal Planning [now DBM], and subject to policies issued by the Secretary....\u201d Accordingly, appellant contends that \u201cDBM\u2019s incorporation of the Board of Public Works\u2019 travel policy in turn adopts the policies established by the State Fleet Administrator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Appellant underscores that \u201c[t]he rule for mileage reimbursement, which DBM has adopted for defining work time, is clear: the time it takes to commute from home to the assigned office is personal time and must be subtracted out.\u201d In its view,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">DMB\u2019s own regulation, COMAR 17.04.11.02B(l)(j), through an incorporation by reference, adopts the State Fleet Policy as the basis for determining work time. Thus, the Comptroller\u2019s revised policy, based as it is on DBM\u2019s State Fleet Policy, is derived directly from DBM\u2019s own definition of work time. That definition requires that the home to assigned office commute segment of each trip be subtracted from the total travel time to determine compensable \u201cwork time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">According to appellant, its interpretation of the work time policy is logical and consistent with the DBM Fleet Policy; both policies recognize that travel time from home to the assigned office \u201cis personal, and not compensable as work-related.\u201d Appellant suggests that, \u201cto hold otherwise would create several anomalies and absurdities of the type that courts regularly caution should be avoided.\u201d In appellant\u2019s view, the revised policy \u201cavoids an unwarranted windfall when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>an employee is assigned to a remote work site that involves a commute that is shorter than the normal drive to the assigned office.\u201d Appellee\u2019s position, argues the Comptroller, could lead to the \u201cinappropriate\u201d result of \u201can auditor [having] earned 30 minutes of compensatory <em>time\u2014-for putting in a 30 minute shorter day.\u201d </em>Appellant asserts: \u201cDisparate treatment of similar components of the same trip makes no sense. This is particularly true where, as here, the rule for computing work time is based on the rule for computing business mileage reimbursement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Moreover, appellant insists that its interpretation \u201cis consistent with the views of DBM.\u201d Referring to the letter of February 8, 2000, from DBM Executive Director Fulton,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> appellant maintains that \u201cthese interpretations, by the official charged with administering the provisions in question,\u201d should receive \u201c \u2018a great deal of deference.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">In addition, appellant relies by analogy on 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(a), which provides that an employer is not subject to liability or required to pay overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (\u201cFLSA\u201d) for activities that are \u201cpreliminary or postliminary\u201d to principal activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Finally, appellant contends that, under S.P.P. \u00a7 12-203(b), the maximum relief to which appellee is entitled is limited to the period of twenty days prior to her filing of the grievance on August 7,2003. Appellant explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">The filing of a grievance on August 7, 2003, permits at most an award going back 20 days, but no further. Were this not the case, an employee could allow an erroneous (or illegal) management policy to continue, indefinitely, thus building up damages for the employee, while denying management the knowledge needed to fix the problem. The ALJ recognized this limit in his reference to \u201cthe twenty-day rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Appellee counters that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>ALJ was correct in his interpretation of the law relative to the substantive issue presented in the Appellee\u2019s grievance: Whether the law requires the employee to be compensated for all of the time she spends traveling between her home and a work site other than her assigned office? The ALJ concluded that the answer to that question is yes. That conclusion was correct....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Further, she asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">The plain language of the regulation requires that the Employee be compensated for the entire time spent traveling from home to a work site other than the assigned office. There is no support in the language of the regulation for the Comptroller\u2019s position that it is authorized to subtract any time from that travel time and deem it non-compensable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFB\">Appellee relies on the definition of \u201ctravel status\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in CO-MAR 23.02.01.02(14), claiming an employee is traveling on State business when proceeding from home to a remote site other than the regularly assigned office. Appellee also asserts that COMAR 23.02.01.02(10), defining \u201croutine business travel,\u201d supports her view, because it means \u201cauthorized travel\u201d to \u201ca jobsite other than the employee\u2019s assigned office for official business.\u201d According to appellee, \u201cthe logical, and correct, interpretation of these regulations\u201d means that whenever an employee is in travel status, he or she is on work time, because the employee is engaged in \u201croutine business travel\u201d for the State. She adds that her interpretation comports with the plain meaning of the words used in the COMAR regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Appellee also complains that the Comptroller relies not on COMAR 17.04.11.02B(1) and the Standard Travel Regulations, but upon a manual adopted by the State Fleet Administrator. According to appellee, the manual addresses the policies and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>procedures by which State employees may utilize vehicles from the State vehicle fleet or receive reimbursement for mileage if a personal vehicle is used for State business, but the manual does not pertain to compensable \u201cwork time.\u201d In appellee\u2019s view, the policy relied upon by the Comptroller \u201cdoes not possess the force and effect of law\u201d and, \u201c[o]n its face, the policy ... has no application to the issue in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Ms. Miller seems to recognize that \u201canomalies and absurdities\u201d are created by compensating an employee \u201cfor work time under one regulation, while another policy does not afford the employee mileage reimbursement for the same trip.\u201d She states: \u201cIt may be true that this is an inconsistency that is not wise or appropriate.\u201d Nevertheless, appellee asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">That does not mean, however, that the appropriate way to remedy that inconsistency is to deprive the employee of the compensation she is clearly entitled to under COMAR, just because she may not be entitled to mileage reimbursement for the trip as well. It makes more sense to bring the mileage reimbursement policy into conformity with CO-MAR\u2019s definition of \u201cwork time,\u201d not the other way around. After all, properly promulgated COMAR regulations carry the force and effect of law. The policy manual relied upon by Appellant does not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Moreover, appellee contends that appellant\u2019s reliance upon FLSA \u201cis simply not the issue in this case,\u201d as it was not relied upon by the appellee in her claim or by the ALJ in his decision. She asserts: \u201cMaryland law clearly contemplates that state employees will be entitled to compensation in a larger number of circumstances than are guaranteed by the FLSA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Miller directs us to S.P.P. \u00a7 8-302 which led to the promulgation of COMAR 17.04.11.02.B. The statute states: \u201cAll employees subject to this subtitle are entitled to the greater of: (1) the benefits that are provided under this subtitle; or (2) to the extent applicable, the benefits required by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.\u201d According to appellee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>\u201cMaryland law does not simply mirror or \u2018codify\u2019 the requirements of the FLSA. Rather, there are circumstances in which state law goes beyond the FLSA----\u201d In appellee\u2019s view, the Comptroller asks this Court to \u201csimply ignore COMAR regulations ... which squarely resolve\u201d the issue, and instead to \u201cadopt a tortured and convoluted argument which essentially ignores controlling law directly on point, in favor of a policy manual which has no reasonable application to the issues or facts presented in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Finally, appellee contends that the issue of whether her remedy is limited to compensation for twenty days is not properly before this Court, because in its \u201cQuestion Presented\u201d appellant \u201craises only the question of the correctness of the decision below on the legality of the Comptroller\u2019s revised work time policy.\u201d In any event, citing S.P.P. \u00a7 12-402(a), \u201cRemedies available to grievants,\u201d which provides that the remedies available to a grievant under this title include \u201cthe restoration of the rights, pay, status, or benefits that the grievant otherwise would have had if the contested policy, procedure, or regulation had been applied appropriately as determined by the final decision maker,\u201d appellee contends that the law provides that employees who are successful through the grievance process are entitled to be made whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">We review the decision of an administrative agency in accordance with the well-established principles of administrative law. <em>See, e.g., Maryland Aviation Administration v.

The <em>Noland </em>Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>by reviewing courts.... Furthermore, the expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">386 Md. at 572, 873 A.2d 1145 (citations omitted). <em>See also Palmer, </em>389 Md. at 453, 886 A.2d 554. \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d said the <em>Noland </em>Court, \u201cwhen a statutory provision is entirely clear, with no ambiguity whatsoever, \u2018administrative constructions, no matter how well entrenched, are not given weight.\u2019 \u201d 386 Md. at 572, 873 A.2d 1145</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Courts have long recognized that it is within the power of agencies to enact regulations. As the Court said in <em>Comptroller of Treasury v. Rockhill, Inc., </em>205 Md. 226, 232-33, 107 A.2d 93 (1954):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\">It is universally recognized that it would be impossible for the Legislature to deal directly with the multitude of details in the complex conditions upon which it legislates, and so it has become customary for the Legislature to delegate to each administrative agency the power to make rules and regulations to carry legislation into effect. Unless an administrative officer or department is permitted to make reasonable rules and regulations, it would be impossible in many instances to apply and enforce the legislative enactments, and the good to be accomplished would be entirely lost.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-8\"><em>See also Christ v.

Moreover, under settled principles of statutory construction, the word \u201cshall\u201d is ordinarily presumed to have a mandatory meaning. <em>See In Re Anthony R., </em>362 Md. 51, 56, 763 A.2d 136 (2000); <em>In Re Abiagail C., </em>138 Md.App. 570, 581, 772 A.2d 1277 (2001); <em>Egloff v.

Instead, we read them with reference to the legislative scheme of which they are a part, so as to effectuate the legislative intent. <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt. City v.

Department of Employment &amp; Training, </em>309 Md. 28, 40, 522 A.2d 382 (1987). And, as with a statute, in construing a regulation we aim \u201cto avoid results which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>\u2018illogical,\u2019 \u2018unreasonable,\u2019 or \u2018inconsistent with common sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Romm v. Flax, </em>340 Md. 690, 693, 668 A.2d 1 (1995) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">At the time of the first step of the grievance procedure, under the Comptroller\u2019s then existing policy, employees traveling to off-site locations were compensated only for travel time that exceeded commuting time by more than one half hour. The Comptroller recognized that the policy denied employees compensation for a period of time that should have been viewed as work time. Accordingly, in a decision issued on September 12, 2003, Miller\u2019s grievance was granted, in part; Miller was found entitled to compensation, as work time, for all travel time in excess of the time that she normally spent commuting between home and office.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">On September 24, 2003, twelve days after the decision at the first step grievance hearing, the Comptroller changed the work time policy and notified all affected employees. Nevertheless, the ALJ rejected the revised policy, concluding that an employee \u201cis working for the State, \u2018on the clock,\u2019 so to speak, from the time the employee leaves the residence or the place from which the normal commute to the assigned office would begin,\u201d until arriving at a field site.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">We agree with appellant that the ALJ\u2019s conclusion is inconsistent with the plain meaning of the regulations. Therefore, the ALJ\u2019s decision is \u201cpremised on an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Noland, </em>386 Md. at 571, 873 A.2d 1145. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">COMAR 17.04.11.02B(I)(j) plainly defines \u201cwork time\u201d as the time during which an employee \u201c[tjravels between home and a work site other than the assigned office, in accordance with the Standard Travel Regulations under COMAR 23.02.01.\u201d As noted, Ms. Miller asserts that the plain language of this regulation requires that the employee \u201cbe com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>pensated for the <em>entire </em>time spent traveling from home to a work site other than the assigned office,\u201d without regard to the fact that, but for the travel to an off site location, the employee would have spent some period of time commuting to the assigned office. However, the Standard Travel Regulations under COMAR 23.02.01.01(c)(2) provide: \u201cReimbursement to employees or officials who use State-owned, State-leased or privately owned motor vehicles to conduct official business for the State is within the jurisdiction of the State Fleet Administrator, Department of Budget and Fiscal Planning [now Department of Budget and Management (\u201cDBM\u201d)] <em>and subject to policies issued by the Secretary.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">We agree with the Comptroller that it is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMK\">clear what the \u201cplain language\u201d of COMAR 17.04.11.02B(I)(j) both does and does not do. It does <em>not </em>provide that the \u201centire\u201d home to remote site commute constitutes work time. The language of the regulations does require, by its incorporation by reference of the Standard Travel Regulations, resort to the state fleet policies to determine what is to be considered work time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">It is \u201cwell settled that incorporation by reference is a perfectly acceptable and appropriate method of drafting legislation.\u201d <em>Boitnott v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>356 Md. 226, 242, 738 A.2d 881 (1999); <em>see also Smith v. Plymouth Locomotive Works, Inc., </em>304 Md. 633, 638-39, 500 A.2d 1027 (1985) (\u201cThe authorities uniformly agree that a statute may adopt all or part of another statute by descriptive reference thereto, and when this occurs it is as if the part adopted has been written into the adopting statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">In <em>Hanrahan v. Alterman, </em>41 Md.App. 71, 396 A.2d 272, <em>cert. denied, </em>284 Md. 744 (1979), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">The law recognizes \u201ca special class of related statutes, ... the relationship [between which] results from the fact that one statute adopts the terms of the other without restating them.[ ]\u201d Incorporating statutory provisions by reference, partially or entirely, into legislation has been long recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>nized as an acceptable practice on both the state0 and federal levels n unless prohibited by constitutional provisions. \u201cThe purpose of incorporating, [adopting,] or referring to prior statutes is to avoid encumbering the statute books with useless repetition and unnecessary verbiage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 81, 396 A.2d 272 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The regulations set out in the \u201cState Vehicle Fleet Policies and Procedures\u201d manual are incorporated by reference into COMAR 17.04.11.02B(l)(j). To conclude otherwise would defeat the \u201cordinary and natural meaning\u201d of the words of the statute, <em>Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. at 672, 659 A.2d 1347, taking \u201ca clear and unambiguous statute\u201d and giving it \u201ca forced ... interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning.\u201d <em>Taylor v. NationsBank, </em>365 Md. at 181, 776 A.2d 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Accordingly, the principles outlined above require us to consider the State Fleet policies adopted by the DBM\u2019s State Fleet Administrator. As noted, \u00a7 5.01.05 of the \u201cState Vehicle Fleet Policies and Procedures\u201d provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">A state employee who leaves home to conduct business without stopping at the assigned office may be reimbursed for all mileage directly connected with the business trip, <em>which is in excess of the commute miles normally traveled i.e. total official miles driven minus normal daily commute miles. </em>In this situation, the driver has not driven his normal daily commute and therefore must subtract it from the total official miles driven.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">The Comptroller has analogized the treatment of an employee\u2019s travel time to the treatment of mileage. An employee is entitled to payment for mileage that exceeds the mileage for the daily commute; when driving for State business, the employee is compensated for mileage, minus the mileage that would have been driven for commuting. The Secretary of DBM, who administers both work time and travel reimbursement, has chosen to apply to travel time the policy applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>for mileage, i.e., awarding compensation for travel time minus normal commuting time.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Although \u201ccommute time\u201d is not defined in COMAR 17.04.11.02, \u201cwork time\u201d is defined in subsection B. The omission of \u201ccommute time\u201d in COMAR 17.04.11.02B, combined with the detailed definition of \u201cwork time\u201d in that subsection, logically suggests to us that \u201ccommute time\u201d is not tantamount to work time. Additionally, with reference to FSLA, we note that \u201cpreliminary activities,\u201d as described in the FLSA, are \u201cthose activities which are engaged in before the threshold of, or entrance upon the day\u2019s principal activity.\u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 254(a)(2); <em>see also Bagrowski v. Maryland Port Authority, </em>845 F.Supp. 1116 (D.Md.1994); <em>Marshall v. Gerwill, Inc., </em>495 F.Supp. 744 (D.Md.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">We are persuaded by appellant\u2019s contention that commuting is \u201cpreliminary to or postliminary to\u201d appellee\u2019s principal activity, and therefore it is not compensable under the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(a). It relieved employers from \u201cliability or punishment under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938\u201d for failing to pay an employee for the following activities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">(1) walking, riding, or traveling to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity or activities which such employee is employed to perform, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">(2) activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity or activities, which occur either prior to the time on any particular workday at which such employee commences, or subsequent to the time on any particular workday at which he ceases, such principal activity or activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Maryland law accommodates the FLSA\u2019s exclusion of commuting time as compensable. As appellee correctly points out, \u201cthere are circumstances in which state law goes beyond the FLSA, as recognized by the General Assembly when it explicitly stated that state employees are entitled to the greater of that which they are afforded by state or federal law.\u201d The FLSA is a floor, not a ceiling.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>COMAR 17.04.11.02B explicitly contemplates compensation for State employees for certain preliminary and postliminary activities, granting the employee the time in excess of daily, normal commute time when an employee \u201c[tjravels between home and a work site other than the assigned office.\u201d CO-MAR 17.04.11.02B(j). Conversely, when an employee travels off site, the provision does not provide for compensation for the time that would have been spent for the daily, normal commute.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Under appellee\u2019s analysis, an employee assigned to a remote work site that requires less travel time than the normal, daily commute would have a shorter work day, yet earn compensation in excess of a full day\u2019s pay. Compensating employees for their entire travel time to a remote work site, without consideration of regular commute time, would lead to unjust enrichment of the employee, who would ordinarily have spent a portion of that time traveling to the regular work site. Commute time is not work time, and an employee who is on travel status is not entitled to compensation for either the mileage or the time that the employee regularly spends to commute. We decline to endorse a facially absurd result that is blatantly unfair to the taxpayers and results in a windfall to the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">We pause to review the Court of Appeals\u2019s recent opinion in <em>Palmer, supra, </em>389 Md. 443, 886 A.2d 554, which is facially similar but distinguishable on its facts. In <em>Palmer, </em>non-uniformed employees at the Eastern Correctional Institution (\u201cECI\u201d) grieved, <em>inter alia, </em>that ECI\u2019s \u201csecurity search policy ... required them to use personal leave time to undergo searches and related delays while entering and exiting the Institution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444, 886 A.2d 554. The grievants were unsuccessful before the Warden, the Secretary of the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (the \u201cDepartment\u201d), and the Secretary, of Budget and Management (the \u201cSecretary\u201d). <em>Id. </em>The Secretary referred the grievance to the OAH, where the ALJ construed the \u201cwork time\u201d regulations in favor of the grievants. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>The ALJ\u2019s decision rested on the ALJ\u2019s construction of COMAR \u00a7 17.04.11.02B(l)(g), which states that \u201c[w]ork time includes time during which the employee ... participates in activities that are job-related immediately before the beginning or immediately after the end of an assigned shift....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448, 886 A.2d 554. The ALJ concluded that the time spent clearing security constituted a job-related activity under CO-MAR 17.04.11.02B(l)(g), citing the following reasons: \u201cthe requirement ... is a pre-requisite to the [ejmployee\u2019s commencement of and completion of the work day\u201d; \u201cit cannot be accomplished off-site, on the employee\u2019s own time\u201d; \u201cthis prerequisite is mandated by Management\u201d; while waiting, \u201cemployees are subject to Management\u2019s assignment and supervision\u201d; and \u201cthe time it takes ... to undergo security can be unduly delayed by Management activities such as a lock-down, or entry of inmates into the institution or unavailability of a female officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 449, 886 A.2d 554. The ALJ\u2019s decision was upheld on judicial review by the Circuit Court for Somerset County. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In the Court of Appeals, the Court noted that \u201cthe issue raised is whether the time spent in clearing security is part of the Grievants\u2019 work time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448, 886 A.2d 554. The Grievants did \u201cnot contest the requirement that they clear security.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447, 886 A.2d 554. They sought \u201cto punch in before, and out after, they have cleared security, so that they will not be charged personal leave time if they do not arrive at their work stations by the start of a shift or if they leave their work stations before the end of a shift.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447-48, 886 A.2d 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The Court observed that the ALJ \u201ccarefully limited the Grievants\u2019 work time to the scope of COMAR 17.04.11.02B(l)(g), holding that time spent clearing security checks was \u2018job-related\u2019 only when entering or exiting a shift.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Holding that the ALJ\u2019s decision \u201cwas not premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law,\u201d the Court noted first that the ALJ\u2019s determination was \u201centitled to a degree of deference described as \u2018considerable weight.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453, 886 A.2d 554 (citing <em>Noland, </em>386 Md. at 572, 873 A.2d 1145). Second, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Court held that the ALJ\u2019s decision \u201cis supported by ordinary rules of statutory construction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454, 873 A.2d 1145. The Court stated: \u201cBy the plain language of [COMAR 17.04.11.02B(l)(g)], the activity need only be job-related, and the ALJ gave explanations that are reasonable and hardly arbitrary for concluding that the security clearance activity in the instant matter was job-related.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\"><em>Palmer </em>involved activities that occurred once the employee arrived at their regular work site. In contrast, the case <em>sub judice </em>involves travel to and from a remote work site, and does not implicate a requirement that an employee use his or her personal time, without compensation, while engaged in a work-related activity. Under the Comptroller\u2019s revised travel policy, Miller is compensated for time that exceeds normal, daily commute time. While travel to an off-site work location \u201cis mandated by Management,\u201d <em>id., </em>she is compensated for time that exceeds her own normal commute time.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">As we see it, the ALJ\u2019s interpretation was premised on the erroneous conclusion that existing regulations mandated that an employee\u2019s entire commute between home and a remote work site be treated as work time. The ALJ ignored the incorporation by reference of the Standard Travel Regulations into COMAR 17.04.11.02B(l)(j). The ALJ also ignored the scenario in which travel to a remote work site takes less time than travel to an assigned office; in that instance, the ALJ\u2019s erroneous interpretation of the regulations would create a windfall for the employee. The Comptroller\u2019s interpretation, in our view, mirrors the DBM\u2019s travel regulations and avoids that unreasonable result.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">We agree that appellee is entitled to the award of compensation as provided in Cordi\u2019s \u201cManagement Decision\u201d of November 12, 2003. That decision modified the August 7, 2003, first step grievance decision \u201cto conform with the 20-day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>requirement of [S.P.P.] Section 12-203(b).\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">As we indicated earlier, appellee sought compensation dating back to the commencement of her employment with the Comptroller in 2001.
