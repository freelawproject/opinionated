When appellee failed to file a response to that suit, the Puerto Rico court granted appellant a divorce, while granting custody of the minor child to appellee. In the meantime, appellee brought a more expansive divorce action in Maryland. Filing a complaint for absolute divorce in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, appellee sought sole custody of their child, as well as child support, alimony, and distribution of the marital assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">After appellant filed an answer to the Maryland suit, a trial was scheduled to commence in the Anne Arundel County circuit court on a date agreed to by both parties. In the weeks leading up to trial, appellant filed several motions to stay the proceedings pursuant to 50 App. U.S.C. \u00a7 522. That section requires a court, if certain conditions are met, to grant a servicemember\u2019s request for a stay of proceedings in a civil case for at least 90 days. All of those motions were denied, including the last, which contained a letter signed by appellant\u2019s commander attesting to his unavailability.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">A trial, in appellant\u2019s absence, was held, as scheduled. When that ex parte proceeding concluded, the circuit court found that the parties had been divorced by the Puerto Rico court, granted appellee custody of the parties\u2019 minor child, as well as rehabilitative alimony, child support, and a share of appellee\u2019s military pension on an \u201cif, as and when\u201d basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Appealing from that order, appellant presents six questions for our review, but only two are relevant to this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Stripped of argument, they are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">I. Whether the circuit court had jurisdiction over appellant and the subject matter of the action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-6\">II. Whether the circuit court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motions for stay of proceedings pursuant to 50 App. U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 521 and 522.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">For the reasons that follow, we hold that the Anne Arundel County circuit court did, in fact, have personal jurisdiction over appellant as well as jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action. But we shall vacate the judgment of that court because it failed to stay the proceedings, pursuant to 50 App. U.S.C. \u00a7 522, as appellant requested. Having resolved this appeal on that issue, we need not address appellant\u2019s other concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">The following facts are not in dispute: On June 5, 1992, the parties were married in Panama City, Panama. On July 27, 1994, they had a child. Although the parties disagree as to who left whom, they do agree that, by February of 2001, the marriage was, in essence, over. At that time, appellant, who was and still is an active member of the United States Armed Forces, received orders to relocate to Puerto Rico. In compliance with those orders, he left for Puerto Rico. When that occurred, appellee and the parties\u2019 child moved to Anne Arundel County, Maryland, to live with appellee\u2019s sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>In May of 2001, appellant filed for a divorce in Florida. Appellant was not certain where appellee and their child were living at the time, and it is unclear from the record whether appellee was actually served with process. In any event, the Florida court granted him a judgment of divorce in 2001. But that judgment was set aside upon appellee\u2019s motion, which successfully argued that the Florida court lacked personal jurisdiction over her.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">On August 12, 2003, appellant again filed for a divorce, but, this time, in the Superior Court of Bayamon, Puerto Rico, and that suit was personally served on appellee. When appellee neither appeared nor filed an answer in the Puerto Rico proceedings, the Puerto Rico court issued a decree on November 5, 2003, dissolving the marriage. In so doing, it granted sole custody of the minor child to appellee and ordered appellant to pay child support in the amount of $349 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">While the Puerto Rico divorce proceedings were pending, on August 28, 2003, appellee filed a complaint for absolute divorce in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, requesting custody of the minor child, child support, permanent alimony, and a distribution of marital property. After filing an answer, appellant moved to dismiss the action, attaching to his motion the November 5th Puerto Rico divorce decree. In an opposition to that motion, appellee argued that the Puerto Rico court did not have jurisdiction over issues of marital property, alimony, child custody or support. The circuit court agreed and denied appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">On January 12, 2004, appellee filed a supplemental complaint, again requesting that the circuit court distribute the marital property, grant her custody of the minor child, as well as alimony and child support. On January 22, 2004, appellee advised the circuit court that he had been transferred from Puerto Rico to San Antonio, Texas. On February 5, 2004, appellant\u2019s attorney entered an appearance. On February 18, 2004, the parties attended a scheduling conference; at which time they agreed, and the court later ordered, that a pre-trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>hearing be held on July 6, 2004. After that hearing, the circuit court scheduled trial for September 8, 2004, a date agreed upon by the parties. Although appellant knew, at that time, that he might be deployed to Colombia, South America, in the near future, he did not know the precise date on which that was to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">On July 21, 2004, concluding that he could no longer afford his attorney\u2019s services, appellant sent him a letter terminating his representation. On July 23, 2004, after receiving the letter, appellant\u2019s counsel filed a motion to withdraw his appearance. On August 3, 2004, appellee filed a response to that motion, stating that she opposed the motion on the grounds that it would postpone the trial. On August 11, 2004, the circuit court issued an order \u201cdefer[ring] action on the motion [to withdraw appearance] until either: (1) The pending 9/8/04 trial [was] completed, (2) Defendant obtained] another attorney as a substitute or (3) Defendant fil[ed] a written statement, indicating that he intends to represent himself <em>at trial </em>and, <em>therefore that he will not ask for any postponements in order to obtain an attorney.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) On August 10, 2004, appellant filed a written statement informing the circuit court of his intent to proceed <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">A month before trial, on August 11, 2004, appellant filed his first motion to stay the proceedings pursuant to 50 App. U.S.C. \u00a7 521, now \u00a7 522. In that pro se motion, appellant stated that he had received orders from the United States Army to move to Colombia, South America, for twelve months starting September 26, 2004. He further stated that a mandatory training course required him to report to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, by September 19, 2004, and that, to comply with all the requirements for his permanent change of station, he had to begin \u201cout-processing procedures\u201d on September 2, 2004. The \u201cout-processing procedures\u201d included, among other things, obtaining passports, visas, and other paperwork, as well as attending medical and dental appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Appellant further stated that his ability to defend the divorce action would be \u201cmaterially affected\u201d by his active <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>duty service and his permanent change of station to Colombia and that the nature of his duties before and during deployment would prevent him from attending the trial as scheduled and from communicating effectively with the circuit court. In support of his motion, appellant attached his orders for permanent change of station, which contained a list of administrative requirements, and a letter from his commanding officer stating that appellant\u2019s current military duty prevented him from appearing at the September 8th trial. He did, however, indicate that he would be available for trial after October 1, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">On August 25, 2004, two weeks before trial, appellant filed a second motion for stay of proceedings. The second motion reiterated the assertions contained in the first motion, but, unlike the first motion, it was prepared by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">On August 31, 2004, a week before trial, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s motion for stay of proceedings on the grounds that appellant\u2019s motion \u201cha[d] not provided evidence that a request for leave would not be granted for the\u201d September 8th trial. That same day, the circuit court permitted appellant\u2019s attorney to withdraw his appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">On September 7, 2004, one day before the scheduled trial, in response to the circuit court\u2019s order of August 31st, appellant submitted a third motion for stay of proceedings. The motion was pursuant to 50 App. U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b), and, in the alternative, pursuant to 50 App. U.S.C. \u00a7 521.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To that motion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>appellant attached a letter from his commanding officer stating that his military duty prevented him from appearing in court on September 8, 2004, and that his request for leave was denied. Appellant also stated that he would be available to appear in court after October 1, 2005. Because the motion was submitted over Labor Day weekend, the circuit court received the motion in \u201copen court\u201d on the morning of September 8, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">After the court denied that motion, an ex parte trial ensued. When the trial ended, the circuit court issued an order finding that the parties were divorced by the Puerto Rico court, awarding custody of the parties\u2019 minor child to appellee, directing appellant to pay child support in the amount of $662 per month, and awarding rehabilitative alimony to appellee. It further granted appellee a share of appellant\u2019s military pension on an \u201cif, as and when\u201d basis, ordered an equal division of the parties\u2019 jointly owned tangible property, and instructed appellant to pay $2,000 of appellee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">On October 18, 2005, appellant filed a Motion to Supplement Initial Brief and Record on Appeal. Because this motion is unopposed and would provide helpful information to this Court, we shall grant it.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">Appellant contends that the circuit court lacked personal jurisdiction over him and subject-matter jurisdiction over this action. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Appellant has waived the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction by failing to comply with Maryland Rule 2-322(a). That rule states, in part: \u201cThe following defenses shall be made by motion to dismiss filed before the answer, if an answer is required,\u201d and then specifies lack of jurisdiction over the person, among others. It then warns, \u201cIf not so made and the answer is filed, these defenses are waived.\u201d Because appellant failed to file a separate motion to dismiss before he filed an answer containing such a request, appellant waived this defense and thereby consented to personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The circuit court also had jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action. Maryland Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 1-201 of the Family Law Article states that an equity court has jurisdiction over divorce, alimony, custody of a child, and support of a child. In addition, Family Law \u00a7 8-202 permits a court, when granting a divorce, to resolve any dispute between the parties regarding the ownership of personal and real property. Furthermore, Family Law \u00a7 7-101 states: \u201c(a) <em>Residence </em>requirement.\u2014If the grounds for the divorce occurred outside of this State, a party may not apply for a divorce unless 1 of the parties has resided in this State for at least 1 year before the application is filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Appellant does not contest that appellee had been living in Maryland for the requisite time period before filing her complaint. In his brief, appellant states that, \u201cAt the beginning of 2002, Appellant was aware that Appellee was in Maryland,\u201d and elsewhere, in his brief, he refers to appellee having moved to Maryland in 2002. Thus, appellant\u2019s claims of lack of both personal and subject matter jurisdiction have no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Appellant also contends that the circuit court erred in denying his motions to stay the proceedings pursuant to the Servicemember\u2019s Civil Relief Act, 50 App. U.S.C. \u00a7 522 or, in the alternative, 50 App. U.S.C. \u00a7 521. This argument is more persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Because the issue is the circuit court\u2019s interpretation of that statute, and, thus, a question of law, our review of the circuit court\u2019s decision is <em>de novo. E.g., Harvey v. Marshall, </em>389 Md. 243, 257, 884 A.2d 1171 (2005); <em>Mohan v. Norris, </em>386 Md. 63, 66-67, 871 A.2d 575 (2005). And it constrains us to conclude that the circuit court should have granted appellant\u2019s third and last motion for a stay of the trial proceedings pursuant to 50 App. U.S.C. \u00a7 522. That section states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">(a) Applicability of section</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">This section applies to any civil action or proceeding in which the plaintiff or defendant at the time of filing an application under this section\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">(1) is in military service or is within 90 days after termination of or release from military service; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-8\">(2) has received notice of the action or proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-9\">(b) Stay of proceedings</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-10\">(1) Authority for stay</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-11\">At any stage before final judgment in a civil action or proceeding in which a servicemember described in subsection (a) is a party, the court may on its own motion and <em>shall, upon application by the servicemember, stay the action for a period of not less than 90 days, if the conditions in paragraph (2) are met.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-12\">(2) Conditions for stay</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-13\">An application for a stay under paragraph (1) shall include the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-14\">(A) A letter or other communication setting forth facts stating the manner in which current military duty requirements materially affect the servicemember\u2019s ability to appear and stating a date when the servicemember will be available to appear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-15\">(B) A letter or other communication from the servicemember\u2019s commanding officer stating that the servicemember\u2019s current military duty prevents appearance and that military leave is not authorized for the servicemember at the time of the letter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>50 App. U.S.C. \u00a7 522(a)-(b) (emphasis added). The statute thus required the circuit court to grant appellant\u2019s motion to stay if he satisfied the conditions in \u00a7 522(b)(2)(A) and (B). He did.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In his first motion, appellant stated that his \u201cability to prosecute or defend is \u2018materially affected\u2019 by reason of his active duty service.\u201d He explained that he would be stationed in Colombia, South America, for twelve months starting September 26, 2004, and that, to prepare for his deployment, he had to begin \u201cout-processing procedures\u201d on September 2, 2004. Those procedures included \u201cappointments with hospital, dental, housing, Central Issue Facility, finance, personnel office, Post Office, AAFES, Officer\u2019s club, and company headquarters.\u201d He further stated that he needed to obtain \u201cpassports, visas, training, and country clearance,\u201d as well as \u201creceive country briefing and all the required paperwork\u201d and \u201corganize family and personal affairs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">In addition, he stated that his duties would prevent effective communication between him and the circuit court, but that he would be available for trial after October 1, 2005. And finally, appellant attached a copy of his permanent change of station orders, which described the tasks appellant had to complete before departure. Appellant\u2019s first motion thus clearly constituted \u201c[a] letter or other communication setting forth facts stating the manner in which current military duty requirements materially affect the servicemember\u2019s ability to appear and stating a date when the servicemember will be available to appear.\u201d \u00a7 522(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Appellant also satisfied \u00a7 522(b)(2)(B). Attached to his third motion was a letter from Captain Christopher Boris, stating that he was appellant\u2019s commanding officer, that appellant\u2019s leave request for September 7-10, 2004, was denied, and that appellant\u2019s current military duty prevented him from appearing in court on September 8, 2004. This statement satisfied the requirement that the servicemember include \u201c[a] letter or other communication from the servicemember\u2019s commanding officer stating that the servicemember\u2019s current military duty prevents appearance and that military leave is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>authorized for the servicemember at the time of the letter.\u201d \u00a7 522(b)(2)(B). Therefore, by the time appellant filed his third motion, he had submitted everything that \u00a7 522(b)(2) requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Because appellant satisfied both statutory requirements, the circuit court was required to grant the stay appellant requested. The statute leaves no room for judicial discretion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It states that the court \u201cshall, upon application by the service-member, stay the action\u201d if the servicemember satisfies the two conditions. \u00a7 522(b)(1). Thus, it was error for the circuit court to have failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>It should be noted that the mandatory aspect of the statute relates merely to the court granting an initial stay of not less than 90 days. The statute further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">(d) Additional stay</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">(1) Application</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">A servicemember who is granted a stay of a civil action or proceeding under subsection (b) may apply for an additional stay based on continuing material affect of military duty on the servicemember\u2019s ability to appear. Such an application may be made by the servicemember at the time of the initial application under subsection (b) or when it appears that the servicemember is unavailable to prosecute or defend the action. The same information required under subsection (b)(2) shall be included in an application under this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-8\">(2) Appointment of counsel when additional stay refused</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-9\">If the court refuses to grant an additional stay of proceedings under paragraph (1), the court shall appoint counsel to represent the servicemember in the action or proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">\u00a7 522(d). Thus the circuit court was required to grant a stay of at least 90 days. At the conclusion of whatever period of time it granted, the court then had the authority to deny any further stays, provided it appointed counsel to represent appellant in his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-11\">MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT INITIAL BRIEF AND RECORD ON APPEAL GRANTED.

Whether the circuit court failed to give full faith and credit to a divorce decree issued by a Puerto Rico court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-12\">II.

Section 521 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-9\">(d) Stay of proceedings</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-10\">In an action covered by this section in which the defendant is in military service, the court shall grant a stay of proceedings for a minimum period of 90 days under this subsection upon application of counsel, or on the court\u2019s own motion, if the court determines that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-11\">(1) there may be a defense to the action and a defense cannot be presented without the presence of the defendant; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-12\">(2) after due diligence, counsel has been unable to contact the defendant or otherwise determine if a meritorious defense exists.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-13\">(e) Inapplicability of section 202 procedures</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahj\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>A stay of proceedings under subsection (d) shall not be controlled by procedures or requirements under section 202 [section 522 of this Appendix],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANU\">(f) Section 202 protection</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af_\">If a servicemember who is a defendant in an action covered by this section receives actual notice of the action, the servicemember may request a stay of proceeding under section 202 [section 522 of this Appendix].</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b712-6\">. Before 2003, the statute, which was then known as the Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors' Civil Relief Act, did not require the court to grant a stay if the conditions were met. The previous version of \u00a7 522 (formerly \u00a7 521) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">Stay of proceedings where military service affects conduct thereof</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUh\">At any stage thereof any action or proceeding in any court in which a person in military service is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, during the period of such service or within sixty days thereafter may, in the discretion of the court in which it is pending, on its own motion, and shall, on application to it by such person or some person on his behalf, be stayed as provided in this Act [sections 501 to 591 of this Appendix], <em>unless, in the opinion of the court, the ability of plaintiff to prosecute the action or the defendant to conduct his defense is not materially affected by reason of his military seivice.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">50 App. U.S.C. \u00a7 521 (1990) (emphasis added). That is, under the previous iteration of the statute, the court had discretion to deny a stay if it believed the servicemember's military service would not materially affect his ability to prosecute or defend the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">In 2003, Congress amended the Act, renaming it the \"Servicemember's Civil Relief Act,\u201d and removing the discretionary power of the court to deny a stay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-10\">\n<em>This expanded section would require a 90-day stay upon application of the servicemember if certain conditions are met....</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-11\"><em>Stays should be automatic </em>if they meet several important criteria which adequately place the court on notice when a case may proceed. First, section 202 [50 App. U.S.C. \u00a7 522] would place an obligation on the servicemember to demonstrate material affect by providing a factual basis for supporting the stay request....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-12\">Second, section 202 would require a letter from the servicemember's unit commander affirming that the servicemember's military duty prevents an appearance. Equipped with this information, the court would be able to make a more informed judgment as to when the litigation may proceed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-13\">H.R.Rep.
