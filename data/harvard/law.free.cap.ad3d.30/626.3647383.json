The charges arose from an incident during which defendant and his codefendants lured an acquaintance to the apartment of one of them, and then assaulted and robbed him. Defendant and one codefendant entered pleas of guilty to the entire indictment <em>(see People v Boyd, </em>26 AD3d 534 [2006]); the other codefendants each pleaded guilty to one count of robbery in the second degree. Defendant\u2019s negotiated plea included a promise by County Court to sentence him to a determinate term of incarceration within a range of five to eight years, to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to prison terms of eight years on the two counts of robbery in the first degree and six years on the two counts of robbery in the second degree, to run concurrently and to be followed by three years of postrelease supervision. Defendant did not waive his right to appeal, which he now exercises.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">We reject defendant\u2019s contention that the photo array shown to the victim was unduly suggestive because defendant\u2019s skin tone is lighter than that of the other five people depicted. Our review of the photographs in the array reveals six individuals with substantially similar shades of skin tone, as well as similar hairstyles and other physical characteristics <em>(see People v Chipp, </em>75 NY2d 327, 336 [1990], <em>cert denied </em>498 US 833 [1990]; <em>People v Colon, </em>24 AD3d 1114, 1115 [2005], <em>lv denied </em>6 NY3d 811 [2006]; <em>People v Taylor, </em>300 AD2d 746, 747-748 [2002], <em>lv denied </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>2 NY3d 746 [2004]). Although defendant\u2019s picture is of a different photographic quality than the other photographs, that does not \"draw[ ] the viewer\u2019s attention to that photograph in such a way as to indicate that the police have made a particular selection\u201d <em>(People v Colon, supra </em>at 1115; <em>People v Davis, </em>18 AD3d 1016, 1018 [2005], <em>lv denied </em>5 NY3d 805 [2005]).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">We find no merit in defendant\u2019s contention that his sentence should be modified because it is harsh and excessive. Although defendant\u2019s sentence of incarceration was the lengthiest of the four codefendants, County Court sentenced him within the parameters of his plea bargain, and with the view\u2014supported by the record\u2014that defendant\u2019s conduct in the violent incident was substantial and significant. The imposed sentence of eight years is near the minimum authorized term, and substantially less than the 25 years of incarceration to which the charges of robbery in the first degree, a B violent felony, exposed him (Penal Law \u00a7 70.02 [1] [a]; [3] [a]). Defendant\u2019s efforts to minimize his participation in the incident as well his prior criminal record are unpersuasive. The fact that one of his codefendants received a sentence that is six months shorter than his <em>(see People v Boyd, </em>supra) does not, on this record, persuade us that County Court abused its discretion, and we do not perceive extraordinary circumstances warranting a reduction of the sentence in the interest of justice <em>(see People v Purcell, </em>8 AD3d 821, 822 [2004]; <em>People v Roberts, </em>301 AD2d 756, 757 [2003]; <em>People v Irizarry, </em>289 AD2d 875, 876 [2001]; <em>People v Durrence, </em>244 AD2d 728, 728-729 [1997], <em>lv denied </em>91 NY2d 925 [1998]).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Mercure, J.E, Crew III, Spain and Kane, JJ. concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
