J.</author>\n<p id=\"ais-dedup-0\">These appeals involve the interplay between several statutes with differing and, to some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>degree, divergent goals. The primary question presented is whether the citizen intervention provision of Connecticut\u2019s Environmental Protection Act of 1971 (EPA), General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-14 to 22a-20, may be invoked by a town\u2019s legislative body in the context of judicial review of the denial of applications to secure approval to construct low and moderate income housing as contemplated by Connecticut\u2019s affordable housing statute, when a possible effect of that invocation is to interfere with the town\u2019s delegation of powers to its zoning commission and inland wetlands and watercourses agency under General Statutes \u00a7 8-1 et seq. and the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-28 through 22a-45, respectively. We answer that question in the affirmative and, accordingly, reverse the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The plaintiff in both of these matters, AvalonBay Communities, Inc., sought to construct an apartment complex in the town of Stratford. One fourth of the units in the complex were to be set aside for low and moderate income housing in accordance with Connecticut\u2019s affordable housing statute, General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To that end, the plaintiff applied to the defendant zoning commission of the town of Stratford (zoning commission) for an amendment to the zoning regulations, <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a zone change for the proposed development <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>site<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and approval of a site development plan. Because the proposed development site included a brook and adjacent wetlands, the plaintiff also applied to the defendant inland wetlands and watercourses agency of the town of Stratford (wetlands agency) for a permit to conduct a regulated activity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The zoning commission and the wetlands agency denied the plaintiffs applications, both initially and after the applications had been revised.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The plaintiff thereafter appealed from each entity\u2019s decision to the Superior Court. In the appeal from the zoning commission\u2019s decision, AC 24507, only the zoning commission was named as a defendant; in the appeal from the wetlands agency\u2019s decision, AC 24508, only the wetlands agency was named as a defendant. After the appeals had been pending for more than one year, settlements appeared imminent. At that time, the town of Stratford through its legislative body, the town council (town), filed in each case a verified pleading pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19 (a), the citizen intervention provision of the EPA, claiming, in essence, that the plaintiffs proposed development would have a negative impact on the environment. The plaintiff filed motions to strike those pleadings, and the court, in separate memoranda of decision filed May 9, 2003, granted the plaintiffs motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In the case involving the zoning commission, the court, relying on \u00a7 8-1 et seq. and decisions interpreting those statutes, concluded that the town\u2019s intervention pleading \u201cmust be stricken because the town council <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>is seeking to interfere in a matter committed exclusively to the [zoning] commission and, therefore, is not entitled to the relief it seeks, viz., to become a party to the appeal.\u201d In the case involving the wetlands agency, the court held similarly, analogizing to cases concerning zoning commissions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court did not analyze the scope or effect of \u00a7 22a-19 in either decision, but mentioned it only in passing as the authority pursuant to which the town sought intervention. It is from those decisions that the town now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">On appeal, the town claims, inter alia, that the court improperly struck its verified pleadings because under \u00a7 22a-19 (a), the town may intervene in appeals from decisions of its zoning commission and its wetlands agency without improperly intruding on those entities\u2019 statutorily delegated authority. We agree that \u00a7 22a-19 (a) gives the town the right to intervene in the matters at issue and, consequently, conclude that the court acted improperly when it granted the plaintiffs motions to strike.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">As an initial matter, we note that the plaintiffs appeal from the decision of the zoning commission denying its application proceeded to judgment after the court granted the plaintiffs motion to strike. As such, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>necessary for us to decide if the issue of whether intervention was warranted in that case is moot. \u201cMootness implicates [this] court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction and is thus a threshold matter for us to resolve. ... It is a well-settled general rule that the existence of an actual controversy is an essential requisite to appellate jurisdiction .... When, during the pendency of an appeal, events have occurred that preclude an appellate court from granting any practical relief through its disposition of the merits, a case has become moot.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Sweeney, </em>271 Conn. 193, 201, 856 A.2d 997 (2004). \u201cMost postjudgment appeals filed by would-be intervenors will be moot because the relief sought, i.e., intervention into the underlying action, cannot be granted once the action has gone to judgment.\u201d <em>Wallingford Center Associates </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>68 Conn. App. 803, 806 n.3, 793 A.2d 260 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">\u201cNevertheless, an otherwise moot question may qualify for review under the \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review\u2019 exception. This exception permits review if other actions in the future (1) will encounter similar time constraints precluding appellate review, (2) will affect a group of similar complainants for whom this litigant may reasonably serve as a surrogate and (3) will similarly raise a question of public importance.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mordasky, </em>84 Conn. App. 436, 442, 853 A.2d 626 (2004). In cases such as this, when a party is denied the right to intervene, there is a substantial likelihood that the underlying matter will go forward and conclude before an appeal can be filed and decided.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Further<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>more, the town here is a reasonable surrogate for other municipalities that may want to invoke \u00a7 22a-19 (a) in the future to raise environmental concerns in proceedings before their land use agencies. Finally, in light of the policy concerns underlying the EPA and its aim of enabling broad citizen participation in matters that could impact the environment negatively,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the question of whether the EPA\u2019s intervention provision applies in the present context undoubtedly raises a question of public importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">We now turn to the merits of the appeals. The question of whether \u00a7 22a-19 (a), read in conjunction with \u00a7 8-1 et seq. and the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act, permits the town to intervene in appeals from decisions of its zoning commission and wetlands agency presents an issue of statutory construction over which our review is plenary.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Stauton </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>271 Conn. 152, 158, 856 A.2d 400 (2004). In undertaking our review, we are cognizant of the rule that \u201c[t]he meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratex-tual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered. Public Acts 2003, No. 03-154, \u00a7 1.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lutters, </em>270 Conn. 198, 205, 853 A.2d 434 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">If, however, application to the facts at hand of the plain language of the statute at issue and related provisions produces absurd or unworkable results, a court may look further in aid of its interpretation. In so doing, \u201cwe seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute [s] [themselves], to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding [their] enactment, to the legislative policy [they were] designed to implement, and to [their] relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 577, 816 A.2d 562 (2003).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>270 Conn. 665, 686, 855 A.2d 212 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">That the EPA was intended to grant wide access to the state\u2019s various tribunals in order to protect the environment is evidenced by the EPA\u2019s declaration of policy, which provides in relevant part that \u201cit is in the public interest to provide <em>all persons </em>with an adequate remedy to protect the air, water and other natural resources [of the state] from unreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 22a-15. In support of that goal, \u00a7 22a-19 (a) on its face clearly conveys broad rights of intervention. It provides that \u201c[i]n any administrative, licensing or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>other proceeding, and in any judicial review thereof made available by law, the Attorney General, any political subdivision of the state, any instrumentality or agency of the state or of a political subdivision thereof, any person, partnership, corporation, association, organization or other legal entity may intervene as a party on the filing of a verified pleading asserting that the proceeding or action for judicial review involves conduct which has, or which is reasonably likely to have, the effect of unreasonably polluting, impairing or destroying the public trust in the air, water or other natural resources of the state.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19 (a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> By its plain language, the provision would appear to encompass the intervention sought by the town here, insofar as the town is a political subdivision of the state<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (and its town council, an instrumentality thereof) and, through its filing of verified pleadings, the town wanted to intervene in the judicial review of two administrative proceedings.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nevertheless, as illustrated by the facts at hand, the resultant situation is to some degree unworkable and at least arguably absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Specifically, the result of allowing the town to intervene in appeals from its zoning commission and wet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>lands agency is, effectively, to permit the town to thwart those agencies\u2019 efforts to resolve the appeals through negotiated settlement. See <em>Ralto Developers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Environmental Impact Commission, </em>220 Conn. 54, 58, 594 A.2d 981 (1991) (General Statutes \u00a7 22a-43 [c] \u201crequires the consent of all parties to an appeal before the court may approve a settlement withdrawing an appeal from a decision of an inland wetlands agency when the settlement agreement modifies the decision of that agency\u201d); <em>Dietzel </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>60 Conn. App. 153, 160, 758 A.2d 906 (2000) (\u201c \u2018All of the parties must consent to a stipulated judgment in a land use appeal made pursuant to [General Statutes \u00a7] 8-8 [n] or [\u00a7] 22a-43 [c] of the General Statutes. The same statutes may also be construed as preventing settlement of appeals without the consent of persons who intervene under section 22a-19 for the limited purpose of raising environmental issues.\u2019 \u201d Quoting R. Fuller, 9A Connecticut Practice Series: Land Use Law and Practice [2d Ed. 1999] \u00a7 32.6, p. 131.). The court here in each of its memoranda of decision found, on the basis of statements made by the town\u2019s counsel at oral argument, that this was in fact the town\u2019s motivation in seeking to intervene in the two appeals. As noted by the court, intervention would give the town veto power over settlements that the zoning commission and wetlands agency believed met the needs of the town, including the need to protect the town\u2019s inland wetlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The situation is anomalous because it amounts to the town\u2019s taking a position before the court that is in opposition to the positions advocated by the town\u2019s proxies, the zoning commission and wetlands agency. Pursuant to the statutes under which they were created, the zoning commission and the wetlands agency are the town\u2019s representatives, acting on its behalf when carrying out the tasks within their respective purviews. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-1 (a) (\u201c[a]ny municipality may, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>by vote of its legislative body, adopt the provisions of [chapter 124 of the General Statutes governing zoning] and exercise <em>through a zoning commission </em>the powers granted hereunder\u201d [emphasis added]); <em>Rommell </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>127 Conn. 16, 21, 15 A.2d 6 (1940) (stating that zoning entities \u201chave ordinarily no corporate existence as such but are merely agencies of the municipality\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42 (c) (\u201c[E]ach municipality shall establish an inlands wetlands agency or authorize an existing board or commission to carry out the provisions of [the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act] .... [T]he board or commission authorized by the municipality . . . shall serve as <em>the sole agent </em>for the licensing <em>of </em>regulated activities.\u201d [Emphasis added.]). Because strict application of \u00a7 22a-19 (a) here leads to the unusual circumstance of the town\u2019s being able to veto settlements reached by its agents and relating to matters that have been statutorily delegated to those agents, we will look further to extratextual sources to determine whether such application was intended by the legislature. \u201cWhere the words of a statute fail to indicate clearly whether the provision applies in certain circumstances, it must be construed by this court . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Keeney </em>v. <em>Fairfield Resources, Inc., </em>41 Conn. App. 120, 134, 674 A.2d 1349 (1996), quoting <em>Carolhers </em>v. <em>Capozziello, </em>215 Conn. 82, 120, 574 A.2d 1268 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Cases interpreting the EPA explain the problem it was intended to address and the role of \u00a7 22a-19 (a) in its resolution. \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 22a-19 (a) is part of the Environmental Protection Act (EPA). General Statutes \u00a7 22a-14 et seq. The purpose of the EPA is to give private citizens a voice in ensuring that the air, water and other natural resources of the state remain protected, preserved and enhanced, and to provide them with an adequate remedy to protect the air, water and other natural resources from unreasonable pollution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>impairment or destruction. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-15.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Red Hill Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>212 Conn. 710, 715, 563 A.2d 1339 (1989), quoting <em>Connecticut Water Co. </em>v. <em>Beausoleil, </em>204 Conn. 38, 44, 526 A.2d 1329 (1987). Accordingly, the EPA \u201cexpands the class of plaintiffs who are empowered to institute proceedings to vindicate the public interest.\u201d <em>Manchester Environmental Coalition </em>v. <em>Stockton, </em>184 Conn. 51, 55-56, 441 A.2d 68 (1981). \u201cStatutes such as the EPA axe remedial in nature and should be liberally construed to accomplish their purpose.\u201d Id., 57; see also <em>Keeney </em>v. <em>Fairfield Resources, Inc., </em>supra, 41 Conn. App. 132-33 (\u201c[environmental statutes, such as our EPA, of which \u00a7 22a-19 [a] is now a part, are considered remedial in nature and are to be construed liberally to accomplish their purpose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Prior to enactment of the EPA, \u201c[standing had been a hurdle to be overcome regardless of the integrity of motives.\u201d H. Johnson, \u201cThe Environmental Protection Act of 1971,\u201d 46 Conn. B.J. 422, 424 (1972). \u201cTraditionally, citizens seeking to protect the environment were required to show specific, personal aggrievement to attain standing to bring a legal action. . . . The [EPA], however, waives the aggrievement requirement in two circumstances. First, any private party, including a municipality, without first having to establish aggrievement, may seek injunctive relief in court \u2018for the protection of the public trust in the air, water and other natural resources of the state from unreasonable pollution, impairment or destruction . . . .\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 22a-16. Second, any person or other entity, without first having to establish aggrievement, may intervene in any administrative proceeding challenging \u2018conduct which has, or which is reasonably likely to have, the effect of unreasonably polluting, impairing or destroying the public trust in the air, water or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>natural resources of the state.\u2019 General Statutes \u00a7 22a-19 (a).\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Fish Unlimited </em>v. <em>Northeast Utilities Service Co., </em>254 Conn. 21, 31, 755 A.2d 860 (2000), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>Waterbury </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>260 Conn. 506, 545, 800 A.2d 1102 (2002). Thus, \u201c[u]nder [the EPA], standing no longer remains a problem, and the public interest may be presented without proof of direct, personal injury to the plaintiff.\u201d H. Johnson, supra, 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Our research has not disclosed any appellate decision barring a party from intervening on the basis of that party\u2019s identity not being encompassed by the broad language of \u00a7 22a-19 (a) or finding that the prospective intervenor somehow was not part of the public on which standing was intended to be conferred.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Rather, the cases seem to indicate that the statute, in that regard, contains no qualifications. See <em>Fort Trumbull Conservancy, LLC </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>266 Conn. 338, 360-61, 832 A.2d 611 (2003) (stating that \u201c\u00a7 22a-19 [a] on its face is extremely broad regarding the parties who may intervene\u201d); <em>Red Hill Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 716 (\u201c\u00a7 22a-19 [a] allows any person to intervene to raise environmental issues in an existing judicial review of an agency action\u201d); <em>Manchester Environmental Coalition </em>v. <em>Stockton, </em>supra, 184 Conn. 57 (\u201c[standing is automatically granted under the EPA to \u2018any person\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Additionally, \u00a7 22a-19 (a) \u201cplainly provides that intervention is authorized in <em>any </em>administrative, licensing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>or other proceeding, and in any judicial review thereof made available by law. . . . Proceedings before planning and zoning commissions are classified as administrative.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Red Hill Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 733. It is clear that hearings before zoning commissions and wetlands agencies, and appeals from the resulting decisions of those entities are the types of proceedings encompassed by \u00a7 22a-19 (a). See, <em>e.g., Pathways, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>259 Conn. 619, 793 A.2d 222 (2002) (intervention in appeal from planning and zoning commission decision); <em>Queach Corp. </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>258 Conn. 178, 779 A.2d 134 (2001) (intervention in appeal from wetlands agency decision); <em>Quarry Knoll II Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>256 Conn. 674, 780 A.2d 1 (2001) (intervention in proceedings before planning and zoning commission); <em>Branhaven Plaza, LLC </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>251 Conn. 269, 740 A.2d 847 (1999) (intervention in proceedings before wetlands agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Although the precise dynamic of the present case, a municipality intervening in appeals from its agencies\u2019 decisions, does not appear to have been specifically contemplated by the General Assembly during the debates leading to the passage of the EPA, the legislative history indicates that the classes of eligible intervenors and administrative proceedings were intended to be all inclusive. Describing \u00a7 3 of the EPA, now codified at General Statutes \u00a7 22a-16, which confers standing to bring actions for declaratory and injunctive relief to protect the environment, Senator Stanley J. Pac stated that \u201cit confers the right of <em>each and every one of us, </em>the Attorney General, <em>political subdivisions </em>to bring a suit . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) 14 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1971 Sess., p. 1091, remarks of Senator Stanley J. Pac. Later, remarking on \u00a7 6 of the EPA, now General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>\u00a7 22a-19, he stated that <em>\u201cin all the administrative and licensing procedures and any Judicial [re]view, any of the parties previously mentioned, </em>may intervene.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 14 S. Proc., supra, p. 1092.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">Additionally, in the proceedings of the House of Representatives, Representative Francis W. Ciampi characterized the bill that became the EPA as \u201cgiv[ing] <em>anyone, </em>including the state [and] <em>its </em>subdivision[s] and any person or other legal [entity] a cause of action in [a] court of law <em>against anyone else </em>including the state or any of its subdivisions or any other person or other [legal] entity who unreasonably pollutes the environment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 14 H.R. Proc., Pt. 2, 1971 Sess., pp. 736-37, remarks of Representative Francis W. Ciampi. According to Representative Howard A. Newman, \u201c[t]he bill will permit, will entitle an individual or <em>a group </em>to seek redress . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., p. 746, remarks of Representative Howard A. Newman. Representative Robert D. King described the bill as \u201can act which would [ejmpower individuals, <em>groups and organizations </em>or combinations of these to go into court and attempt to stop what they perceive to be an abuse of the environment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., p. 747, remarks of Representative Robert D. King. Representative Abijah U. Fox characterized the bill as \u201callowing] <em>anyone </em>to go into court . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., p. 760, remarks of Representative Abijah U. Fox. Contemporaneous commentary was in accord, describing the recently passed legislation as creating standing for anyone against anyone. See H. Johnson, supra, 427 (\u201c[t]he [EPA], in essence, provides that any person, group, corporation, or public official may sue anyone, including government officials, in order to protect the environment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">On the basis of the foregoing, it is difficult to conclude that the legislature intended any implicit exceptions to be read into the class of eligible intervenors contem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>plated by \u00a7 22a-19 (a) for any of the contemplated proceedings, including appeals from municipal land use decisions. That is all the more likely due to the fact that there is nothing explicit in the statutes governing zoning appeals; General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 et seq.; or those governing wetlands appeals; General Statutes \u00a7 22a-43 et seq.; that bars municipalities from participating therein.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he legislature is presumed to have acted with knowledge of existing statutes and with an intent to create one consistent body of laws.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>St. George </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>264 Conn. 538, 553, 825 A.2d 90 (2003). Furthermore, pertinent case law, some of which preceded passage of the EPA, indicates that there is no court fashioned rule barring municipalities from participating in appeals brought from decisions of their land use agencies. Rather, the cases indicate that such participation is altogether proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In <em>Rommell </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>supra, 127 Conn. 21, a case in which our Supreme Court considered who the proper parties were in appeals from administrative decisions, the court, in passing, noted the need for the public interest to be represented in certain matters and stated that \u201c[i]n appeals in zoning cases the municipality might no doubt properly do this.\u201d While holding that zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>and other boards also typically were proper defendants in appeals from their own decisions, the court nevertheless allowed that \u201c[t]he municipality in the case of municipal boards may no doubt intervene as the principal representing the public interests concerned.\u201d Id., 23. That holding was reiterated eighteen years later in <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>145 Conn. 655, 658, 145 A.2d 832 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">More recently, in a case interpreting a statutory provision governing service of process in zoning appeals, our Supreme Court discussed cases recognizing municipalities\u2019 interests in the validity and enforcement of their zoning regulations, and again indicated that they were proper parties in zoning appeals. See <em>Simko </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>206 Conn. 374, 380-83, 538 A.2d 202 (1988).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As stated by the court, \u201cthe interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>of the municipality in a zoning appeal may not always coincide with those of the zoning board.\u201d Id., 381-82.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Subsequently, in <em>DeRito </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>18 Conn. App. 99, 556 A.2d 632 (1989), this court found it unnecessary to resolve the potentially jurisdictional question of whether a town\u2019s building official had standing to appeal from a decision of the town\u2019s zoning board of appeals insofar as the town itself also was a party plaintiff whose standing the defendants did not contest. We stated then, citing <em>Simko </em>and <em>Tyler, </em>that \u201cit is now settled that [t]he municipality concerned is always entitled to represent such [public] interests by participating as a party to an appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The plaintiff concedes that those cases stand for the proposition that a municipality may participate in a zoning appeal, but it contends nevertheless that this is so only under certain circumstances, for example, when the municipality itself is an adjoining property owner or a permit applicant, i.e., when it has a direct interest in the outcome of the appeal. According to the plaintiff, the provisions of \u00a7 8-1 et seq., by implication, operate to bar a municipality from intervening in a zoning appeal when the effect of that intervention is \u201cto revoke, undermine or interfere with its delegation [of functions to a zoning commission] under \u00a7 8-1,\u201d specifically, the functions of \u201cadopting regulations, deciding permit applications and settling lawsuits involving permits.\u201d It claims that allowing \u201cintervention by a town council in order to interfere with a previously delegated zoning function would in effect repeal \u00a7 8-1 and grant an impermissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>veto to the town council over the zoning commission\u2019s actions.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The plaintiff cites the cases relied on by the court in its memoranda of decision to support that proposition. We disagree with each of the plaintiff\u2019s points and find the cases cited by the court to be inap-posite.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">First, <em>Rommell, Tyler, Simko </em>and <em>DeRito </em>did not involve municipalities as adjoining property owners or permit applicants. Moreover, nothing about the language used by the courts in those decisions suggests that municipalities\u2019 rights to participate in appeals should be limited to those circumstances. Rather, the statements regarding municipalities\u2019 rights to participate were unqualified. Regardless, there would never be a need for a municipality to seek intervention were it a permit applicant or adjoining property owner, as it would have direct standing to bring the appeal itself as an \u201caggrieved person\u201d under \u00a7 8-8 (a) (l).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Second, the plaintiff has not cited, nor has our research disclosed, any authority for the proposition that the functions of settling zoning and wetlands appeals are ones exclusively delegated to the zoning commission and wetlands agency, respectively, through operation of \u00a7\u00a7 8-1 and 22a-42. The statutes are silent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>in that regard, in contrast to the explicit assignment of authority to the zoning commission to establish, change or repeal zoning regulations; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-2, 8-3 (b); to make zone changes; see General Statutes \u00a7 8-3 (b); and to approve site plans; see General Statutes \u00a7 8-3 (g); and to the wetlands agency to promulgate regulations; see General Statutes \u00a7 22-42a (a); and to issue permits. See General Statutes \u00a7 22-42a (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">In any event, the function of settling appeals, unlike those functions previously enumerated, is not really one that lends itself to exclusivity. To effectuate a settlement, the agreement of <em>all </em>parties to an appeal is required; see <em>Ralto Developers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Environmental Impact Commission, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 58; <em>Dietzel </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>supra, 60 Conn. App. 160; as well as final court approval. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (n) (\u201c[n]o [zoning] appeal . . . shall be withdrawn and no settlement between the parties to any such appeal shall be effective unless and until a hearing has been held before the Superior Court and such court has approved such proposed withdrawal or settlement\u201d); General Statutes \u00a7 22a-43 (d) (providing similarly regarding settlements of appeals from decisions of wetlands agencies). Additionally, it is difficult to view an intervening municipality\u2019s refusal to agree to a settlement as an improper usurpation of an agency\u2019s power when any other intervening party (for example, a concerned citizen or a public interest group) would be able to block a settlement in precisely the same manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Third, the cases relied on by the court, and by the plaintiff on appeal, are distinguishable. That is because each case concerned a function explicitly delegated by statute to a zoning commission, and a legislative body\u2019s direct and final override of the commission\u2019s action, and, further, one involved a regulatory mechanism that necessarily would lead in each instance to improper usurpation of the agency\u2019s delegated authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>In <em>State ex rel. Bezzini </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>133 Conn. 592, 594, 53 A.2d 299 (1947), the town\u2019s zoning commission adopted zoning regulations for a portion of the town, which thereafter were repealed by a vote at an adjourned town meeting. The court held that the vote was ineffective to repeal the zoning regulations because the town meeting lacked the power to repeal or to prevent enforcement of regulations, a function explicitly delegated to the zoning commission under the zoning statutes. Id., 596. In <em>Olson </em>v. <em>Avon, </em>143 Conn. 448, 456, 123 A.2d 279 (1956), the court held invalid a provision in the town zoning regulations requiring approval by a majority vote at a town meeting of any amendment to the zoning regulations before that amendment could become effective. The court cited a clear \u201clegislative intent ... to vest the power both to enact and to change zoning regulations and zone boundaries exclusively in [town] zoning commissions\u201d and concluded that \u201cany attempt by a zoning commission to delegate the powers so vested in it to a town meeting is violative of the statute.\u201d Id., 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Thus, in both <em>Olson </em>and <em>State ex rel. Bezzini, </em>the towns\u2019 legislative bodies improperly had been afforded the final say on the amendment or repeal of zoning regulations, a matter exclusively committed to zoning commissions by \u00a7 8-3. Additionally, in <em>Olson, </em>the improper exercise of power by the town meeting actually was required by the town\u2019s regulatory procedure; <em>Olsons. Avon, </em>supra, 143 Conn. 449; ensuring that illegal delegation of authority would occur each and every time the zoning commission sought to amend a regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The plaintiff claims that the end result of allowing the town to intervene in appeals is \u201cprecisely the same \u2014 a municipal legislative body acting as the final arbiter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>a zoning permit, rather than the zoning commission.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We disagree. As noted previously, it is the court that has the final say over any proposed settlement, not the parties. Moreover, intervention, when it does prevent settlement, may affect the course and length of an appeal, but it does not result in the intervenor\u2019s being the ultimate decision maker as to, e.g., the permit or regulatory change sought. In fact, it is the court that is the final arbiter in a zoning appeal. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 <em>(J) (\u201c[t]he court, </em>after a hearing thereon, may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify or revise the decision appealed from\u201d [emphasis added]).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> As well stated by the plaintiff in its briefs, \u00a7 22a-19 simply <em>\u201cdoes not </em>provide or imply that the intervening party becomes the decision maker with respect to environmental issues.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Instead, the municipality, like any other intervening party, merely is permitted to be heard on matters pertaining to the environment. Municipal input or advice on matters committed to an agency does not amount to illegal encroachment on that agency\u2019s authority. Cf. <em>Forest Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>155 Conn. 669, 678, 236 A.2d 917 (1967) (holding commission\u2019s submission of proposed road specifications to town selectmen for approval not improper delegation of authority because commission ultimately would make final decision after receiving selectmen\u2019s report).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">In sum, the court declines the plaintiffs invitation to read an exception into \u00a7 22a-19 (a) when there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>indication that such was intended or is necessary. \u201cAbsent such language by the legislature, this court cannot engraft amendments into the statutory language. ... As [our Supreme Court has] stated in numerous other cases, it is not the province of a court to supply what the legislature chose to omit. The legislature is supreme in the area of legislation, and the courts must apply statutory enactments according to their plain terms.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Red Hill Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Furthermore, \u201c[t]he legislature is always presumed to be aware of all existing statutes and the effect that its action or nonaction will have on any of them\u201d; <em>Wiseman </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>269 Conn. 802, 822, 850 A.2d 114 (2004); and it also is presumed to be aware of existing judicial interpretations of those statutes. <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrissette, </em>265 Conn. 658, 668, 830 A.2d 704 (2003). Accordingly, we presume that the legislature, when drafting the EPA, was aware of the statutes defining the purview of municipal land use agencies and governing appeals therefrom, and of the courts\u2019 interpretation of those statutes. If it had wanted to bar municipalities from utilizing \u00a7 22a-19 (a) to intervene in appeals from decisions of their land use agencies, it would have so said.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The judgments are reversed and the case involving the wetlands agency is remanded for further proceedings in which the town council shall be permitted to intervene.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">In this opinion DRANGINIS, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g defines a set-aside development as one in which a portion of the dwelling units \u201cwill be conveyed by deeds containing covenants or restrictions which shall require that, for at least forty years after the initial occupation of the proposed development, such dwelling units shall be sold or rented at, or below, prices which will preserve the units as housing for which persons and families pay thirty per cent or less of their annual income, where such income is less than or equal to eighty per cent of the median income. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (a) (6).

This court notes that those arguments were not raised in the trial court and, therefore, we are not bound to address them on appeal. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.

Public Acts 1988, No. 88-79, \u00a7 1. Nothing in the legislative history of that amendment suggests, however, an intent that municipalities be barred from participating in zoning appeals. Rather, the legislature disagreed with the <em>Simko </em>court\u2019s holding that the clerk of a municipality was an indispensable party whose absence from an appeal created a jurisdictional defect. See <em>Conn. </em>Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Planning and Development, Pt. 1, 1988 Sess., pp. 6-20, 22-23, 28-31, 32-42, 44. As stated by Vincent M.
