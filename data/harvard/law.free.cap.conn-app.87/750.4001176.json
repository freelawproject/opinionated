He claims that the filing of an amended information without his consent after trial commenced violated his due process right to notice because the charged offenses are not lesser offenses included within robbery in the first degree and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree, as alleged in the original information. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On September 11, 2002, Adam McCleery, Justin Miller and Steve Amaro arrived at a parking lot on the comer of Farmington Avenue and Kenyon Street in Hartford. As they exited their vehicle, two men passed them. Turning abruptly, the two men pulled the hoods of their sweatshirts over their heads and approached. As one of the men applied a choke hold on McCleery, the other placed a handgun<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against his head. They demanded money, and McCleery acquiesced, relinquishing his wallet. The assailants fled to their vehicle and drove away. Amaro identified both the vehicle make and license plate number. The police were notified. The defendant subsequently was identified as an assailant and charged with three counts of robbeiy in the first degree in violation of subdivisions (2), (3) and (4) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and with one count of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 (a) and 53a-134 (a) (2), (3) and (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">A jury trial commenced on July 14, 2003. After presenting its case, the state informed the court that an expert had confirmed that the pistol was inoperable. Consequently, the court ruled that the pistol was not a deadly weapon and that the state had failed to prove that the pistol was used as a dangerous instrument. It accordingly rendered a judgment of acquittal as to the first two robbery counts. When the defendant moved to dismiss the third robbery count, the court declined: \u201cOh, I\u2019m certainly not going to dismiss the count. . . . [The court will] preclude the state from proceeding on robbery one. I\u2019ll charge robbery two on the third count.\u201d Thereafter, the court permitted the state to file an amended information that alleged one count of robbery in the second degree and one count of conspiracy to commit robbery in the second degree. The jury found the defendant guilty on both counts, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">The defendant claims that the filing of an amended information without his consent after trial commenced violated his due process right to notice because the charged offenses are not lesser offenses included within robbery in the first degree and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree, as alleged in the original information. The defendant did not preserve his claim before the trial court and now requests review under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We review his claim because the record is adequate for review and the claim is of constitutional dimension.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">The sole question before us is whether \u00a7 53a-135 (a) (2) is a lesser offense included within \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cUnless the original and the amended informations charge the defendant with the same crime . . . amendment is permissible only to charge a lesser included offense.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kitt, </em>8 Conn. App. 478, 486, 513 A.2d 731, cert, denied, 202 Conn. 801, 518 A.2d 648 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim is governed by our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>71 Conn. App. 865, 877, 804 A.2d 937, cert, denied, 261 Conn. 942, 808 A.2d 1136 (2002), in which we explained that \u201c\u00a7\u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) and 53a-135 (a) (2) contain the same elements. The only difference between them in this case is whether the defendant proved that the weapon was inoperable.\u201d The defendant in <em>Ortiz </em>was charged with robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4). As in the present case, evidence was introduced during the trial in <em>Ortiz </em>indicating that the firearm was inoperable. Id., 869. The <em>Ortiz </em>court concluded: \u201cGiven the uncon-troverted evidence of inoperability ... it was plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>error for the court not to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of robbery in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-135 (a) (2).\u201d Id., 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">In the present case, the state belatedly submitted evidence that the pistol was inoperable after trial had commenced. The court immediately rendered a judgment of acquittal as to the first two counts of robbery in the first degree, but refused to dismiss the third count that alleged a violation of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4). Rather, it permitted the state to file an amended information charging the defendant with robbery in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-135 (a) (2), and conspiracy to commit robbery in the second degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 (a) and 53a-135 (a) (2). Because such amendment charged lesser offenses included within the offenses that were charged in the original information, no due process violation arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-7\"> It was later discovered that the handgun was a BB pistol.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b784-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when ... he or another participant in the crime ...
