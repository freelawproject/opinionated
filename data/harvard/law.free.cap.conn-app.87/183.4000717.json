We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">The juiy reasonably could have found the following facts. On December 24, 2001, the victim was thirteen years old. She lived in New Haven with her mother, an older sister and a younger brother. Her father, the defendant, was divorced from the victim\u2019s mother and lived in New London. The defendant routinely spent time with the victim away from her home and, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>December 24, 2001, drove her and her brother to his apartment, where they stayed the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Sometime during the night, the victim, who was asleep on a sofa in the defendant\u2019s living room, awoke to discover the defendant touching her. The victim attempted to push the defendant away, but he did not leave her alone. The defendant pulled the victim\u2019s pants down and performed cunnilingus on her.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The victim kicked and struck the defendant in an effort to resist his assault. The defendant told the victim not to tell anyone what he had done. The defendant told the victim that she did not \u201cwant him to go to jail.\u201d As a result of the defendant\u2019s actions, the victim sustained, among other injuries, bruises on her legs. The defendant drove the victim and her brother home on December 25,2001, and the victim reported the incident to her older sister and to her mother. The victim sought medical assistance at Yale-New Haven Hospital, where medical personnel examined her. The victim thereafter reported the incident to the New London police. The defendant\u2019s arrest followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">The defendant first claims that prosecutorial misconduct deprived him of a fair trial. The defendant concedes that he did not preserve his claim at trial. He argues that appellate review is warranted under (1) the plain error doctrine, codified in Practice Book \u00a7 60-5, (2) the doctrine enunciated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), or (3) the exercise of our supervisory powers. We will review the claim following the analytic approach set forth by our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>269 Conn. 563, 572-73, 849 A.2d 626 (2004). In <em>Stevenson, </em>our Supreme Court enunciated a new analytical approach to reviewing unpreseived claims of prosecutorial misconduct. The court held that \u201cfollowing a determination that prosecutorial misconduct has occurred, regar dless of whether it was objected to, an appellate court must apply the . . . factors [set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987)] to the entire trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 575. The defendant\u2019s claim is based on arguments advanced by the prosecutor during closing argument. Before we review the challenged remarks, we set forth our standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Prosecutorial misconduct claims invoke a two step analysis. First, the reviewing court must determine whether the challenged conduct did, in fact, constitute misconduct. Second, if misconduct occurred, the reviewing court must then determine if the defendant has demonstrated substantial prejudice. <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>259 Conn. 693, 699, 793 A.2d 226 (2002). \u201cIn order to demonstrate this, the defendant must establish that the trial as a whole was fundamentally unfair and that the misconduct so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due process.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 699-700.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">\u201cIn determining whether prosecutorial misconduct was so serious as to amount to a denial of due process [a reviewing court should focus] on several factors. Among them are the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense conduct or argument . . . the severity of the misconduct . . . the frequency of the misconduct . . . the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case . . . the strength of the curative measures adopted . . . and the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 540. Additionally, a reviewing court must consider whether the defendant objected, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>requested a curative instruction to the jury or moved for a mistrial on the basis of the misconduct. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>85 Conn. App. 563, 574-75, 858 A.2d 792, cert, granted on other grounds, 272 Conn. 906, 863 A.2d 699 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The defendant claims that the prosecutor committed misconduct in that she expressed her personal opinion concerning the victim\u2019s credibility. The remarks of which the defendant complains follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">During her closing argument, the prosecutor discussed the charges against the defendant and then argued in relevant part as follows: \u201cIf you accept [the victim\u2019s] testimony beyond a reasonable doubt, you will find that the state has proven these charges. The elements are really not what\u2019s at issue here. What\u2019s at issue here is credibility. This is a credibility case. It\u2019s all about whose testimony you accept and whether you accept it beyond a reasonable doubt. The state\u2019s case rests squarely on the shoulders of [the victim], and that\u2019s really not a bad place to start, from the state\u2019s point of view. [The victim] is a fourteen year old girl from New Haven, comes here to a strange court in Norwich and under oath \u2014 not a small thing \u2014 under oath testifies that [the defendant] had intercourse with her during a Christmas visit in 2001 in the city of New London. That\u2019s not an easy thing to do. That\u2019s not a pleasant thing to do. I can think of, and I know you can think of, many other things a fourteen year old girl would [want] to do on any given day. So, that\u2019s the starting point.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">\u201cAdd to that the fact that her testimony has what we refer to as hallmarks of credibility, which is just a fancy way of saying that within that testimony, there are many signs of truthfulness, many signs of reliability. And I\u2019m going over some of those with you, and I\u2019d ask you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>to consider them when you think about [the victim\u2019s] testimony. The first thing I\u2019d ask you to think about is consistency. [The victim] has been consistent from the very first day she returned to her mother\u2019s home and indicated that her father had sexually assaulted her. She has always said that the sexual assault consisted of a brief moment where he put his mouth on her vagina and a second encounter, moments later, where he inserted his penis into her vagina, very minimally, she says, very minimally, but that would be enough under our statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\u201cShe has been consistent in her interviews then with Florence Mackey.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She has been consistent in her interview with Janet Murphy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She has been consistent here in court. She said [that] those are the things that happened. She didn\u2019t add to them. She didn\u2019t include one type of sexual contact in one interview and then have another type in a different, interview. She was consistent and clear on the [witness] stand. She never pretended to remember things she didn\u2019t remember, and so I\u2019d ask you to consider that consistency when you think about her testimony. And I\u2019m going to really ask you to think about it when you compare it to the defendant\u2019s testimony . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The prosecutor later argued as follows: \u201cAnother important thing, I think, when you think about her testimony, is that there was no exaggeration. [The victim] didn\u2019t pretend to remember things if she didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t claim to know what ejaculation was. She just said she didn\u2019t feel any wetness on her in the incident. She didn\u2019t say he had penetrated her for a long amount of time very deeply. She just described what happened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>to her. She didn\u2019t try to fill in the blanks.\u201d The prosecutor also argued: \u201c[The victim] is an accurate reporter. She is a reporter without any motivation. She is a reporter without an agenda, and she\u2019s a reporter with absolutely nothing to gain here at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The defendant argues that the prosecutor expressed her personal opinion concerning the victim\u2019s credibility. The law circumscribes the prosecutor\u2019s leeway in commenting on the credibility of witnesses. \u201cIt is well settled that [a] prosecutor may not express his own opinion, either directly or indirectly, as to the credibility of witnesses .... Such expressions of personal opinion are a form of unsworn and unchecked testimony. . . . These expressions of opinion are particularly difficult for the jury to ignore because of the special position held by the prosecutor. . . . The jury is aware that he has prepared and presented the case and consequently, may have access to matters not in evidence . . . which the jury may infer to have precipitated the personal opinions. . . . The prosecutor may, however, argue to the jury that the <em>evidence </em>and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom should lead the jury to a conclusion as to the credibility of witnesses.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>70 Conn. App. 255, 287, 797 A.2d 616, cert, denied, 261 Conn. 919, 806 A.2d 1056 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Having reviewed the challenged remarks, we conclude that they do not constitute prosecutorial misconduct. It was not improper for the prosecutor to argue that her case rested on the victim\u2019s testimony and to comment on the strength of that testimony. The issue is whether the prosecutor injected a personal opinion about the victim\u2019s credibility into the argument or if the argument was grounded in a discussion of the evidence presented at trial. Here, the argument reflects that the prosecutor discussed the victim\u2019s credibility by inviting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>the jury to consider \u201csigns\u201d of truthfulness and reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The prosecutor clearly argued that the victim was consistent, that she did not exaggerate her account of what had occurred, that she was \u201can accurate reporter\u201d and that she had \u201cnothing to gain\u201d from testifying. The prosecutor argued that the victim\u2019s testimony had \u201challmarks of credibility,\u201d but she did not cross the line into improper argument by stating that she believed that the victim had testified truthfully. The prosecutor couched her argument in terms of suggesting how the jury might evaluate the victim\u2019s testimony and did not personally guarantee the victim\u2019s credibility or imply that she had knowledge of the victim\u2019s credibility outside of the record. For those reasons, we reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor improperly commented on the victim\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">The defendant claims that the prosecutor committed misconduct during her closing argument by referring to facts that were not in evidence. The claim is based on the prosecutor\u2019s reference to a letter received by the defendant from the department of children and families (department) concerning the allegation of sexual abuse by the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">The record reflects that the defendant testified at trial concerning the statement that he gave to Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Robert Pickett of the New London police department subsequent to being arrested in February, 2002. The statement was the topic of examination by both the defense and the state. It suffices to state that the prosecutor attempted to demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s statement was inaccurate and inconsistent. During direct examination, the defendant testified concerning the circumstances under which he gave the statement to the police. Specifically, he testified that he was nervous and that he did not have a \u201cclue\u201d about the nature of the charges against him. The defendant testified that he had \u201cno idea\u201d that the victim was going to accuse him of any crime. On cross-examination by the state, the defendant testified that he had, in fact, \u201cheard about\u201d the allegation that the victim had been abused, albeit not by him, from his former wife and the department. The prosecutor inquired about the defendant\u2019s assertion that he had learned about the incident from the department. The defendant testified that before his arrest, the department had sent him a letter concerning the incident with the victim. The letter set forth findings related to the incident, and the defendant testified that he took steps to appeal from the findings made by the department. Following that testimony, the defendant reiterated his previous testimony that at the time of his arrest, he had \u201cno idea\u201d what the basis was for his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The defendant later testified during cross-examination by the state that the letter he had received from the department stated that an allegation of child abuse had been substantiated against him. The defendant testified that the letter indicated that the allegation of child abuse concerned the victim. He testified that he brought the letter to his probation officer and took steps in the presence of his probation officer to appeal from the department\u2019s findings. The defendant reiterated that despite having received this letter from the department, he was confused about the charges against him at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>time of his arrest and that this confusion helped explain aspects of his statement that were inaccurate or inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">During her closing argument, the prosecutor argued that the defendant\u2019s assertion that he \u201chad no idea what he was being charged with\u201d was \u201cridiculous.\u201d The prosecutor sought to discredit the defendant\u2019s testimony in that regard by discussing evidence that he knew about the allegation of sexual abuse against him from both his former wife and from the department\u2019s letter. The prosecutor argued in relevant part: \u201cHe receives a letter from the department of children and families telling him he has been substantiated as a perpetrator of sexual abuse and that he has the right to appeal, and he takes that to his probation officer and he elects to appeal. He \u2014 and this all happens before Officer Pickett comes to him. And he still wants you to believe that when Officer Pickett came to him, it was an absolute surprise that he was being charged with something that occurred that Christmas Eve, that he was being charged with a sexual assault. That is not believable.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">\u201c[The defendant] has some familiarity with the criminal justice system. He knew enough to appeal that finding [by the department]. He knew that whatever \u2014 and substantiation is a word that is not always used in daily life. I agree. That\u2019s true. But appeal is a word that he knows, and he knew to appeal that finding because he knew it was a negative finding against him that had to do with the reported sexual abuse of [the victim]. So, when Officer Pickett comes to [the defendant\u2019s] workplace, he\u2019s aware, he knows what the charges [are], he knows some agency has already found that it happened, and he\u2019s ready, and he\u2019s ready to give a statement, and he gives a statement that he believes will exculpate him, and will avoid this matter going any further . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The defendant now argues that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the department\u2019s letter during closing argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>was improper. The defendant points out that the letter was not admitted into evidence and that the prosecutor improperly referred to the contents of the letter, specifically, that the department had \u201csubstantiated\u201d the claim of sexual abuse against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\u201cOur decisional law on prosecutorial misconduct makes clear that as the state\u2019s advocate, a prosecutor may argue the state\u2019s case forcefully, [provided the argument is] fair and based upon the facts <em>in evidence </em>and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ritrovato, </em>85 Conn. App. 575, 596, 858 A.2d 296, cert, granted on other grounds, 272 Conn. 905, 863 A.2d 699 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The record clearly reflects that the defendant, himself, brought up the letter in his testimony. The prosecutor inquired about the letter absent any objection by the defense, and the defendant does not now claim that the inquiry was improper. The defendant agreed that the department indicated in the letter that the claim of sexual abuse against the victim had been substantiated. It is of no consequence that the letter itself was not admitted into evidence because, in her argument, the prosecutor referred only to the defendant\u2019s testimony concerning the letter and the inference that the jury should draw from that testimony. The prosecutor confined her argument to matters in evidence. Further, the prosecutor did not improperly argue that the department\u2019s findings in the letter proved the state\u2019s case. Instead, she argued that the defendant\u2019s testimony with regard to the letter, that the department had determined that the allegation of sexual abuse by him against the victim was substantiated, discredited the defendant\u2019s testimony that he was confused and unaware of the allegations against him at the time he gave his statement to the police. Stated otherwise, the prosecutor referred to the defendant\u2019s testimony about the letter for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>purpose of discrediting the defendant\u2019s assertion that the misstatements in his statement to the police were reasonable under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s argument constituted fair commentary on the evidence adduced during trial. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">The defendant also argues that the prosecutor improperly characterized his testimony and statement to the police as untrue. The defendant cites the following specific remarks in support of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">The prosecutor stated: \u201cThe defendant could have remained silent. That is his right. The state has to prove this case on its own. But having testified, he is not entitled to any special protection. His testimony needs to be evaluated the same way as anyone else\u2019s, and his testimony is inconsistent. It is not candid. It is not clear. It is not credible. I\u2019m not going to \u2014 if I spent the morning going over the inconsistencies in the defendant\u2019s testimony, we would be here all day. There is just so much ample room there to talk about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">The prosecutor then discussed the evidence, referring to what she deemed were \u201cglaring\u201d examples of the defendant\u2019s lack of truthfulness. The prosecutor attempted to discredit the defendant\u2019s testimony that he was confused about the charges against him at the time that he gave his statement to the police. The prosecutor referred to evidence of what the defendant knew about the victim\u2019s allegations at the time of his arrest and characterized his testimony that he was surprised at the charges as \u201cnot believable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">At another point in her argument, the prosecutor attempted to discredit the defendant by referring to his admittedly inaccurate statement to the police, in which he represented that his girlfriend was with him during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>the night in question, and that the victim and her brother had slept in another room in his apartment. The prosecutor referred to the statement and the defendant\u2019s explanation for the fact that the statement was not accurate. She stated: \u201cHe claims that he was confused about that statement. That statement was taken only about seven weeks after the incident. It was taken after he had been alerted that there was a problem, after [the department] had alerted him. He was ready to give that statement. He was not confused at all. He deliberately gave that false statement in order to give himself\u2014 alibi\u2019s the wrong word \u2014 in order to give him a person that would support his contention that it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The prosecutor then argued: \u201cSo, what\u2019s my point? If the point of this trial was to prove that the defendant is an untruthful person, I\u2019d just sit down right [now] because that\u2019s out there, and that\u2019s clear. But . . . that\u2019s not the charge. The charge here is the sexual assault on [the victim]. And so how does this untruthfulness relate to that charge? And the way it relates . . . is this. You can find when somebody tells lies, untruths about important matters, that they\u2019re doing that for a reason, that they\u2019re doing that to hide what really happened. And I would suggest to you in this case, that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going on here. The concept is called consciousness of guilt. It\u2019s not really important to put a label on it, but it\u2019s what we all know from our common sense happens. When you\u2019re in trouble, make up a story to get yourself out of it. And that\u2019s what happened. Unfortunately, the story got so complicated, and the lies became so layered, that he kind of got himself jammed up. And he even confused \u2014 I know he confused me. . . . [H]e may have confused all of you in the end. But the most important thing here is that he lied in that statement that he gave to Officer Pickett.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The defendant also challenges statements made by the prosecutor during the state\u2019s rebuttal argument. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>The prosecutor attempted to discredit the defendant\u2019s testimony and argued as follows: \u201cI would love to believe that I was the source of the defendant\u2019s confusion and intimidation [on the witness stand], that I somehow outlawyered up here and he was terrified of me, and \u2014 and in his terror of me, he continued to give false statements on the [witness] stand. I don\u2019t buy that. I don\u2019t think you have to buy that. This is a man who\u2019s very well acquainted with the system, from his own testimony. He has had many encounters with the New Haven police department, apparently. He told \u2014 he testified as he did up here because he felt it was advantageous. He wasn\u2019t good at it. I\u2019m not saying he was good at it, but he was trying.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\u201c[T]he state isn\u2019t arguing that he formulated some grand plot and tried to engage everybody in it when he gave that statement to Officer Pickett. What the state is saying is, he knew he had to have somebody there [in his apartment with him on the night in question], and he stuck [his girlfriend] there, and it just didn\u2019t work. [His girlfriend] didn\u2019t say that she was there.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When I say he tells untruths or he lies, I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s a good liar. He seems to be relatively inept at it. But that\u2019s not what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s about what his motivation is. Why do you go to those lengths? You go to those lengths to hide what you did. It\u2019s because you\u2019re conscious of your own guilt, and you\u2019re trying to avoid responsibility for it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The prosecutor also stated: \u201c[T]he defendant\u2019s familiar with the system. He knows what was at stake when he was interviewed by Officer Pickett. He lied because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>he . . . knew he was guilty.\u201d In referring again to the representation in the defendant\u2019s statement to the police that his girlfriend was with him on the night in question, the prosecutor stated: \u201cThe defendant gave a false statement because he knew he needed somebody to be there, and that\u2019s all. . . . [I]t wasn\u2019t a grand plot, and I\u2019m not arguing it was some scheme he had. And what he did here was to attempt to confuse the evidence, and I was confused, but to confuse the evidence so that you didn\u2019t string together this series ... of events which was in the evidence.\u201d The prosecutor concluded the state\u2019s rebuttal argument by characterizing the defendant\u2019s statement to the police as \u201cfalse\u201d and reminding jurors to consider the defendant\u2019s \u201clack of candor\u201d when considering his testimony. The prosecutor then argued: \u201cWeigh everything you\u2019ve heard and use your common sense. It is ... in the state\u2019s best interest for you to use that common sense. It\u2019s a tough call. It\u2019s a call about credibility. All of you said you can do it, and we all have confidence that you can.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The defendant now argues that the foregoing statements by the prosecutor were a \u201cbrazen attack on [his] testimony\u201d and constituted misconduct. Specifically, the defendant cites the fact that the prosecutor repeatedly referred to him as a \u201cliar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">There is no rule that precludes a prosecutor from challenging a defendant\u2019s testimony. The issue is whether the prosecutor\u2019s argument took the form of a fair criticism of a defendant\u2019s credibility on the basis of the evidence or if it reflected merely the prosecutor\u2019s personal opinion of the defendant\u2019s credibility. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>supra, 70 Conn. App. 287. Having reviewed the challenged remarks, we conclude that they were based on the evidence and not on the prosecutor\u2019s personal opinion. The prosecutor prefaced her remarks by reminding the jury that it had to evaluate the defendant\u2019s testimony and asked the jury to weigh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>the evidence by using common sense. The prosecutor referred to the defendant\u2019s statement to the police and invited the jury to infer that the statement was inaccurate because the defendant had a motive to lie, that he had fabricated a story to conceal his guilt. Because the prosecutor based her comments on the evidence and asked the jury to use its common sense in evaluating the evidence in light of the defendant\u2019s likely motives, the argument was proper. \u201cOur jurisprudence instructs that a prosecutor may comment on a witness\u2019 motivation to be truthful or to lie.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Holliday, </em>85 Conn. App. 242, 261, 856 A.2d 1041, cert, denied, 271 Conn. 945, 861 A.2d 1178 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The prosecutor drew the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s statement to the police, as well as his testimony concerning what he knew about the charges against him at the time he made the statement, demonstrated that he was a liar. The prosecutor asked the jury to conclude likewise. The prosecutor\u2019s submission concerning the defendant\u2019s credibility was fair in light of the testimony of other witnesses that contradicted the defendant\u2019s statement and his testimony. The defendant\u2019s testimony concerning what he knew about the victim\u2019s complaint against him was, in itself, contradictory and the basis for a fair criticism of the defendant\u2019s credibility. \u201c[E]ven though it is unprofessional, a prosecutor can argue that a defendant is a \u2018liar\u2019 if such an argument is supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Spyke, </em>68 Conn. App. 97, 113, 792 A.2d 93, cert, denied, 261 Conn. 909, 804 A.2d 214 (2002); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Wickes, </em>72 Conn. App. 380, 388, 805 A.2d 142, cert, denied, 262 Conn. 914, 811 A.2d 1294 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">This court has often observed that closing arguments have a \u201crough and tumble quality about them\u201d and that generous leeway must be afforded to counsel in stating their case to the jury. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tate, </em>85 Conn. App. 365, 370, 857 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>394, cert, denied, 272 Conn. 901, 863 A.2d 696 (2004). Although it would have been better practice for the prosecutor to have avoided characterizing the defendant as a \u201cliar,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> he has not demonstrated that the prosecutor committed misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The defendant also claims that the evidence did not support the jury\u2019s verdict as to any of the four crimes of which he was convicted. The defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the state\u2019s case and renewed his motion prior to sentencing. The defendant claims that the court improperly denied those motions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> According to the defendant, the evidence was insufficient because \u201cother than the testimony of [the victim], there was no physical evidence presented of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>any sexual assault.\u201d The defendant argues that several witnesses testified on behalf of the state, but that \u201c[n]ot one of these witnesses made any finding of trauma, blood and tissue or could testify that there were any positive results from the rape kit that was performed at Yale-New Haven Hospital on December 25, 2001.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u201cThe standard of review we apply to a claim of insufficient evidence is well established. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bennett-Gibson, </em>84 Conn. App. 48, 52, 851 A.2d 1214, cert, denied, 271 Conn. 916, 859 A.2d 570 (2004). We have reviewed the record and conclude that the evidence supports the verdict beyond a reasonable doubt and that the jury reasonably could have relied on that evidence in returning the verdict that it did. The defendant\u2019s claim is based solely on the flawed premise that the state bore the burden of proving its case with physical evidence. The victim\u2019s testimony provided a sufficient evidentiary basis for the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">In this opinion HENNESSY, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b217-11\"> The jury acquitted the defendant of four other charges: Sexual assault in the first degree, sexual assault in the second degree, risk of injury to a child and sexual assault in the third degree. The trial court sentenced the defendant to serve a term of incarceration of ten years followed by ten years of special parole.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b218-9\"> The defendant\u2019s conviction is related to that conduct. The state also alleged that the defendant engaged in penile-vaginal intercourse with the victim. The victim testified at trial that after the defendant performed cunnilingus on her, he \u201cgot on top\u201d of her and partially inserted his penis inside of her vagina against her will. The jury acquitted the defendant of the charges related to that alleged conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b221-6\"> At trial, the state elicited testimony from Mackey, a social worker employed at the child sexual abuse clinic at Yale-New Haven Hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b221-7\"> At trial, the state elicited testimony from Muiphy, a pediatric nurse practitioner employed by Yale-New Haven Hospital in its child sexual abuse evaluation program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b223-10\"> The defendant also takes issue with the following argument by the prosecutor: \u201cTake [the victim\u2019s] testimony. Her testimony alone proves the state\u2019s case. Her testimony alone can make that beyond a reasonable doubt standard.\u201d The defendant does not state why that argument is improper except to claim that \u201c[t]he prosecutor [made] no mention of the elements of any specific Connecticut general statute that the testimony proved.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s argument was not improper on its face and, viewing the argument in its context, we conclude that it does not reflect an attempt by the prosecutor either to invade the jury\u2019s fact-finding function or to dilute the state\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b229-8\"> In Ms statement to the police, the defendant represented that on the night in question, his then girlfriend stayed with him at his apartment and that on the following morning, she had taken the victim out shopping. The state called the defendant\u2019s girlfriend as a witness, and she testified that on the night in question, she was not at the defendant\u2019s apartment and that she had not taken the victim shopping the following morning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b232-8\"> After the prosecutor concluded the state\u2019s rebuttal argument, the court addressed counsel outside of the presence of the jury. The court stated in relevant part: \u201c[D]uring its second argument, the state indicated that the defendant was a liar and said that he lied or words to that effect.\u201d The court then asked if the defendant wanted the court to give the jury a curative instruction concerning that argument. The defendant\u2019s attorney responded affirmatively. The prosecutor indicated that she did not want to be heard on the issue, except to indicate that she made such comments \u201cin the heat of the moment . . . .\u201d After the jury returned to the courtroom, the court instructed as follows: \u201cDuring [her] closing argument, the prosecutor indicated that, I think words to the effect that the defendant \u2014 referred to the defendant as a liar or said that he lied or words to that effect. Disregard those arguments. It\u2019s your decision, and your decision alone as to the credibility of all witnesses, including the defendant. So, disregard those arguments by the prosecutor. Okay.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b232-9\"> The defendant properly argues that he preserved his claim. The defendant, however, seeks review under the plain error doctrine. The defendant\u2019s request for review under the plain error doctrine is flawed for two reasons. First, the plain error doctrine applies to unpreserved claims. \u201cThe court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial. The court may in the interests of justice notice plain error <em>not brought to the attention of the trial court. . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. Second, even if the defendant at trial had not challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, we would nonetheless review his claim because it \u201cimplicate[s] a defendant\u2019s federal constitutional right not to be convicted of a crime upon insufficient proof.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>supra, 70 Conn.

I respectfully concur with the result the majority has reached and write separately only to address the prosecutor\u2019s depiction of the defendant, Pedro S., as a liar during closing argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>to the jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant contends that such characterization was improper, and I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">As the majority recognizes, we are required to engage in a two step analytical process when reviewing claims of prosecutorial misconduct. \u201cThe two steps are separate and distinct: (1) whether misconduct occurred in the first instance; and (2) whether that misconduct deprived a defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. Put differently, misconduct is misconduct, regardless of its ultimate effect on the fairness of the trial; whether that misconduct caused or contributed to a due process violation is a separate and distinct question that may only be resolved in the context of the entire trial . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>266 Conn. 364, 381-82 n.29, 832 A.2d 14 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The majority notes that our case law currently instructs that \u201ceven though it is unprofessional, a prosecutor can argue that a defendant is a \u2018liar\u2019 if such an argument is supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Spyke, </em>68 Conn. App. 97, 113, 792 A.2d 93, cert, denied, 261 Conn. 909, 804 A.2d 214 (2002); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Wickes, </em>72 Conn. App. 380, 388, 805 A.2d 142, cert, denied, 262 Conn. 914, 811 A.2d 1294 (2002). The sole support offered in <em>Spyke </em>for this proposition of law is a citation to <em>State </em>v. <em>Oehman, </em>212 Conn. 325, 334, 562 A.2d 493 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">In <em>Oehman, </em>the defendant claimed that statements made by the prosecutor characterizing the defendant as, inter alia, a \u201cliar\u201d constituted prosecutorial misconduct. Id., 333. Our Supreme Court stated that \u201c[although such invective is wholly unprofessional and has no place in a Connecticut courtroom, we conclude that the [comment] by the prosecutor characterizing the defendant as a liar . . . [was] supported by the evidence presented in this case. The jurors heard the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>testify concerning numerous lies he had told to various persons both before and after the death of the victim. In this situation, it was certainly permissible for the jurors to infer, and for the prosecutor to argue, that the defendant\u2019s <em>prior lies </em>were relevant to the credibility of his testimony at trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 334.1 read that holding to indicate that a prosecutor may argue that a particular statement made by the defendant is a lie, if supported by the evidence. There is a significant distinction, however, between arguing that a particular statement is a falsehood on one hand and arguing that the defendant \u201cis a liar\u201d on the other.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When a prosecutor brands a defendant a \u201cliar,\u201d the line is crossed between proper and improper comment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See Rules of Professional Conduct 3.4 (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">It appears that this court has followed two divergent paths on this issue. Although we have indicated that a prosecutor may argue that a defendant is a \u201cliar\u201d if such an argument is supported by the evidence; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Spyke, </em>supra, 68 Conn. App. 113; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wickes, </em>supra, 72 Conn. App. 388; we have also held that such argument constitutes misconduct. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>10 Conn. App. 361, 367-68, 523 A.2d 1323, cert, denied, 203 Conn. 809, 525 A.2d 523, cert, denied, 484 U.S. 859, 108 S. Ct. 172, 98 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1987), despite the fact that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s statements to the police prior to trial conflicted with the evidence presented at trial by the police and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>even the defendant\u2019s alibi witnesses,\u201d we stated that the use of the word \u201cliar\u201d to refer to the defendant was something we could not condone. Viewing the trial as a whole, however, we concluded that this impropriety \u201cdid not deny the defendant a fair trial.\u201d Id., 368. As recently as 2003, we concluded that a prosecutor\u2019s use of the epithet \u201cliar\u201d to describe a defendant was improper. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>79 Conn. App. 155, 169, 829 A.2d 890 (2003), we held that the prosecutor\u2019s comments characterizing the defendant as a liar \u201ccertainly were improper and not in any way consistent with the expectation of professionalism of his office.\u201d Nevertheless, we concluded that because \u201cthe prosecutor coupled his substantially accurate characterization of the evidence with the suggestion that the jury closely examine the evidence for itself, we cannot say that his misconduct in the use of the word \u2018liar\u2019 deprived the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d Id., 169-70. Thus, in <em>both Floyd </em>and <em>Hilton, </em>this court concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s use of the epithet \u201cliar\u201d to describe the defendant was misconduct that did not amount to a deprivation of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">In the present case, I would likewise conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s depiction of the defendant as a liar constituted misconduct. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that immediately following the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument, the court inquired whether the defendant wanted the court to give the jury a curative instruction as to the prosecutor\u2019s depiction of him as a liar. Equally telling is the prosecutor\u2019s response, in which she indicated that such comments were made \u201cin the heat of the moment . . . .\u201d The court thereafter provided a curative instruction to the jury. See footnote 8 of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Nevertheless, in applying the factors set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>to the entire trial, as required under <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>269 Conn. 563, 849 A.2d 626 (2004),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 1 would conclude that this misconduct did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial. Because the defendant\u2019s testimony at trial contradicted his written statement to the police on February 23, 2002, as well as his testimony on cross-examination, the misconduct was, to a degree, invited. The severity of the misconduct was minimized by the supporting evidence presented at trial and was infrequent and limited to closing argument. Furthermore, the defendant did not object to the misconduct. In <em>Stevenson, </em>our Supreme Court insisted that \u201cthe fact that defense counsel did not object to one or more incidents of misconduct <em>must be considered </em>in determining whether and to what extent the misconduct contributed to depriving the defendant of a fair trial and whether, therefore, reversal is warranted.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 576. \u201cWhere counsel does not request a curative instruction or seek a mistrial, he presumably does not view the remarks as so prejudicial that his client\u2019s right to a fair trial is seriously jeopardized.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lubesky, </em>195 Conn. 475, 484, 488 A.2d 1239 (1985). Finally, the trial court, sua sponte, provided a curative instruction regarding the misconduct, which likely minimized any harm that may have resulted from the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct. Our Supreme Court has \u201coften held that a prompt cautionary instruction to the jury regarding improper prosecutorial remarks obviates any possible harm to the defendant.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>193 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Conn. 646, 666, 480 A.2d 463 (1984). Accordingly, I would conclude that although the prosecutor\u2019s use of the epithet \u201cliar\u201d to describe the defendant was unprofessional and constituted misconduct, it did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-9\"> See part I C of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b235-5\"> Our Supreme Court has noted the \u201cdistinction between using the words wrong or mistaken rather than lying in questions and closing arguments, concluding that the former terms are not improper because they merely [highlight] the objective conflict without requiring [one] to condemn the prior witness as a purveyor of deliberate falsehood, i.e., a liar.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>259 Conn. 693, 706-707, 793 A.2d 226 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b235-6\"> Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>99 Conn. 115, 121, 121 A. 277 (1923), in which the prosecutor, referring to the defendant, declared that \u201c \u2018[h]e sits there as a perjurer upon that [witness] stand.\u2019 \u2019\u2019The court concluded that the statement was prejudicial and inexcusable.
