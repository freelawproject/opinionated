We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">On the basis of the evidence presented at trial, the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The victim turned three years old in April, 2002. Her parents often took her to the home of the defendant, her paternal grandfather. The victim\u2019s parents did not leave the victim unaccompanied with the defendant or his wife, who also lived at the home, but the victim and the defendant did spend time alone together during the visits. During one of these visits in May or June, 2002, the defendant touched the victim\u2019s intimate parts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">In addition to eliciting testimony from other witnesses at trial, the state elicited testimony from Lisa Radigan, a licensed clinical social worker. Radigan testified concerning her educational background in social work, as well as her professional experience providing mental health treatment to children, adolescents and adults. As part of her experience, Radigan has either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>supervised or conducted numerous interviews of children, some as young as three years of age, in child sexual abuse cases. According to Radigan, many of those children were referred to her by police departments or the department of children and families (department). In her capacity supervising interviews, Radigan has worked with department employees, law enforcement personnel, victim\u2019s advocates and interviewers. Radigan has evaluated children concerning sexual abuse in her employment at mental health treatment centers concerning sexual abuse, as well as at hospital affiliated sexual abuse climes. Radigan also has trained medical students, police officers and department workers in the subject of child sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Radigan testified concerning the process of conducting forensic interviews of children as it relates to sexual abuse and discussed certain behavior generally exhibited by child sexual abuse victims. Radigan testified that she was familiar with the victim in the present case and the interview process that she underwent. The defendant challenges the admissibility of two aspects of Radigan\u2019s testimony, which, he argues, constituted improper expert opinion with regard to credibility. First, the defendant argues that the court improperly permitted Radigan to testily regarding the subject of delayed disclosure of abuse by child sexual abuse victims. Second, the defendant argues that the court improperly permitted Radigan to testily with regard to the subject of coaching, as it pertains to allegations of child sexual abuse. We will set forth our standard of review and address each of the claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">\u201c[T]he trial court has wide discretion in ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony and, unless that discretion has been abused or the ruling involves a clear misconception of the law, the trial court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wargo, </em>255 Conn. 113, 123, 763 A.2d 1 (2000). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>\u201cA witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, education or otherwise may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise concerning scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge, if the testimony will assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence or in determining a fact in issue.\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 7-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly permitted the state to elicit testimony from Radigan regarding the subject of delayed reporting of abuse by minor sexual abuse victims. Before Radigan testified, the defendant asked the court to preclude the state from eliciting expert testimony from Radigan concerning two subjects upon which the state indicated she would testify: delayed disclosure of abuse by minor sexual abuse victims and coaching. The defendant argued, with regard to testimony concerning delayed disclosure, that such testimony was not relevant in this case. The state argued that the evidence demonstrated that the victim had not disclosed the abuse to anyone immediately after it allegedly had occurred and that expert testimony from Radigan as to the general behavior patterns of minor sexual abuse victims was relevant to understanding why this might have occurred. The state argued that the law permitted such testimony and that Radigan would not testify with regard to the credibility of the victim. The court permitted the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Radigan testified as follows with regard to the issue of delayed disclosure during the state\u2019s direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">\u201cQ. Now in your experience, training and education, Ms. Radigan, do children in the age range of three to four years have difficulty concerning temporal concepts, timing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>\u201cA. Yeah. Kids actually don\u2019t master things like dates and times usually until about age seven. But preschool children particularly have a really difficult time kind of being able to articulate exactly when something happened. They just developmentally don\u2019t have the concepts to articulate those types of things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">\u201cQ. And have you ever heard the term late disclosure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">\u201cQ. And what does that mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">\u201cA. A late or delayed disclosure basically means that a child doesn\u2019t tell right away after they\u2019ve been touched, which is actually more common than not in cases of sexual abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">\u201cQ. And why is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-11\">\u201cA. Lots of factors. Sometimes kids are threatened or told not to tell, lots of kids don\u2019t really understand what\u2019s happened to them, and they, especially young kids, don\u2019t have the articulation to explain to someone what\u2019s happened. Embarrassment, shame, kids often feel responsible because their parents tell them, you know, no one is supposed to touch you in your privates, and then when that happens, a lot of times kids will take responsibility that perhaps sometimes it\u2019s their fault. Kids generally don\u2019t report things when they think it\u2019s their fault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-12\">\u201cQ. Now the children at the age of three to four, do they understand their sexual organs or what they\u2019re for, other than perhaps the basic sanitary needs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-13\">\u201cA. Yeah, I mean, kids generally associate genitalia with, you know, being able to go to the bathroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-14\">\u201cQ. All right. Does the relationship between the offender and the victim in any way play a part in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>delayed disclosure that you were speaking about before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">\u201cA. Sure. I mean, it certainly complicates it, you know. As you can imagine, you know, if somebody that you have positive feelings about or have a close relationship violates you in a certain way, it makes it much more complicated and makes it much more difficult to tell. Lots of times kids, again, take the responsibility. They\u2019re afraid if they tell their mother or tell their father that the father is going to get upset or worried or things like that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The victim, who was three years old at the time of trial, testified on direct examination that she thought she told her parents \u201cright away\u201d that the defendant had touched her \u201cprivates.\u201d During cross-examination, the defendant\u2019s attorney asked the victim several questions related to the timing of her disclosure. For example, he asked the victim if she remembered \u201cwhen\u201d she spoke with her parents about the alleged incident and if she had discussed the incident \u201crecently.\u201d The victim replied that she did not remember when she talked with her parents about the incident. The defendant\u2019s attorney pursued the line of inquiry, asking the victim if she remembered telling her mother about the incident. The victim replied affirmatively. The defendant\u2019s attorney asked the victim where the disclosure had occurred, whether it had taken place at the defendant\u2019s house (where the incident allegedly had occurred) and whether the disclosure had occurred on the same day that the incident allegedly occurred. The victim gave contradictory answers to the questions. She testified, on the one hand, that she told her mother about the incident on the same day that it had occurred at the defendant\u2019s house and, on the other hand, that she did not recall where she was when she told her mother about the incident. The defendant\u2019s attorney also inquired whether the victim had visited a physician <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>\u201cnear the time\u201d that the defendant had touched her. The victim replied that she had not.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The victim\u2019s mother testified that she and her husband took the victim to the defendant\u2019s house frequently for visits, and that visits occurred in May and June, 2002. The victim\u2019s mother testified that the victim told her about the incident on June 25, 2002, while she was driving the victim to her day care provider. According to the victim\u2019s mother, she was discussing \u201cgood touch and bad touch\u201d with the victim when the victim indicated where the defendant had touched her by rubbing her \u201cvaginal area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">During cross-examination, the defendant\u2019s attorney asked the victim\u2019s mother about her testimony that the victim related more details about the incident to her after the initial disclosure. The victim\u2019s mother testified that, within a week after the victim told her about the incident, the victim told her that the incident had occurred in the defendant\u2019s backyard. The defendant\u2019s attorney asked the victim\u2019s mother questions related to the timing and circumstances of this further disclosure by the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The defendant argues that \u201c[t]he defense never impeached the credibility of the victim regarding delayed reporting\u201d and that \u201cRadigan\u2019s testimony regarding delayed reporting therefore did not rebut or refute any insinuation by the defendant, but rather served only to bolster the credibility of the victim.\u201d The defendant asserts: \u201cIn the absence of impeachment on this subject, the extensive expert testimony about delayed reporting served one purpose: to comment on the credibility of the victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">This court addressed a similar issue in <em>State </em>v. <em>Car-dany, </em>35 Conn. App. 728, 730-32, 646 A.2d 291, cert, denied, 231 Conn. 942, 653 A.2d 823 (1994), another appeal from a conviction on charges related to the sex-</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>ual abuse of a minor victim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There, one of the issues raised was whether the trial court properly had admitted expert testimony \u201cthat it is not unusual for abuse victims to delay in reporting incidents of abuse.\u201d Id., 730. The defendant claimed that the expert testimony was inadmissible because he \u201chad not initially impeached the victim\u2019s credibility on the issue of delay.\u201d Id. This court held that \u201cthe state may introduce expert testimony that explains in general terms the tendency of minors to delay in reporting incidents of abuse once the victim has testified and there has been testimony introducing the alleged dates of abuse and reporting.\u201d Id., 731. \u201cThe rationale for allowing testimony in the state\u2019s case-in-chief to explain alleged delays in reporting incidents of abuse is analogous to the rationale for allowing constancy of accusation testimony, with or without actual impeachment.\u201d Id. This court further explained that \u201c[i]t is natural for a jury to discount the credibility of a victim who did not immediately report alleged incidents of abuse whether or not the defense emphasizes the delay in cross-examination. Thus, testimony that explains to the jury why a minor victim of sexual abuse might delay in reporting the incidents of abuse should be allowed as part of the state\u2019s case-in-chief.\u201d Id., 732. This court upheld the admission of expert testimony concerning the subject of delayed disclosure by minor victims of sexual abuse in <em>Cardany, </em>and there is no dearth of authority upholding the admissibility of such evidence. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Francis D., </em>75 Conn. App. 1, 14-16, 815 A.2d 191, cert, denied, 263 Conn. 909, 819 A.2d 842 (2003); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>71 Conn. App. 8, 17-23, 799 A.2d 1126 (2002); <em>State </em>v. <em>Christiano, </em>29 Conn. App. 642, 649-54, 617 A.2d 470 (1992), aff'd, 228 Conn. 456, 637 A.2d 382, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>cert, denied, 513 U.S. 821, 115 S. Ct. 83, 130 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim that Radigan\u2019s testimony with regard to delayed disclosure was inadmissible because he did not attempt to impeach the victim\u2019s credibility on the basis of delayed disclosure is belied by the transcript of proceedings at trial. The record reflects that the defendant\u2019s attorney did, in fact, question the victim and her mother concerning the timing of the victim\u2019s initial disclosure of abuse, as well as the timing of the victim\u2019s later disclosure of additional information about the abuse. Whether the defendant\u2019s inquiries constituted an impeachment of the victim\u2019s credibility, however, is not dispositive. Our law is clear that impeachment is not a necessaiy predicate for the introduction of this expert testimony; all that is required is that evidence concerning the timing of the alleged abuse and disclosure be placed before the finder of fact.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That occurred in this case, and the court properly permitted the state to elicit Radigan\u2019s testimony during its casein-chief. Here, the expert testimony was admissible, and did not impermissibly bolster the victim\u2019s credibility, because it explained, in general terms, the behavioral characteristics of minor sexual abuse victims with regard to the issue of delayed disclosure of abuse. Accordingly, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by permitting the state to present this evidence to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The defendant finally claims that the court improperly permitted Radigan to testify with regard to the subject of coaching, as it pertains to child sexual abuse victims. As we noted in the context of our discussion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>in part I, the defendant asked the court to preclude Radigan from testifying with regard to the subject of coaching. The defendant argued, essentially, that Radi-gan\u2019s expert testimony was unnecessary because the jury did not need any assistance in evaluating the victim\u2019s credibility and that any expert testimony concerning general behavior exhibited by minor sexual abuse victims would encroach upon the jury\u2019s evaluation of the victim\u2019s credibility. The prosecutor argued that Rad-igan\u2019s testimony with regard to the general behavioral characteristics of minor victims of sexual abuse and, specifically, the issue of coaching,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was relevant and admissible because the defendant\u2019s attorney, in his cross-examinations of the victim and other witnesses had, at the least, implied that the victim had been coached to allege abuse. As he did with regard to expert testimony concerning delayed disclosure, the prosecutor argued that testimony concerning coaching would assist the jury in evaluating the victim\u2019s testimony. The court agreed with the state, noting that, in light of the alleged victim\u2019s age and the allegations of abuse, the testimony would be helpful to the jury. The court also indicated that it believed that the defendant\u2019s attorney, during cross-examination, had attempted to demonstrate that the victim had been coached.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The prosecutor, thereafter, elicited testimony from Radigan with regard to the subject of coaching. The following colloquy occurred during the state\u2019s casein-chief: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>and thinks, okay, what are all the other possibilities of why this child would be saying it other than sexual abuse? And you kind of systematically rule those possibilities out until you come to the conclusion that, you know, why else would the child be saying this? Coaching is always something that we\u2019re concerned about and are always looking for.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>\u201cQ. Now in your experience . . . coaching of children, is that a concern in forensic interviews?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-8\">\u201cA. Sure, it\u2019s always a concern. I think a good forensic interviewer, a good supervisor, goes into an interview</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>\u201cQ. Now, in your experience, your training and education, and some of the literature that exists out there with respect to coaching, are there any particular signs that you look for that the child may exhibit [if] coaching is suspected?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">\u201cA. Sure. And again, this is, you know, this is general. Often kids who are coached tend to blurt out their statement right away, you know, because they\u2019ve kind of been programmed that this is what they need to say, so they\u2019ll say it right away. They kind of don\u2019t participate through an engagement period during the interview. Kids sometimes will have pretty limited statements around the abuse, you know, they\u2019ll make vague statements. They often can\u2019t talk about sensory details. What did it feel like? What did it look like? What did it smell like? Things like that. In general, parents who are coaching their child are usually very involved in the process, you know, sometimes [they] don\u2019t want to separate from the child. Sometimes parents will insist on being in the room with the child being interviewed and will appear, for lack of a better word, overintense in the process, kind of wanting to know a lot of details. Well, what exactly did the child say? Things like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">\u201cQ. Now, in this particular case with [the victim], did you have an opportunity to meet with the parents when the interview was conducted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">\u201cA. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>\u201cQ. Okay. And was there a separation, meaning was [the victim] interviewed in a room other than a room that her parents were in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">\u201cA. Yes. The parents were not present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">\u201cQ. All right. And with respect to [the victim] separating from her parents, do you recall whether or not the parents, after the interview, were overly enthusiastic about any of the information that you had given to them \u2014 that you may have given to them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">\u201cA. No. I mean, they were appropriately concerned. They certainly wanted to know what our impressions were and they were certainly interested in what their child disclosed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-9\">\u201cQ. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-10\">\u201cA. They were actually more concerned about treatment and recovery for their daughter than actually the content of the disclosure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">The defendant claims on appeal, as he did at trial, that the court should have precluded the testimony because he did not attempt to impeach the victim\u2019s credibility by suggesting that she had been coached. The defendant also claims that, even if he had sought to impeach the victim\u2019s credibility in this manner, Radi-gan\u2019s testimony impermissibly bolstered the victim\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">Our review of the record supports the observations of the prosecutor and the court that the defendant had attempted to impeach the victim\u2019s credibility by demonstrating that she had been coached by her mother. The defendant pursued this line of inquiry in his cross-examination of the victim. First, the defendant cross-examined the victim concerning conversations that she had had with her mother, before she alleged abuse, related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>to the issue of sexual abuse.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Second, the defendant, over objection by the state, cross-examined the victim about statements she made to her day care provider at or around the time that she reported the abuse to her mother. Specifically, the defendant\u2019s attorney asked the victim if she made certain statements about experiencing pain in her genitals because her mother told her to do so.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Finally, the defendant\u2019s attorney asked the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>if she had rehearsed her present testimony with her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">At trial, the victim\u2019s mother testified that the victim disclosed the abuse to her while she was driving the victim to her day care provider and that the disclosure occurred at or near a time at which she had discussed the topic of sexual abuse with the victim. The victim\u2019s mother testified that, from the time that her daughter was two years old, she routinely discussed the issue of \u201cgood touch and bad touch\u201d with her so as to educate her daughter about the subject and to let her know that it was \u201cokay to tell the truth in case something bad did happen.\u201d The victim\u2019s mother testified that she did not discuss with the victim the subject of her testimony in court, tell her anything about coming to court to testify or \u201cprepare\u201d her for testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">The defendant also pursued lines of inquiry related to coaching in his cross-examination of the victim\u2019s mother. First, the defendant\u2019s attorney cross-examined the victim\u2019s mother concerning her relationship with the defendant, her husband\u2019s father. The defendant\u2019s attorney specifically inquired as to financial disagreements between the victim\u2019s mother and the defendant, disagreements that purportedly arose just prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>victim\u2019s allegation of abuse.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> By means of this inquiry, the defendant could have intended to demonstrate only that the victim\u2019s mother had a motive to cause her daughter to allege the abuse because of her own disagreements with the defendant. Second, the defendant\u2019s attorney extensively cross-examined the victim\u2019s mother about her practice of talking frequently with the victim about the subject of sexual abuse and her own history of sexual abuse as a child.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> These inquiries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>are related to the subject of coaching because they help demonstrate that the victim\u2019s mother frequently discussed sexual abuse with the victim and, therefore, could have influenced the victim\u2019s allegation of abuse if she so desired. Third, the defendant\u2019s attorney later asked the victim\u2019s mother if, prior to the date on which the victim allegedly told her about the abuse, she told the victim that her \u201cprivates were going to hurt\u201d before she went to her day care provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>During his cross-examination of Radigan, the defendant\u2019s attorney reinforced the inference that the victim\u2019s mother caused the victim to allege the abuse.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This inquiry reinforced the theory, relied on by the defense, that the victim\u2019s mother was in a position to cause the victim to allege abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">During the defendant\u2019s case-in-chief, the defendant\u2019s attorney elicited testimony from an employee at the victim\u2019s day care center, Jennifer Takacs. He inquired with regard to whether, on June 20, 2002, the victim told Takacs that her \u201cprivates\u201d were going to hurt her that day. The defendant\u2019s attorney also asked Takacs whether the victim told her that her mother told her that before she left her at the day care center. Takacs answered in the affirmative to both of these inquiries. The defendant\u2019s attorney also elicited testimony from Sandy Kell, the director of the victim\u2019s day care center. He asked Kell whether the victim\u2019s mother had spoken with her on June 25, 2002, and whether, as a result of that conversation, she took steps to memorialize the victim\u2019s earlier report of discomfort in writing. Kell testified that this was the case. This evidence demonstrated that the victim\u2019s mother told the victim that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>would experience discomfort in her genitals, that this conversation occurred just prior to the time at which the victim allegedly told her mother about the sexual abuse and that the victim\u2019s mother went to the victim\u2019s day care provider and caused the victim\u2019s complaint to be memorialized in writing. It is not unreasonable to view this as circumstantial evidence presented to demonstrate that the victim\u2019s mother coached the victim and ensured that a record was created that would help substantiate the claim of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The implications raised by the defendant during cross-examination and in the evidence that he elicited in his case-in-chief were reflected in the closing argument of the defendant\u2019s attorney. The defendant\u2019s attorney characterized the victim\u2019s mother as having a \u201cpedophile phobia.\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney argued that the victim\u2019s mother, having been the victim of sexual abuse herself at an early age, essentially caused the claim of sexual abuse in this case. He argued that the victim\u2019s mother \u201cturned\u201d what could have been \u201csome innocent gesture\u201d by the victim into \u201csome sort of sexually inappropriate contact with the child by the grandfather\u201d because of her own phobia about sexual abuse. Throughout his closing argument, the defendant portrayed the victim\u2019s mother as being inappropriately concerned with sexual abuse and suggested that she engaged in age inappropriate conversations concerning sexual abuse with the victim. The defendant argued this point to the extent that he stated, with regard to the victim\u2019s testimony, as follows: \u201cWhat we think is that this is the product of an overwrought mother, who\u2019s paranoid about the crime specifically of sexual assault or the sexual abuse of children. For the good reason, most likely, albeit nonsensical, but understandable reason, that she had been abused as a child herself. And she is now so overly protective of her child that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>has resulted in this allegation, for which we all find ourselves collected here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">It is clear that the defendant elicited testimony intending to demonstrate that the victim\u2019s mother, for whatever improper reason, exerted such an influence over the victim that she caused the victim to testily falsely that the defendant had sexually abused her. The defendant clearly focused the jury\u2019s attention on the behavior of the victim\u2019s mother as an explanation for the victim\u2019s allegations. By relying on this theory of defense, the defendant asked the jury to believe that, rather than being the product of the victim\u2019s memory of past events, the victim\u2019s testimony was based on things that her mother either had told her, or had told her to say to others, concerning the defendant. The defendant argues, as he did at trial,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that he did not assert that the victim had been coached, but that the victim\u2019s mother had \u201ccreated an environment where [the victim] felt strongly encouraged to say\u201d that the defendant had sexually abused her. Even if the defendant properly argues that there is a distinction between suggesting that the victim had been influenced strongly by her mother to allege the abuse and suggesting that the victim was coached by her mother to allege the abuse, we disagree with the defendant that his efforts to impeach the victim\u2019s credibility were limited to the former of these two grounds. On the basis of the questioning and evidence set forth above, we conclude that the defendant raised the issue of whether the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>had been coached, even if he did so by implication rather than by name.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Having determined that the defendant sought to impeach the credibility of the victim on the basis that her mother had caused her to testify untruthfully that the defendant had abused her, we next determine whether the court properly admitted into evidence Radi-gan\u2019s testimony concerning coaching.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Issues of credibility typically are determinative in child sexual abuse prosecutions. This is so because \u201cin sex crime cases generally, and in child molestation cases in particular, the offense often is committed surreptitiously, in the absence of any neutral witnesses.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>264 Conn. 617, 669, 835 A.2d 895 (2003). Generally, an expert witness may not express an opinion as to an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact. Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 7-3 (a). An expert witness may not testify concerning the credibility of another witness or of a particular victim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Toccaline, </em>258 Conn. 542, 550 n.10, 783 A.2d 450 (2001). While an expert witness is precluded from testifying with regard to the credibility of a complaining victim, he or she may nevertheless testify concerning issues that may bear on a logical assessment of a victim\u2019s credibility, particularly in cases where a minor is the alleged victim of sexual abuse. \u201c[T]he consequences of the unique trauma experienced by minor victims of sexual abuse are matters beyond the understanding of the average person.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Spigarolo, </em>210 Conn. 359, 378, 556 A.2d 112, cert, denied, 493 U.S. 933, 110 S. Ct. 322, 107 L. Ed. 2d 312 (1989). Our law recognizes that expert testimony concerning certain behavior patterns of minor victims of sexual abuse in general may assist the jury in assessing the credibility of a particular complaining victim. In certain circumstances, such testimony has been deemed admissible on this ground. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>For example, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Spigarolo, </em>supra, 210 Conn. 359, our Supreme Court held that, \u201cwhere defense counsel has sought to impeach the credibility of a complaining minor witness in a sexual abuse case, based on inconsistency, incompleteness or recantation of the victim\u2019s disclosures pertaining to the alleged incidents, the state may offer expert testimony that seeks to demonstrate or explain in general terms the behavioral characteristics of child abuse victims in disclosing alleged incidents.\u201d Id., 380. The court recognized a \u201ccritical distinction between admissible expert testimony on general or typical behavior patterns of minor victims and inadmissible testimony directly concerning the particular victim\u2019s credibility.\u201d Id., 379. Evidence of the latter variety is not admissible. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>257 Conn. 797, 805-806, 778 A.2d 159 (2001) (expert testimony that minor victim was \u201cvery credible\u201d and had \u201cexperienced\u201d sexual abuse deemed improper).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Here, the court permitted the state to present Radi-gan\u2019s expert testimony concerning coaching only after it accurately observed that the defendant sought to impeach the victim on the basis that she had been coached. The testimony was of the same nature as expert testimony concerning the general behavioral characteristics of child abuse victims in disclosing alleged incidents of abuse. That is, it was specialized knowledge concerning the behavior of minor victims of sexual abuse that, in light of the defendant\u2019s efforts to impeach the victim\u2019s credibility, likely would assist the jury in assessing the victim\u2019s credibility. As an expert in conducting forensic interviews, Radigan discussed certain behaviors typically exhibited by minors that have been coached and by parents who have coached their children. Radigan did not express an opinion as to whether the victim had been coached, whether the victim or her parents were credible or whether she believed that the victim had been sexually abused. Her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>opinion was relevant to the issue of the victim\u2019s credibility, but did not constitute an assessment of the victim\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the court\u2019s evidentiary ruling did not reflect an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-10\"> The court sentenced the defendant to a term of incarceration of ten years, execution suspended after five years, to be followed by fifteen years of probation. The court also ordered the defendant to register as a sexual offender for a period of ten years.

Outside of the presence of the jury, the defendant\u2019s attorney indicated that the victim\u2019s day care provider noted, in written form, that, on June 20, 2002, the victim told her that her \u201cprivates\u201d were going to hurt. The provider further noted that, when she asked the victim why this was the case, the victim told her that \u201cher mother told her that they were going to hurt.\u201d The defendant\u2019s attorney justified his line of inquiry as follows: \u201cSo, because [the victim\u2019s statement to her day care provider is] so contemporaneous with the very complaint, I want to know whether the mother, for some reason, is trying to influence her to make a complaint of vaginal irritation on the very day [the victim] was supposed to have complained of this to the mother.

The victim\u2019s mother responded to these questions in the negative. The defendant\u2019s attorney also questioned the victim\u2019s mother about cellular telephones that the defendant either purchased or helped her to purchase, as well as outstanding cellular telephone bills related to these telephones. The victim\u2019s mother testified that the defendant \u201ccosigned\u201d for these telephones but that she paid for them.

At trial, the defendant\u2019s attorney argued that the defense did not assert that the victim had been coached. He further argued that, despite eliciting evidence that the victim\u2019s mother and the defendant had financial disagreements, the defense did not mean to suggest that these disputes were related to the victim\u2019s allegation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\"> The defendant also claims that, in rendering her expert opinion with regard to coaching, Radigan impermissibly \u201cbuttressed the state\u2019s position that the [victim\u2019s] parents were credible witnesses and also that they had not coached their daughter. \u201d The defendant further argues as follows: \u201cRadigan\u2019s claims about the parents\u2019 concerns fostered the impression that they would never have contributed to [the victim\u2019s] answers because of their good faith. It also impermissibly bolstered their general credibility and increased the likelihood that their other testimony would be believed, especially their vital constancy of accusation testimony.\u201d The defendant bases this claim upon Radigan\u2019s testimony in which she related her observations of the victim\u2019s parents during the interview process.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">By way of his motion in limine, the defendant argued that Radigan\u2019s testimony concerning coaching was improper because it would bolster the credibility of the victim and had no bearing on the issues in the case. The defendant did not seek to preclude Radigan from testifying with regard to her observations of the victim\u2019s parents during the interview process, but with regard to the issue of coaching in general. The scope of the defendant\u2019s motion did not encompass the specific evidentiary claim he now raises on appeal. Further, the defendant did not object to Radigan\u2019s testimony at the time that she testified, or at any time thereafter, in the manner in which he now complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">We will not review this aspect of the defendant\u2019s claim because it is unpreserved. \u201cWe have consistently refused to consider evidentiary rulings not properly preserved.
