Tadros and the defendant Giuseppe Tripodi, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>both of whom axe surgeons. Of the eight lawsuits filed between the parties and their various entities,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> six were consolidated and tried to the court, the seventh remains open following a foreclosure sale<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the eighth was withdrawn. In short summary, after trial, the court concluded that the defendants, Tripodi and his wife, Concetta Tripodi, secretly had stolen $876,985.27 from the medical practice over the course of several years. The court ordered them to pay the plaintiff Raafat R. Tadros, Giuseppe Tripodi and Thomas Alosco, M.D., P.C. (professional corporation) treble damages totaling $2,630,955.81, plus interest in the amount of $537,418.50. In addition, the court concluded that Giuseppe Tripodi was hable to Tadros for unpaid rent in the amount of $211,875, plus interest. Finally, as a prejudgment remedy, the court garnished the proceeds of the foreclosure sale of a building owned by Tadros\u2019 and Guiseppe Tripodi\u2019s real estate corporation held by the clerk of the Superior Court after Giuseppe Tripodi purchased the property at a foreclosure auction. The defendants claim that the court improperly (1) admitted hearsay evidence for a limited nonhearsay purpose and then improperly considered the evidence for its truth as proof of the amount stolen, (2) concluded that Giuseppe Tripodi was hable for unpaid rent, (3) awarded the plaintiffs prejudgment interest pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 37-3a and (4) concluded that it had the authority to garnish funds held by the clerk of the Superior Court. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>The following background facts essentially are undisputed. Tadros hired Giuseppe Tripodi in 1985, and the two later formed a professional corporation, Raafat R. Tadros and Giuseppe Tripodi, M.D., P.C. In 1990, Tadros and Giuseppe Tripodi purchased real estate and conveyed it to their newly formed real estate corporation, Middlebury Medical Center, Inc. (real estate corporation). The practice occupied the second floor of the building while the first floor was leased to other medical professionals. In 1996, Thomas Alosco, also a surgeon, joined the professional corporation and later became an equal shareholder with Tadros and Giuseppe Tripodi.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Alosco did not at any relevant time own an interest in the real estate corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">By the end of2000, both the personal and professional relationship between Tadros and Giuseppe Tripodi soured, and they terminated their practice effective January 1, 2001. Giuseppe Tripodi formed a new entity, the defendant Middlebury Surgical, LLC, and Tadros and Alosco formed a new professional corporation, Raafat R. Tadros and Thomas Alosco, M.D., P.C. The two new entities continued to share the same office space until March 24, 2001, when Tadros and Alosco moved their practice to a different location. By agreement of the parties, Giuseppe Tripodi remained in the practice\u2019s original offices in the building owned by the real estate corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The court in its memorandum of decision made the following findings of fact specifically related to the Tripodis\u2019 theft of funds from the plaintiff professional corporation. \u201cBetween 1991 and 2001, $876,985.27 of the corporation\u2019s revenues were \u2018discounted\u2019 in the corporation\u2019s records. The effect of the discount was to offset the accounts receivable of the corporation so that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>corporate records would not show the revenue that it had earned. Although the evidence was circumstantial, the evidence points unequivocally to the conclusion that the Tripodifs] misappropriated and committed the theft of this money. . . . [T]he items entered in the corporation\u2019s computer records under \u2018discount\u2019 were accompanied by computer codes used exclusively by Concetta Tripodi.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These codes were not used by Joyce Benoit, an administrative assistant in the office who was supervised by Concetta Tripodi in handling the office\u2019s financial records and who was the only other person in the office with substantial computer expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u201cSecond, between February 13 and 20, 2001, while the professional corporation was in the throes of an acrimonious breakup, corporation counsel Mark Neikrie and his agents seized the corporation\u2019s computer. They returned the computer to the office on February 21 and then seized it again on March 9, [2001]. During the period between February [21] and March [9], 2001, when the computer was back in the office, Concetta Tripodi made over 200 deletions of prior computer entries, some of which involved patient balances. Almost half of the matters deleted had been originally entered prior to 2000, and some had been entered as far back as 1993.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the exact economic effect of all of the deletions is not clear, they nonetheless reveal unauthorized tampering with the computer records at a particularly suspect time.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\u201cThird, numerous canceled patient or insurance payment checks bore an endorsement of Guiseppe Tripodi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>alone or, less frequently, some other endorsement different from that usually used by the professional corporation. These checks were deposited into bank accounts other than the one used by the corporation for deposits. The amount in these checks was then entered under \u2018discount\u2019 in the corporation\u2019s records. This money was, thus, plainly diverted from the corporation by the Tripodis.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u201cFourth, Guiseppe Tripodi requested and received cash for certain varicose vein procedures performed on Saturdays. Occasionally, the cash would be missing on Monday morning and, thus, would not be available for the daily deposit into the corporate bank account. Guiseppe Tripodi told Benoit that he took cash from patients and used the cash for the medication for the varicose vein procedure. Concetta Tripodi told Benoit that the former would take care of the related computer entries.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u201cFifth, Guiseppe Tripodi sought to end his medical practice with Tadros because Guiseppe Tripodi felt that he was not receiving adequate compensation for the work that he was doing. Tadros preferred to adhere to the original agreement whereby each partner would receive equal shares of the earnings. Guiseppe Tripodi\u2019s dissatisfaction with the compensation scheme forms a strong motive for the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\u201cSixth, at his deposition, Guiseppe Tripodi invoked the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination in response to questions concerning whether he was stealing from the business, depositing corporate revenues into noncorporate bank accounts and failing to pay income taxes on these moneys. At her deposition, Concetta Tripodi invoked the fifth amendment in response to questions concerning the deposit of corporate revenues to noncorporate accounts, her use of the office computer to discount these deposits and her use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>of the computer in late February or early March, 2001, to make changes to conceal the misappropriation of funds. The court can and does draw an adverse inference from the breathtaking scope of the Tripodis\u2019 invocation of the fifth amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Further facts will be provided as necessary to address the defendants\u2019 specific claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The defendants first claim that the court improperly admitted into evidence two exhibits that constituted inadmissible hearsay, and then, despite having admitted the exhibits for limited nonhearsay purposes, relied on the exhibits for their truth as proof of damages. The defendants argue that without those improperly admitted exhibits, there was an inadequate evidentiary basis to calculate damages related to the theft. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">\u201c[T]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility [and relevancy] of evidence. . . . The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . Additionally, before a party is entitled to a new trial because of an erroneous eviden-tiary ruling, he or she has the burden of demonstrating that the error was harmful. . . . The harmless error standard in a civil case is whether the improper ruling would likely affect the result.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Urich </em>v. <em>Fish, </em>261 Conn. 575, 580-81, 804 A.2d 795 (2002). Furthermore, \u201c[i]t is well recognized that any error in the admission of evidence does not require reversal of the resulting judgment if the improperly admitted evidence is merely cumulative of other validly admitted testimony.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cadle Co. </em>v. <em>Errato, </em>71 Conn. App. 447, 466-67, 802 A.2d 887, cert, denied, 262 Conn. 918, 812 A.2d 861 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Exhibit forty-seven, introduced through the plaintiffs\u2019 expert, forensic accountant Alan Mandell, contained documents prepared by Mandell and by Mark Austin, a computer consultant, as well as supporting documentation. Following voir dire of Mandell regarding the exhibit, the defendants\u2019 counsel objected only to those portions of the document that were not actually prepared by Mandell.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court admitted those portions of exhibit forty-seven to which counsel objected for the limited purpose of demonstrating the basis for Man-dell\u2019s expert opinion. The remainder of exhibit forty-seven, which includes Mandell\u2019s analysis and his determination of the total amount of money the defendants stole, was admitted as a full exhibit without limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The court was well within its discretion to allow Mandell to testify as to the bases of his expert opinion, regardless of whether the documentation on which he relied was itself admissible.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 7-4 (b); see also <em>Carusillo </em>v. <em>Associated Women\u2019s Health Specialists, P.C., </em>72 Conn. App. 75, 85-86, 804 A.2d 960 (expert opinion regarded as evidence in its own right), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>remanded on other grounds, 262 Conn. 920, 812 A.2d 861 (2002). Most importantly, the defendants\u2019 counsel did not object either to Mandell\u2019s testimony regarding his conclusions as to the amount of money stolen or to those portions of exhibit forty-seven containing the gravamen of the plaintiffs\u2019 case for theft, including Man-dell\u2019s own analysis of the professional corporation\u2019s business records and his calculations of the total amount stolen. Either those portions of exhibit forty-seven to which counsel did not object or Mandell\u2019s testimony was sufficient evidence of the damages awarded. Thus, because the challenged evidence was cumulative of other, unchallenged evidence that was sufficient in itself to support the court\u2019s finding as to the amount stolen, any possible error in the admission of hearsay evidence was necessarily harmless and does not warrant reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Austin prepared the other challenged exhibit, number seventy-six, when Neikrie twice seized the professional corporation\u2019s computer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The exhibit demonstrated the alterations Concetta Tripodi had made to computer records following the initial seizure of the computer. The court admitted exhibit seventy-six for the limited purpose of showing that the changes had been made after the first seizure and before the second, but stated that it would not consider the substance of the changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">There is nothing to suggest that the court considered exhibit seventy-six for any purpose beyond that for which it allowed the exhibit to be admitted into evidence. Exhibit seventy-six is one piece of circumstantial evidence of the defendants\u2019 theft. Moreover, it is cumulative evidence because both Austin and Benoit testified without objection that someone had altered the computer information during the period between the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>and second seizures of the professional corporation\u2019s computer. See <em>Cadle Co. v. Errato, </em>supra, 71 Conn. App. 466-67. Finally, exhibit seventy-six was not in any way employed by the court to calculate damages. In fact, the court specifically stated in its memorandum of decision that \u201cthe exact economic effect of all of the deletions is not clear\u201d and that it considered the deletions as evidence of \u201cunauthorized tampering with the computer records at a particularly suspect time.\u201d We accordingly conclude that the court properly admitted and considered exhibits forty-seven and seventy-six and that there was an adequate basis for the damages award.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The defendants next claim that there was an inadequate evidentiary basis for the court to hold Guiseppe Tripodi liable for unpaid rent. The court concluded that Guiseppe Tripodi had failed to make rent payments in the amount of $211,875 during the period after the professional corporation dissolved, but before Guiseppe Tripodi became the owner of the building. We find that there was an adequate evidentiary basis for the court to conclude as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The standard of review for a claim of insufficient evidence is well established. \u201c[W]e must determine, in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, whether the totality of the evidence, including reasonable inferences therefrom, supports the [court\u2019s judgment] .... In making this determination, [t]he evidence must be given the most favorable construction in support of the verdict of which it is reasonably capable. ... In other words, [i]f the [court] could reasonably have reached its conclusion, the verdict must stand, even if this court disagrees with it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Arnone </em>v. Enfield, 79 Conn. App. 501, 508, 831 A.2d 260, cert, denied, 266 Conn. 932, 837 A.2d 804 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Following the breakup of the professional corporation, Tadros and Alosco moved their practice to a different location. From April, 2001, when the parties agreed that Guiseppe Tripodi would remain in the practice\u2019s former offices, until May, 2003, when Guiseppe Tripodi acquired title to the building, Guiseppe Tripodi remained a tenant of the landlord real estate corporation. He did not, however, pay the full rent that the professional corporation previously had paid. Of the $316,875 in rent due during that period, Guiseppe Tripodi paid only $105,000, leaving an unpaid balance of $211,875. In its memorandum of decision, the court stated that \u201cTripodi had the opportunity to sublet his new office space or bring other partners into his new practice to help generate more income and defray the rental costs, but he did not do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The defendants raise several arguments, all purporting to address the adequacy of the evidentiary basis of the court\u2019s decision. Specifically, they claim that (1) there was no evidence adduced at trial that Guiseppe Tripodi possessed authority to enter into a lease unilaterally or to sublease on behalf of the real estate corporation, (2) even if Guiseppe Tripodi had the legal authority to negotiate a lease or sublease, it was unlikely that he could have found a viable tenant due to the fact that the property was the subject of a foreclosure action and (3) the rent charged was inflated to allow for payment of debt service on the real estate corporation\u2019s loan. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">In order for the court to award damages for unpaid rent in this case, it had to make three findings of fact. It had to conclude that Guiseppe Tripodi occupied the office space as a tenant, that he did not pay the rent due and that the rent due was fair market rent. Guiseppe Tripodi\u2019s lack of authority to negotiate on behalf of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>real estate corporation is of no consequence. His ability or inability to find a subtenant or partner to help defray costs is irrelevant to the court\u2019s decision to award damages. Thus, even if that finding of fact is unsupported by the evidence, it is harmless. Furthermore, the defendants attack only the court\u2019s finding that Guiseppe Tripodi could have sublet some of the office space to defray costs. They ignore the court\u2019s finding, announced in the same sentence, that Guiseppe Tripodi could have brought on other partners or employees to the same end. The defendants\u2019 argument necessarily fails where they dispute one finding of fact and ignore another independently sufficient factual basis for the same outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">We need not address the defendants\u2019 next argument, that a sublease would have been impracticable due to the foreclosure action, because of our conclusion regarding their first argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The defendants\u2019 third claim of insufficient evidence is that the evidence did not support the court\u2019s conclusion that the rent the real estate corporation charged Guiseppe Tripodi was a fair amount. Specifically, they argue that the rent was inflated to reflect the real estate corporation\u2019s debt and that because the parties were not on speaking terms, they did not negotiate a new rental amount after Tadros and Alosco moved their new practice to a different building. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">The evidence at trial showed that the parties, including Alosco, who did not own an interest in the real estate corporation, and Guiseppe Tripodi, himself, agreed on the rent to be paid by the professional corporation. The real estate corporation did not raise the rent after Alosco and Tadros moved out. Guiseppe Tripodi used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>the entire second floor of the office building and was charged the same rent that the professional corporation had been charged for the same space for more than one decade. We can find no reason to disturb the court\u2019s finding that the rent to which Guiseppe Tripodi had himself agreed in an arm\u2019s length transaction was the fair market rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The defendants next claim that the court improperly awarded prejudgment interest on the damages for unpaid rent. There is, however, no analysis of that claim in the defendants\u2019 brief. Accordingly, we consider that claim abandoned. E.g., <em>Updike, Kelly &amp; Spellacy, P.C. </em>v. <em>Beckett, </em>269 Conn. 613, 642-43, 850 A.2d 145 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">The defendants\u2019 final claim is that the court improperly ordered the garnishment of surplus funds held by the Superior Court clerk following the foreclosure sale of the real estate corporation\u2019s building. Specifically, they argue that the court lacked the authority to order the garnishment of funds held by the clerk of the Superior Court. Although it is true in the abstract that a court cannot order the garnishment of funds held by a court official or other state official; see <em>Herzig </em>v. <em>Horrigan, </em>34 Conn. App. 816, 821, 644 A.2d 360 (1994); we do not agree that the court\u2019s order in this case was a garnishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">\u201cIssues concerning a court\u2019s authority to act are issues of law over which our review is plenary.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, 85 </em>Conn. App. 27, 37, 856 A.2d 452, cert, denied, 271 Conn. 933, 859 A.2d 931 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">Guiseppe Tripodi purchased the real estate corporation\u2019s building at auction following the Supreme Court\u2019s order of remand to the trial court. See <em>Tadros </em>v. <em>Mid-dlebury Medical Center, Inc., </em>263 Conn. 235, 820 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>230 (2003) (inteipreting language granting right of first refusal to a third party as inapplicable in foreclosure situation and approving sale of real estate corporation\u2019s building to Tripodi). The clerk of the Superior Court currently holds the proceeds of the sale payable to the real estate corporation, which in turn is one-half owned by Guiseppe Tripodi. Following the entry of judgment for the plaintiffs in the consolidated trial, the plaintiffs successfully moved for a prejudgment remedy<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> ordering the Superior Court clerk to hold the remaining funds left from the foreclosure sale and attaching other assets owned by the defendants<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in order to satisfy the judgments awarded. The same trial court, <em>Schuman, J., </em>presided over both the consolidated trial and the foreclosure action. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">This issue occurs at the intersection of legal and equitable doctrines. On the one hand is the principle of sovereign immunity, which prohibits the garnishment of funds held by court officers. See <em>Herzig </em>v. <em>Horrigan, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 821; 2 E. Stephenson, Connecticut Civil Procedure (3d Ed. 2002) \u00a7 107 (e), pp. 23-24. On the other hand, \u201c[t]he distribution of a surplus from a foreclosure sale lies within the equity jurisdiction of the court.\u201d <em>Bryson </em>v. <em>Newtown Real Estate &amp; Development </em>Corp., 153 Conn. 267, 273, 216 A.2d 176 (1965). The rejoinder is that the funds at issue were \u201cbrought into court\u201d and held by the court pending further distribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>tion by order of the court and, as such, the concerns that support the principle of sovereign immunity do not apply. See General Statutes \u00a7 49-27.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u201c[T]he sovereign immunity doctrine rests ... on the purpose of preventing serious interference with governmental functions and the imposition of enormous fiscal burdens on the state by subjecting its government to private litigation.\u201d <em>Herzig </em>v. <em>Horrigan, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 819. In this case, the court simply ordered its clerk to hold, rather than to distribute, funds. Thus, there is no concern with interference with governmental functions or the imposition of any fiscal burdens on the state. In <em>Segal </em>v. <em>Segal, </em>86 Conn. App. 617, 637, 863 A.2d 221 (2004), this court recently affirmed the order of the trial court directing the court clerk to pay to a party the proceeds of a partition sale. We concluded that because the clerk came into possession of the proceeds as a direct result of a court order and because it was a one time disbursement that would not cause any administrative difficulty, this was not a garnishment implicating sovereign immunity concerns. Id. That is also the case here. This case, furthermore, is not the typical one of a third party garnishing his debtor\u2019s assets. The parties in interest in the foreclosure action are the same parties in interest in the consolidated cases we affirmed in parts I through III. We accordingly conclude that the court\u2019s order with respect to the funds from the foreclosure sale was not a garnishment of funds held by the court clerk and that the court had the authority to order the clerk to hold rather than to distribute the funds pending the outcome of this and any further appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-5\"> For clarity and for consistency with the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision, we shall classify Tadros, Thomas Alosco, the professional corporation and the real estate corporation as the plaintiffs and Guiseppe Tripodi, his wife, Concetta Tripodi, and Guiseppe Tripodi\u2019s entity, Middlebury Surgical, LLC, as the defendants.
