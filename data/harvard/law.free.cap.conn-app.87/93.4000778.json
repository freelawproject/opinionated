We agree with the defendant with respect to his fourth claim only and reverse in part the judgment of the trial court. We affirm all other aspects of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On October 19,1999, the defendant, Carl Johnson and Rashad Smith were sitting in a stolen black Honda Accord <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> near 85 Wolcott Hill Road in Wethersfield. The trio had smoked marijuana. Sometime after darkness fell, the victim, Michael Clarke, returned to Camilleri and Clarke Associates, Inc., the insurance brokerage firm located there, of which he was an owner. He had left his motor vehicle, a black Lincoln Mark VIII valued at approximately $28,000,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the firm\u2019s parking lot. After the victim had been in the building for some time, his dog began to bark, and so the victim went outside. After the victim left the building, he was accosted by the defendant and Johnson. The defendant wore a red <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>sweatshirt or parka.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The victim was instructed to turn over the keys to his vehicle. One of the men pointed a gun at the victim, and told him to go back into the building and to his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In the office, while one of the men continued to point the gun at the victim, the other held the victim. The defendant and Johnson took the victim\u2019s laptop computer and credit card.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They threatened the victim and ordered him to provide the access code for the card so that they could use it to obtain cash.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Johnson took the computer while the defendant took the credit card. The defendant and Johnson stated that they were going to take the victim to the car, and after he protested and resisted, he was struck twice in the face with the gun. The victim was pushed outside, continued to struggle with the two men and broke away from them before being forced into the car. The victim started to flee and called out for help, but was soon tackled by Johnson. The victim then struggled with the defendant, who took out a .22 caliber Beretta and shot the victim in the head.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant and Johnson fled the scene in the victim\u2019s Lincoln while Smith drove the Honda Accord.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Oscar Rivera, a Wethersfield police officer, arrived at the scene after being notified of the assault. He found the victim lying on the ground in the parking lot, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>was otherwise empty. At that time, the victim was responsive, but had suffered visible injuries. Medical personal subsequently transferred the victim to Hartford Hospital for treatment. The victim was hospitalized for nine to ten days and then was transferred to a rehabilitation facility for an additional seven weeks of therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Leslie Higgins, an employee of United Services Automobile Association, the company that issued the victim\u2019s credit card, testified that on the night of the shooting, there were several attempts at various automatic teller machines to obtain cash with the card taken by the defendant. The first three attempts were declined due to an incorrect access code, and the fourth failed as a result of an automatic lock out due to the previous incorrect access codes. Higgins further testified that the defendant\u2019s card was used on October 21, 1999, to make several purchases, totaling several hundred dollars, at various stores in Manchester. Eventually, a hold was placed on the account due to suspected fraudulent activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">On October 24, 1999, Sergeant Robert Whitty of the Avon police department stopped a black Honda Accord carrying the defendant, Johnson, Smith and Damion Kelly. A search of that vehicle revealed the victim\u2019s credit card, credit card receipts that matched the victim\u2019s credit card, items purchased with the victim\u2019s credit card and a .22 caliber bullet that subsequently was determined to have been of the same caliber used in the shooting. Additionally, after searching the defendant\u2019s residence, the police recovered a pair of the defendant\u2019s boots that were stained with the victim\u2019s blood, a computer case containing the victim\u2019s business card and a red jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">The defendant subsequently was arrested, tried before the jury and convicted on all of the fifteen counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>with which he had been charged. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly denied his motion for a mistrial. Specifically, he argues that one of the state\u2019s witnesses made reference to his prior misconduct despite an agreement between the parties to avoid using such testimony and that no curative instruction could have alleviated the resulting prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">At the outset, we identify the appropriate standard of review. \u201cWhile the remedy of a mistrial is permitted under the rules of practice, it is not favored. [A] mistrial should be granted only as a result of some occurrence upon the trial of such a character that it is apparent to the court that because of it a party cannot have a fair trial . . . and the whole proceedings are vitiated. . . . If curative action can obviate the prejudice, the drastic remedy of a mistrial should be avoided. . . . On appeal, we hesitate to disturb a decision not to declare a mistrial. The trial judge is the arbiter of the many circumstances which may arise during the trial in which his function is to assure a fair and just outcome. . . . The trial court is better positioned than we are to evaluate in the first instance whether a certain occurrence is prejudicial to the defendant and, if so, what remedy is necessary to cure that prejudice. . . . The decision whether to grant a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Label Systems Corp. </em>v. <em>Aghamohammadi, </em>270 Conn. 291, 316-17, 852 A.2d 703 (2004); <em>State </em>v. <em>Taft, </em>258 Conn. 412, 418, 781 A.2d 302 (2001). Put another way, \u201c[o]n appeal, the defendant bears the burden of establishing that there was irreparable prejudice to the defendant\u2019s case such that it denied him a fair trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Taveras, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>49 Conn. App. 639, 652, 716 A.2d 120, cert, denied, 247 Conn. 917, 722 A.2d 809 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. Prior to the start of the trial, the defendant filed a motion in limine with respect to certain uncharged misconduct. Specifically, the defendant sought to prohibit reference to his involvement in a carjacking that had occurred in East Hartford and for which he had been convicted. Prior to the court\u2019s ruling, the prosecutor stated that he did not oppose the motion; furthermore, he did not intend to introduce any evidence relating to the East Hartford incident. He informed the court that all of the state\u2019s witnesses had been instructed to avoid discussing the East Hartford incident. The court noted that if the issue arose during the trial, the court was to be warned in advance and that it would make a ruling outside of the jury\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">During the second day of evidence, Detective Mark Miele of the Wethersfield police department testified that he had met the defendant on October 25, 1999. He interviewed the defendant regarding the crimes underlying this appeal. After initially denying his involvement, the defendant subsequently admitted to being a participant in the Wethersfield incident. Miele testified in relevant part that the defendant \u201cstated that [he], another individual . . . Johnson, and a third individual . . . Smith, were riding around in a stolen Honda Accord that they had acquired from another individual in the town of East Hartford some days before, and that that night, they were going to look to carjack another individual and . . : take the car from that person if they could find a car that they liked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Defense counsel immediately objected, and, outside of the presence of the jury, made an oral motion for a mistrial. The prosecutor apologized to the court, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>argued that Miele\u2019s comment did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial and, therefore, a mistrial was not warranted. He further stated that he did not object to the court\u2019s striking that portion of Miele\u2019s testimony or the court\u2019s issuing a limiting instruction to the jury. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion in an oral ruling and allowed the defendant time during the luncheon recess to consider whether to request a limiting instruction. The defendant subsequently declined any limiting instruction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">On appeal, the defendant argues that Miele\u2019s testimony making reference to the East Hartford incident resulted in prejudice that warranted a mistrial. Our review of the record, however, persuades us that Miele\u2019s statement did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial, thereby requiring the court to grant the motion for a mistrial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>265 Conn. 35, 75, 826 A.2d 1126 (2003). Miele testified after the jury had heard from several witnesses. Smith, who testified before Miele, stated that he had been arrested in East Hartford with the defendant and Johnson. Furthermore, Miele, prior to his statement, informed the jury that he knew that the defendant was in the custody of the East Hartford police department on a matter unrelated to Miele\u2019s investigation of the Wethersfield incident. It is clear that the jury was aware that the defendant had been involved in some activity that resulted in the East Hartford police taking him into custody. We also note that Miele did not state that the victim in the East Hartford incident was injured during the criminal activity; instead, the jury merely learned that the defendant previously had been involved in a carjacking. We cannot conclude that this information alone deprived the defendant of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>We have declined to find an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion in cases in which a party failed to adhere to a ruling on a motion in limine or some misstatement was made in the presence of the jury. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>76 Conn. App. 1, 10-14, 818 A.2d 134 (two prejudicial remarks concerning defendant\u2019s misconduct made during testimony before jury), cert, denied, 264 Conn. 906, 826 A.2d 178 (2003); <em>State </em>v. <em>Taveras, </em>supra, 49 Conn. App. 650-53 (four references made to defendant\u2019s uncharged misconduct during testimony before jury). In those cases, the court issued a limiting instruction and struck the testimony. \u201cA reviewing court gives great weight to curative instructions in assessing error.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>supra, 13. In this case, however, the defendant was given two opportunities to have the court issue such an instruction, once immediately after Miele\u2019s statement and once following the luncheon recess prior to the continuation of Miele\u2019s testimony. At both times, the defendant refused the limiting instruction and the offer to strike the statement. \u201c[M]ost important, the defendant declined a cautionary instruction on the matter. The trial court could have decided that the testimony, even if prejudicial enough to warrant an instruction, did not call for a mistrial. Defense counsel cannot opt for a mistrial instead of a curative instruction, as if the two were interchangeable. If defense counsel decides to move for mistrial and altogether eschews the instruction, the trial court cannot be compelled by that decision to go further than it otherwise would.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McNellis, </em>15 Conn. App. 416, 437-38, 546 A.2d 292, cert, denied, 209 Conn. 809, 548 A.2d 441 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that Miele\u2019s isolated statement did not rise to the level of denying the defendant his right to a fair trial. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>ingly, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly admitted into evidence testimony from his prior trial. Specifically, he argues that the court abused its discretion by allowing that testimony to be read to the jury. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of that issue. On March 28,2002, after several days of testimony, defense counsel filed a motion in limine to preclude the state from introducing evidence from the defendant\u2019s prior trial. The state sought to introduce a letter written by the defendant to Johnson. Although the letter was to be redacted, the state wanted to present to the jury the defendant\u2019s statement that if Johnson took responsibility for his crime, then the defendant would take responsibility for what he did. Defense counsel objected, arguing that the letter did not have any probative value and, in any case, the prejudicial impact was too severe. The court, after detailed discussions with counsel, allowed a portion of the defendant\u2019s prior testimony to be read to the jury. The following colloquy between the defendant and the prosecutor from the defendant\u2019s prior trial on December 13, 2000, was read to the juiy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-9\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Now, turning your attention to state\u2019s [exhibit] forty, the letter that starts, \u2018Yo, Carl,\u2019 the third sentence says: \u2018Yo, if you take your body, I\u2019ll take responsibility for what I did.\u2019 Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-10\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-11\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: You indicated yesterday [December 12, 2000] that that was reference to \u2014 that that phrase, \u2018I\u2019ll take responsibility for what I did,\u2019 was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>reference to [the Wethersfield incident], an unrelated matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-7\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Going on . . . \u2018When me and [Smith] were talking, made a lot of plans and got our\u2019\u2014 that document says \u2014 \u2018stories straight\u2019 and you indicated that was, again, a reference to an unrelated matter, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-8\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-9\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Now, the reference . . . \u2018I\u2019ll take responsibility for what I did,\u2019 in that sentence where [the letter states] \u2018me and [Smith] were talking,\u2019 we \u2018made a lot of plans and got our stories straight.\u2019 Those two references are references to the Wethersfield incident, isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-10\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-11\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: And isn\u2019t it true, sir, that in the Wethersfield case on Tuesday, October 19, 1999, you, sir, were involved in an incident, which involved a robbery at gunpoint and the theft of a late model Lincoln car, and also [were] involved in the pushing of the gentleman, the owner of the Lincoln, into or an attempt to push the owner of that Lincoln into that vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-12\">\u201c[The Defendant]: I don\u2019t remember seeing nothing like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-13\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Pardon me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-14\">\u201c[The Defendant]: I don\u2019t remember seeing nothing like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-15\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Were you involved in those situations, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-16\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Yes. But I didn\u2019t see nobody get pushed into no car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>\u201c[The Prosecutor]: You were involved in a robbery and a larceny.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: The theft of a late model Lincoln.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: At gunpoint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-10\">\u201c[The Defendant]: Correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">The defendant did not request that the court give a limiting instruction with respect to that testimony. The defendant now claims that the court improperly admitted the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">At the outset, we identify the standard of review and legal principles that guide the resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. \u201cOur standard of review regarding challenges to a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings is that these rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the [defendant] of substantial prejudice or injustice. . . . In reviewing claims that the trial court abused its discretion, great weight is given to the trial court\u2019s decision and every reasonable presumption is given in favor of its correctness. . . . We will reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling only if it could not reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hurdle, </em>85 Conn. App. 128, 137, 856 A.2d 493, cert, denied, 271 Conn. 942, 861 A.2d 516 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">\u201c[E]vidence may be excluded by the trial court if the court determines that the prejudicial effect of the evidence outweighs its probative value. ... Of course, [a]ll adverse evidence is damaging to one\u2019s case, but it is inadmissible only if it creates undue prejudice so that it threatens an injustice were it to be admitted. . . . The test for determining whether evidence is unduly prejudicial is not whether it is damaging to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>defendant but whether it will improperly arouse the emotions of the jury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bennett-Gibson, </em>84 Conn. App. 48, 66, 851 A.2d 1214, cert, denied, 271 Conn. 916, 859 A.2d 570 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">In the present case, the court admitted into evidence the defendant\u2019s testimony from his prior trial. Such statements are generally admissible as an exception to the rule against hearsay. <em>See State v. Calderon, </em>82 Conn. App. 315, 325, 844 A.2d 866, cert, denied, 270 Conn. 905, 853 A.2d 523, cert, denied, 543 U.S. 982 125 S. Ct. 487, 160 L. Ed. 2d 361 (2004); Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-3 (1). The defendant argues that the testimony had little probative value and was clearly outweighed by its prejudicial effect. The defendant contends that once the jury heard his prior testimony, it was predisposed to conclude that because he had been involved in a prior violent carjacking, he was guilty of the present charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">We conclude that the court properly weighed the prejudicial impact that the testimony would have on the defendant, along with its probative value. The state argued that the testimony constituted an admission because the defendant acknowledged a fact or circumstance from which guilt may be inferred and, further, that it was offered to rebut the claim that the defendant was a passive or unknowing participant in the criminal activity. The court properly exercised its discretion in determining that the testimony was relevant on the basis of those rationales. We note further that the court minimized any potential prejudice by declining to admit the actual letter and redacting the testimony itself. Finally, the statement, \u201cif you take your body, I\u2019ll take responsibility for what I did,\u201d does not indicate that the defendant engaged in prior violent activity, particularly when the statement is viewed in context. Instead, it demonstrates that Johnson was responsible for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u201cbody\u201d while the defendant was involved with what he \u201cdid,\u201d which does not necessarily mean a violent act. In short, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the defendant\u2019s prior testimony into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly instructed the jury as to an essential element of larceny. Specifically, he argues that the court failed to define \u201cto appropriate\u201d during its instruction, thereby denying him due process of law. We conclude that any such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of that issue. Count fourteen of the information charged the defendant with larceny in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-122 (a) (3) and alleged in relevant part that the defendant, \u201cwith intent to deprive another of property and to appropriate the same to himself and to a third person, did wrongfully take, obtain and withhold such property from an owner and such property was a motor vehicle, the value of which exceeded ten thousand dollars . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The court instructed the jury that to find the defendant guilty, the state had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he had committed larceny, as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119, and that the property consisted of a motor vehicle, the value of which exceeded $10,000. The court then defined larceny, stating: \u201cA person commits larceny when, with intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to himself or to a third person, he wrongfully takes, obtains or withholds such property from an owner.\u201d The court continued, stating that \u201c[t]o intend to deprive another of property means to intend to withhold or keep it or cause it to be withheld from another permanently, or, for so long a period or under such circumstances that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>the major portion of its value is lost to that person.\u201d The court proceeded with its instruction without providing the jury with the statutory definition of the term \u201cto appropriate.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The defendant concedes that his claim was not preserved and seeks review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). \u201cIn <em>Golding, </em>our Supreme Court held that a defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions axe met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail. <em>The appellate tribunal is free, therefore, to respond to the defendant\u2019s claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances. . . . </em>The first two questions relate to whether a defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable, and the last two relate to the substance of the actual review.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bangulescu, </em>80 Conn. App. 26, 32, 832 A.2d 1187, cert, denied, 267 Conn. 907, 840 A.2d 1171 (2003). We agree with the defendant that the record is adequate for our review and that the claim is of constitutional magnitude. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>84 Conn. App. 283, 300-301, 853 A.2d 532, cert, denied, 271 Conn. 928, 859 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>A.2d 584 (2004). We conclude, however, that his claim fails under the fourth prong of Golding.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\u201cA jury instruction that improperly omits an essential element from the charge constitutes harmless error if a reviewing court concludes beyond a reasonable doubt that the omitted element was <em>unconlesled and supported by overwhelming evidence, </em>such that the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirk R., </em>271 Conn. 499, 517, 857 A.2d 908 (2004); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Faust, </em>237 Conn. 454, 470, 678 A.2d 910 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">In the present case, Smith extensively testified regarding the plan to steal the victim\u2019s motor vehicle. Smith stated that Johnson, after seeing the Lincoln, stated that he saw something that he wanted and that the defendant nodded in agreement. Smith watched the defendant and Johnson come out of the building, fight with the victim and then take the victim\u2019s motor vehicle. Smith followed in the Honda Accord as the defendant and Johnson drove the victim\u2019s vehicle to Johnson\u2019s home in East Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>The jury also heard testimony that the defendant had admitted to Miele in a written statement that he had been involved in the Wethersfield incident. \u201cIn the context of harmless error analysis, our Supreme Court has noted that a confession, if sufficiently corroborated, is the most damaging evidence of guilt . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Holliday, </em>85 Conn. App. 242, 248, 856 A.2d 1041, cert, denied, 271 Conn. 945, 861 A.2d 1178 (2004). Additionally, a confession that is corroborated generally \u201cwill constitute the overwhelming evidence necessary to render harmless any errors at trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>269 Conn. 563, 596, 849 A.2d 626 (2004). Miele testified that the defendant had stated that he, Johnson and Smith had planned to take a vehicle by force if necessary. After seeing the victim\u2019s Lincoln, they decided that it was the vehicle they were going to steal. Miele read a portion of the defendant\u2019s written statement to the jury. In his statement, the defendant stated that \u201c[i]t was Carl Johnson, Rashad Smith and me who robbed the guy in Wethersfield and stole his Lincoln sometime last week.\u201d The defendant\u2019s statement also included a description of what he was wearing \u201c[t]he night we stole the Lincoln . . . .\u201d The defendant\u2019s statements indicated that he and Johnson drove the victim\u2019s vehicle for a period of time before abandoning it. Finally, we note that the jury heard the defendant\u2019s statements from his other trial that he was involved in the theft of the Lincoln in Wethersfield that occurred on October 19, 1999. See part II.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">On the basis of the foregoing, including the defendant\u2019s confession, combined with the corroboration of Smith\u2019s testimony, we conclude that the record establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the element of larceny that was incompletely defined by the court, namely, \u201cto appropriate,\u201d was uncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence. We further conclude that the verdict would have been the same had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>jury been given the definition that was missing. We determine that the court\u2019s incomplete jury instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, as the evidence establishing that the defendant had appropriated the victim\u2019s vehicle was overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court improperly violated the prohibition against double jeopardy by sentencing him on six counts of conspiracy offenses. Specifically, the defendant argues that the jury convicted him of six conspiracies<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> arising out of a single plan.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendant further argues that pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>221 Conn. 447, 604 A.2d 1294 (1992), he can be punished only for the one conspiracy. In both its brief and at oral argument, the state agrees with the defendant\u2019s arguments with respect to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u201cThe double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides: [N]or shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb .... The double jeopardy clause is applicable to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. . . . Although the Connecticut constitution has no specific double jeopardy provision, we have held that the due process guarantees of article first, \u00a7 9, include protection against double jeopardy. . . . We have recognized that the Double Jeopardy Clause consists of several protections: It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense. . . . These protections stem from the underlying premise that a defendant should not be twice tried or punished for the same offense. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\u201cWhether the object of a single agreement is to commit one or many crimes, it is in either case that agreement which constitutes the conspiracy which the statute punishes. The one agreement cannot be taken to be several agreements and hence several conspiracies because it envisages the violation of several statutes rather than one. . . . The single agreement is the prohibited conspiracy, and however diverse its objects it violates but a single statute .... For such a violation, only the single penalty prescribed by the statute can be imposed.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Arceniega, </em>73 Conn.

The appropriate remedy under these circumstances is to remand the case to the trial court with direction to merge the conviction of the six conspiracy offenses and to vacate the sentences for five of them. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>supra, 221 Conn. 463; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 85 Conn. App. 814-15; <em>State </em>v. <em>Elsey, </em>supra, 81 Conn.

In <em>Spillane, </em>the information charged the defendant only with the <em>\u201cintent to appropriate </em>a motor vehicle . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)

In the present case, however, the state charged the defendant with the intent to deprive and the intent to appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">\u201cConnecticut courts have interpreted the essential elements of larceny as (1) the wrongful taking or carrying away of the personal property of another; (2) the existence of a felonious intent in the taker to deprive the owner of [the property] permanently; and (3) the lack of consent of the owner.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Flowers, </em>69 Conn.

Therefore, intent is often inferred from conduct . . . and from the cumulative effect of the circumstantial evidence and the rational inferences drawn therefrom. ... In a conspiracy prosecution, when determining both a defendant\u2019s specific intent to agree and his specific intent that the criminal ads be performed, the jury may rely on reasonable inferences from facts in the evidence and may develop a chain of inferences, each link of which may depend for its validity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>on the validity of the prior link in the chain.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Oberdick, </em>74 Conn.
