Gomes, appeals from the summary judgment rendered by the trial court in favor of the defendant, Massachusetts Bay Insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Company.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly concluded that he was not entitled to coverage under the underinsured motorist policy endorsement issued by the defendant. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly (1) construed General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (f) as limiting underinsured motorist coverage to those employees of a named insured who are injured while \u201coccupying\u201d a covered motor vehicle, rather than construing it to require such coverage to any person insured under the liability portion of the policy, (2) concluded that the exception to the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity rule provided by \u00a7 38a-336 (f) does not apply to him because he was not \u201coccupying\u201d a covered motor vehicle within the meaning of the statute and (3) failed to conclude that because he was a named insured under his employer\u2019s policy, he was not barred from collecting underinsured motorist coverage by the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our disposition of this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his complaint, the plaintiff alleged that he was injured on January 11, 2001, while working in his capacity as a volunteer fire policeman for the Pawcatuck fire district (district). Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that he responded to an emergency call, parked his vehicle at a nearby intersection and began directing traffic to carry out his assigned duties. He further alleged that while standing in the middle of the road directing traffic, he was struck from behind by a vehicle driven by the tortfeasor, Stanley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Prachniak, and was seriously injured. The plaintiff applied for and received workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the district for his injuries. The plaintiff also recovered $100,000 from Prachniak\u2019s insurance carrier for the injuries he sustained. The plaintiff brought the present action to collect on the underinsured motorist coverage provided by a policy issued to him by Allstate Insurance Company and by a policy issued to the district by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">On January 28, 2003, the defendant moved for summary judgment, claiming that the plaintiff, as a matter of law, was not entitled to underinsured motorist coverage under the defendant\u2019s policy. In support of its motion, the defendant argued that General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a), the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision, limited the plaintiff to the remedies provided by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant further argued that the underin-sured motorist coverage exception to the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision provided by \u00a7 38a-336 (f) was inapplicable to the plaintiff because he was not occupying a covered motor vehicle at the time of the accident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The plaintiff objected to the defendant\u2019s motion and argued that when interpreted in light of legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>intent, the exception provided by \u00a7 38a-336 (f) was applicable regardless of whether he was occupying a covered vehicle at the time of the accident. In the alternative, the plaintiff argued that the exception was applicable because he was occupying or using a covered vehicle at the time of the accident. In addition to these arguments, at the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff argued that pursuant to <em>Agosto </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>239 Conn. 549, 687 A.2d 1267 (1996), and <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., </em>239 Conn. 537, 687 A.2d 1262 (1996), the terms of the uninsured and underinsured motorist endorsement were ambiguous and that, therefore, the policy must be construed to provide coverage regardless of whether he was occupying a covered vehicle at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">On June 26, 2003, the court issued a memorandum of decision granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court concluded that the exception to the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision provided by \u00a7 38a-336 (f) was not applicable because the plaintiff was \u201cin the middle of an intersection directing traffic when struck\u201d and was not occupying a covered vehicle as \u201cdefined by the policy to mean \u2018in, upon, getting in, on, out or off.\u2019 \u201d The court, therefore, concluded that the plaintiffs recovery was limited to those remedies provided by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The court subsequently rendered judgment in favor of the defendant. On July 10, 2003, the plaintiff filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">On July 16,2003, the plaintiff filed a motion for articulation in which he sought to have the court address his argument that \u00a7 38a-336 (f) was applicable regardless of whether he was occupying a covered vehicle at the time of the accident. The court denied the motion. On November 5, 2003, the plaintiff filed a second motion for articulation regarding the reasons for the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>apparent rejection of the argument based on <em>Agosto </em>that he made during the hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff stated: \u201cIn light of the absence of any indication that the trial court addressed [the] <em>Agosto </em>argument, the plaintiff requests that an articulation be granted in order to create a proper record for this appeal.\u201d On November 13, 2003, the court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Subsequently, the plaintiff filed a motion for review of the court\u2019s November 13, 2003 decision denying the motion for articulation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We granted the plaintiffs motion for review and, citing <em>Agosto, </em>ordered the court to \u201carticulate whether the plaintiff was entitled to uninsured/underinsured motorist benefits as an insured as opposed to \u2018as an occupant\u2019 of a covered motor vehicle.\u201d The order also directed that the articulation include the factual and legal bases for the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The court articulated its decision, explaining that, at the time it issued its decision, it had considered the issue before it to be whether the plaintiff was occupying a covered vehicle rather than whether ambiguity of the policy language entitled the plaintiff to coverage. After reviewing <em>Agosto </em>and <em>Hansen, </em>the court concluded that the policy language was ambiguous and that accordingly, the plaintiff \u201cis entitled to coverage under the uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage policy of the defendant.\u201d In the final sentence of its articulation, the court stated that it \u201ctherefore, reverses itself and denies the motion for summary judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The defendant filed a motion for review in which it asked this court to vacate the trial court\u2019s articulation on the ground that it had exceeded its authority by reversing its prior summary judgment ruling when responding to this court\u2019s order for articulation. We granted the motion and ordered stricken the final sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>tence of the trial court\u2019s articulation reversing its prior ruling.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">On appeal, the plaintiff contends that when the court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, it improperly concluded that, as a matter of law, the plaintiff was not entitled to coverage under the uninsured and underinsured motorist policy endorsement. Before addressing his specific claims, we set forth the applicable standard of review of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment. Practice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d See also <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Stafford Construction, Inc., </em>271 Conn. 78, 83, 856 A.2d 372 (2004). \u201cOur review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant [a] motion for summary judgment is plenary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Quality Steel Products, Inc., </em>263 Conn. 424, 450, 820 A.2d 258 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">In addition, because this appeal involves questions of statutory construction, we set forth our well established principles of statutory interpretation. \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wasko </em>v. <em>Manella, </em>269 Conn. 527, 534, 849 A.2d 777 (2004). \u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>ship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extra-textual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z; see also <em>Carmel Hollow Associates Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Bethlehem, </em>269 Conn. 120, 129, 848 A.2d 451 (2004). When we must consider extratextual evidence of the meaning of a statute, we look \u201cto the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wasko </em>v. <em>Manella, </em>supra, 535. Statutory interpretation is a question of law, over which our review is plenary. <em>Bengtson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>86 Conn. App. 51, 56, 859 A.2d 967 (2004), cert, denied, 272 Conn. 922, 867 A.2d 837 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The plaintiff claims that the court improperly construed \u00a7 38a-336 (f) as limiting underinsured motorist coverage to those employees of a named insured who are injured while \u201coccupying\u201d a covered motor vehicle, rather than construing it to require such coverage to any person insured under the liability portion of the policy. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that a conflict exists between \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (1), which mandates uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage for any person insured under the liability portion of an automobile insurance policy, and \u00a7 38a-336 (f), which limits such coverage to those employees injured while \u201coccupying\u201d a covered motor vehicle. The plaintiff further contends that an absurd and unworkable result will occur if \u00a7 38a-336 (f) is construed as limiting uninsured and underin-sured motorist coverage to those employees \u201coccupying\u201d a covered motor vehicle. The plaintiff argues that the conflicting statutes should be harmonized with the public policy underlying mandatory uninsured and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>underinsured motorist coverage, by interpreting \u00a7 38a-336 (f) as requiring uninsured and underinsured motorist endorsements to provide coverage to <em>any </em>person insured under the liability portion of the policy. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u201cAs with all issues of statutory inteipretation, we look first to the language of the statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Starks </em>v. <em>University of Connecticut, </em>270 Conn. 1, 10, 850 A.2d 1013 (2004). Section 38a-336 (f) provides: \u201cNotwithstanding subsection (a) of section 31-284, an employee of a named insured injured while <em>occupying </em>a covered motor vehicle in the course of employment shall be covered by such insured\u2019s otherwise applicable uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\u201cIn determining the meaning of a statute . . . we look not only at the provision at issue, but also to the broader statutory scheme to ensure the coherency of our construction.\u201d <em>Schiano </em>v. <em>Bliss Exterminating Co., </em>260 Conn. 21, 42, 792 A.2d 835 (2002). Section 38a-336 (f) provides an exception to the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision contained in \u00a7 31-284 (a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This \u201cexclusivity rule\u201d provides that the exclusive remedy for workers injured in the course and scope of employment is provided by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and that the \u201cinjured [workers are] therefore barred from bringing, in most cases, common law actions against their employers for job-related injuries whether predicated on common law tort, statute, or contract.\u201d A. Sevarino, Connecticut Workers\u2019 Compensation After Reforms (3d Ed. 2002) \u00a7 4.32.3, p. 521; see also <em>Mello </em>v. <em>Big Y Foods, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 21, 25-26, 826 A.2d 1117 (2003); <em>Sorban </em>v. <em>Sterling Engineering Corp., </em>79 Conn. App. 444, 449, 830 A.2d 372, cert, denied, 266 Conn. 925, 835 A.2d 473 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>The text of \u00a7 38a-336 (f) expressly provides an exception to the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity rule contained in \u00a7 31-284 (a) by allowing an injured employee to collect benefits from his or her employer\u2019s uninsured and underinsured motorist insurance coverage. The text, however, plainly and unambiguously limits the applicability of the exception to those employees injured while <em>occupying </em>a covered motor vehicle. \u201cIn construing the meaning of a statute . . . courts do not torture words to import ambiguity where the ordinary meaning leaves no room for it . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hyllen-Davey </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>57 Conn. App. 589, 599, 749 A.2d 682, cert, denied, 253 Conn. 926, 754 A.2d 796 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The plaintiff contends, however, that construing \u00a7 38a-336 (f) according to its plain and unambiguous meaning will lead to the absurd and unworkable result of limiting coverage required by \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (1). General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (1) provides in relevant part: \u201cEach automobile liability insurance policy shall provide insurance, herein called uninsured and underin-sured motorist coverage, in accordance with the regulations adopted pursuant to section 38a-334 . . . <em>for the protection of persons insured thereunder </em>who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles and underin-sured motor vehicles . . . because of bodily injury, including death resulting therefrom. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Thus, by its terms, \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (1) requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>that each automobile liability policy provide uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage to a class of persons that is coextensive with that insured under the liability section of the policy. <em>Middlesex Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>225 Conn. 257, 267, 622 A.2d 572 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">We are not persuaded that construing \u00a7 38a-336 (f) to limit the uninsured and underinsured motorist exception to the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision to only those employees injured while occupying a covered vehicle will lead to an absurd or unworkable result. We are mindful that our uninsured and underinsured motorist statute \u201cis remedial in nature and designed to protect people injured by [uninsured and underinsured] motorists . . . [and that] remedial statutes should be construed liberally in favor of those whom the law is intended to protect.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gohel </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. </em>Co., 61 Conn. App. 806, 815, 768 A.2d 950 (2001); see also <em>Willoughby </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>254 Conn. 404, 440, 757 A.2d 1083 (2000) <em>(McDonald, C. J., </em>dissenting) (legislative intent underlying uninsured and underinsured motorist statute is to provide protection to broadest number of accident victims).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">We must also consider the remedial purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation statutory scheme, including the exclusivity provision contained in \u00a7 31-284 (a), to which \u00a7 38a-336 (f) provides an exception. \u201cThe Workers\u2019 Compensation Act . . . provides the sole remedy for employees and their dependents for work-related injuries and death. ... Its purpose is to provide a prompt, efficient, simple and inexpensive procedure for obtaining benefits related to employment.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pietraroia </em>v. <em>Northeast Utilities, </em>254 Conn. 60, 74, 756 A.2d 845 (2000). \u201cUnder the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, both the employer and the employee have relinquished certain rights to obtain other advantages. The employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>no longer has to prove negligence on the part of the employer, but, in return, he has to accept a limited, although certain, recovery. . . . The employer, in turn, guarantees compensation to an injured <em>employee in return for the exclusivity </em>of the workers\u2019 compensation liability to its employees.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Quality Steel Products, Inc., </em>supra, 263 Conn. 451. \u201cIn return for the attempt to guarantee, through workers\u2019 compensation insurance, that the injured worker will continue to receive enough income and medical care to enable the injured worker to exist without being a burden to others, the insured employer is released from [other rights and] claims of . . . liability pursuant to [\u00a7] 31-284 (a).\u201d A. Sevarino, supra, \u00a7 1.03, p. 14. The exclusivity provision contained in \u00a7 31-284 (a) manifests a legislative policy decision that a limitation on remedies is an appropriate trade-off for the benefits provided by workers\u2019 compensation. <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>General Nutrition Corp., </em>252 Conn. 215, 220-21, 752 A.2d 1069 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Prior to the enactment of \u00a7 38a-336 (f), our Supreme Court held that the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision contained in \u00a7 31-284 (a) precluded an employee injured while operating the employer\u2019s vehicle in the course of employment from seeking uninsured or underinsured motorist benefits directly from a self-insured employer; <em>Bouley </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>222 Conn. 744, 761, 610 A.2d 1245 (1992); or from the employer\u2019s insurance carrier. <em>CNA Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Colman, </em>222 Conn. 769, 773-74, 610 A.2d 1257 (1992). In 1993, the General Assembly legislatively overruled <em>Bouley </em>and <em>Colman </em>when it enacted \u00a7 38a-336 (f). In <em>Reliance Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>American Casually Co. of Reading, Pennsylvania, </em>238 Conn. 285, 679 A.2d 925 (1996), in holding that \u00a7 38a-336 (f) applied retroactively, our Supreme Court stated that the statute was \u201cintended to be clarifying legislation and, as such, must be accepted as a declaration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>legislature\u2019s original intent pertaining to the <em>interplay </em>between the uninsured motorist provision of . . . \u00a7 38a-336 and the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision of \u00a7 31-284.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Although the plaintiff urges this court to harmonize what he contends to be a continuing conflict between the statutory mandate of uninsured and underinsured coverage and the impact of the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision, we decline to do so because we conclude that the legislature appropriately resolved the conflict when it enacted \u00a7 38a-336 (f). We presume that the legislature acted with knowledge of the existence and contents of both \u00a7 31-284 (a) and \u00a7 38a-336 (a) (1). We also presume that it was mindful of the remedial purposes behind both the uninsured and underinsured motorist statute and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and intended to create a consistent body of law. See <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>204 Conn. 609, 621, 529 A.2d 692 (1987) (legislature presumed to enact statutes with knowledge of existing statutes and with intention of creating consistent body of law); see also <em>Hatt </em>v. <em>Burlington Coat Factory, </em>263 Conn. 279, 310, 819 A.2d 260 (2003) (legislature always presumed to have created harmonious and consistent body of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">On the basis of the language of \u00a7 38a-336 (f), it is apparent that the legislature addressed the <em>interplay </em>between the uninsured and underinsured motorist statute and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act by providing a <em>limited </em>exception to the exclusivity provision. The legislature could have chosen to allow the <em>Bouley </em>and <em>Colman </em>decisions to stand, or it could have chosen to provide a broader exception to the exclusivity provision. Instead, the legislature chose to harmonize the conflicting statutory schemes by providing an exception, while limiting its applicability to those employees \u201cinjured while <em>occupying </em>a covered motor vehicle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (f). \u201cThere is no question that the legislature may, by the language it uses in a statute or a section of a statute, demonstrate its intent that it be limited or restricted.\u201d <em>Taravella, </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>52 Conn. App. 431, 440, 727 A.2d 727 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Even if we were to agree with the plaintiff that consideration of extratextual evidence of the meaning of \u00a7 38a-336 (f) is warranted in this case, we note that the legislative history the plaintiff presented would be <em>insufficient </em>to override the plain and unambiguous text of the statute. The plaintiff argues that the legislature intended to provide coverage for all employees without regard to occupancy and that \u201cuse of statutory language suggesting any restriction on that right must be dismissed as accidental.\u201d The plaintiff further argues that <em>absent </em>any legislative history showing that the legislature expressly intended to limit the applicability of the exception to the exclusivity rule to those employees injured while occupying a covered vehicle, we should ignore the plain and unambiguous text of the statute. These arguments are wholly inconsistent with our well established principles of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">When searching for the legislative intent of the meaning of a statute, we always begin with an examination of the statutory language because it \u201cis the most important factor to be considered . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 563, 816 A.2d 562 (2003); see also General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 l-2z (\u201c[t]he meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself\u2019). When we proceed to consideration of extratex-tual evidence, our inquiry usually confirms that the legislative intent was accurately expressed in the text of the statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>supra, 574. Even when extratextual evidence indicates a different intent from that revealed by the plain and unambiguous meaning of the text, we require it to be sufficiently persuasive before we will \u201cconclude that the legislature intended a different meaning\u201d from the text. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">As discussed, the text of \u00a7 38a-336 (f) is plain and unambiguous and strongly suggests that the legislature intended to limit applicability of the exception to those employees injured while occupying a covered vehicle. We find nothing in the legislative history that persuades us that the legislature intended a meaning contrary to this plain and unambiguous text. We disagree that the legislative history cited by the plaintiff shows an obvious legislative intent that would override the plain meaning of the statute. The legislative history simply reveals discussion regarding the basic purpose of the statute and the reasons underlying its enactment. The mere <em>absence </em>of discussion regarding the limitation of the applicability of the exclusivity exception is insufficient to persuade us that the legislature did not intend the plain meaning of the statute. See <em>Spears </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>263 Conn. 22, 29, 818 A.2d 37 (2003) (where legislative history is silent regarding legislature\u2019s intent in enacting statute, party cannot rely on it to support interpretation contrary to plain and unambiguous text of statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">We conclude that the court properly construed \u00a7 38a-336 (f) as limiting underinsured motorist coverage to those employees of a named insured who are injured while \u201coccupying\u201d a covered motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">We next address the plaintiffs claim that the court improperly concluded that the exception to the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity rule provided by \u00a7 38a-336 (f) does not apply to him because he was not \u201coccupying\u201d a covered motor vehicle within the meaning of the statute. Specifically, the plaintiff contends that the term \u201coccupying\u201d should be interpreted broadly in order to implement the purpose of \u00a7 38a-336 (f), which he argues is to ensure that employees are not barred from the coverage provided by the uninsured and under-insured motorist statute. Accordingly, the plaintiff argues that the term \u201coccupying\u201d as used in \u00a7 38a-336 (f) should be interpreted to include any situation in which an employee is injured while within reasonable physical proximity to a covered motor vehicle and actively engaged in the use of that vehicle. The plaintiff therefore urges this court to reject the \u201cphysical contact\u201d test and adopt the \u201cuse and proximity\u201d test for determining, on a case-by-case basis, whether the employee was injured while occupying a covered vehicle. We disagree with these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">In its memorandum of decision, when discussing whether the term \u201coccupying\u201d as used in \u00a7 38a-336 (f) applied to the plaintiff, the court stated: \u201cOccupying is defined by the policy to mean \u2018in, upon, getting in, on, out or off.\u2019 In the present case the plaintiff was not getting in, or out of a covered vehicle when he was injured .... The plaintiff was not physically touching the covered vehicle and, in fact, was in the middle of an intersection directing traffic when struck .... These facts are not in dispute. General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 (f) applies only to those injured \u2018while occupying a covered motor vehicle . . . .\u2019 Accordingly, because the plaintiff was not in, upon, getting in, out or off a [covered] motor vehicle at the time of the injury, the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is granted.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Presumably because \u00a7 38a-336 (f) does not define \u201coccupying,\u201d the court, understandably, turned to the policy definition. Although this definition may prove instructive, it does not control our interpretation of the meaning of \u201coccupying\u201d as used in \u00a7 38a-336 (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">When a statute does not define a term, we \u201clook to the common understanding of the term as expressed in the dictionary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tele Tech of Connecticut Corp. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>270 Conn. 778, 798, 855 A.2d 174 (2004); see also General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a) (\u201c[i]n the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language\u201d); <em>New England Pipe Corp. </em>v. <em>Northeast Corridor Foundation, </em>271 Conn. 329, 336, 857 A.2d 348 (2004). Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary provides several definitions of \u201coccupy,\u201d including, \u201cto fill up (a place or extent),\u201d and \u201cto hold possession of [something].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">We are also guided by the definition of \u201coccupying\u201d contained in another statute. General Statutes \u00a7 38a-363 (c) provides: \u201c \u2018Occupying\u2019 a vehicle means to be in or upon or entering into or alighting from the vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This definition is not controlling because \u00a7 38a-336 \u00a9 is not one of the specifically enumerated sections to which \u00a7 38a-363 applies. When, however, one statute does not define a term, we may use the definition set forth in another section of the General Statutes concerning the same subject matter to inform our understanding of the term\u2019s meaning.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>271 Conn. 785, 792, 860 A.2d 249 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">In addition to the definitions noted, we are guided by our case precedent regarding interpretation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>meaning of \u201coccupying\u201d and other related language used in uninsured and underinsured motorist policy provisions. In <em>Testone </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>165 Conn. 126, 127-29, 328 A.2d 686 (1973), the plaintiff, a tow track operator injured when a disabled car he was attaching was struck by an uninsured vehicle, attempted to obtain uninsured motorist coverage from the insurer of the tow truck and the insurer of the disabled vehicle. Both policies defined \u201coccupying\u201d as \u201cin or upon or entering into or alighting from\u201d a covered vehicle. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 131, 134. Our Supreme Court held that the plaintiff was not entitled to uninsured motorist coverage because he was not occupying a covered vehicle as the term was defined in the policies. Id., 132, 134. In concluding that the plaintiff was not occupying the tow truck, the court stated that \u201c[t]he fact that the plaintiff was near his employer\u2019s wrecker when injured is of no significance.\u201d Id., 131. In concluding that the plaintiff was not occupying the disabled vehicle, the court stated that because \u201c[t]he plaintiff was not in physical contact with the [disabled] vehicle ... it cannot be said that he was \u2018upon\u2019 that vehicle.\u201d Id., 134. When drawing these conclusions, the court cited with approval several cases that have interpreted similar policy language as meaning that \u201cactual physical contact with the insured vehicle affords coverage . . . .\u201d Id., 133.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>31 Conn. App. 132, 133-34, 623 A.2d 1031, cert, denied, 226 Conn. 911, 628 A.2d 983 (1993), the claimant, who had been a passenger in an insured vehicle when it was involved in a minor accident, was in the process of returning to the vehicle following a discussion with the occupants of the other vehicle when a third vehicle struck the vehicle in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>she had been a passenger, causing it to strike and seriously injure her. The insurance policy defined an \u201cinsured person\u201d for purposes of uninsured motorist coverage as \u201c[a]ny person while in, on, getting into or out of\u2019 a covered vehicle. Id., 133. In applying this language to the facts of the case, the court expressly relied on the <em>Testone </em>court\u2019s approval of the premise that actual physical contact with the insured vehicle affords coverage. The court concluded that \u201c[i]t is clear that coverage is compelled under the circumstances of this case where, at the time of the accident, the [claimant] was in physical contact with the car and she intended to and was taking steps to reenter the vehicle after only a brief interruption in her travels related to the operation of the vehicle.\u201d Id., 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\"><em>Testone </em>and <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>place Connecticut courts among those of several states that \u201chave predicated determinations about whether an individual was \u2018occupying\u2019 an insured vehicle on there being some \u2018physical contact\u2019 with the vehicle.\u201d 1 A. Widiss, Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist Insurance (2d Ed. Rev. 2004) \u00a7 5.2, p. 238 (noting that \u201c \u2018physical contact\u2019 test has not been adopted in most states\u201d). We reiterate that the <em>Testone </em>and <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>decisions relied on the \u201cphysical contact\u201d test when determining whether the language used in uninsured and underin-sured motorist <em>policy provisions </em>entitled the claimant to coverage. In this case, the defendant argues that we must also use the \u201cphysical contact\u201d test for determining whether the term \u201coccupying\u201d as used in \u00a7 38a-336 (f) applies to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The plaintiff, however, urges adoption of the broader \u201cuse and proximity\u201d test. As the name implies, under this test, \u201cjudges usually examine the facts to determine (1) whether the injury occurred while the claimant was in a zone or area that was within reasonable proximity to the insured vehicle, or (2) whether the claimant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>injured while engaged in a task related to the operation, maintenance, or use of the vehicle. If either of these conditions is found to exist, judges usually conclude that claimants are entitled to coverage.\u201d 1 A. Widiss, supra, \u00a7 5.2, p. 238. Underlying the expansive interpretation of coverage terms embodied by this approach are (1) the rule of construction that where terms are ambiguous the policy is to be construed against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured, and (2) the policy choice of maximizing statutorily mandated uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. Id., 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">We decline the invitation to adopt the \u201cuse and proximity\u201d test for three reasons. First, in consideration of the common meaning of the word and the <em>more </em>expansive definitions provided in \u00a7 38a-363 (c), we conclude that \u201coccupying\u201d as used in \u00a7 38a-336 (f) is <em>not </em>ambiguous. Second, as discussed in part I, we conclude that the legislature expressed its policy decision regarding the scope of uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage available to employees when it enacted \u00a7 38a-336 (f), which expressly limits such coverage to those employees injured while \u201coccupying\u201d a covered vehicle. An expansive interpretation of \u201coccupying\u201d would undermine the legislature\u2019s declaration of its intent regarding the interplay of the exclusivity provision of the workers\u2019 compensation laws and the uninsured motorist laws. Third, we are compelled to follow our Supreme Court\u2019s express approval of the \u201cphysical contact\u201d test in <em>Testone </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>supra, 165 Conn. 134, despite the fact that it was applied in the context of interpreting policy rather than statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">In this case, there is no dispute that the plaintiff was not physically touching the covered vehicle and, in fact, was in the middle of an intersection directing traffic when struck. As such, the plaintiff cannot be said to have been occupying a covered vehicle under the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>monly approved usage of the term and in light of the \u201cphysical contact\u201d test. We conclude that the court properly determined that the exception to the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity rule provided by \u00a7 38a-336 (f) does not apply to the plaintiff because he was not occupying a covered motor vehicle within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Finally, we address the plaintiffs claim that as a named insured under his employer\u2019s policy, he is not barred from collecting underinsured motorist coverage by the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision. Specifically, he argues that pursuant to <em>Agosto </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 239 Conn. 549, and <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., </em>supra, 239 Conn. 537, the language in the \u201cwho is an insured\u201d provision of the uninsured and underinsured motorist endorsement is ambiguous and therefore must be construed to provide coverage to the plaintiff as an insured, regardless of whether he was occupying a covered vehicle.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The plaintiff contends that although he collected workers\u2019 compensation benefits from his employer, the exclusivity provision contained in \u00a7 31-284 is inapplicable because he is claiming benefits as an insured \u201cagainst his own insurer\u201d and not merely against his employer\u2019s insurer.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although the defendant concedes that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>plaintiff is a named insured, it argues that the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision nonetheless bars the plaintiffs claim for underinsured motorist coverage under his employer\u2019s policy unless the exception provided by \u00a7 38a-336 (f) is applicable. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">In <em>Hansen, </em>the plaintiffs decedent, who was killed while riding a snowmobile that collided with an underin-sured motor vehicle, was a shareholder and the sole paid employee of a closely held corporation. <em>Hansen </em>v. <em>Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., </em>supra, 239 Conn. 538-40. Our Supreme Court concluded that the commercial automobile liability insurance policy issued to the corporation which contained <em>individual </em>oriented language in the policy along with <em>family member </em>oriented language in the uninsured motorist endorsement \u201cinjected confusion and uncertainty into the coverage afforded by the policy,\u201d and therefore was ambiguous. Id., 548. The court resolved the ambiguity against the insurer and held that the plaintiff was entitled to coverage under the uninsured motorist endorsement. Id., 548-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">In <em>Agosto, </em>which was a companion case of <em>Hansen, </em>the plaintiffs decedent, a state police trooper, was killed during a traffic stop when he was struck by another vehicle while outside of his police cruiser. <em>Agosto </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 239 Conn. 550. Although the policy in the case was issued to a state governmental entity, as opposed to a corporation, our Supreme Court saw no reason to distinguish the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>case from <em>Hansen </em>because \u201c[t]he same problematic language exists here.\u201d Id., 552. The court stated: \u201cOn the basis of our reasoning in <em>Hansen, </em>the defendant in the present case should not have issued an uninsured motorist endorsement containing language referring to individuals and family members when the named insured was a governmental entity.\u201d Id. As in <em>Hansen, </em>the court resolved the ambiguity in the policy language against the insurer and held that the plaintiff\u2019s decedent was entitled to coverage. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In this case, the uninsured and underinsured motorist endorsement included in the commercial automobile insurance policy issued to the district contains language identical to the endorsements at issue in <em>Hansen </em>and <em>Agosto. </em>The coverage provision of the endorsement states in relevant part: \u201cWe will pay all sums the \u2018insured\u2019 is legally entitled to recover as compensatory damages from the owner or driver of an \u2018uninsured motor vehicle.\u2019 The damages must result from \u2018bodily injury\u2019 sustained by the \u2018insured\u2019 caused by an \u2018accident.\u2019 . . .\u201d The \u201cwho is an insured\u201d provision of the endorsement provides a list that includes the following: \u201c1. You. 2. If you are an individual, any \u2018family member.\u2019 3. Anyone else \u2018occupying\u2019 a covered \u2018auto\u2019 . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The plaintiff argues that we should follow <em>Agosto </em>and <em>Hansen, </em>and hold that this language, which is contained in a commercial policy issued to a fire district, is ambiguous and therefore must be construed to provide coverage to the plaintiff as an insured, regardless of whether he was occupying a covered auto. The defendant argues that this case is distinguishable from <em>Hansen </em>and <em>Agosto </em>because, unlike the insurers in those cases, the defendant conceded that the plaintiff is a named insured under the policy and did not attempt to disclaim coverage on that basis. The defendant also contends that we are not bound by <em>Agosto </em>because it has raised an argument not addressed in that case, namely, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>plaintiff, even as a named insured, is not entitled to coverage because he cannot overcome the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The plaintiff argues that the claim for underinsured motorist coverage in <em>Agosto </em>should have been subject to the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision contained in \u00a7 31-284 because, although not stated in the decision, it is likely that the plaintiffs decedent, a state trooper, had recovered workers\u2019 compensation benefits from his employer. The <em>Agosto </em>decision, however, does not discuss the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision or the exception contained in \u00a7 38a-336 (f). The plaintiff argues that this absence of discussion suggests that the decedent\u2019s status as a named insured overrode any need to question whether he was barred by the exclusivity provision. We cannot assume, however, that the exclusivity provision is not a bar to the plaintiff in this case simply because our Supreme Court did not address the issue in a factually similar case.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The plaintiff applied for and received workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the district for his injuries. The plaintiff is now claiming coverage under his employer\u2019s insurance. He argues that, pursuant to <em>Hansen </em>and Agosto, he qualifies as an insured under the underin-sured motorist endorsement and that, pursuant to the employee coverage extension endorsements, he qualifies as a named insured under the liability coverage portion of the policy. Thus, the issue is whether, absent an exception, \u00a7 31-284 bars the plaintiff from claiming underinsured motorist coverage under his employer\u2019s policy despite the fact that he is a named insured. We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Section 31-284 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAll rights and claims between an employer who complies with the [workers\u2019 compensation insurance] requirements of subsection (b) of this section and employees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>or any representatives or dependents of such employees, arising out of personal injury or death sustained in the course of employment are abolished other than rights and claims given by this chapter, provided nothing in this section shall prohibit any employee from securing, by agreement with his employer, additional compensation from his employer for the injury or from enforcing any agreement for additional compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Although the policy provides protection for the plaintiff, the policy is not, as he argues, his own insurance policy. It is his employer\u2019s policy. It is irrelevant that he is a named insured under the policy. Section 31-284 bars all claims made by employees against their employers for injuries sustained in the course of employment other than claims for remedies provided by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Thus, the exclusivity provision bars the plaintiff from claiming underinsured motorist coverage under his employer\u2019s policy, unless an exception applies. As discussed in part I, \u00a7 38a-336 (f) provides a limited exception to the exclusivity provision for those employees \u201cinjured while occupying a covered motor vehicle in the course of employment . . . .\u2019\u2019In part II, however, we concluded that this exception does not apply to the plaintiff under the facts of this case. We conclude that the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision bars the plaintiff from collecting undeiin-sured motorist coverage under his employer\u2019s policy, even though the plaintiff is a named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-5\"> The plaintiff also named Allstate Insurance Company as a defendant, but it was not a party to the motion for summary judgment that is the subject of this appeal.
