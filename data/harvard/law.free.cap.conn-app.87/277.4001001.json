(Leete-Stevens), brought a certified appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court, sustaining the appeal by the plaintiffs, Penny Urbanowicz and Edward Sidor<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the decision of the defendant planning and zoning commission of the town of Enfield (commission) granting a special permit to Leete-Stevens. On appeal, Leete-Stevens claims that the trial court improperly concluded that (1) the appeal was not moot despite a 2001 amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>ment to General Statutes \u00a7 19a-320 (2001 amendment),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) the commission\u2019s approval of the special permit was appealable under General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (a) and (b), (3) Urbanowicz was classically aggrieved, (4) the commission failed to comply with the applicable notice requirements and (5) the commission\u2019s action granting the special permit was void. Although we conclude that the court properly determined that it had subject matter jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal and that the commission lacked jurisdiction to consider ah amended application that Leete-Stevens filed for want of proper notice, we hold that the special permit was voidable, not void. We therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the matter with direction to remand it to the commission for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">The court set forth the following undisputed facts in its memorandum of decision, which was filed on November 21, 2000. In May, 1998, Leete-Stevens, a corporation that provides mortuary services, filed an application with the commission requesting a special permit to operate a crematory and related equipment on its property located at 61 South Road in Enfield (town). The commission caused notice of the public hearing on the application to be published on May 23 and 30, 1998. The notice stated in relevant part: \u201cPH1414.02\u2014 Special Use Permit for operation of a crematory and equipment at 9-1.8 Leete Stevens Enfield Chapels, 61 South Road (Map 73, Lot 88) R-33 zone Leete-Stevens, Inc. applct/owner. [Enfield Zoning Regs. \u00a7] 16-2.9 . . . .\u201d The hearing was held on June 4, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">At the June 4,1998 hearing, the attorney representing Leete-Stevens stated that the application for the special permit had been filed pursuant to \u00a7 16-2.9 of the Enfield <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>zoning regulations,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but that it should have been filed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 19a-320. Members of the commission discussed whether Leete-Stevens should file another application and whether the hearing should be continued to the next date.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The commission, however, proceeded with the hearing, and Richard K. Stevens and a representative of the crematory manufacturer spoke on behalf of the special permit application. Urbanowicz and several other residents of the town spoke in opposition. At the conclusion of the June 4, 1998 hearing, the commission chairman stated that the hearing would be continued to June 18, 1998, for the submission of additional information. The commission failed to cause a notice of the hearing on the amended application to be published prior to the June 18, 1998 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">At the commencement of the June 18, 1998 hearing, the attorney representing Leete-Stevens stated that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>understood that notice of the hearing on the amended application had not been published, that notice would be published and that the hearing would be continued until July 2,1998. He then inquired whether the commission would hear testimony, and he was informed that the commission would hear testimony at that time. The attorney for Leete-Stevens introduced the amended special permit application, which changed the location of the proposed crematory from lot 88 to lots 88 and 89 and indicated that the application was being submitted pursuant to \u00a7 19a-320, rather than the town\u2019s zoning regulations. The architect for the proposed crematory spoke in favor of the second application. Residents of the town spoke both for and against the granting of a special permit for the crematory. The commission continued the hearing until July 2, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">On June 20 and 27, 1998, the commission caused notice of Leete-Stevens\u2019 second application for a special permit to be published. The notice stated in relevant part: \u201cPH 1414.02 \u2014 Application to locate, maintain and conduct a crematory at Leete-Stevens Enfield Chapels, 61 South Road and abutting land (Map 73, Lots 88 &amp; 89) R-33 zone \u2014 Leete-Stevens, Inc. applct/owner. Sections 19a-320, Connecticut General Statutes.\u201d The commission concluded the hearing on the application for a special permit on July 2, 1998. On July 23, 1998, by a vote of four to three, the commission approved the application, stating that it was approving the special permit because the crematory was an accessory to the present use, that it met the requirements of current state statutes and that it would not have a negative effect on the neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The plaintiffs appealed from the commission\u2019s decision pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 (a) and (b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In response, Leete<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Stevens filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, arguing that the Superior Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the appeal because \u00a7 19a-320 does not afford the right to appeal from the commission\u2019s decision regarding location. Leete-Stevens argued, in the alternative, that if the plaintiffs had the right to appeal, that right arose under the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq., and that the plaintiffs had failed to allege facts sufficient to demonstrate classical aggrievement as required by the UAPA. The court, <em>McWeeny, J., </em>denied the motion to dismiss, concluding that the commission\u2019s decision was appealable as a zoning decision under \u00a7 8-8 (a) and (b). In answering the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, Leete-Stevens filed two special defenses. They again alleged the absence of subject matter jurisdiction. The court, <em>Gallagher, J., </em>addressed the first special defense and agreed with Judge McWeeny that the appeal was brought properly under \u00a7 8-8 (a) and (b). <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Leete-Stevens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>alleged, as a second special defense, that the plaintiffs were not aggrieved. Judge Gallagher concluded that Urbanowicz was statutorily and classically aggrieved. <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">At trial, Leete-Stevens further argued that the commission was not required to publish a new notice of a continued hearing and that Leete-Stevens\u2019 \u201cminor revision\u201d to the application and site did not constitute a second application that required publication of notice. The court disagreed, finding that the original application was modified to include lot 89 and that the modification constituted a new application that required notice of the public hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Citing <em>Lauer </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>220 Conn. 455, 461, 600 A.2d 310 (1991), the court reasoned that when the notice required is constructive notice to the general public, failure to provide notice in the proper fashion is a defect implicating subject matter jurisdiction. The court therefore concluded that the commission\u2019s failure to publish notice regarding the amended application, which was to be considered at the June 18, 1998 public hearing, was a jurisdictional defect and that the special permit was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Thereafter, the parties filed numerous motions, including a motion filed by the plaintiffs to enforce the court\u2019s judgment, as Leete-Stevens had constructed and was operating the crematory as described in the second application. The court ruled on the motions in memo-randa of decision, respectively, that will be addressed where relevant to the issues on appeal. On May 24, 2002, Leete-Stevens filed a petition for certification to appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s judgment sustaining the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from the commission\u2019s granting Leete-Stevens a special permit. This court granted certification to appeal, and Leete-Stevens appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Leete-Stevens\u2019 first two claims on appeal concern the Superior Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction to consider the appeal from the commission. We will address those claims simultaneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Leete-Stevens first claims that the court improperly concluded that the appeal was not moot due to the 2001 amendment to \u00a7 19a-320 and, second, that the court improperly concluded that the commission\u2019s granting Leete-Stevens a special permit was appealable under \u00a7 8-8 (a) and (b). We disagree, but address the claims in reverse order.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Leete-Stevens filed a motion to dismiss the appeal in the Superior Court, claiming that \u00a7 19a-320 did not provide for an appeal, but that if an appeal were permitted, it had to be brought pursuant to the UAPA, not our zoning statutes. Judge McWeeny concluded that the commission\u2019s decision was a zoning matter, appealable under \u00a7 8-8 (a) and (b). In sustaining the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, Judge Gallagher also concluded, with respect to Leete-Stevens\u2019 first special defense, that the appeal was a zoning matter. Judge Gallagher cited the pertinent language of \u00a7 19a-230: \u201cThe location of such crematory . . . shall be within the confines of a plot of land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>approved for the location of a crematory by the selectmen of any town . . . provided, in any town . . . having a zoning commission, such commission shall have the authority to grant such approval. ...\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 19a-320. She concluded that \u00a7 19a-320 (a) delegates authority to the commission to approve the location of the crematory.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">On July 23,2001, Leete-Stevens filed a motion to open the judgment and to dismiss the appeal. The legal basis of the motion to dismiss was grounded in the 2001 amendment to \u00a7 19a-320, which the legislature passed during a special session in June, 2001. The 2001 amendment provides: \u201cThis section shall not apply to any resident of this state or any corporation formed under the law of this state that was issued an air quality permit by the Department of Environmental Protection prior to October 1,1998.\u201d Public Acts, Spec. Sess., June, 2001, No. 01-4, \u00a7 28 (Spec. Sess. 01-4). In support of its motion to open the judgment and to dismiss the appeal, Leete-Stevens argued that it is a Connecticut corporation that had obtained an air quality permit from the department of environmental protection prior to October 1, 1998. Consequently, because it met the criteria set forth in the 2001 amendment, it was exempt from the zoning process that was the subject of the appeal and that the appeal therefore was moot. The plaintiffs opposed the motion to open and to dismiss. The court denied the motion to open, reasoning that because the appeal properly was taken pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 (a) and (b), the question of subject matter jurisdiction was governed by the zoning statute, and the 2001 amendment had no effect on the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">We begin by addressing our standard of review. \u201cA party may challenge a corut\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction at any time, and whenever a court discovers that it has no jurisdiction, it is bound to dismiss the case, without regard to [its] previous rulings.\u201d (Internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>Berlin Batting Cages, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>76 Conn. App. 199, 203, 821 A.2d 269 (2003). Whether the court has subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law to which the plenary standard of review applies. <em>Brookridge District Assn. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>259 Conn. 607, 611, 793 A.2d 215 (2002). Our decision is controlled by the relevant statutes. Statutory construction also is a question of law, requiring plenary review. <em>Tighe </em>v. <em>Berlin, </em>259 Conn. 83, 89, 788 A.2d 40 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\u201cThe meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d Public Acts 2003, No. 03-154, \u00a7 1 (P.A. OS-154). We conclude that the meaning of the 2001 amendment is not clear and unambiguous. If the meaning of a statute is not plain, we apply the standard established in <em>State </em>v. <em>Courchesne, </em>262 Conn. 537, 816 A.2d 562 (2003). \u201cThe process of statutory construction involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Our first step is to determine whether, as Leete-Ste-vens argues, the commission\u2019s granting the special permit was not appealable. If the decision was appealable, we then must determine the correct procedural vehicle. We conclude that the commission\u2019s granting Leete-Ste-vens\u2019 application for a special permit was appealable under our zoning statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Leete-Stevens argues that \u00a7 19a-320, the statute governing the erection and maintenance of crematories, does not provide the right of appeal from the commission\u2019s decision. Section 19a-320 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Any . . . corporation formed under the law of this state, may erect ... a crematory in this state .... The location of such crematory shall ... be within the confines of a plot of land approved for the location of a crematory . . . provided, in any town . . . having <em>a zoning commission, such commission shall have the authority to grant such approval, </em>(b) Application for such approval shall be made in writing to the local authority specified in subsection (a) and a hearing shall be held within the town ... in which such location is situated within sixty-five days from the date of receipt of such application. <em>Notice of such hearing shall be given ... by publication twice in a newspaper </em>having a substantial circulation in the town .... The local authority shall approve or deny such application . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 19a-320.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>With respect to Leete-Stevens\u2019 claim that the plaintiffs may not appeal from the commission\u2019s decision, we conclude that the words of the statute and their relationship to other statutes are plain and unambiguous. \u201cWe are constrained to read a statute as written . . . and we may not read into clearly expressed legislation provisions which do not find expression in its words . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Giaimo </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>257 Conn. 481, 494, 778 A.2d 33 (2001); see also <em>Miller\u2019s Pond Co., LLC </em>v. <em>Rocque, </em>71 Conn. App. 395, 408, 802 A.2d 184 (2002) (court cannot read into statute provision that does not exist), aff'd, 263 Conn. 692, 822 A.2d 238 (2003). Section 19a-320 does not foreclose the right to appeal from the decision of the local authority with respect to the location of a crematory. We will not construe \u00a7 19a-320 to mean what it does not say.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Our conclusion that \u00a7 19a-320 does not foreclose the right to appeal from the decision of the commission is supported by its relation to \u00a7 8-8 (a) and (b). Subsec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>tions (a) and (b) of \u00a7 19a-320 provide that a local authority, in this instance the commission, shall approve or deny an application for the location of a crematory. Subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 8-8 set forth the procedure by which to appeal from the administrative decisions of zoning commissions. Although <em>judicial </em>review of administrative decisions is generally governed by the UAPA, \u201c[jJudicial review of the actions and decisions of a zoning commission ... is governed by General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-9 and 8-8 rather than by the appeals provisions of the UAPA. <em>Ensign-Bickford Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning </em>Commission, 245 Conn. 257, 263, 715 A.2d 701 (1998), citing <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>232 Conn. 122,129,653 A.2d798 (1995).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Christensen </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>78 Conn. App. 378,383-84, 827 A.2d 716 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Because \u00a7 19a-320 does not deny the right to appeal from a decision regarding the location of a crematory and \u00a7 8-8 provides the means to appeal from the decision of a zoning commission, the plaintiffs properly filed this appeal. We must construe statutes \u201cconsistently with other relevant statutes because the legislature is presumed to have created a coherent body of law.\u201d <em>Petco Insulation Co. </em>v. <em>Crystal, </em>231 Conn. 315, 323-24, 649 A.2d 790 (1994). If the legislature had wanted to foreclose appeals from the decisions regarding the location of crematories, it could have done so, as it knows how to draft legislation in accordance with its intent. See <em>Monaco </em>v. <em>Turbomotive, Inc., </em>68 Conn. App. 61, 67, 789 A.2d 1099 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the court had subject matter jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal under \u00a7 8-8 (a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">We now turn to Leete-Stevens\u2019 claim that the appeal to the court was moot due to the 2001 amendment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>\u00a7 19a-320. Leete-Stevens argues that because its permit application fulfilled the factual predicate of the 2001 amendment, Leete-Stevens did not have to apply to the commission for permission to locate its crematory in the town. Consequently, Leete-Stevens continues, there was no practical relief that the court could have afforded the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We disagree with Leete-Stevens\u2019 contention. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">\u201cIt is a well-settled general rule that the existence of an actual controversy is an essential requisite to appellate jurisdiction; it is not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief can follow. . . . Mootness applies to situations where events have occurred during the pendency of an appeal that make an appellate court incapable of granting practical relief through a disposition on the merits. . . . Because [an appellate] court has no jurisdiction to give advisory opinions, no appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>can be decided on its merits in the absence of an actual controversy for which judicial relief can be granted.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cole v. Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>40 Conn. App. 501, 505-506, 671 A.2d 844 (1996). \u201cThe test for determining mootness of an appeal is whether there is any practical relief [the appellate] court can grant the appellant. ... If no practical relief can be afforded to the parties, the appeal must be dismissed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Taylor v. Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>71 Conn. App. 43, 46, 800 A.2d 641 (2002). We agree with the commission that, although Leete-Stevens may fall within the factual predicate of the 2001 amendment, the issue is whether the 2001 amendment applied to the appeal to the court as a matter of law. We conclude that the court properly concluded that 2001 amendment did not render the appeal moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">We apply our previously stated rules of statutory construction, i.e., that \u201c[t]he meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of <em>the statute itself </em>and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd and unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d (Emphasis added.) P.A. 03-154. The 2001 amendment provides: \u201cThis <em>section </em>shall not apply to any resident of this state or any corporation formed under the law of this state that was issued an air quality permit by the Department of Environmental Protection prior to October 1,1998.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Spec. Sess. P.A. 01-4, \u00a7 28. The use of the word <em>section, </em>rather than the word <em>subsection, </em>in the 2001 amendment effectively exempts any holder of an air quality permit issued by the department of environmental protection prior to October 1,1998, from complying with \u00a7 19a-320, including the approval and annual inspections of crematories <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>by the department of environmental protection as required by General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 19a-320 (c). Our examination of the language of the 2001 amendment as it relates to \u00a7 19a-320 demonstrates that it creates an absurd and unworkable result. Leete-Stevens itself does not contend that it is exempt from the dictates of subsection (c).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The effect of the 2001 amendment also defies the state\u2019s public policy concerning air quality and the health, safety and welfare of the people of this state. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-l and 22a-15. We therefore turn to the legislative history of \u00a7 19a-320 and the 2001 amendment to determine the intent of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">We may consult the analysis of a bill by the office of legislative research to ascertain legislative intent. See, e.g., <em>Starks </em>v. <em>University of Connecticut, </em>270 Conn. 1, 25 n.21,850 A.2d 1013 (2004); <em>Statev. Murray, </em>254 Conn. 472,494, 757 A.2d 578 (2000); <em>Burge </em>v. <em>Southington, </em>219 Conn. 581, 594, 594 A.2d 945 (1991). The analysis of the 2001 amendment by the office of legislative research states: \u201cBy law, any crematory not operating on October 1, 1998, cannot be located within 500 feet of any residence or land used for residential puiposes that is not owned by the crematory owner. The act exempts from this prohibition any state resident or corporation issued an air quality permit before October 1,1998.\u201d This legislative analysis makes clear that the 2001 amendment was intended to exempt state residents and corporations that held air quality permits prior to October 1, 1998, from the prohibition against locating a crematory within 500 feet of a residence that they did not own. The 2001 amendment did not exempt any of the subject permit holders from any other dictates of \u00a7 19a-320, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>including the requirement that the location of the crematory be approved by the appropriate local authority. We therefore conclude that, regardless of the 2001 amendment, Leete-Stevens must obtain permission from the commission prior to erecting a crematory in the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Furthermore, the appeal to the court was not moot because the 2001 amendment may not be given retroactive application. First, we note that Leete-Stevens filed its application for a special permit in May, 1998. The commission approved the special permit in July, 1998. An appeal was brought from the commission\u2019s decision, and the court decided the appeal on November 21,2000. The 2001 amendment was passed during the June, 2001 special session of the legislature and was effective July 1, 2001. Leete-Stevens filed its motion to open the judgment and to dismiss the appeal on July 23, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u201cWhether to apply a statute retrospectively or prospectively depends upon the intent of the legislature in enacting the statute. ... In order to determine the legislative intent, we utilize well established rules of statutory construction. Our point of departure is General Statutes \u00a7 55-3, which provides: No provision of the general statutes, not previously contained in the statutes of the state, which imposes any new obligation on any person or corporation, shall be construed to have retrospective effect. The obligations referred to in the statute are those of substantive law. . . . Thus, [our Supreme Court has] uniformly interpreted \u00a7 55-3 as a rule of <em>presumed </em>legislative intent that statutes affecting <em>substantive </em>rights shall apply prospectively only.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Coley </em>v. <em>Camden Associates, Inc., </em>243 Conn. 311, 316, 702 A.2d 1180 (1997). To determine whether the 2001 amendment applies to Leete-Stevens\u2019 application for a special permit, we must decide whether it is substantive or procedural in nature. Procedural or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>remedial amendments to statutes generally have retroactive application while substantive amendments affecting the rights of the parties may be applied only prospectively. Id., 316-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">We conclude that the 2001 amendment is substantive in nature because it changed the authority of the commission to approve the location of a crematory within 500 feet of a residence if the application is submitted by the holder of an air quality permit issued prior to October 1, 1998, who owns the subject land. In arguing that the appeal was moot, Leete-Stevens sought to take advantage of a right it did not have at the time it filed its application for a special permit with the commission. Because the 2001 amendment is substantive in nature, it may not be applied retrospectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">We also are mindful that \u00a7 19a-320 directs the appropriate local authority within a city, town or borough to approve the location of a crematory within municipal borders. In this instance, Leete-Stevens\u2019 application for a special permit is subject also to the town\u2019s regulations. \u201cWhere the state legislature has delegated to local government the right to deal with a particular field of regulation, the fact that a statute also regulates the same subject in less than full fashion does not, ipso facto, deprive the local government of the power to act in a more comprehensive, but not inconsistent, manner.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dwyer </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>193 Conn. 7, 12, 475 A.2d 257 (1984). The legislative history of \u00a7 19a-320 indicates that local authorities should decide the location of crematories not sited within a cemetery.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Here, the location of a crematory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>is subject to the town\u2019s zoning regulations concerning hazardous waste. See footnote 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the court properly concluded that the appeal was not moot because there was practical relief the court could grant the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Leete-Stevens\u2019 third claim is that Urbanowicz is not classically aggrieved and therefore has no standing to appeal from the decision of the commission. This claim arises out of Leete-Stevens\u2019 claim that the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal \u2014 if the plaintiffs are permitted to appeal \u2014 must be brought under the UAPA. We need not address this claim because we concluded in part IA that the plaintiffs properly brought their appeal pursuant to \u00a7 8-8 (a) and (b), which control zoning appeals. Section 8-8 (a) (1) provides in relevant part that \u201c \u2018aggrieved person\u2019 includes any person owning land that abuts or is within a radius of one hundred feet of any portion of the land involved in the decision of the board.\u201d Leete-Stevens does not dispute that, as abutting landowners, the plaintiffs are aggrieved within the terms of the zoning statute. Consequently, whether Urbanowicz is classically aggrieved by the action of the commission is not relevant to this appeal. See <em>Bankers Trust of California, N.A. </em>v. <em>Neal, </em>64 Conn. App. 154,156, 779 A.2d 813 (2001) (academic questions do not present justiciable issues).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Leete-Stevens also claims that the court improperly concluded that the commission failed to comply with the statutory notice requirements. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">We briefly restate the relevant facts. On May 13,1998, Leete-Stevens submitted an application for a special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>permit to erect a crematory on its premises at 61 South Road, lot 88, pursuant to \u00a7 16-2.9 of the Enfield zoning regulations. The commission gave notice of the public hearing. At the hearing that was held on June 4, 1998, Leete-Stevens, through its attorney, verbally modified its application to delete \u00a7 16-2.9 and substitute General Statutes \u00a7 19a-320 as the authority under which the application was being submitted. Despite the change, the commission heard testimony on the application and continued the hearing. On June 5, 1998, Leete-Stevens submitted written changes to its application for a special permit, adding the words \u201clot 89\u201d and \u201cabutting land,\u201d and changing the authority from \u00a7 16-2.9 of the zoning regulations to General Statutes \u00a7 19a-320. The commission held a second public hearing on Leete-Stevens\u2019 application on June 18,1998, but without causing notice of the hearing to be published. The commission caused notice of the public hearing on the amended application to be published prior to the continued hearing that was held on July 2, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Section 19a-320 (b) requires the local authority specified in subsection (a) to hold a hearing on an application to erect a crematory. \u201cNotice of such hearing shall be given to such applicant . . . the Commissioner of Public Health, and by publication twice in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in the town . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 19a-320 (b); see also General Statutes \u00a7 8-3 (a) (notice requirement for zoning changes). The court in this case concluded that the application was amended to include abutting land, that the amendment constituted a new application and that publication of notice of a public hearing on that application was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">As in <em>Lauver </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>60 Conn. App. 504, 760 A.2d 513 (2000), the questions before this court are whether the trial court properly concluded that the original application for a special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>permit and the amended application were separate and distinct and, therefore, required separate legal notice and whether the trial court correctly concluded that the commission\u2019s granting of the special permit was illegal for want of proper notice. See id., 508. We answer those questions in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">\u201cThe scope of review of a trial court\u2019s factual decision on appeal is limited to a determination of whether it is clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings. . . . Conclusions are not erroneous unless they violate law, logic or reason or are inconsistent with the subordinate facts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Statutory notice \u201crequirements are for the protection of property interests and therefore implicate rights of due process. . . . Our courts have consistently refused to consider the adequacy of public notice to be a merely procedural matter and have unwaveringly treated failure to give proper public notice as a jurisdictional defect. . . . Compliance with the notice procedures requiring that the time of a scheduled public hearing be published at least twice, is a prerequisite to valid zoning authority actions. . . . Without proper public notice, zoning authority actions are null and void. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\u201cA notice is proper only if it fairly and sufficiently apprises the public of the action proposed, making possible intelligent preparation for participation in the hearing. . . . Not all flaws in the notice are fatal; for example, the notice need not describe the proposed action with exactitude.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Cocivi </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>20 Conn. App. 705, 707, 570 A.2d 226, cert, denied, 214 Conn. 808, 573 A.2d 319 (1990). \u201cThe public is entitled to constructive notice of commission hearings and a defect is not cured merely because some members of the public received actual notice or in fact appeared at the hearing.\u201d Id., 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>\u201cCompliance with prescribed notice requirements is a prerequisite to a valid action by a zoning board of appeals and failure to give proper notice constitutes a jurisdictional defect.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Nazarko </em>v. <em>Zoning </em>Commission, 50 Conn. App. 517, 519, 717 A.2d 853, cert, denied, 247 Conn. 941, 723 A.2d 318 (1998). \u201cStrict compliance with statutory mandates regarding notice to the public is necessary.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lauver </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 60 Conn. App. 509. \u201cThe burden of proving that the notice was defective rests on the persons asserting its insufficiency.\u201d <em>Nazarko </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 520. Both <em>Nazarko </em>and <em>Lauver </em>are instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">In <em>Nazarko, </em>the applicant was a sporting club seeking to operate a skeet shooting range on its property and to widen the access road. Id., 518. The published notice identified the subject property as being off a certain road in East Lyme, lot 10 on the assessor\u2019s map. Id. On appeal, the trial court found that the sporting club owned two parcels of land and that it sought to move the skeet shooting range to lot 10 from lot 9. Id., 520. This court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, concluding that \u201cthe notice was insufficient in that it describes the subject property as lot ten on the assessor\u2019s map without referring to lot nine, even though the applicant seeks a special exception to improve an access driveway that traverses both parcels.\u201d Id. Likewise, in <em>Lauver </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 60 Conn. App. 506-507, the commission reviewed an application preliminarily and requested that the applicant provide a better description of the land and provide a map, and that lot numbers be added to the application. The commission only caused notice of the original application to be published. Id. This court sustained the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>application was different from the original one and required its own notice. Id., 506-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">In the case before us now, Leete-Stevens amended its application for a special permit. In its amended application, it sought to change the boundary between lots 88 and 89. It added the term \u201cabutting land\u201d and changed the legal authority under which it was submitting the application. The commission failed to cause notice of the public hearing on the amended application to be published in accordance with \u00a7 19a-320. We conclude that the addition of lot 89 and \u201cabutting land\u201d to the application to adjust the boundary between lots 88 and 89 constituted a new application that required its own notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Leete-Stevens\u2019 final claim is that the court improperly declared the special permit void without remanding the application for further proceedings. Without a remand, Leete-Stevens argues, it must submit another application. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">By failing to give proper notice of the amended application, the commission\u2019s action in approving the permit was a nullity. See <em>Koepke </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>223 Conn. 171, 178, 610 A.2d 1301 (1992). The court should have remanded the case to the commission with instructions to give proper notice and to conduct a public hearing on the amended application. See <em>Lauver </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 60 Conn. App. 515. We therefore remand the case to the Superior Court for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to remand the matter to the commission for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-9\"> The trial court granted the motion filed by Urbanowicz to substitute Debra M.

They both require public hearings, and they both require your approval, and I think that accurately reflects what [the attorney for LeeteStevens] said. We have legally advertised it as it is written and as it was announced. If you continue with the hearing, I think there would be no harm personally in doing that and allowing everyone a chance to speak to this, but I would be cautious about closing the hearing and taking any action, and then ask the town attorney for an opinion. Because, as you know, in the past the town attorney has made some opinions about some legal notices that said [that] if they aren\u2019t accurate, the vote that you take would be null and void because of a technical problem with the legal ad. So, I think if you proceed with the hearing, it has been noted and put on the record what the problem is. You would just need to take that cautionary step, and if the town attorney thinks that it should be readvertised, we have also done that in the past and we would advertise it in a way that might be more appropriate and continue the hearing to the next date.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\"> The plaintiffs filed an eleven count amended appeal alleging improper notice of the second application, conflict of interest on the part of the commission, noncompliance with the special permit regulations, violation of a 1976 zoning stipulation entered into by Leete-Stevens and the commission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>violation of the town\u2019s residential zoning district, violation of the R-33 zone of the town\u2019s zoning regulations, violation of the town\u2019s hazardous materials zoning regulation, an invalid accessory use under the town\u2019s zoning regulations, failure to obtain inland wetland commission approval, violation of General Statutes \u00a7 19a-323 and improper site plan modification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b315-10\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 8-8 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) As used in this section: (1) \u2018Aggrieved person\u2019 means a person aggrieved by a decision of a board and includes any officer, department, board or bureau of the municipality charged with enforcement of any order, requirement or decision of the board.

Shlatz, as executrix of Sidor\u2019s estate, was not aggrieved. The court found that at the time the appeal was filed, Sidor, who was an adjoining landowner, was statutorily aggrieved and, thus, his estate was statutorily aggrieved. As the executrix of Sidor\u2019s estate, Shlatz properly was substituted as a plaintiff to represent the interests of Sidor\u2019s estate. See footnote 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b316-12\"> In its brief to this court, Leete-Stevens described the amount of land needed from lot 89 as a \u201cnarrow sliver,\u201d fifty-five feet by 442 feet.

The location of a crematory is a matter for local zoning approval.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b323-6\"> The plaintiffs represented in their brief to this court that Leete-Stevens had lobbied through its trade association for the 2001 amendment. LeeteStevens did not deny the representation, but argued in its reply brief \u201cthat the legislature was keenly aware of the limited number of individuals who hold these very specific [environmental protection] permits when it decided to exempt them from local regulation.\u201d During oral argument, counsel for Leete-Stevens responded to a question from this court that he knew of no other individual or corporation who benefited from the 2001 amendment. Because we conclude that the appeal is controlled by General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (a) and (b) and the parties did not address the question, we will not consider whether the 2001 amendment is a public emolument that violates article first, \u00a7 1, of the constitution of Connecticut.
