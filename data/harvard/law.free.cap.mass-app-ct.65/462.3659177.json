L. c. 265, \u00a7 18(a) (the \u201cage sixty\u201d counts), and ten counts of armed assault with intent to rob. The charges arose out of a single event in Dedham during which the defendant and five or six others commandeered a tour bus carrying passengers to Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut. A Superior Court jury convicted the defendant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>twenty counts, including four age sixty counts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant claims error in the amendment of one of the age sixty counts, and evidentiary error during cross-examination of one of the codefendant\u2019s alibi witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">a. <em>Amendment. </em>Prior to jury empanelment, the Commonwealth sought to amend one of the counts, number thirteen, which charged the defendant with armed assault with intent to rob. The victim in that count was over sixty years of age, but the words \u201ca person over sixty years of age\u201d were not included in the indictment. All of the other counts as to the defendant and a codefendant were identical, and the counts in their indictments were grouped sequentially according to the crime: counts one through twelve, armed robbery while masked; counts fourteen through seventeen, armed assault with intent to rob a person over sixty; and counts eighteen through twenty-six, armed assault with intent to rob. Only count thirteen as to this defendant contained a discrepancy: the codefendant\u2019s indictment on count thirteen included the \u201cover sixty\u201d language, while the defendant\u2019s indictment on count thirteen did not. For this reason, and because all the defendant\u2019s indictments from numbers fourteen through seventeen included the language \u201ca person over sixty years of age,\u201d the judge allowed the amendment, noting that \u201cit\u2019s obvious to me in reading the indictments that 013 in the [defendant\u2019s] group does not have the words \u2018a person over 60,\u2019 and 013 in the [codefendant\u2019s] group does have it for [that victim]. It seems to me it is a clerical error . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Rule 4(d) of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure, 378 Mass. 849 (1979), provides that \u201c[u]pan his own motion or the written motion of either party, a judge may allow amendment of the form of a complaint or indictment if such amendment would not prejudice the defendant or the Commonwealth.\u201d Under the rule, \u201cthe amendment must be a matter of form and not a matter of substance.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>437 Mass. 487, 491 (2002). \u201cMatters of form are those that are \u2018not essential to the description of the crime charged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 492, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snow, </em>269 Mass. 598, 606 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>(1930). The amendment here added an essential element of the offense and, thus, was a matter of substance. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snow, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jervis, </em>368 Mass. 638, 643 (1975), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">We are mindful that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snow, supra, </em>and many subsequent cases, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiStasio, </em>294 Mass. 273, 277-278 (1936), cert. denied, 302 U.S. 759 (1937); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Binkiewicz, </em>342 Mass. 740, 748 (1961); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>415 Mass. 161, 165 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dellamano, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 156, 158 (1983), <em>S.C., </em>393 Mass. 132 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saylor, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 117, 121 (1989), have utilized a double jeopardy test in analyzing amendments as to form, as opposed to substance, inquiring \u201cwhether a judgment of conviction or acquittal on the indictment as originally drawn would be a bar to the new indictment as amended.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dellamano, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. at 158-159. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>441 Mass. 783, 788 n.8 (2004). In some cases the court has identified the test as <em>\u201cone </em>test,\u201d see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snow, supra </em>at 609-610; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knight, supra </em>at 492-493, and at other times, <em>\u201cthe </em>test,\u201d see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, supra </em>at 165. Where the amendment here added an essential element of the offense, it was one of substance even though it may arguably pass the double jeopardy test.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">There are additional reasons why the amendment of the indictment was error. Such amendments are not authorized with respect to matters \u201cessential to the description of the crime charged,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snow, supra </em>at 606. An amendment may not \u201cmaterially change the work of the grand jury,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>441 Mass. 783, 787 (2004), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knight, supra </em>at 492, and citing art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. Finally, an amendment may not broaden the charges against a defendant, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dellamano, supra </em>at 159, citing <em>Stirone </em>v. <em>United States, </em>361 U.S. 212, 215-216 (1960). The amendment here fails each of these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">b. <em>Impeachment of the codefendant\u2019s alibi witness. </em>The defendant\u2019s remaining issue on appeal, framed by him as two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>issues, concerns the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of an alibi witness of the codefendant. The prosecutor asked whether the codefendant or his attorney had instructed the witness not to come forward with the alibi information. The defendant argues, first, that the prosecutor elicited hearsay and, second, that the prosecutor invaded work product.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">There was no error. Our decisions grant judges discretion to allow a prosecutor to impeach an alibi witness with her failure to bring exculpatory information to the police. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>401 Mass. 437, 444-445 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cintron, </em>435 Mass. 509, 522-525 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 288, 296-297 (1981). To conduct such impeachment properly, the prosecutor must establish a foundation for his questions by eliciting testimony that \u201cthe witness knew of the charge against the defendant in sufficient detail to realize he possessed exculpatory information; that the witness had a reason to make the information available; that the witness was familiar with the means of reporting it to authorities; and that neither the defendant nor his lawyer asked the witness to refrain from disclosing the information.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cintron, supra </em>at 522. The prosecutor here established a sufficient foundation for impeaching the witness, and the judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting the testimony. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The judgment and verdict on count thirteen of the indictment are modified to show a conviction of armed assault with intent to rob, and the case is remanded for resentencing upon that offense. The judgments are otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b497-7\"><em> A </em>codefendant was similarly convicted, i.e., on an identical twenty-six count indictment, as to the same twenty counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
