Correia, makes a sole appellate challenge to several comments by the prosecutor in closing argument, which he asserts were improper and prejudicial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-14\"><em>Background. </em>The jury could have found the following facts. In the early morning (about 1:00 a.m.) of September 13, 2001, Carlos Costa went from his second-floor apartment in New Bedford into the unlit, \u201cpitch black\u201d backyard of the apartment house in pursuit of his sister\u2019s puppy, a six month old miniature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>pug named Pudgy, who had run down the stairs and into the yard. As he followed Pudgy\u2019s bark, he heard someone say, \u201cGet the fuck out of here before I kick you.\u201d Costa said into the darkness, \u201cIt\u2019s only a puppy,\u201d and then came upon the defendant (whom he did not know but recognized as a daily visitor to the neighborhood, speeding in and out on his moped). The defendant replied to Costa, \u201cGet the fuck out of here before I stab you.\u201d Costa said, \u201cWhatever,\u201d and continued walking toward the street. Hearing a sound, he turned to see what it was and immediately felt a knife being plunged into his stomach and then pulled out. The defendant had come up from behind and, as Costa turned, had stabbed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Having heard the events outside, Costa\u2019s mother and sister came downstairs and saw Costa and the defendant facing each other, Costa bleeding profusely from his wound and the defendant holding a knife covered with blood. The defendant turned and mounted his moped, ignoring the sister\u2019s demand that he not leave, and raced out of the backyard. He momentarily lost control of his vehicle, crashed into something, and fell over, but then hopped back on and rode off, as Costa\u2019s sister hurled a rock at him. The police and an ambulance soon arrived and took Costa (who had fallen to the ground and felt faint) to the hospital, where he underwent surgery for a pierced liver and spent five days recovering from his wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The police spent over a month searching for the defendant, who had been unhesitatingly identified by Costa and his sister and who never returned to the neighborhood after the incident. He could not be located by the police, despite constant searches for him and several visits to his last known addresses without success. He was finally arrested when encountered in the New Bedford District Court house sitting outside the probation office.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">In a statement to the police, the defendant said that he had been visiting a friend and was in the backyard repairing his moped with his pocket knife when the dog charged up to him, barking and nipping at his legs. A man (he did not recognize Costa) then came up to him, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t yell at my dog.\u201d While he was bending over at the waist to slash at the dog with his knife, he was struck in the back by the man. Swinging his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>body up, he noticed blood coming from and running down the man\u2019s shirt and chest. He then left as two women ran toward him, yelled at him, and threw a rock at him. Asked by the police if he had stabbed the man, the defendant responded, \u201cMaybe I did,\u201d but could not recall one way or the other. He claimed that the knife must have fallen out of his pocket as he rode home that night. At trial, the defendant (who did not testify) relied primarily on this statement (to which the arresting officer testified) as the basis for his defense of accident. His counsel conceded that the defendant had stabbed Costa but had done so accidentally while holding the knife to ward off the puppy nipping at his legs, as a reflexive response to Costa\u2019s having struck him in the back.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>The defendant faults the prosecutor for four alleged errors in his closing argument, to all of which he objected: (1) leaving the photograph of Costa\u2019s abdominal wound (characterized as \u201cgraphic\u201d and \u201cgrisly\u201d by the defendant) on the court room\u2019s television monitor for much of his argument; (2) asserting that the nature of Costa\u2019s wound suggested that the defendant had used \u201ca double-edged knife\u201d; (3) deriding the defendant\u2019s theory of accident by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">\u201cAn accident, you apologize. You don\u2019t flee, when [Costa\u2019s mother and sister] tell him to wait, and he knows that the police are coming. He gets on his moped and drives away not to be seen again at that address ever, although he had been a frequent visitor. He doesn\u2019t know what he did? He doesn\u2019t have a guilty knowledge of what he did?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">and (4) telling the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-10\">\u201cYou know from your life experience that there are people in this world whose paths we would choose not to cross. In the daytime we see them, and we know to keep clear of them. And if we were unfortunate enough as human be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>ings to bark at them, or in Pudgy\u2019s case bark at them, they would just as soon stab you as look at you. . . . Carlos Costa didn\u2019t know that when he went into the backyard and ran into Keith Correia, that he was one of those people. But you know from the evidence in this case that he is.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">The defendant contends that by this latter comment the prosecutor was arguing that the jury should consider the defendant\u2019s \u201cbad character,\u201d as a violent person who stabbed people frivolously, and as evidence that he was predisposed to and did commit the crimes charged. We agree, however, with the Commonwealth that the challenged conduct of the prosecutor during his closing either was within the bounds of proper argument or could not have prejudiced the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">1. As to the display of the photograph, which the defendant attacks as \u201ccalculated to appeal to the jury\u2019s sympathy,\u201d the trial judge expressly found that \u201cthe Commonwealth did not unduly dwell on it. In fact, he moved it different times so the jury was not even looking at the television. I watched that. It was on my screen, but their eyes were following \u2014 as usual, they follow both of you when you make final argument.\u201d Moreover, as the judge noted, and defense counsel acknowledged, \u201c[t]he jury will have it for a longer time in front of them while they deliberate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">In any event, \u201c \u2018whether the inflammatory quality of a photograph outweighs its probative value and precludes its admission is determined in the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeSouza, </em>428 Mass. 667, 670 (1999), and cases cited. \u2018In order to find an abuse of discretion, \u201cit is necessary to decide that no conscientious judge, acting intelligently, could honestly have taken the view expressed by [her].\u201d \u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Jaime, 433 Mass. 575, 579 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Medeiros, </em>395 Mass. 336, 351 (1985). The defendant has failed to [address, much less] meet[,] this heavy burden.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>445 Mass. 195, 208-209 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>We note that the defendant did not request any instruction as to the use of the photograph or object to the judge\u2019s stated intention not to give any such instruction. Finally, the judge appropriately mitigated any potential prejudice by cautioning the jury at least four times that they could not base their verdicts on sympathy or the nature of the crimes charged. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>427 Mass. 642, 645-646 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kent K., </em>427 Mass. 754, 761 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>431 Mass. 506, 511 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">2. As to the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that the defendant had used a \u201cdouble-edged knife,\u201d the judge concluded that no such inference could be drawn from the photographic evidence of the wound, a subject that required expert testimony, and explicitly directed the jury that they could not infer the use of such a knife because there was insufficient evidence on which to base it. Consequently, even if error occurred, it was fully corrected and could not have influenced the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leno, </em>374 Mass. 716, 719 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pillai, </em>445 Mass. 175, 190 (2005) (jury presumed to follow judge\u2019s instructions).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">3. The defendant\u2019s attack on the prosecutor\u2019s mocking of his claim of accident (by referring to his flight after the stabbing when he knew the police were coming and his consciousness of guilt) fails. Prosecutors are entitled to argue theories supported by the evidence and to suggest fair inferences from the evidence (which inferences need only be reasonable and possible, not necessary or inescapable). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 516 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dinkins, </em>415 Mass. 715, 725 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>430 Mass. 552, 564-565 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s statements here did not exceed the bounds of fair inference from the evidence, and the jury \u2014 admonished by both the judge and counsel to apply their common sense and experience in their deliberations \u2014 did not have to engage in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>impermissible conjecture in order reasonably to draw the commonsense inference suggested by the prosecutor, that the defendant had guiltily fled the scene and knew that the police were coming. This was rationally inferable from the evidence that the defendant had already threatened to stab Costa without reason or provocation; that he was aware he had seriously injured Costa from Costa\u2019s verbal and physical reactions and the copious flow of blood (which stained Costa\u2019s clothing and the ground); that he had to have realized that the police would be summoned to respond to and investigate such a serious, arguably criminal, and potentially life threatening incident; that despite being told he had to stay, he immediately left the scene in a precipitate manner that indicated a determined effort to escape the consequences of his action; and that his culpable state of mind on that occasion could be inferred from his subsequent conduct, in never returning to a neighborhood he had previously been visiting daily, and in being absent from all of his known addresses for weeks as the police searched for him in vain. (As to the latter point, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cardarelli, </em>433 Mass. 427, 434 [2001], and cases cited.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Finally, when examined in context, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks could reasonably be viewed by the jury as fairly commenting on the inherent implausibility or unreliability of the defendant\u2019s claim of accident. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>403 Mass. 441, 457 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>408 Mass. 117, 128 (1990). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Glass, </em>401 Mass. 799, 807 (1988) (\u201cAs an attack on the defendant\u2019s self-defense contention, expressed as hyperbolic ridicule, the argument was arguably tolerable\u201d). There was no impropriety.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">4. The prosecutor\u2019s challenged statement regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>defendant being \u201cone of those people\u201d who \u201cwould just as soon stab you as look at you,\u201d appears problematic only when wrenched out of context from the prosecutor\u2019s initial point (that we all recognize the danger of violence from certain types of people because they take disproportionate offense at trivial matters) and his culminating observation (that the jury would be able to identify the defendant as such a person from the evidence). See discussion, <em>supra. </em>Rather than a gratuitous comment on the defendant\u2019s violent character, as the defendant contends, it was a fair, if hard, blow arising from the frightening circumstances of the case: a man walking in his own backyard is threatened with stabbing without cause by a total stranger, retreats, then unexpectedly has a knife plunged into his abdomen and is left, gravely wounded and heavily bleeding with a life threatening injury, by the stranger, who takes time to withdraw the knife and then disappears into the night. A reasonable juror could view such a senseless, unprovoked, unexpected, and savage attack as an exceptionally cruel and vicious act reflecting callous indifference to the sufferings of others, and as particularly cold blooded by reason of the use of a knife, which requires close contact with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Viewed in context, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks would have been seen by a rational juror as directed not at the defendant\u2019s character but at his shocking conduct, in legitimate response to the defendant\u2019s improbable alternative claims of accident or provocation and lashing out in the heat of passion. The defendant\u2019s cold and calculated behavior was also circumstantial evidence of his purposeful state of mind, a proper subject for argument given the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of establishing the specific intent required to prove assault with intent to cause death. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardone, </em>406 Mass. 123, 131 (1989). It could also be fairly deemed the type of wanton or reckless conduct resulting in harm to another that is the legal equivalent of intentional conduct for purposes of establishing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 271, 273-277 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">As our appellate courts have frequently observed, \u201c[w]e have never criticized a prosecutor for arguing forcefully for a conviction based on the evidence and on inferences that may reasonably be drawn from the evidence,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. at 516, and \u201c \u2018enthusiastic rhetoric, strong advocacy, and excusable hyperbole\u2019 are not grounds for reversal.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>427 Mass. 336, 350 (1998), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanna, </em>424 Mass. 92, 107 (1997). To the degree the prosecutor\u2019s statement could be deemed \u201cinflammatory, that was inherent in the odious and brutal nature of the crime[] committed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ingram, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 999, 999 (1982) (armed assault, aggravated rape, armed robbery). \u201cTo the degree that the argument might have warmed the passions of the jury, it did so by reference to [the evidence] that, when recalled, would have that effect. That is permissible.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garofalo, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 191, 194 (1999) (assault and battery). Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>426 Mass. 466, 472-473 (1998) (murder by stabbing).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Thus, closing arguments by prosecutors that have been challenged as prejudicial character attacks in such cases as the following have been viewed indulgently by our courts (at least where the judge gave proper instructions and the Commonwealth\u2019s case was strong: <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>411 Mass. 279, 285-287 (1991) (on charge of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, a razor, by one prison inmate on another, prosecutor\u2019s characterization of the prison as a \u201csewer\u201d and of defendant as one of \u201cthe kind of people you are dealing with\u201d who made the prison a sewer, held permissible as supported by the evidence and as \u201ca dramatic flourish that was probably not meant to be taken literally. The jury undoubtedly were aware that the prosecutor was arguing his view, and they had the capacity to discount hyperbole\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>425 Mass. 223, 230-231 (1997) (on charge of murder by shooting, prosecutor\u2019s referring to the defendant and his witnesses as \u201cthese people\u201d who come from \u201ca world unlike anything you\u2019ve ever experienced ... a whole different planet . . . havfing] a whole different moral code,\u201d had a foundation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>in the evidence, reflected the prosecutor\u2019s effort to ask \u201cthe jury to make the imaginative leap to understand a world different from their own and to judge fairly\u201d; and \u201cconstituted permissible argument\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deveau, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 9, 10-11, 14 (1993) (on charges of child molestation, prosecutor\u2019s references to defendant and his character witnesses \u2014 \u201c[Djon\u2019t we all know people who are unsavory . . . [but] who can get a parade of [character witnesses] to come in ... . [That is based on] behavior that is subject to public scrutiny .... This is why people like Mr. Deveau get children involved, and get their confidences .... [They] do it in secret\u201d \u2014 held unremarkable, because they amounted to an assertion \u201cthat the defendant had committed acts of child molestation, but that, of course, was the government\u2019s position as prosecutor, and it is hardly likely that the jury would have been misled .... We are prepared to credit the jury with common sense which would enable them to hear the . . . statements] as a rhetorical flourish in aid of the argument\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>442 Mass. 485, 496 (2004) (on charge of murders by stabbing, prosecutor\u2019s statement, that the defendant \u201cmurdered both of these people in cold blood,\u201d was \u201cbased on the evidence and [was] not inappropriate,\u201d given the fact that the evidence \u201cpermitted an inference that the murders were unprovoked, senseless, and brutal\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>427 Mass. at 352 (on charges of murder by stabbing and assault by means of a dangerous weapon, prosecutor\u2019s references to the defendant as \u201ca triple murderer. . . \u2018did not cross the line between fair and improper argument,\u2019 \u201d because \u201cthe jury are presumed to know \u2018that the prosecutor is an advocate\u2019 and to be able to recognize his arguments as advocacy\u201d [citations omitted]); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>411 Mass. 345, 357 (1991) (on charge of murder, prosecutor\u2019s multiple references to the defendant\u2019s participation in the cruel shooting of a cat just before the shooting of the victim, claimed to have inflamed the jury, \u201cinvolved some hyperbole but nothing beyond the ability of the jury to discount\u201d). See generally note 8, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Even if a prosecutor\u2019s closing argument is objected to and subsequently deemed improper, no cognizable prejudice is created when, in light of the entire record, the Commonwealth\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>case is strong and the trial judge\u2019s instructions have mitigated or cured any error that could have deprived the defendant of a fair trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. at 518, 522-523 &amp; n.15; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daley, </em>439 Mass. 558, 567 (2003). Both factors are present in this case and mandate rejection of the defendant\u2019s contentions. The Commonwealth\u2019s case that the defendant had committed the crime charged, supported by uncontradicted eyewitnesses \u2014 as well as the defendant\u2019s admission (through counsel) that he had indeed stabbed Costa \u2014 was overwhelming, while the defendant\u2019s story of accident or provocation was implausibly weak, particularly given his evasive conduct after the stabbing and the lack of any testimony supporting such theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Even more significant for the negation of prejudice were the judge\u2019s impeccable instructions, most significantly his admonishing the jury no less than five separate times (both at the beginning and at the end of the case) that the arguments of counsel were not evidence and could not be considered by them as evidence, while separately cautioning them multiple times that the only evidence they could consider consisted of the testimony of the witnesses at trial and the admitted exhibits; that they were to decide the case solely on that evidence; that anything counsel or the judge himself may have said that was contrary to the jury\u2019s recollection of the evidence was to be ignored; and that they could not let their consideration of the evidence be swayed by any sympathy, prejudice, or personal feelings. Further, he repeatedly instructed them concerning the presumption of the defendant\u2019s innocence, the Commonwealth\u2019s unremitting burden of proof, the requirement that such proof be beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the burden never shifts to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">In light of those comprehensive charges, as well as the defendant\u2019s failure to have sought further or curative instructions on any of the arguments claimed to have been improper,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we can confidently conclude that the judge\u2019s careful instructions adequately cured any prejudice that could be argued to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>have arisen from the prosecutor\u2019s arguments.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See, in addition to the case cited above, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>366 Mass. 506, 515-516 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacDonald, </em>368 Mass. 395, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>401-402 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>417 Mass. 126, 133-134 (1994); <em>Commonwealth v.

Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 932, 933 (1983) (even though defendant objected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, when he did not ask for curative instructions or make any objection to the instructions given pertaining to closing arguments, he \u201ccannot now be heard to complain about the instructions\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b71-6\"> Not only is it a fundamental premise of our system of criminal justice that the jury will pay heed to and follow the judge\u2019s instructions, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leno, </em>374 Mass. 716, 719 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>399 Mass. 841, 849 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Viriyahiranpaiboon, </em>412 Mass. 224, 231-232 (1992); but our law also presumes (as the cases cited above illustrate) (a) that the jury are aware (when properly instructed, as they were here) that \u201cclosing argument is identified as argument . . . [and] is not evidence,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. at 517; (b) that \u201cthe jury should realize that the statements of counsel are arguments and not dispassionate recitations of fact,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Loguidice, </em>420 Mass. 453, 456 (1995); (c) that \u201c[t]he jury [can] be expected to take [closing] arguments with a grain of salt,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>385 Mass. 244, 277 (1982); (d) that the jury \u2014 charged with using their common sense and experience \u2014 are aware that the prosecutor\u2019s position is that the defendant being tried committed the acts with which he is charged, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deveau, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. at 11; (e) that \u201cthe jury know[] that the prosecutor is an advocate and [they] may be expected ... to discount [overzealous] remarks as seller\u2019s talk,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>366 Mass. 705, 714 (1975) (citations omitted); (f) that jurors are \u201cable to recognize [the prosecutor\u2019s] arguments as advocacy and not statements of personal belief,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>427 Mass. at 352, and, \u201caware that the prosecutor was arguing his view, . . . [are able] to discount [prosecutorial] hyperbole,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>411 Mass. at 287; and (g) that the jury possess \u201c[a] certain measure of . . . sophistication in sorting out excessive claims on both sides,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. at 517, particularly the capability of \u201csorting out [both] hyperbole and speculation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>431 Mass. at 512. There are, of course, cases in which the judge\u2019s instructions are not pointed enough to neutralize claimed errors in the prosecutor\u2019s argument. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shelley, </em>374 Mass. 466, 469-471 (1978) (prosecutor characterized defendant\u2019s expert psychiatric witnesses in murder case, in disclaimer form, as \u201cbought,\u201d \u201cmercenary soldiers,\u201d and \u201cprostitutes,\u201d but judge did not give curative instructions and the Commonwealth\u2019s case was not overwhelming); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>417 Mass. 266, 269-272 (1994) (in a case \u201cclose ... on the facts,\u201d the prosecutor supported police witnesses by not only stating evidence not in the record but also improperly suggesting that the defendant had an obligation to produce evidence, and request for particularized curative instructions was ignored); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Coren, </em>437 Mass. 723, 731 (2002) (prosecutor misstated important aspects of the testimony going to the central issue in the case beyond fair inferences, and the judge declined to give particularized instructions); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallego, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 714, 717-720 (1989) (prosecutor appealed to ethnic stereotypes and xenophobic feelings by repeatedly referring to the defendant as one of a \u201ctightly knit organization\u201d of \u201cColombian drug dealers,\u201d despite lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>of evidence to support the references, and judge\u2019s charge did not lay special stress on closing arguments as lacking evidentiary status). This is not such a case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b72-9\"> The defendant did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the \u201cspecial kind of person\u201d it takes to \u201csleeve [a knife] into a person\u2019s body,\u201d so that it is reviewable, assuming error, under the \u201csubstantial risk of a miscarriage of justice\u201d standard. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass, at 518 n.8. The absence of any objection \u201crightly appears to be of large, if not necessarily conclusive, importance upon appellate review.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 283, 288 n.7 (1988). Since we conclude that no reversible error occurred even under the more favorable (to the defendant) \u201cprejudicial error\u201d standard applicable to preserved errors, any argument that this remark created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice would be unavailing if made; but the defendant does not even advance such an argument, which is accordingly waived. See Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b72-10\"> The defendant argues that the \u201ccumulative effect of his four assignments of error in the prosecutor\u2019s closing requires reversal.\u201d As there was, at most, one arguable error, that argument fails. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Degro, </em>432 Mass. 319, 329 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b72-11\"> While we are firmly persuaded that the challenged prosecutorial remarks here \u2014 even the exuberant final one \u2014 came nowhere near depriving the defendant of a fair trial or meriting reversal, we nonetheless express our dismay that yet another prosecutor has exposed himself to charges of having \u201csailed unnecessarily close to the wind,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Redmond, </em>370 Mass. 591, 597 (1976), essentially by ignoring the clear guidelines on the subject that our courts have frequently announced, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Masello, </em>428 Mass. 446, 453 (1998), quite likely as the result of lack of thoughtful and careful preparation, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 536, 541 (1991), with the consequence that the court\u2019s time and energy must be devoted \u2014 again, unnecessarily \u2014 to the difficult task of evaluating the propriety and impact of challenged closing statements in the context of the entire proceedings. We remind prosecutors of our recent admonition that \u201c[o]ur conclusion that no misconduct occurred here should by no means be read as an endorsement of the prosecutor\u2019s actions. . . . While the government here managed to skate a fine line between proper argument and reversible error . . . there was no justification for cutting things so fine. Were the facts changed but slightly, the outcome here easily could [have] be[en] different.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beaudry, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 488, 499-500 (2005), further appellate review granted, 445 Mass. 1101 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
