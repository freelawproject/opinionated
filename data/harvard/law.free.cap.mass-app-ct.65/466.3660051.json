L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B. Arguing that the Commonwealth failed to satisfy all elements of the charge, the defendant claims that the judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty. He also claims reversible error because of the repeated use of the word \u201cresisting\u201d during the Commonwealth\u2019s case and closing argument. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number><em>Background. </em>This case arises out of a dispute between the tenant of an apartment building and the defendant, Donald Maylott, the building\u2019s maintenance person. Officer Reginald Miller of the Springfield police department was called to the apartment building on the evening of November 4, 1999, to investigate an alleged assault and battery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Officer Miller arrived at the building and called his partner, Officer Brian Elliott, for assistance. The officers interviewed the downstairs tenant and then went to a second-floor apartment, where the defendant was working, to interview him about what had happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">At trial, the officers testified that they attempted to interview the defendant, but that he was \u201cextremely angry,\u201d \u201coutraged,\u201d and \u201cuncooperative,\u201d and was \u201cflailing his arms\u201d and swearing. The officers also testified that they made several attempts to get the defendant to tell his side of the story, but he was too agitated to talk with them. When the defendant continued to be uncooperative, the officers informed the defendant that he was being placed under arrest. At that point, the defendant \u201cbecame even more angry\u201d and started to yell louder. \u201cHe was moving his arms, flailing as he was yelling and screaming and Officer Miller and [Officer Elliot] approached him.\u201d Officer Miller took hold of the defendant\u2019s right hand in an attempt to handcuff him. Instead of complying with the officers\u2019 demands, the defendant \u201cstiffened out his arm, and refused [their] advances to put his hands behind his back.\u201d Officer Elliott then grabbed for the defendant\u2019s left wrist or forearm with both his hands because the defendant was not \u201ctum[ing] around\u201d to \u201cplace himself in a position ... to be handcuffed.\u201d The defendant again stiffened his arm. Holding the defendant by the arms, the officers faced him against a wall in order to protect themselves and to gain a physical advantage over him. The officers told the defendant \u201cagain and again, \u2018[P]ut your hands behind your back.\u2019 \u201d Officer Miller \u201cforcefully swept\u201d the defendant\u2019s arm behind his back and finally placed him in handcuffs. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>defendant was then escorted, without incident, into the police cruiser.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">1. <em>Resisting arrest. </em>The statute at issue, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B, inserted by St. 1995, c. 276, reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">\u201c(a) A person commits the crime of resisting arrest if he knowingly prevents or attempts to prevent a police officer, acting under color of his official authority, from effecting an arrest of the actor or another, by: (1) using or threatening to use physical force or violence against the police officer or another; or (2) using any other means which creates a substantial risk of causing bodily injury to such police officer or another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The defendant argues that the judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty because the Commonwealth failed to present sufficient evidence to satisfy all elements of the crime. Specifically, he claims that his conduct of stiffening his arms was a natural reaction, and did not constitute the use of \u201cphysical force or violence,\u201d or \u201ccreate[] a substantial risk of causing bodily injury\u201d to the arresting officers, as required by G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, a rational trier of fact could have found that the defendant\u2019s conduct amounted to resisting arrest as defined under either prong of G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B(a). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979). We reach this conclusion by reviewing the spectrum of conduct that has been considered in other decisions to amount to resisting arrest. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grandison, </em>433 Mass. 135, 143 (2001), in response to an officer\u2019s efforts to arrest him, the defendant, who was shouting obscenities, \u201cstiffened his arms and, for a second, was able to pull one of his arms free.\u201d It took four officers to handcuff the defendant, who \u201cnever complied with a request to put his hands behind his back\u201d so that \u201che <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>could be handcuffed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143-144. The court found that the type of resistance perpetrated by the defendant, especially at the moment he pulled his arm free, constituted using \u201c \u2018any other means\u2019 that created a \u2018substantial <em>risk </em>of causing bodily injury\u2019 to the police officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Katykhin, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 261, 262 (2003), the defendant stiffened his body and began to pull away from the arresting officer, \u201cstarting a \u2018tug of war,\u2019 \u201d when he was asked to get into the police cruiser. In that case, we held that the defendant\u2019s use of force \u201cin opposition\u201d to the arresting officer constituted resisting arrest under \u00a7 32B(a)(1), noting that that subsection did not require that the offending conduct pose a substantial risk of bodily injury to the officer. <em>Id. </em>at 263. By way of contrast, <em>Katykhin </em>posited and distinguished \u201cpurely passive conduct not involving the use or threat of force or violence, such as that characteristic of nonviolent protestors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 263 n.2. We stated that our opinion did \u201cnot address, in any way,\u201d such conduct. <em>Ibid. </em>Indeed, the Commonwealth has conceded that such passive conduct would not constitute resisting arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In considering this spectrum, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s actions are of a similar tenor to that conduct deemed criminal in <em>Grandison </em>and <em>Katykhin, </em>and were substantially distant from purely passive conduct. As in <em>Grandison </em>and <em>Katykhin, </em>the defendant in this case was actively uncooperative in his behavior as he opposed the arresting officers\u2019 attempts to handcuff him. When the officers tried to question the defendant, his demeanor and actions were openly hostile, and his recalcitrant conduct did not end when the officers informed him that he was under arrest. To the contrary, it took the effort of two officers to consummate the arrest, and they were able to do so only after pushing the defendant against the wall, thus gaining a physical advantage over him. Although the defendant did not break free as in <em>Grandison, </em>or begin to pull away as in <em>Katykhin, </em>his conduct still represents an active, physical refusal to submit to the authority of the arresting officers, and opposition to their efforts to effect the arrest. While the defendant\u2019s exertion of force in an attempt to prevent his arrest may not have overcome the police officers, the circumstances also presented a substantial risk of injury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>them. In short, the evidence supports the conviction under either prong of G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 32B(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">2. <em>Repeated use of the word \u201cresisting.\u201d </em>The defendant argues that repeated use of the word \u201cresisting\u201d during the officers\u2019 direct examination and in the Commonwealth\u2019s closing argument usurped the jury\u2019s fact-finding role.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">We review the disputed testimony for prejudicial error, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994), and \u201cconsider the challenged comments in light of the entire argument, the judge\u2019s instructions, and the evidence at trial,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 677, 679 (2000). In essence, the defendant claims that the use of the word \u201cresisting\u201d ran afoul of the general proscription against allowing testimony on the \u201cultimate issue\u201d in a case, see Young, Pollets, &amp; Poreda, Evidence \u00a7 704.1, at 507 (2d ed. 1998). While we think that the use of the word in the context of this case falls under the umbrella of permissible shorthand expression, see Liacos, Brodin, &amp; Avery, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 7.4, 7.5, at 379-383 (7th ed. 1999), it would have been preferable for the prosecutor to avoid using the word in framing the questions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In any event, even assuming arguendo that the use of the word was error, such error was harmless. The officers described the defendant\u2019s behavior in great detail. Moreover, the judge gave a curative jury instruction which explained the legal meaning of the term \u201cresisting arrest\u201d and reminded the jury of their fact-finding role in the trial, and their obligation to apply the law to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-6\"> The defendant was also charged with one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (a door), but on the date of the trial the charge was dismissed for lack of prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b502-9\"> In his testimony, the defendant disputed the officers\u2019 accounts of the arrest, claiming that he had not been uncooperative and that the police officers just \u201cdove at [Mm],\u201d \u201cgrabbed [Mm,] and threw [Mm] into the wall.\u201d He testified that the officers never informed Mm that he was under arrest and never told him why he was being arrested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b502-10\"> The defendant does not dispute the legality of Ms arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b504-8\"> We note that in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grandison, </em>433 Mass. at 144, the court, pointing to the evidence, disagreed with the defendant\u2019s claim that \u201cthe officers\u2019 characterization of the defendant\u2019s behavior as \u2018resisting\u2019 or \u2018struggling\u2019 is mere opinion.\u201d However, the court was neither presented with, nor did it address, tile question of the propriety of using the word \u201cresisting.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
