L. c. 152, \u00a7 37, for certain benefits it paid to an employee who sustained a second work-related injury after the date the employer filed its notice of nonparticipation.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\"><em>Background. </em>On April 6, 1993, E.I. Dupont de Nemours &amp; Co. (employer), a self-insurer,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> notified the department, in accordance with G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65(2), that it was electing not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>continue its participation in the trust fund. Because the employer gave notice after March 1, the notice was not effective until July 1, 1994. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65(2). On May 5, 1993, an employee sustained a second work-related injury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On June 13, 1995, the employer and its employee entered into a lump sum settlement agreement, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 48. In 1997, the employer petitioned for reimbursement from the trust fund, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 37, of certain apportioned benefits paid in the 1995 lump sum settlement agreement. The employer\u2019s petition for reimbursement was denied by the trust fund. The matter was subsequently heard by an administrative judge within the department. The administrative judge denied the petition, in part, because the employer had \u201copted out\u201d of the trust fund, giving up entitlement to reimbursement thereunder. The employer appealed to the reviewing board of the department (reviewing board), which affirmed solely on the basis that the employer opted out of the trust fund. A single justice of this court affirmed the decision of the reviewing board, concluding that, under the statute, an employer\u2019s entitlement to reimbursement is conditioned on participation in the fund, and that participation terminates when the employer notifies the department that it is exercising its right to \u201copt out.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">In the case now before us, the employer continues to argue that it is entitled to reimbursement from the trust fund because the injury was sustained before the effective date of its nonparticipation, or opting out.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\"><em>The trust fund. </em>The Legislature has long provided for funds to reimburse employers a portion of the compensation they pay to workers who suffer a second work-related injury, so as to encourage the retention of previously injured employees. See generally <em>American Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>379 Mass. 398, 401-403 (1979); <em>Daly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 100, 101-103 (1990). \u201cAlthough the statutory provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>sions have changed substantially over the years, the right to reimbursement has always been codified at G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 37 and 37A, while the funding mechanism has been codified at G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65.\u201d <em>Shelby Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>420 Mass. 251, 252 (1995). In 1985, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65, was rewritten by St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 55, to establish the trust fund, financed by assessments paid by employers, to partially reimburse employers for payment of second injury claims made by employees. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In 1991, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65(2), was rewritten by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 85, to allow private employers with a license to self-insure, as well as certain other employers, the option of not participating in, or opting out of, the trust fund by filing an irrevocable notice with the department.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>No Massachusetts appellate decision has addressed the effect an employer\u2019s notification of opting out of the trust fund has on the employer\u2019s entitlement to reimbursement under the statute. The issue in this case is whether the reviewing board correctly determined that reimbursement from the trust fund is foreclosed to an employer for an employee\u2019s injury occurring subsequent to the employer\u2019s filing of a notice of nonparticipation. This issue presents a question of statutory interpretation. We examine the statutory language according to well-known principles. See <em>Gateley\u2019s Case, </em>415 Mass. 397, 399 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">In relevant part, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65(2), inserted by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 85, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">\u201cNo reimbursements from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Trust Fund shall be made under clauses (a) to inclusive, to any . . . self-insurer . . . which has chosen not to participate in the fund as hereinafter provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">\u201cNo private employer with a license to self-insure . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>shall be required to pay assessments levied to pay for disbursements under clauses <em>(a) </em>to (g), inclusive, ... if such employer . . . has given up an entitlement to reimbursement under said clauses by filing a notice of non-participation with the department. Such notice shall be made to the commissioner on or before March first of any year in order to be effective as of July first of that year. Notice of non-participation shall be irrevocable . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The employer argues that the statute is ambiguous because it does not explicitly state when entitlement to reimbursement ends for injuries occurring after the filing of a notice of nonparticipation, but before its effective date. Relying on the language in \u00a7 65(2), that the filing of a notice of nonparticipation must be made by March 1 in order to be effective as of July 1 of that year, the employer urges a construction of the statute that would foreclose reimbursement only for injuries occurring after the \u201ceffective date\u201d of opting out, that is, July 1. We do not agree that the statute is ambiguous or that an employer is entitled to reimbursement so long as the injury occurs before the effective opt out date. \u201cWe cannot read into a statute words that the Legislature did not see fit to embody in the enactment. We are bound to interprdt a statute as it is written.\u201d <em>West\u2019s Case, </em>313 Mass. 146, 149 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">As correctly observed by the single justice, \u201c[an employer] \u2018chooses\u2019 not to participate when it notifies the department that it is exercising its right to \u2018opt out.\u2019 The Legislature could have specified, but did not, that entitlement to reimbursement would terminate upon the effective date of the opt out. Its decision to focus on the election to withdraw, rather than on the actual effective date of withdrawal, is meaningful.\u201d The provisions of the statute, taken together and given their plain and ordinary meaning, compare <em>Taylor\u2019s Case, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 499 (1998), clearly indicate that a notice of nonparticipation expresses an employer\u2019s decision to opt out of the trust fund\u2019s mechanism of assessments and reimbursements as of the date it files the notice of nonparticipation.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">This interpretation of when entitlement to reimbursement ends finds further support in the manner in which the trust fund is financed. General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 37, inserted by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 71, states, in relevant part, that \u201c[i]nsurers making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>payments under this section shall be reimbursed . . . from the trust fund . . . ; provided, however, that the insurer is not a self-insurer . . . that has chosen not to be subject to the assessments which fund said reimbursements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Section <em>65(4){b) </em>establishes a private employer trust fund budget based on the department\u2019s annual estimates, made on or before July 1 of each year, of \u201cthe total amount of funds required to make payments during the following twelve months for the compensation payable pursuant to subsection (2) of this section.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65(4)(\u00bf), inserted by St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 55. Funding of the trust fund takes place through employer assessments, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65(2), that are calculated on a yearly basis. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 <em>65(4)(a)-(d). A </em>private employer\u2019s assessment rate for any given year is determined, in part, by consideration of \u201cthose portions of the private employer trust fund budget from which such payor is entitled to seek reimbursement pursuant to subsection (2).\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 <em>65(4){d), </em>as amended by St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 86. Once the assessment rate is determined, it is used to calculate the ultimate assessment to be paid by an employer pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65(5). The assessments paid by private employers constitute the budget available for reimbursements from its respective portion of the trust fund for that year. As a result, employers are required to report to the department annually by May 1, the losses paid for the preceding twelve months, beginning January 1 and ending on the last day of December. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The provisions of the statute, requiring that an employer\u2019s notice of nonparticipation be given by March 1 in order to be effective July 1 of that year, and that an employer\u2019s report of losses for the prior year is to be given by May 1, are coordinated so that an employer electing nonparticipation will not be part of the trust fund\u2019s assessment for its next yearly cycle of funding, as it would if the employer were to continue its participation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As the single justice observed, this method of funding the trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>fund, through annual assessments based on anticipated payments, constitutes essentially a \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d system. Accordingly, the filing of a notice of nonparticipation is a clear indication that an employer will not enter the next cycle of assessment. Consequently, and because the notice is irrevocable, an employer could not take the steps required to engage the reimbursement mechanism for an employee injured after filing its notice of nonparticipation.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Because \u201cthe language of [the] statute is clear and unambiguous, . . . [and] the ordinary meaning of the statutory terms yields a workable result, we need not resort to extrinsic aids of interpretation such as legislative history.\u201d <em>Pyle </em>v. <em>School Comm. of S. Hadley, </em>423 Mass. 283, 285-286 (1996). We therefore conclude that at the time of filing the notice of nonparticipation, an employer has disengaged from the trust fund\u2019s reimbursement mechanism and cannot be reimbursed for an employee\u2019s subsequent injury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For these reasons, and having \u201caccord[ed] deference to an administrative interpretation of a statute,\u201d <em>Massachusetts Org. of State Engrs. &amp; Scientists </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>389 Mass. 920, 924 (1983), we agree with the reviewing board that the statute plainly and unambiguously provides that upon filing its notice of nonparticipation, the employer chose not to participate further in the trust fund, and consequently was neither required to pay future assessments nor entitled to reimbursement for any injury occurring after the date of filing its notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\n<em>Decision of reviewing board affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-15\"> See generally G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 25A(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b385-7\"> For a statement of legal principles related to second injuries, see <em>Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 373, 375-377 (2000). That the employee sustained a second work-related injury in this case is not in dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b385-9\"> The appeal to the single justice from the reviewing board was filed before July 1, 2005, and is not affected by the rescission of this court\u2019s standing order governing appeals from that board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b386-10\"> The leading commentary, Nason, Koziol, &amp; Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 7.16 (3d ed. 2003), contains a discussion of nonparticipation provisions and factors relevant to an employer\u2019s decision to continue to participate in the trust fund, or to opt out.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b388-7\"> Pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65(2), a private employer or group that opts out of the trust fund continues to be required to pay trust fund assessments for funding disbursements under clauses <em>(d) </em>(vocational rehabilitation benefits) and <em>(e) </em>(claims against uninsured employers) of that section.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\"> In this case, the employer\u2019s notice was untimely filed after March 1, 1993, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>so that it did not become effective until July 1,1994. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 65(2). Neither the employer nor the reviewing board argues there is any significance in the late filing, and nothing in our decision turns on the late filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">In addition, actual payment was made by the employer as a lump sum in June, 1995. Even if the employer had not given notice of nonparticipation, it would not have been able to seek reimbursement from the fund, pursuant to \u00a7 37, until 104 weeks from the onset of the disability, which was May, 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b389-13\"> Given our holding in this case, it is unnecessary to address the employer\u2019s other suggestions of analogizing entitlement to reimbursement from the trust fund to principles of indemnity or contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
