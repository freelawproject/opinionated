Some might say that no good can come from this strategy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-14\">On May 3, 2002, Paul J. Vinci filed a complaint alleging legal malpractice against Philip J. Byers, an attorney who represented Vinci in his divorce proceedings. Acting on Byers\u2019s motion for summary judgment, a judge in the Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>concluded that Vinci\u2019s cause of action was barred by the three-year statute of limitations, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 4,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and allowed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Vinci appeals, claiming that the continuing representation doctrine should be expanded and applied to his case; that Byers should be estopped from asserting the statute of limitations due to his conduct; that summary judgment could not be granted on Vinci\u2019s general negligence claim; and that the date of accrual of Vinci\u2019s cause of action could not be decided by summary judgment. We hold that the cause of action accrued prior to May, 1999, and that the continuing representation doctrine is inapplicable. We, therefore, affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\"><em>Facts. </em>\u201cWe recite the material facts in the light most favorable to [Vinci], as the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Nutt, </em>436 Mass. 244, 245 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">On or about November 10, 1996, Vinci, an attorney, retained Byers to represent him in his divorce proceedings. In mid-January, 1997,\"Vinci received a referral fee of about $228,000 for a personal injury case. According to Vinci, he immediately informed Byers, who told him to make the referral fee \u201cdisappear\u201d so that it would not be known in the divorce negotiations at this point.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This advice made Vinci uncomfortable, but he followed it nonetheless. Vinci lent the full amount, as an unsecured ninety-day loan, to a high school Mend on or about January 23, 1997, for an interest payment of $5,000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Between January 16, 1997, and June 30, 1998, Vinci, allegedly at Byers\u2019s direction, filed three financial statements with the Probate and Family Court that did not disclose the referral fee.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The financial statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>submitted on May 21, 1998, was signed by Vinci under the penalties of peijury.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">In April, 1998, Vinci spoke with an attorney in his office concerning a hypothetical involving his own case. The attorney opined that the referral fee should be immediately disclosed to \u201cthe divorce attorney and/or spouse\u201d and that \u201cthe [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)] tax issue [should be addressed] ... as interest and penalties are incurring at substantial rates.\u201d Conversely, Byers allegedly told Vinci not to be concerned with the issue, as he (Byers) had consulted with another attorney who was a former member of the Board of Bar Overseers. Vinci, who himself had handled two divorce cases in the past, continued to follow Byers\u2019s obviously improper advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">On June 30, 1998, Vinci and Byers met with Vinci\u2019s wife and her counsel for a \u201cfour-way meeting,\u201d presumably as required by Probate and Family Court Standing Order 1-88 (1988).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> During this meeting, the wife\u2019s counsel questioned Vinci as to whether he had recently received a large referral fee. Vinci responded in the affirmative, revealing its size. Byers allegedly disclaimed any knowledge of the referral fee, aborted the meeting, and took Vinci outside to discuss the issue. According to Vinci, Byers grabbed him by the tie, told him that he (Byers) would be in trouble for having known about the fee, and that Vinci had better not admit to anyone that Byers knew because Byers \u201cwasn\u2019t going down for this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">At that point and from then on, Vinci \u201cfelt that [his] whole defense of this case was compromised, and that [he] was losing faith in Mr. Byers to represent [him] diligently.\u201d Vinci, however, did not seek new counsel and continued to be represented by Byers. On September 14, 1998, Vinci gave Byers a check for legal services in the amount of $6,000. Vinci further alleges that on April 27, 1999, shortly before the scheduled trial date, he was pressured into signing a separation agreement that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>perceived to be unfair to him, and remained convinced that he would have obtained a better result by going to trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">On May 4, 1999, the Probate and Family Court approved the separation agreement between Vinci and his wife. Vinci claims that Byers continued to represent him long after the separation agreement was signed, or at least until the judgment of divorce became final at the end of the ninety-day nisi period on August 4, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">By complaint filed on May 3, 2002, Vinci brought this action against Byers alleging legal malpractice and the intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Byers filed a motion for summary judgment on all counts, asserting that there were no material facts in dispute and that Vinci\u2019s claims were barred by the statute of limitations. Based on Vinci\u2019s deposition testimony that he no longer trusted or had confidence hr Byers as of June 30, 1998, when it became clear that Vinci\u2019s nondisclosure of the referral fee would result in harm, a Superior Court judge mled that the continuing representation doctrine did not apply to this case and that Vinci\u2019s claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\"><em>Law. </em>\u201cSummary judgment is appropriate where the \u2018pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Highlands Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Aerovox Inc., </em>424 Mass. 226, 232 (1997), quoting from Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). \u201cThe moving party bears the burden of proving that there are no material issues of fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Highlands Ins. Co., </em>424 Mass. at 232, citing <em>Pederson </em>v. <em>Time, Inc., </em>404 Mass. 14, 17 (1989).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">\u201cThe statute of limitations applicable to a legal malpractice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>claim begins to run when a client \u2018knows or reasonably should know that he or she has sustained appreciable harm as a result of the lawyer\u2019s conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lyons, </em>436 Mass. at 247, quoting from <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>423 Mass. 467, 473 (1996). \u201cAt its root meaning, appreciable harm is \u2018injury, loss or detriment\u2019 that is \u2018capable of being measured or perceived.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Goffstein, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 230, 233 (2004), quoting from Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 97, 722 (7th ed. 1999). \u201cThe plaintiff need not know the full extent of [his] injury for a cause of action to accrue and for the statute of limitations to begin running.\u201d <em>Taygeta Corp. </em>v. <em>Varian Assocs., </em>436 Mass. 217, 229 (2002). The standard applied when assessing knowledge or notice is that of a \u201creasonable person in the plaintiff\u2019s position.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Riley </em>v. <em>Presnell, </em>409 Mass. 239, 245 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u201cIf [the] defendant pleads the statute of limitations and demonstrates that the action was commenced more than three years after the date of the plaintiff\u2019s injury, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that the facts take the case outside of the statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>423 Mass. at 474. Although the question when the cause of action accrued typically presents a question of fact, when the facts regarding discovery of harm are undisputed, the question may be decided as matter of law. See <em>Lyons, </em>436 Mass. at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The continuing representation doctrine \u201ctolls the statute of limitations in legal malpractice actions where the attorney in question continues to represent the plaintiff\u2019s interests in the matter in question.\u201d <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>411 Mass. 133, 137 (1991). The doctrine \u201crecognizes that a person seeking professional assistance has a right to repose confidence in the professional\u2019s ability and good faith, and realistically cannot be expected to question and assess the techniques employed or the maimer in which the services are rendered.\u201d <em>Lyons, </em>436 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>at 249-250, quoting from <em>Murphy, </em>411 Mass. at 137. \u201cThe doctrine has no application, however, where the client actually knows that he suffered appreciable harm as a result of his attomey\u2019s conduct. If the client has such knowledge, then there is no \u2018innocent reliance which the continued representation doctrine seeks to protect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lyons, </em>436 Mass. at 250, quoting from <em>Cantu </em>v. <em>St. Paul Cos., </em>401 Mass. 53, 58 (1987).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ArtB\"><em>Discussion. </em>Vinci filed this action against Byers on May 3, 2002. Therefore, in order to fall within the three-year statute of limitations, the underlying cause of action must have accrued after May 3, 1999. See G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 4. Fatal to Vinci\u2019s claims are the notable number of occasions prior to May 3, 1999, that gave Vinci actual knowledge that he had suffered appreciable harm as a result of Byers\u2019s advice.</p>\n<p id=\"A3z\">For example, Vinci testified in his deposition that after the meeting of Byers, himself, his wife, and her attorney on June 30, 1998, when Vinci revealed the existence of the $228,000 referral fee to his wife\u2019s attorney, he \u201cfelt that [his] whole defense of this case was compromised, and that [he] was losing faith in Mr. Byers to represent [him] diligently.\u201d At this point, as the judge found, the statute of limitations was triggered, as Vinci had actual knowledge that as a result of Byers\u2019s advice, Vinci\u2019s position in his divorce case had been negatively affected. Although Vinci did not yet know the full extent of the harm, the statute of limitations had begun to run by this point, see <em>Taygeta Corp., </em>436 Mass, at 229, almost four years before Vinci filed this action against Byers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ati\">The judge, in fact, was being generous to Vinci, as the meeting on June 30, 1998, was neither the first nor the last point at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>which Vinci knew or should have known that Byers\u2019s advice not to reveal the referral fee was improper and would cause him harm. All of the following events occurred prior to May 3, 1999, three years before Vinci filed suit on May 3, 2002: (1) on January 16, 1997, December 3, 1997, and May 21, 1998, he apparently committed perjury by signing financial statements under the penalties of perjury<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>; (2) on April 1, 1998, Vinci received an opinion from another attorney that interest and penalties were accruing from the IRS on the referral fee; (3) on April 27, 1999, Vinci entered into a separation agreement that he perceived to be very unfavorable; and (4) Vinci never recovered the full amount of the loan he made to his high school friend after it became due ninety days after January 23, 1997. There were, thus, several occurrences prior to May 3, 1999, that gave Vinci actual knowledge of Byers\u2019s alleged malfeasance and of the fact that he had suffered injury as a result. For the purposes of this opinion we need not decide which of them initially triggered the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Vinci, however, urges us to apply the continuing representation doctrine to his case. He claims that the statute of limitations began to run \u2014 at the earliest \u2014 on May 4, 1999, when the Probate and Family Court approved the separation agreement. In order for the continuing representation doctrine to apply, Vinci would have had innocently to rely on Byers\u2019s advice and could not have known that he \u201csuffered appreciable harm as a result of his attorney\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Lyons, </em>436 Mass, at 250. Simply, as an attorney, Vinci should have known, among other things, that Byers\u2019s alleged advice to submit false financial statements and commit fraud on the tribunal was both wrong and harmful to him.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The continuing representation doctrine does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Summary judgment correctly entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b169-16\"> The attorney for the plaintiff filed a brief but failed to appear at oral argument.

Only the May 21, 1998, statement was made part of the summary judgment record, and it is the only one included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>in the record appendix before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b171-9\"> Standing Order 1-88 provides in relevant part: \u201cPrior to the scheduled date of the pre-trial conference, a four-way meeting (parties and counsel) is to be held to identify and attempt to resolve the contested issues.\u201d Standing Order 1-88 was deleted upon the adoption of Probate and Family Court Standing Order 1-04, effective October 4, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b172-9\"> Vinci claims that in order to obtain his consent to the separation agreement, Byers offered to waive $20,000 of his legal fee, which was, indeed, waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b172-10\"> The judge did not discuss the emotional distress claim.
