(MHI), appeals from the entry of a separate and final judgment entered pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(b), 365 Mass. 821 (1974), on a complaint brought by O. Ahlborg &amp; Sons, Inc. (Ahlborg), seeking confirmation of an arbitrator\u2019s award under G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 11. MHI argues that because the confirmation order did not resolve with finality a separate and distinct claim, the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>erred in ordering the entry of a separate and final judgment and that the order sought to be confirmed was not that of an arbitrator. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">1. <em>Background facts. </em>In November, 1997, Ahlborg entered into a construction contract with MHI to do part of MHI\u2019s work at a shipyard located in Quincy and Braintree. Section 5.1 of the contract allowed Ahlborg to submit monthly requisitions certifying the percentage and value of the work it had performed and to receive a progress payment commensurate with the work completed during the month. Requisitions were to be accompanied by lien waivers executed by Ahlborg and its subcontractors as well as certification by Ahlborg that amounts due and owing its subcontractors had been paid in full. MHI then had ten days to inspect the work or, in the event of a disputed item, to have the work subject to the requisition inspected by an \u201cindependent engineer\u201d pursuant to section 10.1. As here pertinent, section 10.1 of the contract provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\">\u201cAny controversy, dispute or claim between [Ahlborg] and [MHI] arising out of or relating to this Contract, or the breach thereof (a <em>\u2018Dispute\u2019), </em>shall first be referred to the Independent Engineer for mediation/arbitration. If either [party] is not satisfied with the determination made by the Independent Engineer and wishes to reserve its right to contest such determination, such party shall give notice to the other within twenty (20) days after the Independent Engineer delivers his written determination to the [parties], to set forth the portion of the Dispute being reserved for later arbitration . . . (the <em>\u2018Reservation Notice\u2019). </em>The determination of the Independent Engineer shall be conclusively binding upon [Ahlborg] or [MHI], or both, as the case may be, with respect to any portion of the Dispute that is not so reserved.. . . [A]ny Dispute or portion thereof that is reserved for the later arbitrator as set forth . . . above shall be reserved for decision until after Substantial Completion . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">In July of 1999, with the contract work overdue and over budget, the parties came to an impasse in a dispute about the amount of a progress payment due Ahlborg, requisition number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>12 (the requisition), for work that it claimed it had performed under the contract during the period May 1 through June 30, 1999. The primary but not sole bone of contention between the parties in respect to the requisition was the percentage of work that Ahlborg had completed under the terms of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">On August 13, 1999, MHI requested Stone &amp; Webster, Inc. (S&amp;W), the designated Independent Engineer, to conduct \u201can impartial \u2018top down\u2019 review of the physical work percent complete of [Ahlborg\u2019s] contractual \u2018scope of the work.\u2019 \u201d On August 27, 1999, S&amp;W submitted a report of its \u201cindependent evaluation\u201d to Ahlborg and MHI. S&amp;W\u2019s report was based on a \u201cwalk down of the entire facility to identify the work locations and to understand the status of the work completed to date,\u201d a review with each of the parties\u2019 representatives of the \u201cschedules of values and individual pay items,\u201d the assignment of a \u201cpercent complete\u201d for each item set out in the requisition \u201cbased on each party\u2019s interpretation of the \u2018scope of the work\u2019 and [its] status as of August 25, 1999.\u201d S&amp;W concluded that Ahlborg had completed eighty percent of the \u201cscope of the work\u201d covered in the requisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">S&amp;W acknowledged in its report that three factors had a \u201cdirect impact on the accuracy\u201d of its conclusion: (1) both Ahlborg and MHI disputed the scope of the work to be performed by Ahlborg under their contract; (2) there was insufficient time to conduct an in-depth assessment; and (3) amendments to the contract had \u201cskewed the schedule of values to the point where it [did] not appear to represent the actual value of scope of work items.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">A little over two weeks later, on September 13, 1999, and consistent with the provisions of section 10.1 of the contract, Ahlborg gave timely notice to MHI that (1) it was asserting its right to immediate payment on the requisition based on S&amp;W\u2019s conclusion that its work was eighty percent complete; (2) it was reserving its right under section 10.1 to further arbitration on that portion of S&amp;W\u2019s determination of the percentage of the work completed; and (3) it was demanding immediate arbitration of several disputed issues that would have an effect on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>future requisitions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Unlike Ahlborg, MHI did not give any notice pursuant to section 10.1 that it was reserving its right to further arbitration on any disputed portion of S&amp;W\u2019s report of August 27, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Three days later, on September 16, 1999, Ahlborg brought the present action against MHI alleging, inter alla, that MHI had failed to make payments due under the contract, had refused to authorize payment for additional \u201cscopes of work\u201d performed by Ahlborg at MHI\u2019s request, had intentionally and deceptively failed to inform Ahlborg that its (MHI\u2019s) financing was inadequate to fund the contractual or increased scope of the work, and had failed to honor its (MHI\u2019s) contractual obligations in connection with the default of its designated contractor. Based on these allegations, Ahlborg asserted claims for breach of contract, quantum meruit, and violations of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. In addition to its various requests for relief based on those claims, Ahlborg requested an order confirming S&amp;W\u2019s August 27, 1999, report, and ordering MHI to make payment on requisition number 12, as well as an order to compel MHI to proceed to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">MHI filed an answer and counterclaim for breach of contract, alleging that Ahlborg had failed through its own dereliction to achieve substantial and final completion of the work under the contract and that the work it had performed was defective. As for Ahlborg\u2019s separate request for confirmation of S&amp;W\u2019s report, MH3 was silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">In the meantime, on October 15, 1999, S&amp;W issued a lengthy \u201cIndependent Engineer\u2019s Report,\u201d perhaps in response to Ahlborg\u2019 s September 13, 1999, demand for arbitration on the issues set out in note 1, <em>supra. </em>S&amp;W set out in this report its determination with respect to the scope of the work to be completed under the parties\u2019 contract and an estimate of the cost to complete the remaining scope of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">About six weeks thereafter, on December 2, 1999, Ahlborg <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>renewed its request for confirmation of S&amp;W\u2019s report of August 27, 1999, pursuant to G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 11. It accompanied the motion with a copy of the contract, S&amp;W\u2019s report of August 27, 1999, and the affidavit of its (Ahlborg\u2019s) project director for the shipyard work, Michael Harrington. In his affidavit, Harrington states that eighty percent of the contract value of $22,848,176, less the amount which Ahlborg had been paid, $16,078,949, left the \u201cundisputed amount\u201d of $2,199,592 due and owing Ahlborg on the requisition. MHI opposed confirmation of S&amp;W\u2019s report of August 27, 1999. A fair reading of the grounds for MHI\u2019s opposition is (1) that S&amp;W had not performed the services of an arbitrator under the contract in respect to the moneys owed Ahlborg on the requisition; and (2) that its contract with Ahlborg was terminated on August 30, 1999, prior to the issuance of S&amp;W\u2019s comprehensive report of October 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">On or about January 6, 2000, the judge allowed Ahlborg\u2019s motion to confirm S&amp;W\u2019s report of August 27, 1999, and ordered that judgment enter against MHI in the amount of $2,199,529, the amount that Harrington stated in his affidavit represented eighty percent of the amount due and owing Ahlborg on the requisition. Next, about a month later, MHI filed a motion to vacate the confirmation order and a motion for a \u201crehearing\u201d on Ahlborg\u2019s motion to confirm, asserting that S&amp;W\u2019s report of August 27, 1999, was not an arbitrator\u2019s decision within the meaning of section 10.1(a) of the parties\u2019 contract. In support of its motions, MHI presented the affidavit of Gerald Doton, the signatory on S&amp;W\u2019s report of August 27, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">According to Doton\u2019s affidavit, S&amp;W\u2019s report of August 27, 1999, \u201cwas not the result of any direct negotiations, arbitration and/or mediation between MHI and [Ahlborg]\u201d; S&amp;W had made no determination in respect to payments due Ahlborg under its agreement with MHI; and \u201c[i]t was understood by [S&amp;W] that [the parties] could use [the results of its assessment] in their ongoing negotiations, but [that] the information [set out in that report] was not binding ... on either party.\u201d Ahlborg opposed MHI\u2019s motions and, pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(b), moved for entry of a separate and final judgment confirming S&amp;W\u2019s report of August 27, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Treating MHI\u2019s motions as a motion for reconsideration, the Superior Court judge granted a hearing subject to the condition that MHI produce all its correspondence to S&amp;W that culminated in the report of August 27, 1999. There the matter stood for about two years, until MHI filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts. In April, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court remanded the case to the Superior Court pursuant to a stipulation of the parties entered as an order of the Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">On May 7, 2002, Ahlborg again sought entry of a separate and final judgment on the order confirming S&amp;W\u2019s report of August 27, 1999, and MHI again moved to vacate that order. MHI did so on the same ground that it had asserted earlier, that is, Doton\u2019s affidavit in which he states that the August 27, 1999, report was not a binding arbitration decision. As further support for its position, MHI also noted S&amp;W\u2019s report of October 15, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">MHI, however, continued in its failure to comply with the judge\u2019s earlier ruling that the motion for reconsideration would be heard on the condition that MHI produce its correspondence with S&amp;W relating to the report of August 27, 1999. Consequently, the judge did not reconsider his order confirming the August 27, 1999, report and allowed Ahlborg\u2019s rule 54(b) motion. He did so without issuing written findings in support of his ruling that there was \u201cno just reason for delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">2. <em>MHI\u2019s arguments on appeal. </em>MHI argues that S&amp;W\u2019s report of August 27, 1999, was not an arbitrator\u2019s decision and that the judge was in error in treating it as such. It also claims that the judge erred in ordering the entry of a separate and final judgment on the basis of that report. MHI further argues that the facts underlying Ahlborg\u2019s claim for payment on the requisition are the same as or closely intertwined with the facts underlying its pending claims and that the separate judgment failed to dispose of all legal theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">3. <em>The confirmation order. </em>An order confirming an arbitrator\u2019s award is based on the established and limited inquiries of whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority and whether his decision was tainted by fraud, arbitrary conduct, or procedural irregularity in the hearing. See G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 12(a). Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>an arbitrator\u2019s award cannot be impeached on the basis of errors of law or fact. See <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Commerce Ins. Co., 62 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 416, 420 n.8 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Based on the materials in the record appendix and the applicable cited provisions of G. L. c. 251, we see no error in the judge\u2019s confirmation of S&amp;W\u2019s report of August 27, 1999. Those materials show that Ahlborg\u2019s motion to confirm S&amp;W\u2019s report of August 27, 1999, was based on section 10.1 of its contract with MHI as set out in part one of this opinion, <em>supra, </em>the affidavit of its (Ahlborg\u2019s) project director, and MHI\u2019s failure to reserve its right to dispute S&amp;W\u2019s determination through final arbitration. When, on September 16, 1999, Ahlborg brought the present action seeking confirmation of the report and alleging new claims for which it sought an order to compel arbitration, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>neither MHI\u2019s answer nor counterclaim asserted grounds requiring inquiry into the substance or effect of S&amp;W\u2019s report of August 27, 1999. See <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Commerce Ins. Co., </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. at 420 n.8; G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 12(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">It was not until about a month after the judge confirmed S&amp;W\u2019s report that MHI sought reconsideration of that ruling on the basis of the Doton affidavit. That Doton characterized in his affidavit the review of the work \u201cpercent complete\u201d as a \u201csuperficial\u201d and \u201cquick \u2018Top Down\u2019 assessment,\u201d did not require the judge to reconsider the confirmation order and look beneath the report of August 27, 1999. See <em>Dadak </em>v. <em>Commercial Ins. Co., </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 302, 306 (2001); <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Commerce Ins. Co., </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. at 420 n.8. Nonetheless, the judge was willing to reconsider the confirmation order on the condition that MHI produce all correspondence leading up to S&amp;W\u2019s report. Still, MHI did nothing and remained silent. We conclude that the judge acted well within the range of his discretion in denying MHI\u2019s motion for reconsideration, especially in view of the fact that MHI failed to meet the condition imposed by him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">4. <em>The rule 54(b) certification. </em>Having denied MHI\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>for reconsideration, the judge then allowed Ahlborg\u2019s rule 54(b) motion for the entry and certification of a judgment on the order confirming S&amp;W\u2019s decision of August 27, 1999. Certification of a judgment under rule 54(b) is considered to be a \u201c \u2018special dispensation,\u2019 <em>Feinstein </em>v. <em>Resolution Trust Corp., </em>942 F.2d 34, 39 (1st Cir. 1991),\u201d which should be \u201c \u2018exercised sparingly,\u2019 <em>Harriscom Svenska AB </em>v. <em>Harris Corp., </em>947 F.2d [627], 629 (2d Cir. 1991)].\u201d <em>Long </em>v. <em>Wickett, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 380, 389 (2000). It is proper where (1) an action involves multiple claims or multiple parties; (2) there has been a final adjudication as to at least one but fewer than all of the claims; (3) there is an express finding that there is no just reason for delaying an appeal until the remainder of the case is resolved; and (4) the entry of judgment is expressly directed. <em>Id. </em>at 385-386.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Whether multiple claims exist and whether there has been a final adjudication as to any claim are questions of law upon which our review of the judge\u2019s decision is de nova. <em>Id. </em>at 386. On the other hand, review of \u201c[t]he determination of the presence or absence of a just reason for delay ... is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge and is subject to reversal only for an abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">To be sure, the pleadings filed by Ahlborg and MHI show the existence of multiple claims. However, based on the materials in the record appendix before us and parts one and three of this opinion, <em>supra, </em>as well as MHI\u2019s failure to raise timely any grounds set out in G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 12(a), we conclude that the order confirming S&amp;W\u2019s report of August 27, 1999, in respect to Ahlborg\u2019s requisition number 12 was a final adjudication on a claim separate from and independent of the remaining counts raised by the parties\u2019 pleadings. See <em>Hague </em>v. <em>Piva, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 223, 227 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Although we have repeatedly emphasized the desirability and importance of written findings setting out the reasons for a judge\u2019s exercise of discretion in allowing a rule 54(b) certifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>tian, we also have held that a judge\u2019s failure to do so would not necessarily require dismissal of the appeal. That is especially so where, as here, the judge\u2019s reasons for ordering the entry of judgment on less than all the claims raised by the pleadings are obvious. <em>Dattoli </em>v. <em>Hale Hosp., </em>400 Mass. 175, 176 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">On the basis of the materials in the record appendix before us, we conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion in concluding that there was no \u201cjust reason for delay,\u201d see rule 54(b), in directing that judgment enter on Ahlborg\u2019s claim for payment on requisition number 12. See <em>Acme Engr. &amp; Mfg. Corp. </em>v. <em>Airadyne Co., 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 762, 765 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-9\"> Ahlborg demanded arbitration on the following issues: (1) whether the contract price was subject to adjustment; (2) the scope of work to be completed under the contract; (3) the proper re-allocation of the schedule of values; and (4) compensation for costs resulting from Ahlborg\u2019s use of MHPs designated subcontractor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b425-8\"> We need not consider the parties\u2019 arguments whether Doton\u2019s affidavit could properly be relied upon to impeach the report of August 27, 1999. The judge had the affidavit before him when he allowed MHI\u2019s motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>reconsideration subject to the condition that MHI produce its correspondence concerning the report. Nor need we consider MHI\u2019s contention in respect to the scope of the confirmation order, as its claim is unaccompanied by argument within the comprehension of Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
