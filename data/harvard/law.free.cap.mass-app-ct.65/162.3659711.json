L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A, as amended by St. 2002, c. 35, \u00a7 1, an assault and battery is subject to enhanced penalties if it \u201ccauses serious bodily injury.\u201d See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A(b)(i), (iii). The statute, in subparagraph <em>(c), </em>defines \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d to mean \u201cbodily injury that results in a permanent disfigurement, loss or impairment of a bodily fu\u00f1etian, limb or organ, or a substantial risk of death.\u201d The defendant concedes that the blow he landed to the victim\u2019s jaw (which broke the jaw and required the victim to be fed through a tube for six weeks pending his recovery) impaired a bodily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>function. However, the defendant contends that the statute requires that any such impairment be permanent in order to constitute serious bodily injury. In other words, the defendant suggests that \u201cpermanent,\u201d as used in the statutory definition, modifies not only \u201cdisfigurement\u201d but also \u201closs or impairment of a bodily function, limb or organ.\u201d We reject the defendant\u2019s contention and affirm his conviction on the charge of assault and battery causing serious bodily injury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A-0\">In general, \u201ca statute is to be interpreted \u2018according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>444 Mass. 80, 85 (2005), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galvin, </em>388 Mass. 326, 328 (1983). We begin, of course, with \u201cthe plain language of the statute,\u201d but we also draw guidance from the legislative history of the statute, \u201cthe language and construction of related statutes, . . . and the law of other jurisdictions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welch, supra, </em>and cases cited. See <em>Cooney </em>v. <em>Department of Mental Retardation, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 378, 383 (2001) (\u201cSound principles of statutory construction make it desirable that our interpretation of provisions that have identical language and deal with essentially the same subject be uniform\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"Ay7\">As a threshold matter, we consider a construction that applies \u201cpermanent\u201d to modify only \u201cdisfigurement\u201d to be the most natural and sensible reading of the sentence structure in the statutory definition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A8v\">We also note that St. 2002, c. 35, which created the felony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>assault and battery causing serious bodily injury, also amended G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A, by adding a provision for enhanced penalties where an assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon causes serious bodily injury. See St. 2002, c. 35, \u00a7 2; G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A(c). The two subsections set forth substantially identical definitions of \u201cserious bodily injury.\u201d See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7\u00a7 13A(c), 15A(d). \u201cWe may turn to similar statutes to construe the meaning of words.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cowans, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 811, 816 n.2 (2001). In construing the term \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A, as in effect prior to the 2002 amendments, we have relied upon the common-law definition, treating as dangerous those weapons capable of causing serious bodily injury, and defining the requisite harm as \u201cmore than merely transient and trifling,\u201d but not necessarily \u201cpermanent.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 265, 269 &amp; n.7 (2002). \u201c[A] statute should not be interpreted as being at odds with the common law \u2018unless the intent to alter it is clearly expressed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>392 Mass. 688, 690 (1984), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knapp, 9 </em>Pick. 496, 514 (1830).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The overall statutory scheme (set out in the margin), defining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>increasingly aggravated forms of assault and battery with concomitantly increasing penalties, also supports our interpretation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Our cases have held that to be convicted of even the most heinous of these crimes, mayhem, the victim\u2019s injury need not be permanent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 385, 392 (2004), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 236, 246, <em>S.C., </em>379 Mass. 190 (1979) (\u201cSubsequent recovery from an injury does not preclude a determination,\u201d under the first branch of mayhem, that the injury \u201cdisable[d] a limb or member\u201d). Just as the word \u201cpermanent\u201d was not read into the first branch of the mayhem statute, so, too, we decline to read it into the assault and battery statute before us. The second branch of the mayhem statute punishes \u201cwhoever, with intent to maim or disfigure, assaults another person with a dangerous weapon . . . and by such assault disfigures, cripples or inflicts <em>serious or permanent </em>physical injury ...\u201d (emphasis supplied). G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 14. It is thus apparent that the Legislature has indicated specifically when it meant to require proof of <em>\u201cpermanent </em>physical injury.\u201d It would also be anomalous if a greater (\u201cpermanent\u201d) injury were required to prove assault and battery causing serious bodily injury than to prove mayhem, a crime which carries a more severe penalty, but which does not require infliction of permanent injury. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>do not think the Legislature intended to confuse this statutory scheme by inserting in the statutes additional intermediate forms of assault and battery. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldman, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 635, 637 (1977) (armed robbery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 17, \u201cis but an aggravated form of common law robbery ... distinguishable by the manner of punishment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AXN\">Our construction of the statute not to require permanent loss or impairment of a bodily function finds further support in the structure of two additional statutes addressing similar topics. General Laws c. 119, \u00a7 29C, as amended through St. 1999, c. 3, \u00a7 12,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> defines \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d to mean \u201csubstantial risk of death, extreme physical pain, protracted and obvious disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ or mental faculty.\u201d Repetition of the adjective \u201cprotracted\u201d to modify separately \u201cdisfigurement\u201d and \u201closs or impairment\u201d suggests both that the two represent discrete examples of serious bodily injury, and that the Legislature modifies each element separately when it intends that the element should be modified, even if each is modified by the same adjective. Compare G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13K(a), as inserted by St. 1995, c. 297, \u00a7 <em>4,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which defines \u201c[sjerious bodily injury\u201d as \u201cbodily injury which results in a permanent disfigurement, protracted loss or impairment of a bodily fu\u00f1etian, limb or organ, or substantial risk of death.\u201d Again, the element of \u201cdisfigurement\u201d is treated as separate from the element of \u201closs or impairment of a bodily function, limb or organ,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>and the two elements are specifically qualified by distinct (though different) adjectives.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ACL\">In its simplest terms, the manifest legislative purpose in specifying serious bodily injury as one form of aggravated assault and battery is to impose more severe penalties for assaults and batteries that result in more severe consequences to the victim. In construing the definition of \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d to include a broken jaw, our construction of the statute conforms to the treatment of such an injury uniformly reached in other States that have had occasion to consider the question. See, e.g., <em>Walker </em>v. <em>State, </em>742 P.2d 790, 791 (Alaska Ct. App. 1987) (broken jaw, wired shut for six weeks, satisfied statute\u2019s definitian of \u201cserious physical injury\u201d as one that \u201ccauses . . . protracted . . . impairment of the function of a body member or organ\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>16 Ariz. App. 92, 94 (1971) (fractured jaw bone satisfied aggravated battery statute\u2019s requirement of \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d); <em>People </em>v. <em>Fosselman, </em>33 Cal. 3d 572, 579 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Landry, </em>871 So. 2d 1235, 1239 (La. Ct. App. 2004) (where victim was knocked uncon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>scions and suffered broken jaw, evidence was sufficient for conviction of second-degree battery, defined as, inter alla, \u201cinjury that involves unconsciousness [or] extreme physical pain\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mentola, </em>691 S.W.2d 420, 421-422 (Mo. Ct. App. 1985) (evidence sufficient to convict defendant under statute defining \u201cserious physical injury\u201d as, inter alla, one that \u201ccauses . . . protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ,\u201d where victim suffered broken jaw that was wired shut for six weeks); <em>State </em>v. <em>Houle, </em>291 Mont. 95, 98 (1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>Capawanna, </em>118 N.J.L. 429, 431-432 (Sup. Ct. 1937) (breaking of victim\u2019s jaw a \u201cwounding\u201d under \u201catrocious assault and battery\u201d statute enhancing punishment for \u201cmaiming or wounding\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>267 Pa. Super. 370, 374-375 (1979) (where victim suffered multiple fractures of her jaw, which was wired shut for six weeks, evidence was sufficient for conviction under statute defining \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d as, inter alla, \u201cprotracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ\u201d); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>State, </em>150 Tex. Crim. 131 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"AXk\">Because we reject the defendant\u2019s contention that loss or impairment of a bodily function must be permanent to meet the definition of \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d under the statute, we reject his claim that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction on that charge. As the jury instruction his trial counsel submitted (and the trial judge administered) correctly construed the statute in that respect, we likewise reject the defendant\u2019s claim that trial counsel was ineffective for his failure to request an instruction that loss or impairment of a bodily function must be permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"AnC\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A5U\"> We need not consider the defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction on the charge of intimidation of a witness under G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 13B, because his conviction was placed on file. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>443 Mass. 799, 800 n.1 (2005). To the extent that it bears on the defendant\u2019s conviction on the separate charge of threatening to commit a crime, under G. L. c. 275, \u00a7 2, we discern no abuse of discretion by the trial judge in allowing the Commonwealth to recall the victim to furnish additional testimony after the victim had already completed his initial testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harmon, </em>410 Mass. 425, 433 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A-T\"> The definition of \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A(c), may be read to encompass either two or three discrete disjunctive elements. If there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>are three, they are: (i) permanent disfigurement; (ii) loss or impairment of a bodily function, limb or organ; or (iii) a substantial risk of death. The single use of the conjunction \u201cor,\u201d appearing before the last of those elements, conforms to the ordinary rule of grammar that a list of particulars is separated by commas and connected by a single conjunction. See Strunk &amp; White, The Elements of Style 2 (3d ed. 1979). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 536, 541 (1986) (commas separating items in disjunctive series should each be read as standing in place of an \u201cor\u201d). But see Follett and Barzun, Modern American Usage 420 (1966) (better practice is to separate each member of series by semicolon when members themselves contain conjunctions or commas). The structure of the sentence alone suggests that \u201cpermanent\u201d is not meant to modify the third element (\u201ca permanent ... a substantial risk of death\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The sentence might instead be construed to contain two disjunctive elements: (i) a permanent disfigurement, loss or impairment of a bodily function, limb or organ; or (ii) a substantial risk of death. Under that constmction, however, \u201cdisfigurement\u201d would need to have potential application to each of (a) bodily function; (b) limb; and (c) organ. However, \u201cdisfigurement\u201d would then appear meaningless as applied to \u201cbodily function.\u201d We instead construe the statute so as to give meaning to all of its terms, so that none is rendered meaningless or superfluous. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mendonca, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 684, 687 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b199-6\"> At common law, the only battery short of mayhem was the misdemeanor crime of ordinary battery. Massachusetts, like other States, \u201cresponded by creating a series of intermediate offenses.\u201d Model Penal Code and Commentaries \u00a7 211.1 comment (1)(c), at 180 (1980).

Its initial inclusion may be construed to support our view of the phrase \u201closs or impairment of a bodily function, limb or organ\u201d as grammatically distinct from the other elements of \u201cdisfigurement\u201d and \u201crisk of death,\u201d and its removal prior to enactment may be viewed as reflecting a legislative election to reduce the duration or degree of loss or impairment required to satisfy the element.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"Alb\"> In light of our examination of the statutory language, <em>supra, </em>including our consideration of \u201cthe context of the entire statute in which the challenged words are used,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Panagopoulos, </em>60 Mass.

The plain meaning of the statutory language itself is sufficiently plain and unambiguous to advise a person of reasonable or common intelligence that loss or impairment of a bodily function need not be permanent in order to constitute serious bodily injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
