It struck and killed defendant Price\u2019s decedent, Doreen C. Mellen, who was a cousin of Dion and who had been operating a wood-chipping machine on the same job. It is not unlikely that the noise from the machine made it impossible for Mellen to hear Dion\u2019s shouted warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Dion carried a commercial general liability policy written by the plaintiff, Monticello Insurance Company (Monticello), which brought this declaratory judgment action to determine whether the policy covered Dion\u2019s potential liability to Mellen\u2019s estate. Acting on Monticello\u2019s motion for summary judgment, a Superior Court judge ruled that the policy did not cover the liability, and the defendants appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Commercial general liability (CGL) policies are, in general, intended to protect an insured employer against liability for losses to third parties arising out of the operation of the insured\u2019s business.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 9 Couch, Insurance \u00a7 129.2 (3d ed. 1997). Injuries to employees are typically excluded from coverage, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 129.7, as the expectation is that the employer will have in place workers\u2019 compensation insurance (or self-insurance) in one of the forms made compulsory by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 25A.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">On the evidence before the motion judge, there was, as the judge recognized, an unresolved question of fact whether Mellen had been working the job as an employee or as an independent contractor. The policy provided coverage for \u201csums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 ... to which this insurance applies.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cBodily injury\u201d is covered only if it is \u201ccaused by an \u2018occurrence,\u2019 \u201d which is defined to include \u201can accident,\u201d thus including the injury to Mellen; and \u201cbodily injury\u201d includes \u201cdeath resulting from [bodily injury].\u201d Specifically excluded from coverage, however, are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">\u201cd. . . . Any obligation of the insured under a workers\u2019 compensation . . . law . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>\u201ce. \u2018Bodily injury\u2019 to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">\u201c(1) An \u2018employee\u2019 of the insured arising out of and in the course of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">\u201c(a) Employment by the insured; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">\u201c(b) Performing duties related to the conduct of the insured\u2019s business.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">The word \u201cemployee\u201d is defined to include a \u201cleased worker\u201d but to exclude a \u201ctemporary worker.\u201d The term \u201cleased worker\u201d means \u201ca person leased to you by a labor leasing firm ... to perform duties related to the conduct of your business.\u201d The term \u201c \u2018[tjemporary worker\u2019 means a person who is furnished to you to substitute for a permanent \u2018employee\u2019 on leave or to meet seasonal or short-term workload conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">Lastly, the policy was supplemented by an optional \u201cindependent contractors exclusion,\u201d which presumably reduced the premium, so that the policy did not cover</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">\u201c \u2018bodily injury\u2019 . . . arising out of the operations performed for the named insured by independent contractors or acts or omissions of the named insured in connection with the insured\u2019s general supervision of such operations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">Interpreting these policy terms, the judge ruled, first, that if Mellen was an independent contractor, her death \u201carf\u00f3se] out of the operations performed for\u201d Dion because she would not have been in a position to be struck by the tree if she had not been operating the chipping machine, an operation that was an integral part of the tree removal work Dion was performing. That conclusion was correct; it was irrelevant that the death could be said to have been proximately caused by Dion\u2019s negligence, rather than by anything Mellen was doing. The phrase \u201carising out of the operations performed for the named insured by [the] independent contractor[]\u201d imports a broader conception of causal connection, one fully met by the fact that she would not have been struck except for the fact that she was engaged in doing a critical piece of the work involved in the tree removal at the location on the job where she was expected to be and for which she was to be paid. See <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Monti</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number><em>cello Ins. Co., </em>430 Mass. 454, 457 (1999) (\u201cThe phrase \u2018arising out of\u2019 must be read expansively, incorporating a greater range of causation than that encompassed by proximate cause under tort law. . . . Indeed, cases interpreting the phrase \u2018arising out of\u2019 in insurance exclusionary provisions suggest a causation more analogous to \u2018but for\u2019 causation . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">It would appear, therefore, that coverage is precluded by the policy, either for an independent contractor or for an employee, unless Mellen could be thought to come within the \u201ctemporary worker\u201d exception to the policy\u2019s otherwise general exclusion of coverage for accidents to employees. Thus, the defendants argue that Mellen was a \u201ctemporary worker,\u201d in that she was \u201cfurnished to [Dion] ... to meet . . . short-term workload conditions.\u201d Not implausibly, the necessity for Mellen to work on the particular job, which called for the clearing of more than twenty large trees \u2014 Dion called it a \u201cbig job\u201d \u2014 could be thought of as a \u201cshort-term workload condition[],\u201d so that Mellen could qualify as a \u201ctemporary worker\u201d if she could be said to have been \u201cfurnished\u201d to Dion.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The parties, unfortunately, are of no assistance in suggesting why the policy\u2019s definition of \u201ctemporary worker\u201d is restricted to one who is \u201cfurnished to\u201d the insured. In the words of the Superior Court judge, \u201c[t]hat phrase necessarily connotes some involvement by a third person; . . . [t]he usual and ordinary sense of the words \u2018furnished to you\u2019 requirefs] something more than Dion asking his cousin if she would work for him for a few days and his cousin agreeing.\u201d It is possible that the policy concept of \u201ctemporary worker\u201d mirrors the workers\u2019 compensation insurance concept of the \u201cloaned employee,\u201d see <em>Scribner\u2019s Case, </em>231 Mass. 132, 133-137 (1918); <em>Ferrara\u2019s Case, </em>269 Mass. 243, 244-245 (1929); <em>Wall\u2019s Case, </em>293 Mass. 93, 94-95 (1935), as to whom, under the common law, the obligation to provide workers\u2019 compensation coverage passed from the \u201cgeneral [i.e., lending] employer\u201d to the \u201cspecial [i.e., borrowing] employer\u201d along with direction and control over the employee\u2019s work. See Nason, Koziol, &amp; Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7\u00a7 8.10, 8.11 (3d ed. 2003). Unlike the \u201cleased worker,\u201d for whose benefit workers\u2019 compensation insurance was reliably maintained by the general employer (the labor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>leasing agency), it is possible that the \u201ctemporary worker\u201d exception to the general exclusion of coverage for employees may have been intended as gap coverage to protect the special employer (i.e., the CGL insured) where the furnishing employer may lack coverage. In any event, we agree with the judge that the words \u201cfurnished to [the insured]\u201d cannot be read out of the definition of \u201ctemporary worker.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Anticipating that we might so rule, the defendants argue that Doreen Mellen was in fact \u201cfurnished to\u201d Dion and thus qualified under the temporary worker exception. Pointing to the fact that her main source of income was tree or landscaping work, that she possessed some of the gear (including two chain saws, three ladders, various ropes, shears, and handsaws), and that she sometimes did work as a sole contractor and at other times helped other contractors like Dion on larger jobs, the defendants conclude that she was in effect a sole proprietorship and that her sole proprietorship furnished her services to Dion the day of the accident. The argument is interesting but must be seen as a purely verbal formulation designed to read \u201cfurnished to\u201d out of the policy. Any employee of a business, at least since the abolition of slavery, can be said to \u201cfurnish his services\u201d to his employer, a phrase synonymous with \u201cwork for\u201d his employer; and Doreen Mellen\u2019s \u201csole proprietorship\u201d had no legal existence separate from her own.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">It follows, therefore, that Monticello was entitled to a declaration that the commercial general liability policy it wrote for Paul Dion doing business as All the Answers Tree Service did not provide coverage for the accident that resulted in the death of Doreen Mellen on November 23, 1999, regardless of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Mellen was an independent contractor or an employee. The judge correctly allowed Monticello\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied that of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b81-7\"> \u201cHomeowners\u2019 liability policies,\u201d in contrast, \u201ctypically exempt from coverage bodily injury or property damage arising out of the business pursuits of the insured.\u201d 9 Couch, Insurance, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 128.12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b81-8\"> Workers\u2019 compensation insurance is not compulsory for coverage of \u201cseasonal or casual or part-time domestic servants.\u201d G.
