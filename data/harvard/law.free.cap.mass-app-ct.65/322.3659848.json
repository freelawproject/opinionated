Kelly, Jr. (executor). The genesis of Craft\u2019s claims was the conflagration of the house she shared with Kelly, who died as a result of injuries received in the fire in January of 1993. Kelly died testate, devising the house to Craft and naming Jeanne P. Louizos as the residuary legatee.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Kelly\u2019s fire insurer paid the executor $48,732.38 (fire insurance proceeds). In October, 1993, Cellai brought the underlying Superior Court action against Kelly\u2019s estate on behalf of Craft, seeking, inter alla, money damages for Craft\u2019s injuries sustained during the fire, and declaratory relief that Craft was entitled to the fire insurance proceeds because the specific devise of the house had not been adeemed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On June 23, 1994, a Superior Court judge ordered that the fire insurance proceeds be put in a constructive trust to be held by the executor for Craft\u2019s benefit. The case dragged on without resolution until April, 1997, when Craft, now disheartened with the process, discharged Cellai as her attorney. She negotiated a settlement of all her claims against Kelly\u2019s estate in the amount of $7,500 (settlement proceeds), which was paid by the Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund (Fund) for Kelly\u2019s insurer. The Fund\u2019s check was made payable to Craft, as well as to \u201cComm of Social Services County of Dutchess &amp; Mass. Dept Pub Welfare &amp; Carlo Cellai.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the check was issued, a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice was filed in the Superior Court on October 14, 1997, and the case dismissed on January 2, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">As might be predicted, a dispute arose over Cellai\u2019s legal fee for work done on the case prior to his discharge. Upon Cellai\u2019s motion to establish and enforce an attorney\u2019s lien pursuant to G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 50,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a second Superior Court judge denied him relief, holding that the constructive trust had been dissolved by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>the settlement and that the settlement proceeds did not fall within the statute. Cellai appealed, and on May 24, 2001, this court held that under the attorney\u2019s lien statute, an inchoate lien for attorney\u2019s fees and expenses arose as of the commencement of the underlying action in October, 1993, and matured on June 23, 1994, when a Superior Court judge entered an interlocutory order, ordering the executor to hold the fire insurance proceeds in a constructive trust until the amount due to Craft could be determined. <em>Craft </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 648, 650-652 (2001) <em>(Craft </em>I). We remanded the case \u201cto the Superior Court for further proceedings under Cellai\u2019s motion to establish and enforce his lien, including a final determination of the amount received by the executor and held by him under a constructive trust, to the extent that such amount constitutes the net proceeds of the fire insurance applicable to the damage to the real estate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653-654.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">On remand, another Superior Court judge (remand judge) conducted a nonevidentiary hearing on the particular issues. She ruled that Craft was entitled to a payment of $14,489.03 from the constructive trust of the fire insurance proceeds to which Cellai\u2019s lien could attach. To this, she added the $7,500 settlement proceeds for a total covered by the lien of $21,989.03. She also determined that Cellai was entitled to interest on this amount from December 22, 1997, the date on which the executor violated the interlocutory order establishing the constructive trust by disbursing all of the fire insurance proceeds to Kelly\u2019s residuary legatee. Subsequent to a further hearing occasioned by the executor\u2019s motion for reconsideration, she vacated part of her original ruling and ordered that \u201cCellai\u2019s lien is limited to the amount recovered in good faith by [Craft], that his lien is limited to $7,500 which has already been paid to him and which hopefully he can have the [Fund] reissue its [check] to him if in fact, he has lost that check.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Cellai raises a plethora of issues, only two of which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>pertinent to resolving this second appeal: (1) a determination of the total amount of money held in the constructive trust by the executor and subject to Cellai\u2019s lien; and (2) whether Cellai is entitled to interest on the amount to which the lien attaches and, if so, from what date.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">1. <em>Assessment of the attorney\u2019s fees under the lien. </em>After we remanded the case in <em>Craft I </em>for further proceedings on the attorney\u2019s lien issues, additional written materials, including correspondence between Craft and Cellai, became part of the record. The remand judge found that Craft\u2019s discharge of Cellai was not done in bad faith or motivated by any of the other factors described in <em>Salem Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Matera, </em>384 Mass. 803, 804 (1981). Rather, the record reflects that Craft was frustrated by the lengthy litigation process and had lost patience with the whole case. The remand judge found that Craft\u2019s letter discharging Cellai was \u201cthoughtful and reflects a decision-making process that had taken her several months.\u201d As a result, the remand judge correctly applied the general rule in Massachusetts that a \u201cclient\u2019s discharge of an attorney ends the attorney\u2019s right to recover on the contract of employment and, thereafter, an attorney can recover only for the reasonable value of his services on the basis of quantum meruit.\u201d <em>Opert </em>v. <em>Mellios, </em>415 Mass. 634, 636 (1993). Cellai has no quarrel with this aspect of the remand judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">In determining the reasonableness of the fee and costs, the remand judge did not consider the usual factors such as the dollar value of the case, the value of the services, the fees usually charged, time spent, and the success achieved, see <em>Phelps Steel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Von Deak, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 592, 595 (1987), because Cellai\u2019s total bill exceeded the \u201camount\u201d covered by the lien. With respect to that amount, she found as follows: Of the total payment of $48,732.38 from Kelly\u2019s fire insurer for the damage to the house and to the personal property within, $26,115.97 was for damage to the house and thus payable to Craft. From that figure, she deducted $2,626.94, which represented Craft\u2019s pro rata share of the fire adjuster\u2019s fee. She also deducted $9,000 paid by the estate to the town of Somerset to discharge a lien for nonpayment of taxes, and then added the $7,500 settlement received by Craft. As a result, in her initial order, she found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>there remained a net amount of $21,989.03 to which Cellai\u2019s lien could attach.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Acting on the executor\u2019s motion for reconsideration, she limited, we think erroneously, Cellai\u2019s lien to the $7,500 settlement that Craft had received from the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">The core issue argued by Cellai is that the remand judge was initially correct in enforcing the lien against both the fire insurance proceeds and the settlement proceeds, and that she should not have revoked her original order and limited the amount of the lien to $7,500. The executor takes the position that the remand judge properly applied the principles articulated in <em>Craft I </em>and that Cellai\u2019s lien covers only the $7,500 payment because Craft settled all of her claims for that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">We start with the proposition that Cellai\u2019s lien arose at the commencement of Craft\u2019s suit against Kelly\u2019s estate and remained in effect despite Craft\u2019s later discharge of Cellai and her settlement of the suit. In <em>Craft I, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. at 650-652, we concluded that the lien attached to the fire insurance proceeds because a constructive trust was established when Craft, with Cellai as her attorney, convinced a Superior Court judge that the specific devise of Kelly\u2019s house to her was not adeemed by the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The executor argues that we allowed the attorney\u2019s hen to attach to the constructive trust amount only because there was confusion as to what happened to the $7,500 settlement draft.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The executor misconstrues our opinion in <em>Craft I. </em>There, we analyzed Cellai\u2019s claims against the fire insurance proceeds held in a constructive trust and the settlement proceeds as distinct aspects of the same lien. See <em>id. </em>at 650, 652. As we stated in <em>Craft </em>I, \u201cCellai\u2019s lien under [G. L.] c. 221, \u00a7 50, . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>remained unaffected by the later dismissal of the suit . . . and attached to whatever amount is finally determined to have been due Craft out of the fire insurance proceeds of $48,732.38, which formed the res of the constructive trust.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 651-652. We did not allow the lien to attach to the constructive trust merely because we were unsure of the fate of the $7,500 check. The lien attached under G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 50, when the order establishing the constructive trust was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">2. <em>Computation of interest. </em>The remand judge ruled that the executor\u2019s payment of the fire insurance proceeds to the residuary legatee on December 22, 1997, constituted a breach of the interlocutory order establishing the constructive trust. As a result, she determined that interest accrued on Cellai\u2019s lien from that date. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The relevant statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C, as amended through St. 1993, c. 110, \u00a7 224, states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">\u201cIn all actions based on contractual obligations, upon a verdict, finding or <em>order for judgment </em>for pecuniary damages, interest shall be added . . . . If the date of the breach or demand is not established, interest shall be added by the clerk of the court. . . from the date of the commencement of the action . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">This case presents a unique set of circumstances, unlike a standard breach of contract case in which parties must conform their conduct to terms of their written or oral agreement. Here, the remand judge correctly ruled that the original contingent fee agreements between Cellai and Craft lapsed when Craft chose, in good faith, to discharge Cellai as her attorney. There ceased to be any agreements concerning the payment of Cellai\u2019s fee, and, as we have concluded, he can recover only the reasonable value of his services on the basis of quantum meruit. In essence, there were no longer any agreements to \u201cbreach.\u201d It is equally illusive to search the record for a \u201cdemand\u201d because Cellai\u2019s notice of lien remained unaffected by the later dismissal of the suit. See <em>PGR Mgmt. Co. Inc., Heath Properties </em>v. <em>Credle, </em>427 Mass. 636, 640 (1998). See also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Consalvo, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 192, 194 n.3 (1994) (noting, although not discussing or approving of, counsel\u2019s successful motion, following a settlement reached by successor counsel, to have succes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>sor counsel deposit an amount \u201c[based on (counsel\u2019s) original application for an attorney\u2019s lien from the settlement in an interest bearing escrow account, pending further order of the court\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">In <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>397 Mass. 837 (1986), the Supreme Judicial Court interpreted G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C, the statute with special attention to this dilemma. There, the court noted that the primary purpose of the statute was to \u201ccompensate a damaged party for the loss of use or unlawful detention of money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 841, quoting from <em>Perkins Sch. for the Blind </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., </em>383 Mass. 825, 835 (1981). \u201cAn award of interest is made\u201d to make the wronged party whole and should not \u201cresult in a windfall for plaintiffs amounting, in essence, to an award of punitive damages.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In this case, to implement the purpose of the statute, we conclude that it was only after the remand judge entered her initial order on April 28, 2004, establishing the amount of the lien, that Cellai was lawfully entitled to his legal fee. Until that time, he was not deprived of the use of his money because the amount of the hen remained an unsettled question.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The order on the executor\u2019s motion for reconsideration is vacated. The judgment on Cellai\u2019s motion to enforce attorney\u2019s hen is modified to award interest only from April 28, 2004, and as so modified, is to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b357-7\"> The executor took the position that the fire insurance proceeds were personalty and should pass to Kelly\u2019s residuary legatee, not to Craft.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b357-8\"> The Fund\u2019s check has never been cashed, and at oral argument neither party could account for its whereabouts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b357-9\"> General Laws c. 221, \u00a7 50, as appearing in St. 1945, c. 397, \u00a7 1, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-10\">\u201cFrom the authorized commencement of an action, counterclaim or other proceeding in any court, ... the attorney who appears for a cli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>ent. . . shall have a lien for his reasonable fees and expenses upon his client\u2019s cause of action, counterclaim or claim, upon the judgment, decree or other order in his client\u2019s favor entered or made in such proceeding, and upon the proceeds derived therefrom.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b360-8\"> Cellai argues for the first time that the remand judge acted impermissibly when she deducted the $9,000 paid to the town of Somerset for unpaid taxes and the $2,626.94 fire adjuster\u2019s fee.

It is also agreed that Cellai no longer has the check, and that it has not been cashed. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>The executor argues that \u201c[a]ny confusion about the holding in <em>[Craft I], </em>however, was created by Cellai\u2019s deliberate failure to inform the court and [the executor] that he had received the $7,500 settlement payment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b362-8\"> The executor\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees and double costs associated with this appeal is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
