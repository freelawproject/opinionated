After the children\u2019s mother and father were divorced in 1994,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the mother (apparently in 1994 or 1995) married the stepfather. The children have lived with their mother and stepfather since that time, and as we shall discuss more fully, <em>infra, </em>the stepfather has played an active and substantial role in the children\u2019s lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">At the commencement of the hearing on the petition for change of name (on March 7, 2003),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the judge was informed that Dr. Edward M. Powers had been appointed guardian ad litem for the children in an ancillary proceeding to investigate visitation and contact between the children and their father following an incident at a soccer game.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although the mother voiced her belief that Dr. Powers\u2019s guardian ad litem report, which was due on April 10, 2003, would be \u201cvery helpful\u201d to the judge in resolving the name change petition, the judge decided to proceed with the hearing on the merits. Thereafter, the mother, who was the only witness at the hearing, testified as to the longstanding and close relationship between the children (who were ten and twelve years of age at the time of the hearing) and their stepfather. She testified further that since 1998 the children had used their stepfather\u2019s surname in their activities,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that they introduced themselves to others using their stepfather\u2019s surname, and that they wanted to be referred to by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>their stepfather\u2019s surname. Continuing, the mother stated that the children had no affection for the father, that they had no desire to be seen with him,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that they had pressed to have their surname legally changed. The mother acknowledged that the father was up-to-date in his child support payments; that he had attempted, through the filing of court actions subsequent to the incident on March 31, 2002, to continue to have a meaningful role in the children\u2019s lives; and that he had \u201ctimely\u201d objected to the name change petition. A letter written by Dr. Powers, dated August 26, 2001, was also introduced in evidence. Doctor Powers stated therein that although his work with the family had been limited, the father appeared to have a genuine affection for his two children and they for him, and that the father\u2019s interactions with the children \u201cwere observed to be occasions of comfortable interpersonal exchange with the children and their father enjoying each other\u2019s company, and were absent of any signs of physical discomfort or emotional distress.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">At the conclusion of the mother\u2019s testimony, the father moved for a \u201crequired finding,\u201d which the judge appears to have treated as a \u201cmotion for a directed verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Thereafter, there was much discussion between counsel and the judge concerning, inter aha, the possible need for Dr. Powers to testify and whether the judge should reserve judgment until Dr. Powers filed his guardian ad litem report. At the close of trial, the judge informed counsel for the father: \u201cThere\u2019s no need to call your client. You did a prima facie case. Otherwise, you\u2019d be entitled to a motion for directed verdict as you\u2019ve asked for.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>By an order dated March 13, 2003, the judge took under advisement the questions whether to admit Dr. Powers\u2019s letter of September 7, 2002 (see note 7, <em>supra), </em>and whether to wait for Dr. Powers to file his guardian ad litem report. The judge stated further that \u201c[b]y representation of counsel for the children, the Court understands that Dr. Powers may include in his report information concerning the children\u2019s name change petition and whether or not it is in the best interest of the children to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">On April 25, 2003, the judge issued a \u201cjudgment\u201d (which also includes certain findings) denying the petition for change of name, finding that the father was current in his child support obligations for both children and continued to love and show an interest in the children, as manifested by Dr. Powers\u2019s letter of August 26, 2001, and the mother\u2019s own reluctant admission to that effect.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The judge did not find credible the mother\u2019s testimony that the children had no interest in spending time with the father or that the children had requested the name change (a request that, the judge indicated, would not be determinative in any event). Concluding that the mother, as moving party, had failed to meet her burden of demonstrating that it was in the best interests of the children to change their names, the judge directed the mother to correct \u201cany and all school, religious, extra-curricular, sporting, and all other records to reflect each of the children\u2019s correct legal names . . . , and, thereafter, only [those] names shall be used with respect to each child in every instance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The children, through their attorney, moved for reconsideration, for a new trial, and for relief from judgment, stating, through the affidavit of counsel, that the guardian ad litem\u2019s report (the relevant portions of which are set out in the margin<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>) had been timely filed and received in the Probate and Family Court on April 10, 2003. On May 29, 2003, the judge, having reviewed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>guardian ad \u00a1item\u2019s report (which the judge stated had been timely filed in the court but not placed in the petition for change of name file) and the formerly-excluded letter of September 7, 2002 (which was incorporated by reference in the guardian ad litem\u2019s report),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> issued a \u201cfurther order\u201d denying all the postjudgment motionsand affirming the earlier judgment, \u201crestajfing] that the Court does not believe that the children\u2019s change of their surname <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>to [that of their stepfather] is in the children\u2019s best interests.\u201d The judge followed with separate and more detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which iterate, in part, the findings intertwined in the judgment dated April 25, 2003.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In concluding that the change in name would not be in the children\u2019s best interest, the judge emphasized the father\u2019s \u201cgood relationship\u201d with, and love for, the children (as evidenced, inter alla, by Dr. Powers\u2019s letter of August 26, 2001, and the mother\u2019s own testimony) and the lack of evidence to suggest that the children do not love the father. The judge further noted that the children have had the father\u2019s surname their entire lives, that \u201cthe level of their identification with the name is well established,\u201d and that there was no evidence that the children\u2019s retention of their father\u2019s surname would cause them difficulty or embarrassment. Finally, the judge, pointing to the comment in Dr. Powers\u2019s letter of August 26 that the \u201cparents remain highly contentious toward each other,\u201d found that the mother\u2019s efforts to change the children\u2019s surname \u201cconstitutes an attempt to alienate [the] [fjather from the children\u2019s lives,\u201d behavior that should not be condoned through a change of name petition. In the judge\u2019s view, \u201callowing the children to keep the last name of their natural father is an important step towards repairing the temporary estrangement of the [fjather from the children.\u201d The mother and children have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>At common law a person could \u201cchange his name at will, without resort to legal proceedings, by merely adopting another name, provided that this is done for an honest purpose.\u201d <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 568, 570 (2002), quoting from <em>Merolevitz, petitioner, </em>320 Mass. 448, 450 (1946). \u201cThat a change of name petition may be sought pursuant to G.

It simply aids a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>petitioner in securing an \u201cofficial record which definitely and specifically establishes his change of name.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570-571, quoting from <em>Verrill, petitioner, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 34, 35-36 (1996). We have stated that in controversies concerning the surnames of children, whether born to married or unmarried parents, the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the child standard is applicable. <em>Id. </em>at 571 (provision in G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 12, that a petition seeking to change the name of a person \u201cshall be granted unless such a change is inconsistent with public interests\u201d does not displace the \u201cbest interests\u201d standard). See <em>Petition of Two Minors for Change of Name, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 941, 941 (1988); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 660, 662 (1992).

App. Ct. at 664. <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. at 571-572.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Mark </em>v. <em>Kahn, </em>333 Mass. 517, 521-522 (1956) (\u201cA change of name may not be in the child\u2019s best interest if the effect of such change is to contribute to the further estrangement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>child from a father who exhibits a desire to preserve the parental relationship\u201d). The personal preference of a child of suitable age and maturity should also be considered. See <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. at 570, 572. See also <em>Mark </em>v. <em>Kahn, </em>333 Mass. at 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">In the instant matter, we agree with the mother and the children that the \u201cjudgment\u201d and \u201cfurther order\u201d denying the petition for name change must be vacated. As we have indicated, the judgment and findings suggest that the judge based his decision on consideration of several factors that lack firm foundation in the evidence or ignore evidence to the contrary, most notably the mutual love and affection between the father and the children, the children\u2019s \u201cwell established\u201d identification with their father\u2019s surname, and the mother\u2019s efforts to alienate the father from the children\u2019s lives through the change in surname.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We address in turn each of these bases.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">In determining that the father has a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with the children, and that there is mutual love and affection between them, the judge seemingly relied on the father\u2019s visitation history with the children, the purported testimony of the mother that she believes the father loves the children, the absence of evidence that the children do not love the father, and the observations of Dr. Powers concerning the interactions of the father and the children as set out in his letter of August 26, 2001 (which appears also to have served as a basis for the judge\u2019s determination that the mother was not credible in testifying that the children had requested the change in name and had no interest in spending time with their father). At the outset, there is nothing in the record to support the judge\u2019s finding that the mother admitted, reluctantly or otherwise, that she believes the father loves the children. Moreover, there ultimately <em>was </em>\u201cevidence\u201d before the court (apart from the mother\u2019s testimony), in the form of the guardian ad litem\u2019s report and Dr. Powers\u2019s letter of September 7, 2002 (see note 11, <em>supra), </em>that the children harbor antipathy towards the father. Furthermore, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>importantly, the judge\u2019s findings, while quoting liberally from Dr. Powers\u2019s letter of August 26, 2001 (which was based on Dr. Powers\u2019s then-limited work with the family), fail to reflect any meaningful consideration by the court of Dr. Powers\u2019s updated (and independent) assessments of the children in the light of subsequent events, and the children\u2019s repeated statements to Dr. Powers concerning, for example, their negative attitudes toward the father, their lack of interest in resuming contact with him at the present time, and their <em>own </em>desires to change their surname.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">The judge\u2019s finding concerning the children\u2019s identification with the father\u2019s surname is also problematic. Putting to one side possible issues implicated in \u201chistoric patterns of patronymic naming\u201d (see note 16, <em>supra), </em>while it is true that the children\u2019s legal surname has been that of their father for their entire lives, the judge\u2019s findings fail to reflect (as it may bear on the question of identification) consideration of the evidence adduced at trial and contained in the guardian ad litem\u2019s report that the children generally have been using their stepfather\u2019s surname in their social activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Finally, while the effect of the change of a child\u2019s surname on the preservation and development of the child\u2019s relationship with each parent, and a parent\u2019s attempt, through a name change, to alienate the other parent from a child,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> may be proper considerations for the court in determining a child\u2019s best interests, here, in the absence of adequate consideration in the findings of all relevant factors (and evidence), the judge\u2019s decision cannot stand.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">In light of the errors and deficiencies in the judge\u2019s findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>in support of his conclusion that the change in name was not in the best interests of the children, we vacate the \u201cjudgment\u201d and the \u201cfurther order\u201d and remand the matter to the Probate and Family Court for a new hearing before a different judge. As in <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. at 572 &amp; n.6, the parties may raise on remand the appropriate considerations to be entertained by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">The judgment dated April 25, 2003, and the further order dated May 29, 2003, are vacated, and the matter is remanded to the Probate and Family Court for a new hearing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-14\"> The two minor children also signed the petition for change of name. We have noted that \u201c[w]hether a parent or guardian may undertake to change the name of a minor child as \u2018next friend\u2019 of the child has not been decided.\u201d <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 568, 570 n.5 (2002). As the issue was not raised below and has not been pressed on the appeal, we do not pass upon it.

As a result of the incident, assault and battery charges were brought against the father, who was found not guilty. The mother and both children obtained restraining orders against the father after the incident, and the father\u2019s visitation was suspended pending an investigation by Dr. Powers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b885-9\"> The mother also stated that the children\u2019s school had allowed the children to use the hyphenated surname of the father and stepfather and that she registered the children for religious classes under the father\u2019s surname because it was a \u201clegal document\u201d (although the children refer to themselves at church by their stepfather\u2019s surname).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b886-7\"> The mother stated that the elder child had not had a face-to-face visit with the father since October, 2001, and that the younger child had not had a face-to-face visit with the father since the incident at the soccer game.

On cross-examination of the mother, the children\u2019s counsel elicited evidence that Dr. Powers had continued to work with the children subsequent to August 26, 2001. Counsel sought to introduce a second letter prepared by Dr. Powers and dated September 7, 2002, which was marked for identification.

They assert further that to the extent our decision in <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Mason, supra, </em>meant to hold that \u201cwhen a child . . . herself petitions for change of name and is competent to make that petition the court may nevertheless deny it on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>the ground that the change is not in the best interest of the child,\u201d it was wrongly decided. In the mother and children\u2019s view, \u201c[n]othing in \u00a7 12 refers to the best interests of the child, and by referring to the \u2018public interest\u2019 the Legislature virtually repudiated that standard in \u00a7 12 petitions.\u201d They also claim that reversal is required because the judge erroneously placed the burden of proof on the children in this case. None of these \u201cissues\u201d was raised in any meaningful way at the hearing, and indeed, the mother and children\u2019s arguments appear (in part) to be inconsistent with the theories on which the case proceeded below. See <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Larson, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 338, 341 (1990). In the circumstances, and in view of the uncertainty as to what points may be pressed at the new hearing, we decline to address these questions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
