Tompkins appeals from a judgment of the Probate and Family Court revoking a domestic relations order entered over four years earlier that specified the bases upon which Denise\u2019s interest in her former husband\u2019s pension was to be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-16\"><em>Background. </em>After thirty years of marriage, Robert W. and Denise M. Tompkins were divorced by a judgment of divorce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>nisi dated December 6, 1999, which became absolute on March 6, 2000. A probate judge approved a separation agreement of the parties dated August 14, 1999, that was incorporated in the divorce judgment, but survived the judgment \u201cas an independent contract.\u201d Within a provision allocating the parties\u2019 interests in their respective pensions is the following sentence, which forms the basis of the judge\u2019s action that is the subject of this appeal: \u201cThe HUSBAND and WIFE further agree that the HUSBAND shall, upon the execution of this Separation Agreement, consent to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] by which 50% of his retirement benefits from the Hull Retirement System, accrued as of the date of this Separation Agreement, shall be allocated to the WIFE.\u201d Three months after the entry of the judgment nisi, the parties submitted a joint motion, prepared by Robert\u2019s attorney (Denise was not represented), requesting that the judge enter a domestic relations order (DRO) in the form attached to the motion and incorporated therein.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The motion further stated that the attached DRO was \u201cpursuant to the terms of a Judgment of Divorce Nisi entered on December 6, 1999,\u201d providing that Denise \u201cwas to receive the sum equivalent to 50% from the husband\u2019s retirement plan.\u201d The proposed DRO attached to the motion had also been prepared by Robert\u2019s attorney.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The motion was allowed, and the judge, on May 17, 2000, issued a DRO in the form stipulated by the parties. The DRO provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>that it is \u201ca part of the final Judgment in this matter.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Upon Robert\u2019s retirement three years later, on May 31, 2003, the parties began to receive their respective retirement checks. It is undisputed that checks received by Denise were calculated in accordance with the DRO that had been stipulated to by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">By a complaint for modification filed October 30, 2003, Robert challenged, for the first time, the language in the DRO as inconsistent with the August 12, 1999, separation agreement. He also filed a motion seeking revocation of the judge\u2019s approval of the DRO and substitution of an amended DRO. In his affidavit in support of the motion, Robert asserts that Denise \u201cshould be receiving $641.69 per month and not $922.56,\u201d and that the language in the DRO is a \u201cmistake\u201d and that it \u201cshould have been written so that [Denise\u2019s] benefits were accrued up to the . . . date of divorce . . . per the separation agreement.\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>a conclusory paragraph, he states, \u201cA mistake in the drafting of a later document [the DRO] that mistakenly did not reflect the agreement reached by the parties should not supersede the separation agreement regardless of whose attorney drafted the [DRO].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Thereafter, Denise filed a motion for summary judgment accompanied by her affidavit, in essence denying there was a mistake in the language of the DRO. So far as the record reflects, the parties did not file memoranda of law; the only submissions in support of the motions were the separation agreement, the parties\u2019 joint motion and attached DRO that had been made part of the final judgment, the parties\u2019 affidavits, and Robert\u2019s newly proposed DRO. Both motions were scheduled for hearing on the same day. On May 5, 2004, following the hearing, the judge denied Denise\u2019s motion by endorsement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">A month later, on June 3, 2004, the judge allowed Robert\u2019s motion, issuing a judgment entitled \u201cDECLARATION OF RIGHTS On Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for Revocation of Approval of [DRO].\u201d It is apparent from the judge\u2019s rationale supporting the ruling that she viewed Robert\u2019s complaint as one seeking enforcement of an agreement, rather than one seeking modification of a judgment. Examining only the provisions of the August 14, 1999, separation agreement, and without considering the stipulated language in the proposed DRO that had been submitted to her in March, 2000, by the parties, the judge issued the declaration of rights, declaring that \u201c[t]he date of the partiesf] divorce, December 6, 1999, is the appropriate date to be used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>for all variables in the retirement allowance calculation.\u201d By this action, the judge revoked the DRO entered on May 17, 2000, that had become part of the divorce judgment. Denise appealed. For the reasons we shall discuss, we vacate the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><em>Discussion. </em>Although Robert\u2019s complaint and motion seek relief from the judgment, the judge\u2019s declaration of rights focuses on enforcement of the underlying separation agreement. Denise makes no claim of error as to the procedure by which the judge, sua sponte, decided Robert\u2019s motion as though he had presented a request for a declaration of the parties\u2019 present rights under the separation agreement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We therefore consider whether Robert made a timely challenge to the judgment, as well as whether he has a viable alternative claim that the stipulations prepared by his attorney (as set forth in the joint motion and attached DRO) contain a mistake supporting rescission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>the DRO\u2019s stipulated terms. We agree with Denise that Robert is barred from relief on either ground and that the DRO should not have been revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">1. <em>Correcting \u201cerror\u201d in judgment. </em>Robert claims that he did not become aware of what he views to be a \u201cdiscrepancy\u201d between the terms of the separation agreement and the DRO until he retired in 2003 and began receiving payments, and that the \u201cerror\u201d in the judgment may be \u201ccorrect[ed] at any time under Rule 60(a) [or 60(b)(6)] [of the Massachusetts Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure].\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Rule 60(a) \u201cseeks to ensure that the record of judgment reflects what actually took place,\u201d Reporter\u2019s Notes to Mass.R. Civ.P. 60, 43B Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., Rules of Civil Procedure, at 331 (West 2002). \u201cRule 60(a) does not apply unless the mistake springs from some oversight or omission; it does not cover mistakes which result from deliberate action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332. The DRO contains exactly the terms to which the parties had stipulated, and approval of the DRO was consistent with the parties\u2019 request, as set forth in their joint motion. There was thus no mistake in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Moreover, although Robert claims he did not become aware of the \u201cmistake\u201d in the judgment until he began receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>benefits three years later, any mistake was apparent on the face of the DRO. To the extent that Robert had a viable claim for relief from the judgment based on mistake, that claim could have been raised by a motion for postjudgment relief pursuant to Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 60(b)(1), but under that rule, the claim must have been made not more than one year after the DRO entered. Because the claim for relief is based on an asserted mistake in the DRO, Robert may not bring his claim under rule 60(b)(6), which by its terms is available only when the relief sought is \u201cbased upon some other reason than those stated in Rule 60(b)(1)-(5).\u201d Reporter\u2019s Notes to Mass.R.Civ.P. 60, <em>supra </em>at 334. The importance of the finality of judgments that is embodied in rule 60(b) extends to judgments of divorce incoiporating separation agreements. <em>Bracci </em>v. <em>Chiccarelli, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 318, 323-324 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Robert\u2019s claim also fails because it constitutes a collateral attack on the judgment. See, e.g., <em>Pavlik </em>v. <em>Dmytryck, 6 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 915, 916 (1978) (action in Land Court was \u201cimpermissible collateral attack\u201d on Probate Court judgment, even assuming Probate Court lacked authority to order conveyance of plaintiff\u2019s interest in land, where final judgment had entered and rights of parties were thus limited to timely appeal or other direct challenge to Probate Court judgment); <em>Levenson </em>v. <em>Feuer, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 428, 441-442 (2004) (plaintiff, who neither appealed nor sought postjudgment relief from contempt judgment, could not collaterally attack judgment in a declaratory proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">2. <em>\u201cMistake\u201d in drafting the stipulated terms. </em>We next consider Robert\u2019s claim that the parties\u2019 proposed DRO, as prepared and submitted to the court in March, 2000, reflects a mistake that is apparent by comparing that document to the provisions of the earlier separation agreement, which he describes as the \u201ccentral contract.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Robert asserts, and we agree, that it is within the Probate Court\u2019s authority to declare the parties\u2019 rights under their separa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>tion agreement, pursuant to G. L. c. 231 A, see <em>Krapf </em>v. <em>Krapf, </em>439 Mass. 97, 107 (2003), and to modify a divorce judgment so that it conforms to the judge\u2019s determination regarding the parties\u2019 respective rights under that agreement. See <em>id. </em>at 104, quoting from <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>393 Mass. 20, 26 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1027 (1985) (Abrams, J., dissenting) (\u201ca separation agreement is a \u2018judicially sanctioned contract\u2019 that is valid and enforceable only if and as approved by the judge\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Here, however, the parties are receiving benefits pursuant to a DRO that is consistent with their written stipulations and is not unconscionable on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Our review of the motion judge\u2019s interpretation of the parties\u2019 agreement is de nova. See <em>Judge Rotenberg Educ. Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dept. of Mental Retardation (No. 1), </em>424 Mass. 430, 443 (1997). When construing the separation agreement and stipulated terms of the DRO, we adhere to the established principle that all parts \u201care to be construed together as constituting a single and consistent arrangement. The intent of the parties must be gathered from a fair construction of the contract as a whole and not by special emphasis upon any one part.\u201d <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Hawker, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 869, 873 (1981), quoting from <em>Crimmins &amp; Pierce Co. </em>v. <em>Kidder Peabody Acceptance Corp., </em>282 Mass. 367, 375 (1933). See <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>Monarch Life Ins. Co., </em>345 Mass. 261, 264 (1962); <em>G.M. Abodeely Ins. Agency </em>v. <em>Commerce Ins. Co., </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 274, 277 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">We first note that a DRO may only award benefits consistent with, and limited to, those authorized by statute. <em>Early </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Retirement, </em>420 Mass. 836, 839, 841 (1995) (retirement system is a \u201ccontributory defined benefit system,\u201d and \u201cif an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>employee maintains employment until becoming eligible to collect retirement benefits, the amount of benefits is not tied to the dollar value of his account, but rather is dependent on a number of variables not determinable until the date of eligibility, see G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 5-7 [1994 ed.], as well as the options he elects on retirement, see G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 12\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There is no specific reference in the separation agreement to those variables that make up the eventual retirement benefit, but are not determinable until the date of eligibility, nor to the options that must be elected on retirement that also have an effect on the amount of the benefit. The relevant language in the separation agreement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">\u201cthe HUSBAND shall, upon the execution of this Separation Agreement, consent to a [DRO] by which 50% of his retirement benefits from the Hull Retirement System, accrued as of the date of this Separation Agreement, shall be allocated to the WIFE. It is the intention of the parties that the administrator for the Hull Retirement System shall allocate said retirement benefits to the WIFE, but that said retirement benefits shall not be paid to the WIFE until the HUSBAND retires.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Nothing in the foregoing provision specifically addresses the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>meaning of the phrase \u201cretirement benefits . . . accrued as of the date of this Separation Agreement.\u201d It could, but does not necessarily, refer to all the variables that determine the amount of benefits upon retirement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The generalities of the provision were given form in the parties\u2019 proposed DRO that was adopted by the judge.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> With respect to the variables to be used in calculating Denise\u2019s fifty per cent interest, the parties\u2019 proposed DRO provided that the wife\u2019s benefit \u201cshall be equal to 50% of the Marital Portion of the [husband\u2019s] benefit commencing at the time of the [husband\u2019s] actual retirement. The Marital Portion . . . is . . . determined . . . using only [the husband\u2019s] credited service under the Retirement Plan through December 6, 1999.\u201d Two other variables \u2014 the husband\u2019s age as of the date of retirement and his highest consecutive three year average salary \u2014 were calculated as of the date of the husband\u2019s actual retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">We conclude that the DRO, as stipulated to by the parties, is not, on its face, inconsistent with the provisions of the parties\u2019 separation agreement; together, they form a congenial whole, with the DRO supplying specificity where required, as well as additional provisions omitted from the earlier agreement but necessary to a complete understanding of the parties\u2019 intentions regarding disposition of Robert\u2019s retirement benefits. No mistake is apparent from the face of these documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">To the extent that Robert\u2019s unhappiness with the DRO may be seen as a claim that it does not accurately reflect his understanding of the agreement, or that it is unfair, his claim comes too late. Cf. <em>O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Case, </em>258 Mass. 205, 208-209 (1927) (it is \u201cwell settled that, where a person capable of read<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>ing and understanding a written instrument fails to acquaint himself with its contents before affixing his signature thereto and such failure is due to his own negligence, his ignorance of the force and effect of the instrument is not available as a basis for equitable relief by way of cancellation. . . . The mistake to warrant cancellation must not result from a want of due care and diligence; and it must be material to the transaction and not an incident or inducement to it\u201d); <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>409 Mass. 727, 732-733 (1991) (in the absence of fraud, coercion, or \u201cshowing that no judge has yet even implicitly considered the fairness and reasonableness of the separation agreement[,]\u201d surviving provisions of the agreement \u201cshould at some time become free from question\u201d; and where the agreement was not challenged \u201cwithin a reasonable time after the entry of judgment [see Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 60(b)(6)], it [was] too late to claim that the agreement was not fair and reasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment dated June 3, 2004, is vacated. A new judgment shall enter stating that the domestic relations order dated May 17, 2000, shall remain in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-5\"> Because the benefits at issue involve those in a municipal retirement system, the assignment of interests is pursuant to a domestic relations order (DRO) and not, strictly speaking, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO), as it is referred to in the parties\u2019 separation agreement. See <em>Early </em>v. <em>Early, </em>413 Mass. 720, 722-723 n.3 (1992) (\u201cThe term QDRO derives from the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 . . . [, which] expressly does not apply to government pension plans. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1003[b][1] [1988]\u201d). That pension benefits of a State public employee may be the subject of a domestic relations order distributing marital property on divorce was established by <em>Contributory Retirement Bd. of Arlington </em>v. <em>Mangiacotti, </em>406 Mass. 184, 186 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b522-6\"> The form appears to have been based on a sample order issued by the Massachusetts Teachers\u2019 Retirement Board, which in turn was based upon the holding of the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Contributory Retirement Bd. of Arlington </em>v. <em>Mangiacotti, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b522-7\"> The DRO, as adopted by the judge, provides in relevant part in paragraph 5:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>\u201cThe Alternate Payee\u2019s Benefit shall be equal to 50% of the Marital Portion of the Participant\u2019s benefit commencing at the time of the Participant\u2019s actual retirement. The Marital Portion of the Participant\u2019s benefit is the benefit which the Participant would have received at his actual retirement date in the absence of this Order, determined using his highest consecutive three-year average salary at his actual retirement date and using the benefit percentage specified in the Retirement Plan for the age at which the Participant actually retires and commences receiving his benefit, but <em>using only his credited service under the Retirement Plan through December </em>6, <em>1999\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b523-9\"> General Laws c. 208, \u00a7 34, as amended through St. 1990, c. 467, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">\u201cUpon divorce or upon a complaint in an action brought at any time after a divorce,... the court[s] of the commonwealth . . . may . . .[,] [i]n addition to or in lieu of a judgment to pay alimony, . . . assign to either husband or wife all or any part of the estate of the other, including but not limited to, all vested and nonvested benefits, rights and funds accrued during the marriage and which shall include, but not be limited to, retirement benefits, military retirement benefits if qualified under and to the extent provided by federal law, pension, profit-sharing, annuity, deferred compensation and insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">As no separate complaint was filed, see Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 3 and 7, we construe the parties\u2019 joint motion as also seeking amendment of the judgment to incorporate the DRO. See <em>Contributory Retirement Bd. of Arlington </em>v. <em>Mangiacotti, supra </em>(authorizing assignment of public pension interest made pursuant to a marital separation agreement when \u201cassignment is supported by a parallel court order entered under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b524-7\"> Robert submitted a revised DRO, proposing changes to paragraph 5 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">\u201cThe Alternate Payee\u2019s Benefit shall be equal to 50% of the Marital Portion of the Participant\u2019s benefit commencing at the time of the Participant\u2019s actual retirement.

See <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>371 Mass. 439, 442-443 (1976). In <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>the former wife filed a motion to dismiss the former husband\u2019s action in Superior Court, in which he sought specific performance of their surviving separation agreement after the Probate Court had entered a modification judgment that increased alimony. <em>Id. </em>at 440-441. The wife claimed that the consequences of the separation agreement had been raised, argued, and decided against the husband in the Probate Court. <em>Id. </em>at 442-443. The Supreme Judicial Court, exercising its general powers of superintendence of the courts, stated that \u201cthe proper administration of justice calls for the transfer of this case to the Probate Court... for disposition. The wife\u2019s claim that the husband\u2019s rights are foreclosed by the earlier determination can be considered there.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Passing the question whether Robert properly raised the issue of mistake in the separation agreement, as a general matter, all claims relating to enforcement of the divorce judgment, including whether the separation agreement acts as a bar to its enforcement, are appropriately considered in the same action. See <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Remick, </em>371 Mass. 433, 438 (1976) (\u201cWe believe that all aspects of the dispute between the former spouses should be resolved in one proceeding. If one spouse seeks modification of a support order so as to depart from the terms of the separation agreement, the other spouse should raise the availability of the separation agreement as a potential bar in the same proceeding\u201d). See also <em>Krapf </em>v. <em>Krapf, </em>439 Mass. 97, 104-109 (2003). Compare <em>Binder </em>v. <em>Binder, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 751, 759 (1979) (limiting the reach of the foregoing language in <em>Knox </em>v. <em>Remick, supra, </em>to modifications seeking increased support that are \u201cin violation of a contractual commitment not to do so\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b526-8\"> We recognize that Robert cites to Mass.R.Civ.P. 60(a), 365 Mass. 828 (1974), and 60(b), 365 Mass. 828 (1974); however, because Robert is seeking to correct an error in a divorce judgment, we believe the governing rules to be Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 60(a) and 60(b), which are in any case identical to Mass. R.Civ.P. 60(a) and (b). See Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">Rule 60(a) of the Massachusetts Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-10\">\u201cClerical mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of the record and errors therein arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any time of its own initiative or on the motion of any party</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">Rule 60(b) of the Massachusetts Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-12\">\u201cOn motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party . . . from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake . . . ; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.

Thereafter, the former husband took steps to maximize his disability benefits, which had the effect of divesting his former wife of her interest in his military pension, and she filed a declaratory judgment action under G. L. c. 231 A. <em>Id. </em>at 100-101. The Supreme Judicial Court invoked basic contract principles to construe the term \u201cpension rights with the U.S. Army\u201d to mean that the plaintiff was entitled to \u201cthe totality of benefits due to the defendant on his retirement from the army.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b529-7\"> As <em>Early </em>v. <em>Early, </em>413 Mass. 720, 722 &amp; n.1 (1992), makes clear, the trial judge\u2019s domestic relations order in that case provided that a separate account be created by the Board of Retirement for the wife consisting of \u201c$61,944, amounting] to 31.6 per cent of the present value of the husband\u2019s pension,\u201d which was based on \u201cvaluation of the husband\u2019s pension ... by an expert with experience in the calculation of pension values.\u201d The wife\u2019s separate account was not tied to her former husband\u2019s retirement eligibility. <em>Early </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Retirement, </em>420 Mass. at 837. The board refused to implement the DRO, contending that the wife \u201cis a nonmember ineligible for an account in the system, but also because the dollar value of 31.56 per cent of the present value of [the husband\u2019s] pension benefits accrued until the date of the divorce decree cannot be calculated until [he] becomes eligible to begin receiving his pension benefits,\u201d and therefore the DRO \u201cmust be pursuant to an \u2018if and when received\u2019 order, because valuation of the [husband\u2019s] benefits is determinable only when he is himself eligible to begin receiving benefits\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 841. The order was vacated and the matter was remanded to the Probate Court. <em>Id. </em>at 842.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The question has not been raised, and we therefore do not address, whether the provisions in the DRO Robert now seeks to have the court adopt would be consistent with the requirements of the State\u2019s retirement system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b530-6\"> Whether Robert\u2019s highest consecutive three year average salary would be earned after the divorce, or whether he had already earned it by that date, could not be known until the date of his retirement; this is not a variable that accrues.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Robert also makes no claim that the reference to \u201caccrued benefits\u201d limits Denise to the individual contributions made by Robert to his annuity account as of December 6, 1999.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b530-8\"> The stipulated terms of the proposed DRO also included a number of important provisions not specifically provided for in the separation agreement, including election of option C, and the reduction in the amount of the wife\u2019s benefit by the husband\u2019s election of option B in the event of accidental disability retirement or the wife\u2019s remarriage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
