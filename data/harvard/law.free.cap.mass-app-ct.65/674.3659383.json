Benavides, </em>Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b708-12\">Trainor, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXvY\">In January and February, 1997, the defendant, John Melo, was tried and convicted of the crimes of home invasion, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, and armed assault in a dwelling house.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was sentenced to a term of ten years to ten years and one day on the home invasion conviction and to a concurrent term of four to six years on the armed assault in a dwelling house conviction. The defendant was also sentenced to five years probation for each of the three convictions of assault by means of a dangerous weapon, to be served concurrently on and after the completion of his State prison sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>In August, 2004, the defendant filed a motion in the Superior Court to correct the mittimus. He complained that the Department of Correction (DOC) had miscalculated the length of his sentence because it had failed to credit one day for each February 29 (\u201cleap year\u201d day) he had served to date.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s motion was allowed. Subsequent to the denial of its motion for reconsideration, the Commonwealth appealed from the judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"><em>The length of the sentence. </em>The defendant argues that the policy and practice of the DOC not to recognize and credit the additional day in a \u201cleap year\u201d is incorrect. He argues that a \u201cyear,\u201d as imposed by the sentence of ten years to ten years and one day, consists of 365 days each, not the 366 days contained in a leap year.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The Legislature, however, has defined a \u201cyear\u201d as a calendar year, not as a compilation of 365 days. General Laws c. 4, \u00a7 7, Nineteenth, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">\u201cIn construing statutes the following words shall have the meanings herein given, unless a contrary intention clearly appears:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">\u201c \u2018Month\u2019 shall mean a calendar month, except that, when used in a statute providing for punishment by imprisonment, one \u2018month\u2019 or a multiple thereof shall mean a period of thirty days or the corresponding multiple thereof; <em>a \u2018year\u2019, a calendar </em>year\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">The DOC is required to calculate sentences in accordance with G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Nineteenth. The Legislature has defined the term \u201cyear,\u201d and the DOC must apply the language of the statute in calculating judicially imposed sentences. Simply stated, the defendant was sentenced to a term of years, not to a term of days or months, and a calendar year is one year of the defendant\u2019s sentence regardless of the number of days which comprises any particular year.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\"><em>The propriety of the defendant\u2019s motion. </em>The Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>contends that a motion to correct the mittimus is not the appropriate procedure to challenge the DOC\u2019s calculation of a sentence. The Commonwealth argues that the defendant has made no claim concerning the correctness of the mittimus, nor does he dispute the calculation of the time he served awaiting trial. See G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 33A. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morasse, </em>446 Mass. 113, 115 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Rule 42 of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure, 378 Mass. 919 (1979), provides a procedure to correct clerical errors in court judgments or records of an otherwise legal sentence imposed by a judge: \u201cClerical mistakes in judgments, orders, or other parts of the record and errors therein arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any time of its own initiative or on the motion of any party. . . .\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Layne, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 3 (1987). The defendant, however, did not claim that any documents or records of the court were in error. Instead, he makes a substantive claim concerning the meaning of the word \u201cyear\u201d as used in the judge\u2019s imposition of sentence. See Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2466 (2d ed. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Rule 30(a) of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure, as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), would permit the defendant to seek relief from an illegal sentence. \u201cAn \u2018illegal sentence\u2019 is one that is in excess of the punishment prescribed by the relevant statutory provision or in some way contrary to the applicable statute.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Layne, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 17, 19 (1985). This rule provides no relief to a defendant whose sentence was legally imposed but the term of which had been miscalculated by the DOC. The defendant has never claimed that his sentence was illegally imposed. See Smith, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 2061. There is no other rule of criminal procedure that would be applicable to this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">A prisoner may, however, use either habeas corpus or declaratory judgment procedures to challenge the DOC\u2019s calculation of a sentence. The Supreme Judicial Court has held that \u201ca prisoner who could show an entitlement to immediate release could invoke a judge\u2019s discretionary power ... to issue a writ of habeas corpus. . . . [Wjhen a prisoner was not entitled to im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>mediate release and thus could not state a claim for a writ of habeas corpus, he could still avail himself of the declaratory judgment procedures set out in G. L. c. 231A to resolve a controversy which had arisen concerning the execution of his sentence.\u201d <em>Hennessy </em>v. <em>Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst., Framingham, </em>386 Mass. 848, 850-851 (1982). Since the defendant would not have been entitled to immediate release even if he had prevailed on his claim, he should have availed himself of the declaratory judgment procedure, where the judge would have made a declaration of the rights of the parties. See <em>Cordeiro </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 690, 690 n.2 (1994). He did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>It was error, both procedurally and subtantively, for the judge to allow the defendant\u2019s motion to correct the mittimus. Procedurally, the defendant should have sought a declaratory judgment to challenge the DOC\u2019s calculation of his sentence. Substantively, the defendant was sentenced to a term of years, not to a term of days. The motion should not have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">\n<em>Order allowing motion to correct mittimus reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-13\"> This court affirmed the defendant\u2019s convictions in December, 1998. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Luna, </em>46 Mass.
