Hurd and codefendant Lesley St. Pierre were convicted of the drug offenses set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his appeal, St. Pierre raises only one claim of error, which is also claimed by Hurd,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> namely, that they were denied due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>process because the judge\u2019s instructions on reasonable doubt impermissibly lowered the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof. We reject the claim and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">1. The jury were instructed as to reasonable doubt as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-5\">\u201cNow, what is proof beyond a reasonable doubt? On one hand it is not enough for the Commonwealth to establish a probability!,] even a strong probability, that a defendant may be guilty. More likely guilty than not guilty. On the other hand, proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond all possible doubt. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you firmly convinced of the defendant\u2019s guilt. There are very few things in this world that we know with absolute certainty. And in criminal cases the law does not require proof that overcomes ever[y] possible doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-6\">\u201cIf based on your consideration of the evidence you think there is a real possibility that the defendants are not guilty of one of the counts or all of the counts or any of the counts then you must give that defendant the benefit of the doubt and find him not guilty. If however you are firmly convinced of that defendant\u2019s guilt, of the crime charged in this case, you must find that defendant guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-7\">\u201cA charge is proved beyond a reasonable doubt if after you have considered and compared all of the evidence you have in your minds an abiding conviction to a moral certainty that the charge that you are considering is true.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">The foregoing definition of reasonable doubt is almost verbatim that recommended in the Federal Judicial Center\u2019s Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions, Instruction 21 (1988), with an addition of a paragraph containing some of the <em>Webster </em>language. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 320 (1850). Instruction 21 is reproduced in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">The defendants\u2019 specific objections are (1) the phrase \u201c[p]roof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you firmly convinced of the defendant\u2019s guilt\u201d understates the degree of certainty required for a criminal conviction; and (2) the phrase \u201creal possibility that the defendants are not guilty\u201d puts the burden of proof on the defendants and establishes too high a threshold of doubt as to the defendants\u2019 guilt. While recognizing that the last paragraph of the judge\u2019s instruction contains a portion of the <em>Webster </em>charge,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> they claim the charge as given eliminates important language that emphasizes the high degree of certitude required and substitutes other language that establishes a lower threshold for conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The difficulty with the defendants\u2019 argument is that the decision in <em>Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>511 U.S. 1 (1994), supports the pattern charge and thus refutes the defendants\u2019 due process claims. The majority does so implicitly, <em>id. </em>at 16-17, and Justice Ginsburg in her concurrence, <em>id. </em>at 27 (Ginsburg, J., concurring), does so explicitly.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">In <em>Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska, supra, </em>the defendants challenged the use of the phrase \u201cmoral certainty\u201d that was contained in the instructions to their respective juries. <em>Id. </em>at 10, 21. After tracing the historical meaning of the phrase, and noting that it had changed since it was used in the <em>Webster </em>instruction, the United States Supreme Court explained that the problem is that \u201ca jury might understand the phrase to mean something less than the very high level of probability required by the Constitution in criminal cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. Although the Supreme Court upheld both convictions, it stated that \u201cwe do not condone the use of the phrase. . . . Indeed, the definitions of reasonable doubt most widely used in the [Federal] courts do not contain any reference to moral certainty. See Federal Judicial Center, Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions 28 (1988); 1 E. Devitt &amp; C. Black-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>mar, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions \u00a7 11.14 (3d ed. 1977).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16-17. The reference to 28 is a reference to page 28 where Instruction 21 appears. See note 4, supra, setting out the text of Instruction 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">It is thus obvious that Instruction 21 on reasonable doubt (which does not contain the <em>Webster </em>language) complies with due process. Indeed, that instruction, which was the basis for the charge in the present case, was described by Justice Ginsburg in her concurring opinion, see <em>Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska, supra </em>at 26 (Ginsburg, J., concurring), as \u201cclear, straightforward, and accurate.\u201d After setting forth the text of Instruction 21, she added, <em>id. </em>at 27:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-5\">\u201cThis instruction plainly informs the jurors that the prosecution must prove its case by more than a mere preponderance of the evidence, yet not necessarily to an absolute certainty. The \u2018firmly convinced\u2019 standard for conviction, repeated for emphasis, is further enhanced by the juxtaposed prescription that the jury must acquit if there is a \u2018real possibility\u2019 that the defendant is innocent. This model instruction surpasses others I have seen in stating the reasonable doubt standard succinctly and comprehensibly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">In her concurrence, Justice Ginsburg, by expressly commending the language challenged here by the defendants, clearly rejected the two points raised by them. In view of her strong support of the language of Instruction 21, and the reference by the majority opinion to it as one of the \u201cmost widely used in the [Federal] courts,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 16, the defendants\u2019 complaint that the instruction (almost verbatim to that of Instruction 21) violated their Federal due process rights is plainly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">2. Moreover, the <em>Victor </em>Court also specifically held that an instruction similar to the last paragraph of the reasonable doubt charge given here passes muster as a sufficient instruction on reasonable doubt. In upholding the conviction in defendant Sandoval\u2019s case (one of the two cases before it), the Supreme Court noted that while the term \u201cmoral certainty\u201d in the abstract is ambiguous, the trial judge had lent \u201ccontent to the phrase\u201d by also telling the jury that they must have \u201can abiding conviction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>to a moral certainty, of the truth of the charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. The Supreme Court reasoned: \u201cAn instruction cast in terms of an abiding conviction as to guilt, without reference to moral certainty, correctly states the government\u2019s burden of proof. . . . [T]he reference to moral certainty, in conjunction with the abiding conviction language, \u2018impress [ed] upon the factfinder the need to reach a subjective state of near certitude of the guilt of the accused.\u2019 <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. [307, 315 (1979)].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14-15.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Thus, quite apart from the approval of the language of Instruction 21, the last paragraph of the reasonable doubt charge in the present case, which is almost identical to the language approved of in Sandoval\u2019s case, withstands any due process attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">3. In <em>Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska, supra, </em>the Supreme Court noted that despite its view of the term \u201cmoral certainty,\u201d the Court has no supervisory power over the State courts. It acknowledged that the phrase \u201cmoral certainty,\u201d when adequately explained and not used alone, does not render an instruction unconstitutional. <em>Id. </em>at 16-17. Our courts have continued to favor the <em>Webster </em>instruction despite the term \u201cmoral certainty,\u201d and have held that \u201c[u]nless the judge uses those words in isolation,\u201d there is no problem with the use of the term \u201cas part of or in conjunction with the approved charge from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Webster.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beldotti, </em>409 Mass. 553, 562 (1991). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pinckney, </em>419 Mass. 341, 344-345 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrien, </em>428 Mass. 607, 610-611 (1998), another case in which the defendant claimed that the language \u201cmoral certainty\u201d failed to state the high degree of certainty required, the court discussed the language that lent content and meaning to the phrase in <em>Victor, </em>and also pointed to two Massachusetts cases where insufficient content had been given. The court noted: \u201cwe stressed that \u2018moral certainty\u2019 language must be explained adequately.\u201d That sentence was followed by a footnote that quoted the text of Instruction 21, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>instruction referred to by the majority in <em>Victor </em>and commended by Justice Ginsburg in her concurrence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrien, </em>428 Mass. at 611 &amp; n.5. By citing Instruction 21, the Supreme Judicial Court intended, we believe, to give an approved example of an adequate explanation of the \u201cmoral certainty\u201d language.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">In sum, the instructions given in this case did not violate the defendants\u2019 due process rights and were consistent with Massachusetts law.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b822-17\"> St. Pierre and Hurd were convicted of distribution of \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A), and distribution in a school zone (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J). Hurd also was convicted of possession with intent to distribute a class B substance, crack cocaine (G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A), and committing a drug violation in a school zone (G.
