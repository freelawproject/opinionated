The rule provides that summary proceedings (e.g., dispensing with formal charges and an evidentiary hearing) may be utilized only if the instant adjudication is necessary to maintain order in the courtroom, and (1) the contemptuous conduct occurred in the presence of a judge or the court; (2) contempt proceedings take place without delay; and (3) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>punishment imposed does not exceed three months imprisonment or a fine of $500. The Supreme Judicial Court has additionally required that unless the conduct is \u201cflagrant,\u201d a prior warning is required as a prerequisite to treating the alleged contempt summarily. <em>Sussman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>374 Mass. 692, 697 (1978). The absence of any one of these distinct factors renders summary proceedings unavailable, triggering the more extensive requirements described in Mass.R.Crim.P. 44, 378 Mass. 920 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Our decisions, viewed as a whole, narrowly interpret rule 43. They suggest that summary contempt should only be used when the offending \u201cbehavior constitutes a threat that immediately imperils the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corsetti, </em>387 Mass. 1, 8 (1982). See <em>id. </em>at 7, quoting from <em>Sachen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>343 U.S. 1, 8 (1952) (observing that \u201c[sjummary punishment always, and rightly, is regarded with disfavor\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 206, 208 (1996) (\u201cexercise of the summary contempt power ... by long tradition is conceived narrowly and used with great restraint\u201d). Moreover, rule 43 allows summary punishment of criminal contempt only when \u201csummary punishment is necessary to maintain or restore order in the courtroom.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Segal, </em>401 Mass. 95, 99 (1987), quoting from Mass.R.Crim.P. 43(a). Other remedial options have been suggested. For example, where conduct is \u201cnot so disruptive as to warrant a summary contempt punishment but nevertheless interfere[s] with the efficient administration of justice, an assessment of costs may be an effective judicial option in maintaining procedural control of a court room.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 109, 112 (1999) (reversing a criminal contempt judgment for an attorney\u2019s disappearance from a courtroom).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Against this backdrop, we sketch the undisputed episode that gave rise to a Superior Court judge\u2019s summary punishment of the defendant. On March 22, 2004, having been previously charged with assault by means of a dangerous weapon, larceny in a building, possession of burglarious tools, breaking and entering a building in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony, and receiving a stolen motor vehicle, the defendant ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>peared in the Superior Court at Worcester for a bail hearing. As the hearing began, trial counsel told the judge that the defendant\u2019s bail, which had been set without prejudice at his arraignment in District Court, was $25,000. He outlined that the defendant, unable to raise that amount of money, had been held \u201cdown in Bridgewater,\u201d mating it impossible for him to receive visits from family members. Trial counsel\u2019s familiar plea was that the defendant had had \u201ca problem with drugs in his past\u201d but had cleaned up his act during pretrial detention and wished to be released on $1,000 cash bail with conditions, including house arrest. Trial counsel identified the defendant\u2019s mother, who was present in the courtroom, and assured the judge that if he were to reduce the defendant\u2019s bail, she and her husband would keep the defendant under house arrest and that should he step out of line in any way, they would immediately report him to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">There followed a brief description by trial counsel of the defendant\u2019s involvement in the underlying case. He was a passenger in a truck that was stopped by the police on suspicion of its use as a get-away vehicle right after a break-in at a gasoline station. For his part, the prosecutor saw it differently. What accounted for the high bail was a lengthy and hazardous flight from police in the truck, which damaged several civilian vehicles along the way. In addition, a tool box was thrown from the passenger\u2019s side window of the truck at one of the pursuing officers, and there was the matter of the defendant\u2019s prior record, which included a 1993 armed robbery that had resulted in the defendant\u2019s imprisonment for six months. According to the prosecutor, that sanction failed to deter the defendant from committing the offenses in question. He cautioned that should the defendant be convicted, he would face significant jail time.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">There followed a brief colloquy among the judge, prosecutor, and trial counsel concerning the possible trial date, at the conclusion of which the judge simply stated, \u201cThe petition is denied.\u201d Then came the defendant\u2019s offending remarks, \u201cFuck you, judge; fuck you.\u201d The judge directed the court officers to \u201c[tjake him out please,\u201d at which point the defendant said, \u201cYou know what, judge? You can suck my fuckin\u2019 dick.\u201d That brought an apology from trial counsel. Although not entirely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>clear from the record, it appears that the defendant was taken to a holding cell adjacent to the courtroom. The discussion between trial counsel and the judge continued. The judge said, \u201cI\u2019m going to impose a sixty-day sentence, contempt of court, on and after any time served . . . and that\u2019s for his conduct here in court today.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Obviously perturbed by the incident, the judge made an oral finding that the defendant\u2019s conduct was \u201coutrageous, disgraceful and it deserves some consequences,\u201d and he increased his bail to $50,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">1. <em>Standard of review. </em>We review the record to determine whether it supports the judge\u2019s summary contempt finding. Our cases have not explicitly set forth a standard of review. Other courts, however, have dealt with the issue. \u201c \u2018[A] court exercises considerable discretion in dealing with contemptuous conduct occurring in its presence, and its summary adjudication is accorded a presumption of finality,\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Melechinsky, </em>36 Conn. Supp. 547, 549 (1980). \u2018From necessity the court must be its own judge of contempts committed within its presence.\u2019 <em>Goodhart </em>v. <em>State, </em>84 Conn. 60, 62-63 (1911).\u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>221 Conn. 498, 504, cert. denied, 506 U.S. 875 (1992). Although appellate review of a summary contempt finding is limited, the reviewing court must conduct a careful examination of the record to determine whether the finding of contempt can be sustained as matter of law. See, e.g., <em>Codispoti </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>418 U.S. 506, 517 &amp; n.6 (1974) (noting that summary convictions \u201cunwarranted\u201d by facts are subject to appellate review and that, if constitutional rights are affected, the court is \u201cduty bound to make an independent examination of the evidence in the record\u201d). \u201cCriminal contempt is a crime in the ordinary sense,\u201d and \u201cconvictions for criminal contempt are indistinguishable from ordinary criminal convictions.\u201d <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 194, 201 (1968). Therefore, the record or the trial judge\u2019s findings regarding the contemnor\u2019s language, gestures, or other body language must support the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>determination that the contemnor\u2019s conduct was contemptuous beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>186 Conn. 256, 258-259 (1982) (explaining that, while criminal contempt proceedings should conform as closely as possible to criminal proceedings, especially regarding the presumption of innocence and the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, they need not exactly adhere to criminal proceeding and can be summary in nature).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Accordingly, in reviewing the defendant\u2019s claim that the judgment of summary contempt should be reversed on the ground that it is not supportable as matter of law, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Segel, </em>401 Mass. at 98, it is not our function to second guess the considered judgment of the trial judge or to ignore the record before us. Rather, we will sustain the judge\u2019s contempt finding if, upon a careful review of the record, we conclude that the trial judge reasonably could have found that the plaintiff\u2019s conduct was wilfully contumacious beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">2. <em>Analysis. </em>We may dispose of the defendant\u2019s threshold argument without much elaboration. A warning is not a condition precedent to criminal contempt in all cases. See <em>Sussman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>374 Mass. at 697 (noting that \u201cflagrant contemptuous conduct\u201d could justify the exercise of the summary contempt power without a warning). We can conceive of a wide panoply of acts that would constitute contempt of court without the necessity of a prior warning. Such acts include a \u201cparty or witness or bystander who[, as here,] behaves boisterously or offensively in open court against the dignity of the court.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Viera, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 209. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Malley, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 804, 811 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Nothing in the judge\u2019s sparse findings or in the record indicates that, as a result of the defendant\u2019s verbal outburst, summary punishment was necessary to maintain or restore order in the courtroom. The real concern, however, is that the defendant\u2019s opprobrious epithets were directed toward the judge himself, who did nothing but announce his decision on the defendant\u2019s bail petition. We agree with the Commonwealth that this factor distinguishes the case from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Diamond, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 103, 105 (1999), where we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>reversed a contempt finding against the attorney even though his statements were \u201ccrude, unprofessional, and vulgar.\u201d In that case, Diamond leaned toward opposing counsel and, in the presence of the judge, told opposing counsel that he would \u201cget discovery up the ass.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104. Diamond argued, and we agreed, that those words posed no threat to the orderly administration of justice. <em>Id. </em>at 105-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">We conclude here that the defendant\u2019s conduct, although not immediately interfering with the business of the court, was sufficiently flagrant so as to undermine the authority of the court to constitute contempt. The defendant, in the most salacious terms, twice indicated his displeasure with the judge\u2019s ruling and with the judge himself. Under the circumstances, the judge reasonably concluded that the defendant\u2019s words constituted a wilful violation of rule 43. Neither the transcript of the proceedings nor the judge\u2019s verbal findings indicate how many persons were in the courtroom at the time of the defendant\u2019s offensive behavior. Consequently, it is not possible for us to determine the extent to which the judge may have believed that prompt action was necessary to convey to others present that a similar affront to the court\u2019s authority would not be tolerated. However, we may infer from the fact that the judge was presiding over a busy first criminal session that other defendants and their attorneys were privy to the defendant\u2019s ill-advised outburst.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">In the rough and tumble of criminal court proceedings, we are not unaware of the frailties of human nature or of the emotional strain on the participants, especially of the accused. Judges must exercise restraint in using summary contempt only in cases where it is necessary to preserve the dignity and order of the court. See <em>In re Little, </em>404 U.S. 553, 555 (1972), quoting from <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em>356 U.S. 148, 153 (1958) (\u201cTrial courts . . . must be on guard against confusing offenses to their sensibilities with obstruction to the administration of justice\u201d). However, in this case, the defendant\u2019s reaction to the judge\u2019s ruling was highly inflammatory and outrageous. It is still the rule that \u201c[cjontempt may . . . consist of an objectionable manner, speech, attitude, conduct, and tone of voice in the court room.\u201d <em>Albano </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>315 Mass. 531, 535 (1944). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Malley, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. at 811-812 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>(judgment of contempt affirmed where defendant had repeatedly interrupted the judge in attempting to get new counsel and the jury venire had to be dismissed, which was a clear interruption of the proceedings and a threat that \u201cimmediately imperilled] the administration of justice\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wiencis, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 688 (2000) (judgment of summary contempt upheld where defendant had berated a witness and the jury and had told the jury that one of the witnesses would smash their cars and stalk them); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Green, </em>176 F.2d 169, 172 (2d Cir. 1949) (judgment of contempt affirmed when defendant had made unsolicited remarks as a witness and snide remarks toward the bench because such behavior, if allowed to continue unchecked, would cause a disruption of court proceedings and flout the court\u2019s authority). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Contach, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 247 (1999) (judgment of contempt reversed where defendant made an obscene gesture toward a former boyfriend that was not directed to the judge, and where there was no real disruption of court proceedings). Here, the defendant\u2019s words were so offensive to the dignity and authority of the court as to be contemptuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b460-6\"> While no rule was cited by the judge, we construe this record as indicating that he generally adhered to rule 43. There is no contention that Mass.R.
