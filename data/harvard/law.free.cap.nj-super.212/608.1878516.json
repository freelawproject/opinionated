The trial judge sentenced defendant to life imprisonment on the murder conviction. In addition, defendant was sentenced to a custodial term of five years on the hindering prosecution offense and 18 months on the false swearing conviction. All sentences are to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">Defendant advances numerous arguments on appeal. Her principal contentions, however, are that the trial judge erred: (1) by admitting into evidence a letter written by the victim prior to his death in which he recounted his belief that defendant would attempt to harm him and (2) by permitting the State to introduce expert testimony relating to morphological footprint comparisons. We find that the decedent\u2019s letter was improperly admitted and that this error taints defendant\u2019s convictions for murder and hindering the prosecution of another. We are constrained to reverse those convictions and remand for a new trial. Since the judge\u2019s error had no impact on the false swearing count, we affirm that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">We need not recite the facts at length. Defendant and Diane Downey were charged with murdering the latter\u2019s husband. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>The same indictment charged defendant individually with hindering the prosecution, of Downey and false swearing. The charges against defendant and Downey were severed for the purpose of trial. Downey was tried first and was convicted of murder. Although defendant was tried separately, much of the evidence presented in the Downey trial was also introduced against her. We thus refer to our opinion in <em>State v. Downey, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>382 (App.Div.1986) for a full recitation of the circumstances surrounding the homicide and its aftermath.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The State\u2019s theory at both trials was that defendant and Downey were engaged in a long-standing lesbian relationship and that they murdered the victim to prevent him from interfering. In support of this theory, the State presented evidence that Downey had moved into defendant\u2019s residence and that the two shared the same bedroom. Defendant\u2019s husband, Raymond Prudden, did not object to this arrangement, because he was having an affair with Downey\u2019s sister. The State introduced into evidence a note written by Downey professing her love for defendant. The police discovered an unmailed Christmas card in defendant\u2019s automobile in which Downey, in vulgar terms, noted her contempt for the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The State presented additional evidence disclosing the victim\u2019s fear of the Pruddens and Downey. Specifically, the decedent suspected that the three were plotting against him.. Over defense counsel\u2019s vigorous objections, the trial judge admitted into evidence an undated handwritten letter signed by the victim. Because of the importance of the letter, we quote it verbatim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">To Anyone, if anything happens to me or my kids you can go get, number one, Diane Downey, number two, Linda Prudden, number three, Ray Prudden. They are at 218 Hardy Avenue, Bound Brook, New Jersey, 356-8574. They would be the cause of it. Robert R. Downey. P.S. In the event of this letter opened I want my kids to have everything I have.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">Defendant ultimately received the letter and turned it over to the police after her arrest. During the trial, the prosecutor read the note to the jury. Immediately thereafter, the trial judge offered a limiting instruction in which he apprised the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>jury that the note could not be considered as \u201cproof of the truth of its contents,\u201d but only to establish the decedent\u2019s state of mind prior to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">We first address defendant\u2019s contention that the trial judge committed reversible error by admitting into evidence the victim\u2019s note. We considered the admissibility of this evidence in <em>State v. Downey, supra. </em>There, we held that the letter constituted inadmissible hearsay and that its introduction substantially impaired Downey\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>Id. </em>at 394-395. In the course of our opinion, we considered whether the letter fell within the purview of the state of mind exception codified in <em>Evid.R. </em>63(12). We held that it did not. <em>Id. </em>at 390-394. We noted that \u201c[t]he necessary predicate to admission of such evidence is that: a) the statement reflects a mental or physical condition of the declarant which constitutes a genuine issue in the case or b) the statement is otherwise relevant to prove or explain the declarant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390. We found that neither evidentiary requisite was present. First, the victim\u2019s state of mind was not a relevant issue to be decided by the jury. \u201cThe important fact ... was the state of mind of the defendant, not that of the deceased.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391. Second, the letter was not relevant to prove or explain the victim\u2019s conduct. <em>Ibid. </em>In that regard, we pointed out that \u201c[b]y its very terms ... the rule is limited to statements offered to prove the declarant\u2019s conduct, not that of another person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391. We thus held that the trial judge erred when he admitted the letter and the corresponding testimony of the decedent\u2019s mother concerning its existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">We recognize that the facts here are slightly different. As we have mentioned, the trial judge in this case instructed the jury that the victim\u2019s note could not be considered as proof of the truth of its contents. According to the judge\u2019s instruction, the probative effect of the letter pertained solely to the jury\u2019s consideration of the decedent\u2019s state of mind. Also, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>unlike <em>State v. Downey, supra, </em>the prosecutor here did not allude to the victim\u2019s note in his summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Nevertheless, we are firmly convinced that our holding in <em>Downey </em>is fully applicable and compels a reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction. In our view, the decedent\u2019s letter was improperly admitted. We are entirely unpersuaded by the State\u2019s argument that the trial judge\u2019s limiting instructions obviated the potential for undue prejudice. Contrary to the State\u2019s contention, the judge\u2019s instructions cannot fairly be construed as limiting the jury\u2019s consideration of this evidence to marital discord between the Downeys and their embittered relationship. Even were we to accept the State\u2019s strained characterization of the judge\u2019s charge, we would be compelled to reverse. The probative value of the victim\u2019s letter was far outweighed by its inflammatory nature. <em>Evid. R. </em>4. <em>See State v. Royster, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>472, 484 (1971); <em>State v. Jordan, </em>197 <em>N.J.Super. </em>489, 504 (App.Div.1984); <em>State v. Blanton, </em>166 <em>N.J.Super. </em>62, 72 (App. Div.1979), certif. den. 81 <em>N.J. </em>265 (1979). There was no real dispute concerning the enmity between the Downeys. Defendant freely admitted that she and Downey had often argued with the victim. Against this factual backdrop, we are convinced that even had more precise limiting instructions been given, they would have been to no avail. The reverberating clang of the accusatory words contained in the letter \u201cwould drown all weaker sounds.\u201d <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>290 <em>U.S. </em>96, 104, 54 <em>S.Ct. </em>22, 25, 78 <em>L.Ed. </em>196, 202 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Nor was the error rendered harmless by the fact that the prosecutor did not refer to it in his summation. While it is true that the evidence against defendant was substantial, the compelling nature of the decedent\u2019s letter convinces us that a reversal is mandated. We cannot say with fair assurance that the jury was not substantially swayed by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">In view of our disposition, it is unnecessary for us to determine whether the opinion of the State\u2019s expert concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>morphological footprint comparisons was properly admitted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We merely add the following comments for future guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The factual context within which the issue is raised can be briefly summarized. During the trial, substantial evidence was presented concerning the condition of the crime scene when the police first arrived at the Downey residence. In the course of their investigation, the police discovered a bloody footprint on a piece of paper in the bedroom where the attack on the victim had apparently commenced. Further investigation revealed another bloody footprint in the bathroom. It is undisputed that the individual who left the footprint was wearing socks, but no shoes. Thus footprint identification by way of comparison of dermatological ridges was impossible. Nevertheless, the sock-prints were preserved and submitted to Dr. Claude Owen Lovejoy, an expert in biological anthropology.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">At trial, the State sought to present Dr. Lovejoy as a witness and have him offer an expert opinion with regard to his comparison of the sockprints. Pursuant to <em>Evid.R. </em>8, a hearing was conducted out of the presence of the jury and the following facts were adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Dr. Lovejoy was given samples of sockprints from 98 individuals. The doctor obtained other sockprints as well as those taken of Downey and defendant. The two prints taken from the victim\u2019s home were also submitted to Dr. Lovejoy. Utilizing photographic translucent overlays, Dr. Lovejoy determined that Downey could not have produced the sockprints, but there was a \u201chigh probability\u201d that they belonged to defendant. In reaching this conclusion, the doctor considered the dimensions of the footprints taken from the murder scene and noted that there was an unusually large \u201ccentral hiatus\u201d, there was no \u201ctoe bar,\u201d there was a \u201cdistinctly preserved anterior border of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>the metatarsal print,\u201d the four digits were evenly positioned, and there were \u201cconvex medial and lateral borders and possibly a high arch.\u201d According to Dr. Lovejoy, the physical characteristics common to defendant\u2019s footprint and those found at the scene of the murder disclosed a high probability that they were made by the same person.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In making these determinations, Dr. Lovejoy explained that every foot is anatomically unique in bone structure. He asserted that due to the rigidity of the foot skeleton and the relatively small amount of surrounding tissue, reliable morphological footprint comparisons can be made. The extent to which the print is distorted by socks depends upon the circumstances. According to Dr. Lovejoy, where, as here, the material surrounding the foot is apparently thin, valid comparisons are possible. Dr. Lovejoy noted that the outer garment generally distorts the positioning of the digits, but does not affect the rigid and less mobile characteristics of the foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The doctor admitted that morphological footprint comparison techniques are not as reliable as fingerprint and footprint identification by examination and comparison of dermatological ridges. Unlike the latter identification method, there is presently no formal classification system for morphological footprint comparison. Further, Dr. Lovejoy was unable to say whether morphological footprint comparison techniques have been accepted in the scientific community. He made no reference to any recognized statistical analysis of the physical characteristics of the population at large. Moreover, the sample employed by the witness in making his comparisons was not compiled in a manner designed to insure an appropriate reflection of the physical characteristics of the general population.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Based upon this evidence, the trial judge determined that Dr. Lovejoy was properly qualified and that he could express his opinion regarding his comparison of the sockprints. Defendant challenges that evidentiary decision on two bases. She first contends that Dr. Lovejoy was not qualified as an expert. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>next claims that the State failed to establish the reliability of the techniques employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">We are entirely satisfied that Dr. Lovejoy was properly qualified as an expert in the field of biological anthropology with a specialty in human locomotion. Our careful review of the record convinces us that the trial judge\u2019s conclusion in that regard was grounded upon substantial evidence. We perceive no valid basis to disturb his discretionary decision. <em>Rempfer v. Deerfield Packing Corp., </em>4 <em>N.J. </em>135, 141 (1950); <em>Spiegle v. Seaman, </em>160 <em>N.J.Super. </em>471, 478 (App.Div.1978); <em>State v. Griffin, </em>120 <em>N.J.Super. </em>13, 20 (App.Div.1972), certif. den. 62 <em>N.J. </em>73 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">We harbor no reservations concerning the witness\u2019 opinion that the footprints could not have been made by Downey. The State\u2019s evidence clearly established that the techniques employed by the witness were sufficiently reliable to permit an expert opinion excluding Downey on the basis of the prints taken at the scene as compared with the samples submitted. However, we question whether the State presented sufficient evidence relating to the scientific reliability of the techniques employed to enable Dr. Lovejoy to reach the conclusion that there was a \u201chigh probability\u201d the footprints left in the bedroom and bathroom were those of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Although courts and commentators have divided over the issue of the foundational requirements for the admission of expert testimony regarding novel scientific techniques, see Giannelli, \u201cThe Admissibility of Novel Scientific Evidence: <em>Frye v. United States, </em>a Half Century Later,\u201d 80 <em>Colum.L.Rev. </em>1197, 1249-1250 (1980), we have adopted the standard that the \u201cmode of analysis used ... must have a sufficient scientific basis to produce uniform and reasonably reliable results____\u201d <em>State v. Kelly, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>178, 210 (1984). <em>See also Romano v. Kimmelman, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>66, 80 (1984); <em>State v. Cavallo, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>508, 516 (1982); <em>State v. Hurd, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>525, 536 (1981). While this threshold test is generally satisfied by a demonstration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>that the technique has gained sufficient basis for general acceptance within the scientific community, <em>Romano v. Kimmelman, supra, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>at 80, recent decisions have suggested that this is not the only permissible means of establishing reliability. <em>State v. Cavallo, supra, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>at 521; <em>Windmere, Inc. v. International Ins. Co., </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>697, 709 (App. Div.1986). Authoritative scientific and legal writings as well as judicial opinions indicating that the expert\u2019s premises have gained general acceptance are other means commonly used to establish reliability. <em>State v. Kelly, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">With this in mind, we note that morphological footprint comparison and identification techniques are in their infancy. The admissibility of expert testimony regarding that subject presents a novel question in New Jersey. In a variety of contexts, the courts of other states have considered the issue and have upheld the admission of such evidence. <em>United States v. Ferri, </em>778 F.2d 985, 988-990 (3 Cir.1985), <em>cert. </em>den. \u2014 U.S.-, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2896, 90 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>983 (1986); <em>State v. Bullard, </em>312 <em>N.C. </em>129, 135-54, 322 S.E.2d 370, 374-384 (Sup.Ct. 1984); <em>State v. Maccia, </em>311 <em>N.C. </em>222, 225, 316 S.E.2d 241, 243 (Sup.Ct.1984). We observe that all of these decisions were rendered after defendant\u2019s trial. While we express no opinion respecting the merits of the question, we note that this is a rapidly developing field. Should the State seek to introduce such evidence at the retrial, we suggest that the more recent studies referred to in these opinions should be fully explored and an adequate record made. <em>Cf. State v. Cary, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>16 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">Defendant\u2019s remaining arguments are clearly without merit and do not require extended discussion. A.2:ll-3(e)(2). We are entirely satisfied that the color photographs and slides of the crime scene were properly admitted. <em>State v. Lamb, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>545, 551 (1976); <em>State v. Thompson, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>396, 420-421 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>(1971); <em>State v. Conklin, </em>54 <em>N.J. </em>540, 545 (1969). We are also convinced that Downey\u2019s letter in which she professed her love for defendant was admissible to show the close relationship between the two and their possible motive to kill the decedent. <em>In re Spiegelglass, </em>48 <em>N.J.Super. </em>265 (App.Div.1958), certif. den. 26 <em>N.J. </em>302 (1958). We further find that the knife and sheath found in defendant\u2019s home were properly received in evidence. <em>State v. Downey, supra, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 397. <em>See also State v. Holland, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>451, 457 (1971); <em>State v. Sinnott, </em>24 <em>N.J. </em>408, 415 (1957). We have carefully reviewed the record and conclude that defendant\u2019s statements were properly admitted. It is abundantly clear that she was free to leave the police station when they were made. We note in that regard that even after defendant was apprised of her constitutional rights she was permitted to leave the station and return to her home. In short, her statements were not the product of custodial interrogation. <em>State v. Marks, </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>514, 527-528 (App.Div.1985). We are satisfied that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in his summation did not exceed the bounds of fair comment. <em>State v. Farrell, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>99, 102 (1972). We reject defendant\u2019s contention that she was deprived of her Sixth Amendment right to counsel merely because her attorney decided not to exercise peremptory challenges with respect to jurors who had read general newspaper accounts of the Downey trial. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>674 (1984). Finally, the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence. <em>R. </em>.3:20-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">For the reasons stated previously, we are constrained to reverse defendant\u2019s conviction for murder. Defendant\u2019s conviction for hindering the prosecution of Downey is also tainted and must be reversed. That conviction was predicated upon the allegation that defendant provided Downey with transportation from the scene of the crime and \u201csuppressed] or concealed]\u201d the murder weapon. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-3 requires as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>an element that the actor \u201chave notice, as distinguished from personal knowledge, that a crime has been committed.\u201d <em>State v. Lynch, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>327, 338 (1979). Here, the decedent\u2019s letter bore directly upon the question of whether defendant actively participated in the crime and hence had notice of Downey\u2019s role in its commission. Since we have held that this evidence should not have been admitted, defendant\u2019s conviction for hindering the prosecution of Downey must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In contrast, we discern no justifiable basis to disturb defendant\u2019s conviction for false swearing. At trial, defendant conceded that she had given inconsistent statements under, oath. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:28-2 c. Thus her conviction for false swearing was in no sense affected by the erroneous admission of the decedent\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Accordingly, defendant\u2019s convictions for murder and hindering the prosecution of another are reversed. The matter is remanded for a retrial on counts one and two of the indictment. Defendant\u2019s conviction on count three for false swearing is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b629-9\">Morphological footprint comparison involves the analysis of the form and structure of the foot. We use the term here to distinguish this technique from the more common procedure of identification of prints by way of comparison of dermatological ridges.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
