The salient facts, concerning which there seems to be no dispute, appear in <em>Brown v. Davis, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>41 (Ch.Div.1984), a civil action in which Brown and her colleagues sought to enjoin her prosecution for trespass and instead received a judgment declaring that they \u201care not entitled to enter defendants\u2019 private property against ... [the] wishes [of the owner and Cherry Hill Women\u2019s Center] to engage in the described expressional activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49. Brown was convicted of criminal trespass in the municipal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>court, the conviction was iterated in the Law Division and now she appeals to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">At the outset we observe that while in <em>Brown v. Davis, supra, </em>plaintiff asserted her purported rights under both the United States Constitution and the New Jersey Constitution, <em>id. </em>at 45, before us she relies only on the New Jersey Constitution. The only issue presented here is framed thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">Where one or more tenants in a commercial office complex on private property, including a tenant performing abortions therein, agressively <em>[sic] </em>advertise for business, anti-abortion advocates have a right under the New Jersey Constitution to limited, controlled access to the property for the purposes of speaking to persons contemplating an abortion and giving them literature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The omission here of a First Amendment argument is of no particular moment for two reasons, both of which appear in <em>Brown v. Davis. </em>First, as Judge Lowengrub there points out, <em>id. </em>at 46, New Jersey has taken a more expansive view of freedom of speech under Article I, paragraphs 6 and 18 of the State Constitution, as is its prerogative. <em>Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins, </em>447 <em>US. </em>74, 81, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2035, 2040, 64 L.Ed.2d 741 (1980). Second, the conclusion of Judge Lowengrub that \u201cthe owner has not sufficiently dedicated the property to public use so as to entitle individuals to access for first amendment [to the United States Constitution] activity,\u201d 203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 46, is eminently sound in accordance with the federal law cited by him in that opinion. We believe that the same result is achieved under the State Constitution and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">The bellwether case of <em>State v. Schmid, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>535 (1980), app. dism. <em>sub nom. Princeton University v. Schmid, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>100, 102 <em>S. Ct. </em>867, 70 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 855 (1982) leads the way. This matter involved the distribution of political literature on the campus of Princeton University by a member of the United States Labor Party. Writing for the court, Justice Handler recognized, as we do here and as Judge Lowengrub did in <em>Brown v. Davis, </em>the necessity for a most difficult balancing of the constitutionally guaranteed right of expression and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>inherent rights associated with the private ownership of property. He noted that \u201cprivate property does not \u2018lose its private character merely because the public is generally invited to use it for designated purposes\u2019 [citation omitted].\u201d 84 <em>N.J. </em>at 561. As a result the court adopted a \u201csliding scale,\u201d finding guidance in the United States Supreme Court cases recognizing that \u201cthe more private property is devoted to public use, the more it must accommodate the rights which inhere in individual members of the general public who use that property.\u201d 84 <em>N.J. </em>at 562. This consideration inspired the promulgation of a \u201ctest to be applied to ascertain the parameters of the rights of speech and assembly upon privately owned property and the extent to which such property reasonably can be restricted to accommodate these rights.\u201d 84 <em>N.J. </em>at 563. The guidelines appear in a tripartite standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">(1) the nature, purposes, and primary use of such private property, generally, its \u201cnormal\u201d use, (2) the extent and nature of the public\u2019s invitation to use that property, and (3) the purpose of the expressional activity undertaken upon such property in relation to both the private and public use of the property. <em>[Ibid.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-7\"><em>See State v. Shack, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>297 (1971); <em>cf. Uston v. Resorts International Hotel, Inc., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>163 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">This court, although eschewing reliance on <em>Schmid </em>because the property in question was held not to be devoted to any public use, recently opined that the combination of five of the office buildings of the Meadowlands Corporate Center\u2014a development consisting of at least six office buildings, several warehouses, a motel, an automobile dealer, and an athletic club\u2014 were protected against \u201cunwanted expressional activity.\u201d <em>Bellemead Development Corp. v. Schneider, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>571, 575 (App.Div.1984), aff\u2019g 193 <em>N.J.Super. </em>85 (Ch.Div.1983), certif. den. 101 <em>N.J. </em>210 (1985). As may be said in the matter before us here, we said there, \u201cThe general public is not invited to use the property, nor does it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 576. We enjoined distribution of leaflets to office workers by a union organizer at building entrances adjacent to employee parking lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>The sliding scale test of <em>Schmid </em>was applied by Judge Selikoff in <em>Planned Parenthood of Monmouth v. Cannizzaro, </em>204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>531 (Ch.Div.1985). That case resembled ours but with some substantial differences. There plaintiff was the sole occupant and owner of the premises in question and received public grant funds. Judge Selikoff granted injunctive relief against antiabortion picketing.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Other jurisdictions have expressed a reluctance, to say the least, to favor antiabortion expression over recognized interests in private property. See, for example, <em>Ingram v. Problem Pregnancy of Worcester, Inc., </em>396 <em>Mass. </em>720, 488 N.E.2d 408 (Mass.Sup.Ct.1986), <em>Kugler v. Ryan, </em>682 <em>S.W.2d </em>47 (Mo.App.1984), <em>Hoffart v. State, </em>686 <em>S.W.2d </em>259 (Tex.App.1985), <em>State v. Horn, </em>126 <em>Wisc.2d </em>447, 377 <em>N.W.2d </em>176 (Ct.App.1985); <em>but cf. Parkmed Co. v. Pro-Life Counselling, Inc., </em>91 <em>A.D.</em>2d 551, 457 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>27 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">In the matter before us the Law Division judge was satisfied to adopt the \u201cprofound and very convincing\u201d opinion of Judge Lowengrub in <em>Brown v. Davis, supra. </em>It seems obvious that the trial judge intended as well to adopt the findings of fact which appear therein for he made no findings of his own. We are satisfied that the facts found by Judge Lowengrub and thus adopted here might reasonably have been reached on the record in the matter before us and so we will not disturb them. <em>Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474 (1974). It is clear to us from these that the premises in question are not devoted to a public use. The tenants and their invitees are there by specific invitation. Akin to that said in <em>Bellemead Development Corp., supra, </em>\u201cAlthough the office buildings are used by many employees, each is there by a specific invitation. The general public is not invited to use the property nor does it.\u201d 196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 576. As noted above, borrowing from <em>Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, </em>407 <em>U.S. </em>551, 569, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>2219, 2229, 33 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 131 (1972), our Supreme Court has reinforced the proposition that property does not lose its private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>character merely because the public is generally invited to use it for a designated purpose. And so here. This private owner has not \u201csufficiently devoted [his premises] to public uses\u201d that they are subject to expressional obligations. <em>State v. Schmid, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 549. Judge Lowengrub concluded and we agree, \u201cIn this case the owner has not sufficiently dedicated the property to public use so as to entitle individuals to access for first amendment activity.\u201d <em>Brown v. Davis, supra, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super, </em>at 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Accordingly, as we observed in <em>Bellemead Development Corp., </em>the accommodation test of <em>State v. Schmid </em>need not be considered because neither the owner nor his tenants have devoted the property to any public use as that term is used in the freedom of expression cases, federal and State. Nevertheless, we observe that analysis under <em>Schmid </em>would, in any event, be unavailing to defendant. With respect to the \u201cnormal use\u201d of the property, we note first what it is not. It is not the functional equivalent of a suburban shopping center nor a place to which a general consumer would go to shop for personal, household or general business merchandise. <em>Brown v. Davis, supra, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 47. Other than the parking lot and walkways, the complex has no common areas, no places that contemplate the congregation of people or the dissemination of literature. Rather, it is similar to the premises discussed in <em>Bellemead Development Corp., </em>reserved for professional offices, and retail outlets are expressly prohibited. Even the Cherry Hill Women\u2019s Center, which does solicit the public, limits its solicitation to a narrow segment of the population, <em>i.e., </em>those women who seek to utilize the Center\u2019s gynecological services.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The second of the <em>Schmid </em>factors, the extent and nature of the invitation to the public, also disfavors defendant as can be seen by contrast with the invitation in <em>Schmid. </em>There defendant was distributing literature on a university campus, an institution dedicated to the dissemination of ideas and historical<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>ly a place of colloquy and discourse, ofttimes contentious. Brown, on the other hand, sought to distribute her leaflets at an office complex resembling, as we have said, the premises in <em>Bellemead Development Corp. </em>This is private property bearing no resemblance to a public forum. The invitation of the Center \u201cis clearly for private and personal purposes.\u201d <em>Planned Parenthood of Monmouth, supra, </em>204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 540. Directed to prospective patients, the \u201cadvertisements and signs [of the Center] do not amount to a general invitation to the public at large to enter upon the premises.\u201d <em>Brown v. Davis, supra, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Defendant comes closest with the last third of the equation: the purpose of the expressional activity in relation to both the private and public use of the property. <em>Planned Parenthood of Monmouth, supra, </em>found that the third factor favored antiabortion protesters. 204 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 541. The trial court in <em>Bellemead Development Corp. </em>found an affinity. 193 <em>N.J.Super, </em>at 98. In the circumstances of this case, we are eminently satisfied with the disposition of this issue by Judge Lowengrub in the civil case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">With regard to the third factor of the <em>Schmid </em>test, the record is perfectly clear that the purpose of the expressional activity plaintiffs seek to engage in is incompatible with some of the services rendered by the Women\u2019s Center.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">Although defendants produced no evidence that any prospective user of the services offered by the Women\u2019s Center was offended, intimidated, or refused to receive medical services as a result of plaintiffs\u2019 conduct, there was credible testimony that females attired in white uniforms met some prospective patients of the Women\u2019s Center as they exited their cars and escorted them to the front door of the Women\u2019s Center. Surely that activity is not that which the provider of gynocological [sic] services normally supplies to patients. The escort service was intended to counter the effects of plaintiffs\u2019 expressional activity. Defendants do not object to the present conduct of plaintiffs as they make use of the State right-of-way. However, any expansion of the area where that activity may be engaged in would be incompatible with the right of the tenant Women\u2019s Center to receive and the owner to provide peaceable possession and quiet enjoyment of the leased premises. <em>See Reste Realty Corp. v. Cooper, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>444, 456 (1969). (203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 47-48.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">No one questions the fact of the intrusion. As noted at the outset, the sole issue concerns justification by constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>protection of the freedom of expression. As did both courts below and Judge Lowengrub in the civil action, we decide that issue against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
