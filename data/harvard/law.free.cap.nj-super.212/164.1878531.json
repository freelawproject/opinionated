(Zim) is an international shipper. Plaintiff Maher Terminals, Inc. (Maher) operates a marine terminal at which plaintiff Zim docks container ships and from which plaintiff Zim\u2019s cargo containers are dispatched to their ultimate commercial destinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">The Director of the Division of Taxation assessed a sales tax for Maher\u2019s charge for the repair and maintenance (R &amp; M) and parts provided to Zim\u2019s containers and chassis (the mobile unit under the containers). Plaintiff Maher was also assessed sales tax on the charges for its rental of cranes from Sea-Land Service, Inc. (Sea-Land) (not a party to this suit).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">Plaintiff Zim paid part of the tax and sought a refund which the Tax Court granted, except for the tax on the sale of parts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>for Zim\u2019s chassis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Maher\u2019s application for abatement of the tax on the crane rentals was denied by the Tax Court. Zim sought and was denied interest on its refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">With the one exception, all parties appealed and cross-appealed the adverse portions of the Tax Court decision which is reported at 6 <em>N.J.Tax </em>513 (Tax Ct.1984). Since the facts and legal issues are fully set forth in the Tax Court opinion there is no need for extensive repetition.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">While appeal in this matter was pending, the case of <em>Hapag-Lloyd A.G. v. Director, Div. of Tax. </em>was decided by Judge Lasser, P.J.T.C. and published at 7 <em>N.J.Tax </em>108 (Tax Ct.1984). That decision was in direct conflict with that of Judge Crabtree concerning the issue of the taxability of R &amp; M of \u201ccontainers\u201d carried on \u201ccontainer ships\u201d. On March 20, 1986, we affirmed Judge Lasser and overruled Judge Crabtree\u2019s determination which favored the taxpayer on that issue. <em>Hapag-Lloyd A.G. v. Director, Div. of Tax., </em>8 <em>N.J.Tax </em>323 (App.Div.1986). Therefore, we will not address that issue anew, namely that charges for container R &amp; M and the sale of parts to fix containers are not exempt from the Sales and Use Tax pursuant to the applicable pre-1980 statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-8.12, which exempted from tax \u201crepairs ... of ... commercial ships ... primarily engaged in interstate or foreign commerce, and ... property used by or purchased for the use of such vessels for ... maintenance and repairs....\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The interpretation question under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-8.12 revolved around whether the container represented such an integral part of a container ship that R &amp; M to containers was R &amp; M to the ship itself. We have held containers were separate units. This ruling, however, does not dispose of the issue of the taxability of the container R &amp; M charges in the case at bar. Plaintiffs Zim and Maher contend that if the fee for R &amp; M to the containers is not exempt from tax because the container is not part of the ship, then it is exempt under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-8.-11<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as a \u201ccharge for the transportation of ... property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">A review of the history provides little insight into the legislative intent behind the passage of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-1 <em>et seq. </em>or any of its exemptions. The Sales and Use Tax Act (L.1966, e. 30) was introduced as an alternative tax following legislative defeat of a State income tax. No public hearings were held and no statements accompanied the sales tax bill. The <em>Report of the New Jersey Tax Policy Committee, </em>Part V at 72 (1972) in its review of Sales and Use Tax Act exemptions recommended maintaining the transportation exemption section because of \u201c(1) the virtually insurmountable administrative problems of imposing such a tax and (2) the fact that such transportation is conducted on an interstate, as well as intrastate, basis.\u201d On this appeal the Division does not suggest that charges for Maher\u2019s stevedoring operation are taxable. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-8.-11. Thus, Maher\u2019s primary activity is tax-exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\"> We are satisfied, however, there is no evidence that by \u201ccharges for transportation\u201d the legislature meant \u201ccharges for R &amp; M of equipment used in transportation.\u201d Exemptions from taxibility for repair charges must be stated in clear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>unambiguous language. <em>Body Rite Repair Co. v. Director, Div. of Tax., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>540, 544 (1982). Moreover, charges for R &amp; M have consistently been taxed separately from the purpose for which the equipment is used, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-3(b)(2), even if that use is exempt. <em>Seaview Demolition v. Director, Div. of Tax., </em>4 <em>N.J.Tax </em>541 (Tax Ct.1982), aff'd 6 <em>N.J.Tax. </em>254 (App. Div.1983). Plaintiffs\u2019 claim of tax exemption for R &amp; M of containers on this basis has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Plaintiffs also sought exemption under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-8.11 for the charges for R &amp; M of chassis. We reject this claim for the same reasons as applied to containers.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">In the alternative, plaintiffs sought exemption for charges for R &amp; M of the chassis and containers, under <em>N.J. S.A. </em>54:32B\u20143(b)(2)(iii) which exempts from tax the receipts from every sale of \u201cservices rendered with respect to trucks, tractors, trailers or semi-trailers by a person who is not engaged, directly or indirectly ... in a regular trade or business offering such services to the public____\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">We first reject plaintiff\u2019s claim as to an exemption for containers under the section. It is not the container which is designed to be \u201cdrawn by a motor vehicle\u201d. The chassis, however, do fall within the definition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The chassis are carriers specially made to transport the containers and the issue concerned Maher\u2019s qualification. Judge Crabtree found that Maher was not engaged in the business of chassis R &amp; M but rather in the business of stevedoring. It was his conclusion that Maher provided chassis R &amp; M to Zim only as an ancillary service. Although the service was separately charged and invoiced, it was an accommodation intended primarily to keep the containers moving in and out of the terminal. Maher did not perform substantial repairs, nor were substantial repairs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>undertaken on Maher\u2019s premises. We are satisfied this factual finding is supported by the record and the judgment of the Tax Court should be affirmed on this issue for the reasons stated by Judge Crabtree, 6 <em>N.J.Tax </em>at 526-528.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">A separate issue was presented by Maher for abatement of tax on the charges for use of cranes between Maher and Sea-Land. Maher and Sea-Land are adjoining marine terminals. Both are engaged in the same business of transportation of goods to and from container shijis. Sea-Land, however, is a terminal only for Sea-Land container ships. Essential to the operation of both terminals is the use of enormous cranes which run on rails and lift the containers from one place to another. Under ordinary circumstances it was posited that each had sufficient cranes for the operation of its business. Occasions arose, however, when one of the two would need another crane. An agreement was entered into whereby each could use the other\u2019s cranes.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The agreement in question recited that Maher and Sea-Land had connected their crane rails, and that each had the right \u201cwhenever a crane is not being used by its owner or undergoing non-deferrable maintenance\u201d to have the other\u2019s crane available. Specific personnel of each party was to have the authority to grant a request for the crane of the other, and \u201c[rjedelivery to owner shall be made as soon as practicable but not later than one hour prior to commencement of period to be worked.\u201d Provisions were made for insurance. Separately, the parties agreed that, to the extent that the use of each other\u2019s cranes was not mutual, there would be an hourly charge, and that the discrepancy would be adjusted each quarter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>All parties agree that the rental or exchange of equipment for consideration is taxable and \u201csale\u201d includes \u201crental\u201d or \u201cexchange\u201d for taxation purposes. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-2(f). Maher contends, however, that its use of Sea-Land\u2019s cranes on this intermittent basis represented an exempted \u201ccasual sale.\u201d <em>N.J. S.A. </em>54:32B-8.6. A \u201ccasual sale\u201d is defined as an \u201cisolated or occasional sale of an item ... by a person who is not regularly engaged in the business of making sales at retail where such property was obtained by the person making the sale through purchase or otherwise, for his own use in this State.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-2(u).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Legislative history does not offer any specific reference to the meaning of this exemption, and we can find no case law interpreting its meaning when applied to rental or exchange. The Commission on State Tax Policy, <em>The 12th Report </em>at 25 (1968) acknowledges that the exemption for occasional sales exists for administrative convenience. It is an exemption of \u201ctrivial\u201d transactions. <em>Id. </em>at xiii. The <em>Report of the New Jersey Tax Policy Committee, </em>Part V at 72 concludes that the \u201cbasic intent of this exemption is practical and realistic from an administrative point of view.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In our efforts to discern legislative intent, however, we note that the exchange of motor vehicles between truckers in which neither is in the business of truck rental and in which the exchange is with persons engaged in carrying freight would not be taxable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>In 1976, Maher used Sea-Land cranes for 288.5 hours, during January through July, and after that only during September and December. In 1977, Maher had no need for a Sea-Land crane until April, and then used them each month on some occasion until September. Again, from August 1977, the total use was twice in September and twice in December. The total number of hours for 1977 was 187. In 1978, the hours were down to 183, twice in March, none in April, three occasions in July (twice with two cranes). During that year, however, Maher needed a Sea-Land crane each month from July through December.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">In concluding that the use of Sea-Land\u2019s crane by Maher was not \u201ccasual,\u201d Judge Crabtree stated that dictionary definitions did not help.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">Suffice to say that Maher\u2019s use of Sea-Land\u2019s crane upon 50 occasions over a three-year span, about one every three weeks, is neither isolated nor occasional. The transactions occurred with regularity as part of a pattern or practice and in accordance with the terms of a written agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Cases interpreting similar statutes generally take two separate approaches. <em>See </em>68 <em>Am.Jur.2d, Sales &amp; Use Taxes, </em>sec. 123 (1981). The first may be termed a definitional approach. The second relates the meaning of \u201ccasual\u201d or \u201cisolated\u201d to the entire intent of the applicable sales tax statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The following are examples of a court\u2019s redefinition of \u201ccasual.\u201d Casual is \u201csomething relatively brief and passing.\u201d <em>Graham, v. Green, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>207, 211 (1959).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cCasual is a happening without design and without being expected; coming without regularity; occasional ... [i]t carries the idea of lack of continuity.\u201d <em>Trico Electric Cooperative Inc. v. State Tax Com., </em>79 <em>Ariz. </em>293, 296, 288 <em>P.</em>2d 782, 784 (Sup.Ct.1955). If, however, the characteristic of systematic recurrence and continuity develops, the sale no longer remains casual. <em>Cf. L.A. Young Sons Const. Co. v. State Tax Com., </em>23 <em>Utah </em>2d 84, 457 <em>P.</em>2d 973 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>(Sup.Ct.1969). A casual sale is a nonrecurring sale. Two separate selling events over a twelve month period is nonrecurring. Three separate selling events is recurring and thus taxable. <em>In re Hubs Repair Shop Inc., </em>28 <em>B.R. </em>858 (Bankr.N. D.Iowa 1983). \u201c[RJegular suggests continuity and consistency of occurrence and excludes the idea of incidental or casual sales to the public.\u201d <em>Colorado College v. Heckers, </em>33 <em>Colo.App. </em>219, 517 P.2d 419, 421 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In those cases which concentrate on the total meaning of the statute, it is generally held that a transfer out of the course of business should be considered exempt. <em>Gemma Prop. Etc. v. City of Tuscon, </em>130 <em>Ariz. </em>369, 636 P.2d 147 (Ct.App.1981). The number of transactions is not necessarily controlling. \u201cThe real question is whether the sale or lease is in line with the business for which the seller or lessor was organized and in which it engages.\u201d <em>Besser Company v. Bureau of Revenue, </em>74 <em>N.M. </em>377, 383, 394 <em>P.</em>2d 141, 146 (Sup.Ct.1964). The exemption of casual sales upon closer inspection is not an exemption but rather a \u201cdirect definitional limitation\u201d upon the term retail sales. <em>In re Oilfield Instruments, </em>53 <em>B.R. </em>199, 203 (Bankr.W.D.La.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\"><em>See also Staley v. Missouri Director of Revenue, </em>623 <em>S.W.2d </em>246 (Mo.Sup.Ct.1981) (No banc) (liquidation sale of fixtures). <em>Big Three Industries, Inc. v. Keystone Industries, Inc. </em>472 <em>S. W.2d </em>850 (Tex.Civ.App.Div.1971) (one sale of an airplane used for corporate purposes). <em>See Green v. Pederson, </em>99 So.2d 292 (Fla.Sup.Ct.1957) (where zoo\u2019s policy was to trade animals, sale of surplus animals not taxable (emphasis added)). As to occasional rental, <em>see Richard Bertram &amp; Co. v. Green, </em>132 <em>So.</em>2d 24 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1961) (broker\u2019s charge to owner for yacht rental to others not taxable).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">While it is clear that Maher\u2019s use of Sea-Land cranes was not \u201cisolated,\u201d and was in accordance with an agreement, we are satisfied the use could come within the definition of \u201coccasional,\u201d meaning \u201cdictated by occasion.\u201d The true question is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>whether the Sales and Use Tax Act was intended to cover the intermittent exchange of equipment between entities engaged in international commerce and far from the source or distribution of any product to any customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">We recognize that all exemptions from tax are to be strictly construed. <em>Metpath Inc. v. Taxation Div. Director, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>147, 152 (1984); <em>Town of Bloomfield v. Academy of Medicine, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>358, 363 (1966); <em>Princeton Univ. Press v. Borough of Princeton, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>209, 214 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Clearly, however, neither of these parties is in the business of renting cranes. From the contract, the arrangement was intended to be one of service exchange. There is certainly no danger of widespread tax avoidance where vastly expensive equipment, available only to the parties in question, is exchanged once in a while as needed. No discrimination against other taxpayers is even implied, since no supplier of cranes on the open market could possibly fill this unique need. While the number of occasions of use is not infrequent, there is little pattern to be discerned. Over the three years, there was a 36.5% decrease in Maher\u2019s use of Sea-Land\u2019s cranes, and a complete change of pattern if considered on an annual basis from 1976 to 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">We conclude that the arrangement between Maher and Sea-Land codified an exchange of services as the occasion demanded and was therefore \u201ccasual.\u201d Accordingly, Maher should be entitled to an exemption from the Sales and Use Tax for its use of Sea-Land\u2019s cranes.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Y</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The final issue raised on this appeal is the awarding of interest due Zim on any refund by reason of its exemption from tax for R &amp; M on its chassis. Judge Crabtree concluded that the tax to be refunded was paid voluntarily, and therefore no refund would carry interest. <em>Cf. Continental Trailways, Inc. v. Director, Div. of Motor Vehicles, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>526 (1986). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>are satisfied Judge Crabtree correctly ruled on this issue and affirm primarily for the reasons put forth in his letter opinion of March 14, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-11\">Plaintiff Maher, as the seller of services, was required to collect any tax properly due on the charge for R &amp; M and parts of the chassis and containers. Plaintiff Zim also was liable as buyer for these taxes. Maher was taxed separately on the rental of the cranes from Sea-Land. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b197-8\">The Tax Court's affirmance of the Division's assessment of sales tax for parts supplied to Zim's chassis is not the subject of cross-appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b197-9\">As all opinions point out, the statute was amended as of September 11, 1980 to provide that repairs to containers would be exempt. The amendment was not, however, retroactive. Judge Crabtree held the 1980 amendment evidenced original legislative intent. We affirmed Judge Lasser\u2019s contrary holding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The applicable section of the statute in effect as of the time of the assessment is <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:32B-8(k). No substantive change was made by the renumbering. Throughout this opinion the numbering system created by L.1980, c. 105 will be used, except in quoted cases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b199-9\">The State does not contend otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b200-8\">The record does not show whether Sea-Land ever used a Maher crane during the audit period. Maher appears to be charged with the rental value of its total use of Sea-Land cranes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b201-7\"><em>N.J.SA. </em>54:32B-8.23 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">Receipts from the renting, leasing, licensing or interchanging of trucks, tractors, trailers or semitrailers [sic] by persons not engaged in a regular trade or business offering such renting, leasing, licensing or interchanging to the public, are exempt from the tax imposed under the Sales and Use Tax Act, provided that such renting, leasing, licensing or interchanging is carried on with persons engaged in a regular trade or business involving carriage of freight by such vehicles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">No one contends that this section is applicable to this case.
