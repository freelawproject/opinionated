(National) appeals from a judgment after court trial, awarding plaintiff Shell Oil Company (Shell) damages for breach of a liability insurance policy. National raises numerous issues, the primary ones being whether National provided coverage for an accident that resulted from Shell\u2019s sole negligence, and if so whether National yet fulfilled its contractual duties by paying its policy limit in settlement for a coinsured. Shell cross-appeals from the judgment insofar as it did not award attorney fees for this action, which Shell claimed under Washington state law. We affirm the judgment in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">I. Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">In September 1985, Shell entered into \u201cContract 169\u201d (the contract) with S.I.P. Engineering, Inc. (S.I.P.), for performance of engineering work on Shell\u2019s oil refinery in Anacortes, Washington. Paragraph 6.2 of the contract obligated S.I.P. to defend and indemnify Shell, up to $5 million, for any claims, liabilities or expenses on account of personal injury or property loss arising out of S.I.P.\u2019s or its subcontractors\u2019 work, \u201cbut excepting when the injury ... or damage is caused by the sole negligence of a party otherwise indemnified [i.e., Shell].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b891-13\">Paragraph 7.1 of the contract provided that during its term S.I.P. would maintain specified insurance, \u201csatisfactory to Shell,\u201d including workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1638\">*1638</page-number>compensation (\u00b6 7.1(a)), employers\u2019 liability (1 7.1(b)), auto liability (\u2022][ 7.1(c)), and, under paragraph 7.1(d), \u201cComprehensive General Liability Insurance, including product/completed operations coverage and contractual liability coverage for [S.I.P.\u2019s] obligations hereunder to defend and/or indemnify Shell, with limit of $1,000,000 each occurrence for bodily/personal injury, death and property damage combined.\u201d Finally, as here relevant, paragraph 7.2 of the contract provided that \u201cTo the fullest extent permitted by law, all insurance policies maintained by [S.I.P.] in accordance with paragraph 7.1 above and any other insurance maintained applicable to [S.I.P.\u2019s] performance hereunder shall include Shell and any parties in joint operation with Shell as additional insureds . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">In fulfillment of its insurance obligations under paragraphs 7.1 and 7.2, S.1. P. provided, inter alia, a $1 million comprehensive general liability policy from National (the policy). In its definitions of whom it insured, the policy provided that \u201cif specifically required to be included as a named insured, this policy shall include as a named insured any person or organization to whom the named insured [i.e., S.I.P.] is obligated by virtue of a contract, entered into before loss, to provide insurance such as is afforded by this policy, but only to the extent required by said contract and not to exceed the coverages and the limits of liability afforded by this policy.\u201d Three other insurance companies\u2014Lexington, Pacific Employers, and Granite State (the excess insurers)\u2014provided insurance over National\u2019s to a limit of $5 million. The excess policies covered the same persons as did National\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">On January 29, 1986, Donald Vaughn, an employee of one of S.I.P.\u2019s subcontractors, suffered severe injuries from a high-voltage electrical circuit while performing work at Shell\u2019s refinery in connection with the contract. S.I. P. reported the accident to National. On May 16, 1986, Vaughn sued S.I. P. and Shell for negligence in federal court in Seattle. Shell also was sued, in subrogation, by the subcontractor\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier. S.I. P. tendered its own defense to National, which accepted and agreed to pay the lawyers S.I.P. had retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-10\">Shell did not immediately tender its defense, instead defending through in-house and retained counsel. After Shell obtained National\u2019s and the excess insurers\u2019 policies in September 1987, it sought coverage through S.I. P.\u2019s counsel. Not having received confirmation, Shell formally demanded coverage and defense (including payment of expenses already incurred) from National and the excess insurers on January 21, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-12\">By that time, National had resolved to offer its policy limits, on behalf of S.I. P. On March 22, 1988, the Vaughn case proceeded to a judicially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1639\">*1639</page-number>required mediation, and was settled. National and its excess insurers\u2014which had declined to cover Shell\u2014paid S.I.P.\u2019s share of the settlement: $2 million, comprising National\u2019s $1 million policy limit and another $1 million from the excess insurers. Shell paid another $2 million, and also waived a $225,000 workers\u2019 compensation lien which it had acquired in settlement with the compensation carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Further litigation among the parties followed in Washington. Shell had sought indemnity from S.I.P., under the contract, but S.I.P. prevailed, the court finding that the Vaughn accident had been caused by Shell\u2019s sole negligence. Thereafter, S.I.P., National and the excess carriers filed two \u201ccontribution\u201d actions against Shell, to recover what they had paid to Vaughn. Shell prevailed in those actions because the releases given to Vaughn had not preserved such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Shell pursued its own claim for coverage and defense against National and the excess insurers in two actions, the present one and a companion case in Los Angeles federal court, which ultimately was dismissed on procedural grounds. Shell\u2019s third amended complaint in the present case sought a declaratory judgment of entitlement to the sums Shell had paid in settlement and defense of the Washington cases, including attorney fees and costs incurred in them and in this case. Alternatively, in the event it was determined not to have been covered, Shell prayed for the same relief from S.I.P., on account of breach of the contract to insure.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">On motion for summary adjudication, the court ruled that Shell had been covered for defense and indemnification in the Vaughn action, by reason of the contract and National\u2019s and the excess insurers\u2019 policies. The excess insurers then settled with Shell for $950,000. The matter proceeded to trial against National.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">The court determined that Shell was entitled to $500,000 from National, half of its policy limit, with prejudgment interest from the date National had paid the Vaughn case settlement for S.I.P., amounting to $265,972. Shell also was awarded $280,231 in attorney fees and costs incurred in the Vaughn case and in S.LP.\u2019s and the insurers\u2019 suits for contribution. (This amount was determined before a referee.) However, Shell\u2019s prayer for attorney fees for this action was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">II. National\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">The basis for the judgment below is straightforward: under the contract and National\u2019s policy, National was obligated to defend and indemnify Shell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1640\">*1640</page-number>in Vaughn\u2019s case and the contribution litigation arising out of it; accordingly, Shell was entitled to damages from National for Shell\u2019s expenses of defending those cases and for one-half of the policy limits payment that National made but apportioned all to its coinsured, S.I.P. National disputes these premises, and the judgment, with the following contentions. First, the Vaughn litigation was not within National\u2019s coverage because it involved Shell\u2019s sole negligence, for which neither indemnification nor insurance coverage was required under the contract; second, National in any event fully discharged its duty to indemnify Shell when it paid its policy limits in settlement; third, National\u2019s duty to defend Shell, if any, was limited to the three-month period between Shell\u2019s formal tender of defense and National\u2019s settlement payment in the Vaughn case; finally, Shell was not entitled to prejudgment interest, and National\u2019s liability should have been reduced by the amount the excess insurers paid Shell in settling this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Before resolving National\u2019s contentions, we note that the contract contained the following choice of law provision: \u201cThis Contract shall be construed and the rights of Shell and [S.I.P.] shall be determined (with respect to both interpretation of this Contract and its performance) according to the laws of the state in which the Work Site is located.\u201d Both parties agree that the law thus applicable to such questions is that of Washington. (See 1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1987) Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 44-45, pp. 82-86.) However, the briefs and our own review disclose few, if any, differences between Washington\u2019s law and California\u2019s with respect to National\u2019s affected issues.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, National relies at least as much upon California case law as upon Washington\u2019s. We thus apply Washington law where required, but without expounding or citing it generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">1. <em>The Question of Coverage.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Whether Shell was covered by National for the Vaughn case and the related subrogation and contribution claims involves determining the meaning of provisions of the contract and National\u2019s policy that have been set forth above. The trial court decided this question as a matter of law. There being no conflicting extrinsic evidence, the parties do not dispute that this court should do the same. The key issue is whether coverage extended to claims arising out of Shell\u2019s sole negligence, a condition that Shell does not dispute appertained in Vaughn\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">Paragraph 6.2 of the contract provided for indemnity of Shell by S.I.P. Although generally omnibus, it specifically excluded claims or liabilities for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1641\">*1641</page-number>injury caused by Shell\u2019s sole negligence. As National points out, in this construction contract a contrary provision, undertaking indemnity for sole negligence, would have been void. (Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 4.24.115; accord, Civ. Code, \u00a7 2782, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Paragraph 6.2, however, concerned indemnity by S.I.P., not the scope of the insurance Shell was to be (and was) provided under the contract. That subject was dealt with in paragraphs 7.1 and 7.2 of the contract, which required S.I.P. to maintain a variety of insurance, including comprehensive general liability, and to include Shell as an insured in all such policies. National fundamentally contends that these provisions excluded insurance for Shell\u2019s sole negligence, because they incorporated the limits of S.LP.\u2019s indemnity obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">We examine first paragraph 7.1(d) of the contract, under which National\u2019s policy was required and maintained. Paragraph 7.1(d) required S.I.P. to carry \u201cComprehensive General Liability Insurance [hereafter CGL], including product/completed operations coverage and contractual liability coverage <em>for Contractors\u2019 obligations hereunder to defend and/or indemnify Shell, </em>with limit of $1,000,000 each occurrence . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) National contends that the italicized language did not simply modify \u201ccontractual liability coverage,\u201d but rather applied to and defined \u201cComprehensive General Liability Insurance\u201d as a whole, with the result that S.I.P. was to maintain CGL only for S.I.P.\u2019s indemnity obligations, and thus not for liabilities occasioned by Shell\u2019s sole negligence. Shell, on the other hand, contends that the italicized language modified a particular subspecies of CGL, namely contractual liability coverage, and thus the CGL required by the contract was otherwise not limited to S.LP.\u2019s indemnity obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">From several vantage points, Shell\u2019s interpretation is the reasonable one and National\u2019s is unreasonable. Textually, paragraph 7.1(d) first requires CGL, without limitation. There follows a parenthetical, modifying phrase, set off by commas, that begins with the illustrative word \u201cincluding,\u201d and in turn contains the italicized \u201cindemnity\u201d language. Moreover, that language immediately follows and is attached to, without intervening punctuation, \u201ccontractual liability coverage,\u201d which is the particular type of liability insurance that would cover liabilities assumed by contract (e.g., an agreement to indemnify). (See <em>Alex Robertson Co. </em>v. <em>Imperial Casualty &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 338, 343 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 165]; <em>Loyola Marymount University </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1217, 1225-1226 [271 Cal.Rptr. 528].) Thus, it appears both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1642\">*1642</page-number>syntactically and substantively appropriate to read the italicized language as relating to and modifying that coverage, rather than CGL as a whole.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">On the other hand, National\u2019s propounded construction of the italicized indemnity language, as embracing and limiting all of the CGL required by paragraph 7.1(d), poses several anomalies. First, had that been the intent of the parties, the italicized language more naturally would have appeared immediately after \u201cComprehensive General Liability Insurance,\u201d rather than in the parenthetical phrase following it. Moreover, CGL does not normally cover indemnity obligations; that is the office of the special contractual liability coverage endorsement. (See 3 Cal. Insurance Law &amp; Practice (1996) \u00a7\u00a7 41.22[7][c], pp. 41-48, 49.31[1], pp. 49-61 to 49-62.) And similarly, the other special coverage called for by paragraph 7.1(d)\u2014\u201cproduct/completed operations coverage\u201d\u2014provides coverage for injuries from products, construction, and services after their completion <em>(id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 47.04 to 47.05, pp. 47-10 to 47-21), not for the insured\u2019s obligations to indemnify another. Yet National insists that the contract meant to provide for this coverage too solely for S.I.P.\u2019s indemnity obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">National\u2019s construction of paragraph 7.1(d) as limiting CGL to coverage for S.I.P.\u2019s indemnity obligation also does not make sense in the larger context of the contract. Paragraph 7.1 as a whole required S.I.P. to maintain a varied package of insurance (workers\u2019 compensation, employers\u2019 liability, automobile, and CGL), covering the general range of risks S.I.P. could encounter in performing the contract. The apparent purpose of this requirement extended beyond insuring S.I.P.\u2019s indemnity obligation, to providing S.I.P.\u2014as well as Shell, under paragraph 7.2 (discussed below)\u2014protection from out-of-pocket liability and dislocation. To construe paragraph 7.1(d) to limit the broad CGL coverage to insuring \u201cContractors\u2019 obligations hereunder to defend and/or indemnify\u201d would slight both S.I.P.\u2019s and Shell\u2019s business interests. Moreover, insofar as Shell was to be a direct beneficiary of the contract\u2019s insurance requirements, restricting the CGL to indemnifiable claims, and thus excluding from it those involving Shell\u2019s sole negligence, would have left Shell unprotected for those claims for which it most needed insurance. (Accord, <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. </em>v. <em>Bragg Crane &amp; Rigging Co. </em>(1986) 180 Cal.App.3d 639, 644 [225 Cal.Rptr. 742] <em>(Chevron).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">National further contends that its interpretation of paragraph 7.1(d), and the consequent lack of coverage for Shell\u2019s sole negligence, are confirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1643\">*1643</page-number>by paragraph 7.2 of the contract, which required Shell\u2019s inclusion as an additional insured in S.I.P.\u2019s insurance policies (or alternatively a \u201cwaiver of subrogation,\u201d which was not given). That requirement applied to \u201call insurance policies maintained by [S.I.P.] in accordance with paragraph 7.1 above and any other insurance maintained <em>applicable to </em>[S.I.P.\u2019s] performance hereunder . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) The reference to paragraph 7.1 of course begs the issue of paragraph 7.1(d)\u2019s meaning. But National appears to argue that the language italicized above limited the insurance to \u201cS.I.P.\u2019s performance\u201d of its indemnity obligations. We do not so read it. Like the rest of paragraphs 7.1 and 7.2, this language plainly appears to refer to S.I.P.\u2019s performance of the contract as a whole. Once again, there is no textual or practical reason to perceive the broad, plain language of these insurance provisions of the contract as requiring coverage only for S.I.P.\u2019s indemnity obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">National contends, however, that there are legal reasons requiring such construction. First, National notes that in both Washington and California, agreements purporting to indemnify for sole negligence must be explicit, and are strictly construed against the indemnitee. <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Strom Construction Co., Inc. </em>(1974) 84 Wn.2d 518 [527 P.2d 1115]; 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, <em>supra, </em>Torts, \u00a7 101, pp. 176-178.) But this doctrine in terms does not apply here, because the obligation to be construed is not an indemnity clause (such as paragraph 6.2 of the contract) but rather an agreement to provide and carry insurance. Insurance, of course, is commonly provided to protect from liability for solitary negligence. (See <em>Chevron, supra, </em>180 Cal.App.3d at p. 644, fn. 4; cf. Civ. Code, \u00a7 2782, subd. (a) [excluding insurance contracts from the prohibition against indemnity for sole negligence in construction contracts].) \u201cHere [Shell] did not contract to exculpate itself from liability. Rather, it contracted for the procurement of insurance. [National]\u2019s contention is therefore unpersuasive.\u201d <em>(Chevron, supra, </em>180 Cal.App.3d at p. 647, fn. omitted; see <em>id. </em>at p. 648, fn. 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">National therefore argues at great length that an agreement to procure insurance for the promisee\u2019s sole negligence should either be against public policy, or at least subject to strict construction. But National admits that no Washington decision has so held. And neither the foreign decisions that National advances, nor Washington Revised Code section 4.24.115, which invalidates construction contract indemnity agreements for the indemnitee\u2019s own negligence, convinces us that Washington either outlaws or imposes a rule of strict construction upon insurance policies or insurance procurement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1644\">*1644</page-number>contracts. We therefore perceive no mandate to depart from a plain and natural construction of paragraphs 7.1(d) and <em>7.2.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">National finally contends that Shell\u2019s own conduct in the Vaughn case evidenced that the contract did not provide for insurance covering Shell with respect to that case. Specifically, Shell undertook its own defense from the outset, and did not ask S.I.P. for insurance policy information or coverage for over a year, until S.I.P. had produced its policies to Vaughn in belated response to his discovery. At trial below, Shell explained that its counsel and SJ.P.\u2019s had agreed not to undertake discovery from each other; but, National urges, that did not explain Shell\u2019s failure to seek the policy informally from its codefendant and obligor.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">Shell\u2019s behavior does appear somewhat curious, but its very opaqueness fails to confirm or establish the construction of the contract that National propounds. At bottom, National contends that Shell refrained from seeking the policy, and then tendering the Vaughn case, out of an absolute conviction that it had been solely negligent and hence was not entitled to coverage by the terms of the contract. But such an attitude on the part of a party that was litigating the sole negligence question\u2014and indeed would do so up to the decision in favor of S.I.P. after the settlement with Vaughn\u2014is even more improbable than Shell\u2019s actual conduct. Even if unaggressive, Shell\u2019s performance does not convince us that the contract necessarily meant what National hypothesizes Shell once believed it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">We conclude that paragraphs 7.1 and 7.2 of the contract required S.I.P. to provide insurance coverage for Shell, including its sole negligence. Those provisions therefore rendered Shell an insured under National\u2019s policy for the Vaughn case.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">2. <em>National\u2019s Settlement Payment: Full Performance or Breach of Duty?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">Under its policy, National was separately obligated to both Shell and S.I.P., but only to an indemnity limit of $1 million for both. The policy provided that \u201cthe insurance afforded by this policy applies separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought, except with respect to the limit of liability.\u201d National contends that it fully performed its obligation to Shell by paying the policy limit, to fund S.LP.\u2019s settlement with Vaughn, while leaving Shell to pay its own settlement out-of-pocket. (Of course, in so paying while denying that Shell was covered, National positioned itself to seek to recover the payment from Shell.) The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1645\">*1645</page-number>rejected this contention. It held that National had not been entitled to pick and choose between its two insureds in its payment of benefits, \u201cparticularly where no detriment is demonstrated by providing equal treatment to both insureds.\u201d We agree.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">It is undisputed that National allocated and applied all of the $1 million cash benefit of its policy to S.I.P.\u2019s liability to Vaughn, and none of it to Shell\u2019s. National yet contends that the payment for S.I.P.\u2019s liability afforded the full $1 million benefit to Shell as well, because Vaughn\u2019s release of S.I.P. reduced his claim against cotortfeasor Shell by the amount of National\u2019s payment for S.I.P., under Washington\u2019s release statute. (Wash. Rev. Code, \u00a7 4.22.060; accord, Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 877, subd. (a).) This contention is illusory.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">Shell received no statutory credit from S.I.P.\u2019s settlement, because that settlement was simultaneous with, and dependent upon, Shell\u2019s own $2 million settlement with Vaughn. With both defendants settling simultaneously, there remained nothing against which Shell could \u201coffset\u201d National\u2019s payment. That payment only could have operated to reduce Vaughn\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d against Shell (Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 4.22.060; accord, Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 877, subd. (a)), had it remained pending (and ultimately produced a judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">Nor do the cases on which National relies support the premise that payment of policy limits on behalf of one coinsured necessarily satisfies the insurer\u2019s obligation to the other coinsured. In <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hunley </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 915 F.2d 557 (Nationwide), the issue was whether the carrier had fulfilled its statutory obligation to afford a permissive user insurance \u201cto the same extent that insurance is afforded to the named insured.\u201d (Ins. Code, \u00a7 11580.1, subd. (b)(4).) The insurer had offered its $25,000 limit on behalf of both parties, but after rejection had paid the entirety on behalf of the policyholder, leaving the permissive user to fend for himself. The court held that the $25,000 statutory credit to a judgment against the user (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 877, subd. (a)) signified that both parties had been equally insured. However, the court continued, absent that statutory allowance, \u201cNationwide could not have made [its] payment on [the policyholder\u2019s] behalf without violating its statutory obligation to insure [the user] to the same extent that it insured [the policyholder]. <em>In that case, Nationwide would have depleted the limited fund to which [the </em>user] <em>could look for indemnity without providing any benefit to [him] in the process. Such an action, if done on [either\u2019s] </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1646\">*1646</page-number><em>behalf, would have violated Nationwide\u2019s contractual duty to [the other].\u201d (Nationwide, supra, </em>at p. 560, italics added.) Thus, on the facts of this case, <em>Nationwide </em>actually confirms the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\"><em>Hartford Casualty Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Mid-Century Ins. Co. </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1783 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 351] <em>(Hartford) </em>is more favorable to National, but ultimately is not dispositive. In that case Mid-Century\u2019s primary policy had a $15,000 limit for an accident by a permissive user. Mid-Century paid that amount to settle the owner\u2019s liability, and refused to defend or indemnify the user and a codefendant employer, both of whom also were insureds. Hartford, whose policy provided excess coverage for those insureds, defended and settled for them for additional amounts, and then sought reimbursement from Mid-Century under equitable indemnity. The court held that Mid-Century had fulfilled its obligations under its policy. \u201cMid-Century promised only to defend and to pay $15,000 for a permissive user accident, regardless of the number of insured persons. That there happened to be three insured persons, rather than one, cannot expand the duty of the insurer. [Citation.] The primary insurer fulfilled its duty by defending and settling for $15,000 on behalf of its own named insured.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1788.)</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\"><em>Hartford\u2019s </em>analysis of the duties imposed by policy language may or may not be accurate.  But further duties are imposed by the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing that is also a part of every insurance policy (indeed every contract). And when there is more than one insured, \u201cAn insurer owes the duty of good faith and fair dealing to each of its insureds, and cannot favor the interests of one insured over the other.\u201d <em>(Lehto </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 60, 72 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 814].)  Applying this rule, the court in <em>Lehto </em>reversed a judgment determining that an insurer had acted improperly when it refused to pay its policy limits for a release of only one insured, without a release of the coinsured. The court implicitly rejected the plaintiff\u2019s position that such a disposition would not have harmed the coinsured, because he \u201cwould get a [policy limits] credit against any damages awarded in plaintiff\u2019s case.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 66.) Rather, had the insurer accepted the plaintiff\u2019s offer, \u201cit would have left one of its insureds bereft of coverage, an act of bad faith. [Citations].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 75.) As do we, the <em>Lehto </em>court found <em>Hartford, supra, </em>inapposite, because it had not taken into account the duties of good faith, and also because in that case Mid-Century\u2019s settlement had not left the coinsureds without coverage, as Hartford provided it. <em>(Lehto, supra, </em>at p. 75, fn. 12.) (In contrast, in the Vaughn case National\u2019s refusal of coverage to Shell also stripped it\u2014until this litigation\u2014of coverage by the excess insurers.)</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1647\">*1647</page-number><em>Smoral </em>v. <em>Hanover Insurance Company </em>(1971) 37 A.D.2d 23 [322 N.Y.S.2d 12] reflects the same view. There once again, the insurer settled for policy limits on behalf of the owner, leaving the driver without coverage (except from his own carrier). The appellate court held the insurer liable, because \u201cit was [the driver\u2019s] insurer and it owed a duty of good faith to him [citations]. Good faith in this connection means more than an absence of intent to harm. It means an adequate protection of the interests of the assured. [Citation.] While this duty has most frequently been considered where the interests of the company have been preferred to the detriment of the insured [citation], the same considerations would apply with equal force where the company preferred one of its insureds over another. It is absolutely no answer for the company to say that it paid the full amount of its policy if in so doing it fully protected one of its insureds and left the other completely exposed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 25 [322 N.Y.S.2d at p. 14].) The court opined that the driver would be entitled to recover the proportion of the policy limits that in good faith should have been allotted to relieving or reducing his liability. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 26 [322 N.Y.S.2d at p. 14].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">We thus agree with the trial court that National\u2019s disbursement of its entire policy limits to indemnify S.I.P. did not discharge National\u2019s policy obligations to Shell but rather constituted an actionable breach of those duties. The court\u2019s consequent award of damages equal to half the policy limits, conservative in view of Shell\u2019s sole negligence, is unexceptionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">3. <em>Liability for Shell\u2019s Defense Expenses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">National\u2019s policy included the standard obligation to defend any claim or suit against its insureds seeking damages within policy coverage. National never provided such a defense to Shell, and the trial court awarded Shell damages for the value of defense expenses it sustained, in the Vaughn case and in the subsequent contribution cases brought by S.I.P. and the excess insurers. National contests the propriety of these awards in various respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">We summarily dismiss National\u2019s broad contention that Shell was entitled to no relief whatsoever, because it did not truly tender its defense to National but rather only demanded that National pay for lawyers Shell had selected. This contention appears only in a heading in National\u2019s reply brief: the text of that brief, and the opening brief, do not argue it. Moreover, Shell did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1648\">*1648</page-number>make a clear tender of defense, at least by January 1988. Indeed, it is the timing of that tender that grounds National\u2019s principal contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">National contends that Shell was not entitled to recompense for its litigation expenses that preceded the January 1988 tender to National, by virtue of a provision in National\u2019s policy, under the heading \u201cAssistance and Cooperation of the Insured,\u201d which provided in part: \u201cThe insured shall not, except at his own cost, voluntarily make any payment, assume any obligation, or incur any expense other than for first aid to others at the time of the occurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Whether this provision embraces expenses of defense is unclear. National cites no Washington authority on the question. Certain Ninth Circuit cases have intimated that the provision has been so construed and applied in California. <em>(Faust </em>v. <em>The Travelers </em>(9th Cir. 1995) 55 F.3d 471, 472, citing <em>Northern Ins. Co. of New York </em>v. <em>Allied Mut. Ins. </em>(9th Cir. 1992) 955 F.2d 1353, 1360.) But in fact, the only California case presenting the question pretermitted it, while \u201cnot[ing] the provision does not specifically refer to the costs of defense and there is a question what a reasonable insured would understand reading the provision.\u201d <em>(Fiorito </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 433, 440, fn. 4 [277 Cal.Rptr. 27] <em>(Fiorito).)</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Of course, if the provision be deemed ambiguous in this regard, that ambiguity must be resolved against National. (E.g., <em>AIU Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807, 822 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253].)</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Even assuming the prohibition against voluntary payments unambiguously applied to expenses of defense before tender, the judgment allowing Shell reimbursement remains supported. <em>Fiorito, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d 433, sustained the sufficiency of a cross-complaint by which two insureds sought to recover defense expenditures incurred during a four-month interval between service of summons and tender of defense. While their lawyer began to defend, the insureds had \u201csearched for insurance policies that might provide coverage or defense.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 436.) They alleged they had been \u201c \u2018compelled\u2019 to incur the pre-tender defense costs in order to respond to legal process and to protect their legal interests. They further allege[d] the obligations were not \u2018voluntarily\u2019 made as the term was used in\u201d the policy language National here would invoke. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 438.) The court held that the voluntariness of those payments presented a triable issue, precluding demurrer. (I<em>d. </em>at p. 439.)</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1649\">*1649</page-number>Under <em>Fiorito, </em>there are substantial difficulties with characterizing Shell\u2019s defense expenses as voluntarily paid. Until September 1987, Shell was unaware either of its insurer\u2019s identity, the contents of the policy, or both. And in the ensuing four months before formal tender, Shell sought without success to secure coverage and defense through S.I.P.\u2019s counsel. We have observed that Shell\u2019s pursuit of its insurance coverage before it obtained the policy may have been less than aggressive. But without question, both the period of self-defense between September 1987 and January 1988, and at least a portion of the preceding period without knowledge, cannot be characterized as voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">The trial court rejected National\u2019s voluntary payments argument at the close of trial. National raised it again before the special master appointed to determine Shell\u2019s defense expenses (a retired justice of this court), who dismissed it as without merit. The trial court approved the master\u2019s recommendations. Under these circumstances, it appears appropriate to treat the court\u2019s decision awarding Shell its expenses as an adjudication that the voluntary payments provision did not apply, either on its face or on the facts relating to voluntariness. Stated otherwise, the court\u2019s implicit determination that Shell\u2019s pre-tender defense expenses were not barred from recovery, because they were not voluntary, is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">National\u2019s policy also provided that National \u201cshall not be obligated to pay any claim, judgment or award or to defend any suit or proceeding after the applicable limit of the company\u2019s liability has been exhausted by payment of judgments, settlements or awards.\u201d Based on this provision, National contends it could not be liable for Shell\u2019s defense expenditures after April 9, 1988, the date National paid its policy limits to Vaughn on behalf of S.I.P. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">National relies on our decision in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Companies </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 477 [248 Cal.Rptr. 412] <em>{Johnson). </em>In <em>Johnson, </em>an insurer with a similar policy provision paid its policy limits to the accident claimants, at the insured\u2019s request. It then refused to defend the insured against indemnity-type cross-complaints in suits the insured and the claimants brought on account of the accident. Acknowledging \u201cthat California has yet to rule on the issue of whether an insurer must continue to defend claims that are proper under the substantive provisions of the policy after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1650\">*1650</page-number>monetary limits of the policy have been reached\u201d <em>(id. </em>at pp. 483-484), we distinguished foreign decisions holding in favor of insureds. We noted that in two of those cases the insurer had tendered its policy limits in the course of litigation to avoid excess liability, in one case doing so without obtaining a release of the insured. (Cf. <em>Lehto </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th 60.) We concluded: \u201cThe cases cited by Johnson rely principally on the idea that an insurer, after being apprised of pending litigation against its insured, may not walk away from its duty to defend its insured by tendering its policy limits. As noted above, these cases are inapplicable to the instant facts since the insurer here tendered its policy limits in response to the demand of its insured prior to the initiation of litigation arising from the accident. [1 We do not construe Continental\u2019s conduct as abandoning Johnson in midcourse or placing upon her shoulders the full burden of investigation, settlement, or defense.\u201d <em>(Johnson, supra, </em>at p. 486.)</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">The present case is everything <em>Johnson </em>was not. Here National afforded Shell none of the benefits of the policy. It left Shell holding the bag, as to both liability and defense. Although Shell had asked National to tender the policy limit, Shell had done so when demanding coverage for itself. Instead, National ignored its duties to Shell and paid its policy limit on behalf of S.I.P. only. In short, the April 9, 1988, payout marked not simply the monetary limit of National\u2019s indemnity undertaking but also the most material breach of its policy with Shell (for which most of the present judgment holds National responsible). National cannot truncate its responsibility and liability to Shell for defense by claiming it fully performed its coverage obligations by the very act of breaching them.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">National finally contends that the award of approximately $70,000 for Shell\u2019s expenses of defending the contribution suits by S.I.P. and the excess carriers lacks legal or factual support. To the extent that National\u2019s arguments replicate those made above, they need not be addressed again.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As for the remaining issues, the contribution claims were within policy coverage: they were made \u201cbecause of personal injury . . . caused by an occurrence,\u201d just as were the cross-claims in <em>Johnson, supra, </em>202 Cal.App.3d 477. And National\u2019s assertion that substantial evidence did not establish the nature and existence of the excess insurers\u2019 suit is refuted by the very record National cites.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">4. <em>Prejudgment Interest.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">The judgment awarded Shell prejudgment interest on its $500,000 damages for National\u2019s breach of coverage duties, running from April 9, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1651\">*1651</page-number>1988, the date National paid all of its policy limits on behalf of S.I.P., not Shell. The statutory basis for this award was Civil Code section 3287, subdivision (a), which allows interest to \u201c[e]very person who is entitled to recover damages certain, or capable of being made certain by calculation . . . .\u201d National contends that Shell did not qualify under this standard, because it proposed three different measures of damages to the court, all of which were in dispute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">The award was proper. \u201cGenerally, the certainty required of Civil Code section 3287, subdivision (a), is absent when the amounts due turn on disputed facts, but not when the dispute is confined to the rules governing liability.\u201d <em>(Olson </em>v. <em>Cory </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 390, 402 [197 Cal.Rptr. 843, 673 P.2d 720].) Here, Shell\u2019s alternative theories required only the court\u2019s legal determination of which was appropriate; the amount of damages would thereby be fixed. The present case thus resembles <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Sequoia Ins. Co. </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 1285 [260 Cal.Rptr. 190], in which the overall responsibility of an insurer was in dispute, and the amount recoverable from it depended on how the court assigned priorities among it and two other insurers. There as here, \u201cthe amount of damages under either formula was readily ascertainable by mathematical calculation\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1307), and prejudgment interest was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">5. <em>Settlement Offset.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">Following the trial court\u2019s summary adjudication of coverage, the excess carriers settled this action with Shell for $950,000. National\u2019s final contention is that it should have been given an offset against its judgment liability for that amount, by virtue of Code of Civil Procedure section 877, subdivision (a). That section provides for reduction of remaining claims when a dismissal or release is given to one or more alleged cotortfeasors, or \u201cto one or more other co-obligors mutually subject to contribution rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">Code of Civil Procedure section 877 did not apply to this case, for several reasons. First, National and the excess insurers were not sued as tortfeasors; this case was based on breach of contract. Second, National and its excess insurers were not \u201cother co-obligors\u201d: their obligations to Shell derived from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1652\">*1652</page-number>different policies, and extended to different monetary liabilities. <em>(Topa Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Companies </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1331, 1336-1338 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 516]; <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1181 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 126]; <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 435, 440, fn. 4 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 520].) Finally, the 1987 amendment to Code of Civil Procedure section 877, which extended its applicability to contractual obligors, also provided that the statute would not apply to a release or dismissal \u201cgiven to a co-obligor on an alleged contract debt where the contract was made prior to January 1, 1988.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (d).) All of the contracts involved in this case predated January 1, 1988. Shell\u2019s settlement with the excess carriers thus did not fall within section 877, and National was not entitled to an offset on account of that settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">III.
