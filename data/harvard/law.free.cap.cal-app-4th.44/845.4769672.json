A jury found Lewis guilty of selling cocaine base and possessing cocaine. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11352, subd. (a), 11350, subd. (a).) The court found true two prior serious felony convictions under California\u2019s three strikes law. (Pen. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i).) The second strike finding was based on Lewis\u2019s 1967 Louisiana conviction for attempted aggravated escape.

Section 667, subdivision (d)(2) defines a prior felony conviction to include \u201ca conviction in another jurisdiction for an offense that includes all of the elements of the particular felony as defined in . . . subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">A. <em>Evidence of Second Strike</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">With respect to the second strike, the trial court found Lewis had been convicted of a 1967 attempted aggravated escape in Louisiana and the conviction included all of the elements of two section 1192.7(c) serious felonies: (1) \u201cassault by a life prisoner on a noninmate\u201d (\u00a7 1192.7(c)(12)) and (2) \u201cassault with a deadly weapon by an inmate\u201d (\u00a7 1192.7(c)(13)). Section 1192.7(c)(12) is based on section 4500 before its amendment in 1977.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Reed </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1608, 1611, fn. 3 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 47]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 826, 832, fn. 7 [210 Cal.Rptr. 623, 694 P.2d 736], overruled on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerrero </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 343, 348 [243 Cal.Rptr. 688, 748 P.2d 1150].)  Section 1192.7(c)(13) reflects a section 245, subdivision (a)(1)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> assault committed by an inmate. A defendant is guilty of both forms of assault if he aids and abets the commission of the assault by the life prisoner/inmate. (See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number><em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 911, 914 [272 Cal.Rptr. 212]; <em>In re De La Roi </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 264, 274 [169 P.2d 363]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Equarte </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 456, 465 [229 Cal.Rptr. 116, 722 P.2d 890].)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">To establish the second strike, the prosecutor proffered documents showing that on September 28, 1967, Lewis was convicted of \u201cattempted aggravated escape\u201d in Louisiana.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Recognizing the statutory elements of this escape offense<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> did not establish all of the elements of an assault under section 1192.7(c)(12) or (13), the prosecution submitted documents from Lewis\u2019s Louisiana criminal court file and prison file in an attempt to establish that the prior Louisiana conviction contained the elements of these \u201cserious felony\u201d offenses. With respect to the nature of the escape offense, the documents consisted of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">1. A Louisiana charging document. The document, signed by an assistant district attorney, alleged: \u201c[Lewis], and one Alvin Howard, each, [][]... on [June 21, 1967], with force and arms in the Parish of Orleans aforesaid . . . did intentionally depart, under circumstances wherein human life was endangered, from the lawful custody of a deputy sheriff and from a place where he was lawfully detained by said deputy sheriff, to wit: the Orleans Parish Prison, . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">2. A document resembling a clerk\u2019s minutes dated September 28, 1967. A handwritten paragraph stated that Lewis \u201centered [a] plea of attempted] aggravated escape\u201d and \u201cwas then sentenced to serve 3 years in the [Louisiana] State Penitentiary[,] sentenceQ to run consecutively with any other sentence imposed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">3. A document entitled \u201cInformation for Violation R.S. 14:109.\u201d (We will refer to this document as Exhibit A and have attached a copy of Exhibit A to this opinion.) The document was signed by a Louisiana criminal district court judge on November 20, 1967, two months <em>after </em>Lewis had pled guilty to the attempted escape charge and two months <em>after </em>Lewis had been sentenced for this crime. The document contained a paragraph as follows: \u201cThe facts disclose that the defendant [David Lewis], and one Alvin Howard, both confined to the same cell in the Orleans Parish Prison, pending appeals from a prior conviction and sentence. On June 21, 1967, at approximately 1:45 a.m., these two defendants escaped from the cell in which they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>were confined and were in the adjoining hallway when Deputy Sheriff Norwood Spencer happened upon the scene. The defendant [Lewis], and Alvin Howard, struck Spencer several times with an iron bar, took cell block keys from his possession, and ran up several stairs with the full intent to escape from Parish Prison.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\">4. A document on \u201cDistrict Attorney\u201d letterhead, dated June 23, 1967 (two days after Lewis\u2019s attempted escape) and signed by an assistant district attorney. (We will refer to this document as Exhibit B and have attached a copy of Exhibit B to this opinion.) The word \u201cAccepted\" is circled on the top of the document. The document, referring to both Lewis and codefendant Howard, contained a statement of \u201cfacts\u201d as follows: \u201cCommitted Aggravated Escape From Deputy Sheriff Norwood Spencer By Striking Him With An Iron Bar &amp; Beating Him With Fists.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">5. Documents establishing that at the time of the attempted escape Lewis and Howard were life prisoners.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">During the court trial on the priors, Lewis argued Exhibit A was inadmissible to prove the circumstances of the prior crime. The court rejected the argument, explaining the document was signed by a judge and it \u201cappears from the [document\u2019s] content\u201d that it was \u201crequired for [Louisiana court] cases.\u201d The court thereafter relied primarily on Exhibit A to reach its conclusion that in committing the attempted escape Lewis had committed the elements of an assault pursuant to section 1192.7(c)(12) and (13).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">B. <em>Legal Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">On appeal, Lewis challenges the admissibility of Exhibits A and B to prove he committed the elements of section 1192.7(c)(12) and (13) felonies. The argument has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Our Supreme Court has held a trier of fact may go beyond the judgment to the entire record of the foreign conviction to determine the truth of a prior conviction allegation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Myers </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 1193, 1201 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 911, 858 P.2d 301]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerrero, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 343 [applying same rule with respect to California prior convictions].) A court may not, however, consider (1) evidence outside the prior \u201crecord of the conviction\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guerrero, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 355) or (2) facts \u201cprecluded by the rules of evidence or other statutory limitation\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number><em>(People </em>v. <em>Myers, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 1201).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Lewis argues the challenged documents fail on both prongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">1. <em>Were Exhibits A and B Part of the \u201cRecord of Conviction\u2019\u2019 ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">A trier of fact may not look outside a record of conviction in determining the truth of a prior conviction allegation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guerrero, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 355; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Matthews </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 930, 940 [280 Cal.Rptr. 134].) While the Supreme Court has not yet defined the meaning of a \u201crecord of conviction,\u201d the court recently clarified that a trier of fact is entitled to \u201cconsider the <em>entire </em>record of the [criminal] proceedings <em>leading to imposition of judgment on the prior conviction </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Myers, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 1195, italics added.) Consistent with this statement, a Court of Appeal has defined \u201c \u2018the record of the prior conviction\u2019 \u201d to mean \u201call items that could have been used on appeal of that prior conviction, specifically, any items considered a normal part of the record under California Rules of Court, rule 33 or by which it could be augmented pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 12.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Abarca </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1347, 1350 [285 Cal.Rptr. 213]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Castellanos </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1163, 1172 [269 Cal.Rptr. 93] [a record of conviction \u201cincludes all relevant documents in the court file of the prior conviction\u201d].) Applying this definition, <em>Abarca </em>held a reporter\u2019s transcript of a plea in the defendant\u2019s previous conviction was within the record of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Rhoden </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1242 [265 Cal.Rptr. 355] also addressed the issue of which documents comprise a \u201crecord of conviction.\u201d In that case, the trial court relied on a Florida \u201cDepartment of Corrections uniform commitment to custody form\u201d to conclude there was a sufficient basis to find the foreign conviction constituted a \u201cserious felony.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1257.) <em>Rhoden </em>held the trial court erred in relying on the document because it was not part of the \u201crecord of conviction.\u201d The court explained \u201c[w]e view the document as an intake and classification report used by the prison system for administration purposes. The record does not reveal any other use for it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>save postconviction, and nothing suggests it was a factor in [defendant\u2019s] conviction or sentencing.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Applying these principles, we conclude Exhibit B was a part of Lewis\u2019s prior record of conviction. The document is dated June 23, 1967, two days after Lewis\u2019s attempted escape, and appears to be a district attorney arraignment or bail form submitted to the court at the beginning of Lewis\u2019s case. Exhibit B is thus a \u201crelevant document\u201d contained in Lewis\u2019s criminal court file. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Castellanos, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d at p. 1172.) Further, it is a document \u201cleading to imposition of judgment\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Myers, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 1195) and would have been a proper part of a record on appeal. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Abarca, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 1350.)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Exhibit A, however, is dated almost two months <em>after </em>Lewis\u2019s plea <em>and </em>sentencing. Based on our analysis of <em>Myers, Abarca, </em>and <em>Rhoden, </em>documents prepared <em>after </em>conviction and sentencing are not part of the \u201crecord of conviction.\u201d A document prepared after judgment, by definition, is not part of the record <em>\u201cleading </em>to imposition of judgment.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Myers, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th atp. 1195, italics added.) Likewise, such document is not generally considered a proper part of the record on appeal. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Pearson </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 218, 221, fn. 1 [74 Cal.Rptr. 281, 449 P.2d 217]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Agnew </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 655, 660 [107 P.2d 601], <em>People </em>v. <em>Acuff (1949) 94 </em>Cal.App.2d 551, 557 [211 P.2d 17].) Moreover, unlike Exhibit B, Exhibit A was not contained in Lewis\u2019s criminal court file; instead it was part of Lewis\u2019s prison file. As in <em>Rhoden, </em>Exhibit A appears, at most, to be in the nature of a prison information form. Because Exhibit A was not part of the record <em>leading to the imposition of judgment, </em>the court erred in relying on it. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Myers, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 1195.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">2. <em>Was the Information in Exhibits A and B Inadmissible </em>Hearsay?</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">A document is admissible to prove a prior conviction only if the facts asserted are admissible under the rules of evidence, including hearsay rules. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Myers, supra, 5 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1201; <em>People </em>v. <em>Abarca, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number><em>supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 1350; <em>People </em>v. <em>Goodner </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 1324, 1330 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 543]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Castellanos, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1172-1174.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, the courts have recognized that a defendant\u2019s admissions in a court document are admissible because the defendant\u2019s statements fall within a hearsay exception. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 233, 237 [264 Cal.Rptr. 662]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Goodner, supra, </em>7 Cal.App.4th at p. 1328; <em>People </em>v. <em>Abarca, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1350-1351.) In <em>Garcia, </em>this court upheld the admissibility of a defendant\u2019s statements contained in a probation report to establish that a prior conviction constituted a serious felony. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d at pp. 236-237.) We reasoned that although probation reports often contain hearsay matter, \u201c[i]f a defendant contends the hearsay information is unfair or untrue he is given an opportunity to refute it.\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 237.) We further emphasized that the trial court relied only on statements made <em>by </em>the defendant <em>to </em>the probation officer. Therefore such statements fell within a hearsay exception. <em>(Ibid:, </em>see Evid. Code, \u00a7 1220.)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">By comparison, statements in a prior probation report made by persons other than the defendant have been held inadmissible. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 911 [272 Cal.Rptr. 212].) In <em>Williams, </em>the trial court found the elements of a prior felony, based on a prior probation report containing the probation officer\u2019s description of the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 915.) The probation officer\u2019s description was based on sheriff\u2019s reports prepared by investigating officers who had spoken with the victim. <em>(Ibid.) Williams </em>held the probation report was not admissible, explaining, \u201cThe use of a multiple hearsay statement attributed to the victim in the probation report at bar went far beyond the holding of <em>Garcia. . . . </em>[The defendant] was given no chance to cross-examine the probation officer, the sheriff who purportedly recited what the victim had said, or the victim himself. . . . Unlike <em>Garcia, </em>the defendant was not afforded adequate protection from the dangers of out-of-court statements. Because it constituted triple hearsay and defendant had no opportunity to cross-examine the hearsay declarants, we hold that the probation report statement was far too unreliable to be used to prove the enhancement. A five-year consecutive prison sentence cannot, consistent with due process and a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront witnesses, be predicated on such untrustworthy evidence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 917-918.)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">While Exhibits A and B appear to be public records, the asserted facts of Lewis\u2019s crime contained in the documents are hearsay and there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>no applicable exception. With respect to Exhibit A, there is no information in the record as to who prepared the document, the basis for the information asserted, the purpose for which the document was prepared or used, the role of such document in the Louisiana court system, or the identity of those who were permitted to review the document. Further, there are no facts showing Lewis or his counsel was even aware of the document. Although Exhibit A is signed by a judge, there is no indication that this was the same judge who presided when Lewis entered his guilty plea or at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Exhibit B likewise contains no information establishing the facts asserted were trustworthy or reliable. The document is signed only by an assistant district attorney and there is no information as to the basis for the information asserted. The document, prepared shortly after Lewis committed the escape crime, appears to be a district attorney arraignment or bail form. Thus, Exhibit B, by its nature, reflects only the district attorney\u2019s preliminary understanding of what occurred during the attempted escape. Given such circumstances, the document\u2019s existence in the court file cannot in and of itself establish the particular facts asserted are a reliable reflection of the circumstances surrounding the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Unlike <em>Garcia, </em>the factual statements contained in Exhibits A and B do not fall within a specific hearsay exception. Moreover, unlike <em>Castellanos </em>wherein this court upheld the use of a prior preliminary hearing transcript (see fn. 10 <em>ante), </em>there is no assurance that Lewis had the opportunity to refute the statements, cross-examine the witnesses involved, or present rebuttal evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The Attorney General argues the trial court was entitled to rely on Exhibits A and B \u201cbecause certified court documents from foreign jurisdictions are the exclusive means of proof of both the existence and nature of a prior conviction allegation.\u201d In essence, the Attorney General is suggesting trial courts may consider all information sent to the prosecutor\u2019s office from the foreign jurisdiction, regardless of the hearsay character of the information or the extent to which the document related to the proceedings leading to judgment. This position is inconsistent with California Supreme Court authority (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Myers, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 1201) and does not comport with fundamental due process considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The Attorney General alternatively attempts to justify the court\u2019s finding by asserting that Exhibits A and B were \u201cbut a small portion of the documents considered by the trial court to determine the truth of the allegation.\u201d However, the only other documents pertaining to the nature of Lewis\u2019s crime were the charging document and the clerk\u2019s minutes, reflecting that Lewis pled guilty to an attempted aggravated escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>Lewis concedes these documents were admissible. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 340, 345 [253 Cal.Rptr. 522].) The documents, however, do not establish that in committing the \u201cattempted aggravated escape,\u201d Lewis committed, or aided and abetted, an assault within the meaning of section 1192.7(c)(12) or (13). The charging document alleged that Lewis and Alvin Howard each \u201cwith force and arms . . . intentionally departed], under circumstances wherein human life was endangered, from the lawful custody of a deputy sheriff . . . .\u201d Lewis pled guilty to this charge. While we are required to assume the asserted facts were therefore true, the allegations did not assert that Lewis either attacked the guard or assisted an attack on the guard. Indeed, there is no allegation that an assault of any kind occurred. From Lewis\u2019s guilty plea, we know only that Lewis admitted he attempted to depart \u201cunder circumstances wherein human life was endangered . . . .\u201d Lewis\u2019s plea is therefore insufficient to establish the prior offense constituted an assault within the meaning of section 1192.7(c)(12) or (13).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">We conclude Exhibit A was not a part of the prior record of conviction. Further, there was no hearsay exception applicable to the information asserted in Exhibit A or B and the documents were devoid of sufficient indicia of reliability with respect to the asserted circumstances surrounding Lewis\u2019s crime. Accordingly, the documents were inadmissible. Because the remaining information was insufficient to prove Lewis committed the specified assaults, the second strike finding is not supported by substantial evidence. Thus, the second strike finding must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">II. <em>Additional Arguments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Our conclusion that the second strike finding must be reversed renders it unnecessary to reach Lewis\u2019s additional challenges to the court\u2019s finding on the second strike. We likewise do not address Lewis\u2019s constitutional arguments challenging the imposition of a 25-year-to-life sentence because those arguments are now moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">We reverse the finding on the second strike. We vacate the sentence and remand the matter for resentencing. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">Work, Acting P.

(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Myers, supra, 5 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1196 fn. 2; <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerrero, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 356.) We note that the California Supreme Court has recently granted review in a number of cases raising these issues. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Reed </em>(Cal.App.); <em>People </em>v. <em>Stephens </em>(Cal.App.); <em>People </em>v. <em>Vindiola </em>(Cal.App.); <em>People </em>v. <em>Isais </em>(Cal.App.).)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b501-9\">Reporter\u2019s Note: <em>People </em>v. <em>Reed </em>(S046378), for Supreme Court opinion see 13 Cal.4th 217; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stephens </em>(G015348), review granted July 20, 1995, and on July 11, 1996, review dismissed and cause remanded to Court of Appeal, Fourth Appellate District, Division Three; <em>People </em>v. <em>Vindiola </em>(F020792), review granted November 30, 1995, and on July 11, 1996, review dismissed and cause remanded to Court of Appeal, Fifth Appellate District; <em>People </em>v. <em>Isais </em>(H013166), review granted February 22, 1996, and on July 11, 1996, review dismissed and cause remanded to Court of Appeal, Sixth Appellate District.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b502-8\">We are unaware of any reported California decision holding a postjudgment document is part of the \u201crecord of proceedings\u201d for purpose of proving a prior conviction. <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 19 [256 Cal.Rptr. 16] is the only decision which arguably sanctions the use of such documents. However, in that case the court held a prior section 1203.01 statement was admissible to prove the elements of a prior California conviction without providing any analysis or specifically addressing the issue whether such document was part of the record of the proceedings. Moreover, even if <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>conclusion is correct, there is no showing in the record that Exhibit A is equivalent to a California section 1203.01 document.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b503-7\">In <em>Castellanos, </em>we held a preliminary hearing transcript was admissible as a hearsay exception in the context of proving prior convictions even though the statutory unavailability requirement was not met. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Castellanos, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1173-1174.) In so concluding, we emphasized the fact that at the prior preliminary hearing the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses to test their credibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
