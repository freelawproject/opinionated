J.\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"ASq\">This case presents the question whether the automatic stay resulting from plaintiffs\u2019 and appellants\u2019 bankruptcy petition precludes our disposition of this appeal. There is no California decisional authority directly on point. However, the federal circuit courts of appeals have held the automatic stay provision (11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a)(1)) is inapplicable to an appeal in a lawsuit <em>initiated by </em>the debtor (rather than <em>against </em>the debtor) in the lower court, regardless of the appellate posture of the case. We conclude the automatic stay provision is inapplicable because the debtors <em>commenced </em>this action in the superior court and have filed the notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">Jayendra A. Shah and Usha J. Shah, plaintiffs, filed this action alleging breach of contract and tort causes of action against Glendale Federal Bank and Verdugo Service Corporation. While the action was pending in the superior court, plaintiffs filed a petition under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. (11 U.S.C.) Thereafter, the superior court entered an order dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and denied their reconsideration motion. Plaintiffs appealed from those orders. Presently before us is plaintiffs\u2019 motion to \u201cdelay or extend\u201d the briefing on appeal due to the automatic stay resulting from the commencement by them of bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">Because we are applying a federal statute, we follow rules of statutory construction enunciated by the United States Supreme Court. In <em>Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. </em>v. <em>Bonjorno </em>(1990) 494 U.S. 827, 835 [108 L.Ed.2d 842, 852, 110 S.Ct. 1570], quoting from <em>Consumer Product Safety Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>GTE Sylvania </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 102, 108 [64 L.Ed.2d 766, 772, 100 S.Ct. 2051], the United States Supreme Court held: \u201cThe starting point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>for interpretation of a statute \u2018is the language of the statute itself. Absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.\u2019 \u201d (494 U.S. at p. 835 [108 L.Ed.2d at p. 852].) The United States Supreme Court has noted that \u201c. . . the statutory language controls its construction\u201d <em>(Ford Motor Credit Co. </em>v. <em>Cenance </em>(1981) 452 U.S. 155, 158, fn. 3 [68 L.Ed.2d 744, 749, 101 S.Ct. 2239]) and that \u201c \u2018[t]here is, of course, no more persuasive evidence of the purpose of a statute than the words by which the [Legislature undertook to give expression to its wishes.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Griffin </em>v. <em>Oceanic Contractors, Inc. </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 564, 571 [73 L.Ed.2d 973, 980-981, 102 S.Ct. 3245].) In interpreting a statute, the United States Supreme Court has noted: \u201c \u2018In expounding a statute, we must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy.\u2019 [Citations.] Our objective in a case such as this is to ascertain the congressional intent and give effect to the legislative will.\u201d <em>(Philbrook </em>v. <em>Glodgett </em>(1975) 421 U.S. 707, 713 [44 L.Ed.2d 525, 532-533, 95 S.Ct. 1893].) On another occasion, the court stated, \u201cWe do not, however, construe statutory phrases in isolation; we read statutes as a whole.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Morton </em>(1984) 467 U.S. 822, 828 [81 L.Ed.2d 680, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2769], fn. omitted.) Further, in interpreting a statute, the Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of avoiding: \u201cabsurd results\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Turkette </em>(1981) 452 U.S. 576, 580 [69 L.Ed.2d 246, 253, 101 S.Ct. 2524]); \u201c \u2018an odd result\u2019 \u201d <em>(Public Citizen </em>v. <em>Department of Justice </em>(1989) 491 U.S. 440, 454 [105 L.Ed.2d 377, 392, 109 S.Ct. 2558]); or \u201cunreasonable results whenever possible.\u201d <em>(American Tobacco Co. </em>v. <em>Patterson </em>(1982) 456 U.S. 63, 71 [71 L.Ed.2d 748, 757, 102 S.Ct. 1534].) Moreover, the Supreme Court has noted, \u201cJudicial perception that a particular result would be unreasonable may enter into the construction of ambiguous provisions, but cannot justify disregard of what Congress has plainly and intentionally provided.\u201d <em>(Commissioner </em>v. <em>Asphalt Products Co., Inc. </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 117, 121 [96 L.Ed.2d 97, 102, 107 S.Ct. 2275].) In <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Oceanic Contractors, Inc., supra, </em>458 U.S. at page 571 [73 L.Ed.2d at p. 981], the court stated: \u201cNevertheless, in rare cases the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters, and those intentions must be controlling .... [Citations.]\" When a statute is unambiguous, its language cannot \u201cbe expanded or contracted by the statements of individual legislators or committees during the course of the enactment process. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Casey </em>(1991) 499 U.S. 83, 98-99 [113 L.Ed.2d 68, 83, 111 S.Ct. 1138].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">We conclude the automatic stay is inapplicable to this appeal. First, we look to the language of title 11 of the United States Code, section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>362(a)(1) (section 362(a)(1)). <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc. </em>(1989) 489 U.S. 235, 240-241 [103 L.Ed.2d 290, 298, 109 S.Ct. 1026].) With respect to the scope of the automatic stay provision, the language of the statute is clear and there is no uncertainty as to the legislative intent. The statute states: \u201c(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a petition filed under section 301, 302, or 303 of this title, or an application filed under section 5(a)(3) of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970, operates as a stay, applicable to all entities, of\u2014 [*][] (1) the commencement or continuation, including the issuance of employment of process, of a judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding <em>against the debtor </em>that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the case under this title . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) California decisional authority holds, based on the plain language of section 362(a)(1), the automatic stay is inapplicable to superior court actions <em>initiated by </em>the debtor. <em>(Shorr </em>v. <em>Kind </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 249, 254-255 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 192] [the automatic stay provision is inapplicable to an action brought by the debtor]; <em>A. Groppe &amp; Sons Glass Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>(1991) 232 Cal.App.3d 220, 226-227 [283 Cal.Rptr. 352] [\u201ca cause of action brought <em>by the debtor </em>is not tolled by the Bankruptcy Act\u201d]; <em>Lauriton </em>v. <em>Carnation Co. </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 161, 164 [263 Cal.Rptr. 476] [\u201ca debtor\u2019s cause of action is not tolled by the filing of a bankruptcy petition\u201d]; <em>Danielson </em>v. <em>ITT Industrial Credit Co. </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 645, 652 [245 Cal.Rptr. 126] [\u201cnothing in the Bankruptcy Act tolls a debtor\u2019s cause of action\u201d].) However, those cases did not address the present issue\u2014the effect of the automatic bankruptcy stay on an <em>appeal </em>by plaintiff-debtors. Nonetheless, the logic of those opinions is equally applicable here\u2014plaintiffs commenced the present lawsuit. Defendants have not commenced or continued, to paraphrase the explicit language of section 362(a)(1), any judicial proceedings against plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">Second, the conclusion the automatic stay provision is inapplicable to suits brought by the debtor is consistent with the policy behind section 362(a)(1)\u2014protection of the debtor and of the creditors. As the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit explained in <em>Martin-Trigona </em>v. <em>Champion Fed. Sav. </em>(7th Cir. 1989) 892 F.2d 575, 577: \u201c[T]he policy behind the statute . . . is to protect the bankrupt\u2019s estate from being eaten away by creditors\u2019 lawsuits and seizures of property before the trustee has had a chance to marshal the estate\u2019s assets and distribute them equitably among the creditors.

Moreover, whether an action is \u201cagainst the debtor\u201d within the meaning of section 362(a)(1) is determined by the debtor\u2019s status at the inception of the action; regardless whether the debtor is the appellant or the respondent. <em>(Koolik </em>v. <em>Markowitz, supra, </em>40 F.3d at p. 568; <em>In re Berry Estates, supra, </em>812 F.2d at p. 71; <em>Teachers Ins. &amp; Annuity Ass\u2019n of America </em>v. <em>Butler </em>(2d Cir. 1986) 803 F.2d 61, 64-65; <em>Commerzanstalt </em>v. <em>Telewide Systems, Inc., supra, </em>790 F.2d at p. 207; Assoc, <em>of St. Croix Condo.

This is because the appeal is a <em>continuation, </em>within the meaning of section 362(a)(1), of an action <em>brought by </em>the debtor; rather than <em>against </em>the debtor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit has held: \u201cAn appeal is indisputably a continuation of a judicial action or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>proceeding, . . <em>(Commerzanstalt </em>v. <em>Telewide Systems, Inc., supra, </em>790 F.2d at p. 207; <em>Cathey </em>v. <em>Johns-Manville Sales Corp., supra, </em>711 F.2d at p. 61.) In <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Bain, supra, </em>68 F.3d at page 1138, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held a plaintiff-debtor\u2019s appeal from the dismissal of its action for breach of fiduciary duty and declaratory relief against the Bank of America was not stayed as the claim was by, not against, the debtor. <em>Alpern </em>v. <em>Lieb </em>(7th Cir. 1993) 11 F.3d 689, 689, involved a plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the dismissal of his suit in the district court. While the appeal was pending, the plaintiff filed a bankruptcy petition. He then moved to stay the appeal pursuant to the automatic stay provision. The court of appeals held: \u201cThe appeal from the dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s suit is not subject to the automatic stay, because the suit was filed by rather than against the debtor.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 690.) The District of Columbia Circuit reached the same conclusion in <em>Carley Capital Group </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company, supra, </em>889 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>F.2d at pages 1126-1127. Plaintiff insureds had appealed from an adverse judgment in their action against their insurer. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1127.) While the appeal was pending, the plaintiffs were forced into involuntary bankruptcy. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1126.) The court of appeals held the automatic stay, provision had no effect on the disposition of the appeal. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1127.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">In the present case, the debtors are the plaintiffs who initiated this action in the superior court. The continuation of that action by way of this appeal is not \u201cagainst the debtor\u201d and is not subject to the automatic stay resulting from plaintiffs\u2019 bankruptcy. Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 motion to \u201cdelay or extend\u201d the briefing on appeal due to the automatic stay in bankruptcy is denied. The opening brief is due in 20 days.
