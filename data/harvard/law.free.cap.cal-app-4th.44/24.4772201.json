J.\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">\n<em>Introduction and Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">In <em>Carty </em>v. <em>American States Ins. Co. </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 399, 402-403 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 1], this court rejected the idea that the words \u201clatent defect,\u201d as used in a homeowners insurance policy, only applied to some undetected defect in construction materials, and did not apply to faulty design or shoddy workmanship. In <em>Carty </em>we also held that because certain defects in the construction of the foundation of a home were \u201cneither readily observable nor apparent on reasonable inspection,\u201d those defects were latent, and therefore the loss they caused was not covered under an insurance policy which specifically excluded loss due to latent defect. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 404.) In the process, we specifically declined to follow an Illinois appellate court opinion, <em>Mattis </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. </em>(1983) 118 Ill.App.3d 612 [73 Ill.Dec. 907, 454 N.E.2d 1156, 41 A.L.R.4th 1082], which involved the defective design or construction of a basement retaining wall. <em>Mattis </em>observed that \u201cthe great majority of the cases\u201d limited the meaning of \u201clatent defect\u201d to inherent defects in <em>just </em>the construction materials, and only then when the defect \u201ccould not be discovered by any known or customary test.\u201d Latent defects would thus not include \u201cdefective construction\u201d such as faulty design or shoddy workmanship. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1162.)</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">The present case, like <em>Mattis, </em>also involves loss to a retaining wall. Here, the parking area retaining wall at an apartment complex in Monterey Park is leaning and cracking. Martha Scott, owner of the complex, requested her insurer to pay for repairs; the insurer, The Continental Insurance Company, has denied the claim because of the latent defect exclusion in the policy. Scott sued Continental, and Continental obtained a summary judgment based on stipulated facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>The most significant facts are these. After Scott made her claim, the insurance company hired a geotechnical consulting firm to ascertain the cause of the distress to the wall. The consulting firm reviewed the permits, grading records and geotechnical documents, observed and mapped the distress to the wall, made borings in the parking area adjacent to the wall, hand-dug test pits along the toe of the retaining wall, prepared a geotechnical map, and tested soil and bedrock samples in the laboratory for moisture content. After all this work, plus more than 10 pages of abstruse mathematical calculations, the consulting firm (whose findings were accepted by the parties as true for purposes of a summary judgment motion) concluded that the wall was not designed for the actual pressures being exerted by the existing backfill. The wall was most likely designed to withstand 30 pounds per cubic foot equivalent fluid pressure; the actual pressure now being exerted is 44 pounds per square foot, and, with a lack of adequate drainage, can go as high as 62.4 pounds per square foot. The excessive pressure is enough to cause the wall to crack at its foundation and begin to lean downslope. Eventually, as the reinforcing steel in the wall rusts, the wall will fail.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Scott did not realize the cause of the cracking until the expert\u2019s report. Her insurance policy listed as an exclusion \u201cLoss caused by . . . inherent or latent defect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">If we were only to look at <em>Carty, </em>we would affirm the judgment in an unpublished opinion. After all, if it took 10 pages of calculations made by an expert to figure out that the wall was defective, it would seem that the defect was most certainly \u201clatent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">A year or so after <em>Carty, </em>however, <em>Chadwick </em>v. <em>Fire Ins. Exchange </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1112 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 871], rejected the idea that defects discoverable only by expert examination were per se latent. The <em>Chadwick </em>court noted that <em>Carty </em>(and two federal cases preceding it<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>) relied on a test\u2014whether the defects were \u201creadily observable\u201d or \u201capparent on reasonable inspection\u201d\u2014derived from <em>Acme Galvanizing Co. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 170 [270 Cal.Rptr. 405]. <em>Acme </em>had derived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>the test from the statute of limitations dealing with construction defect suits against builders.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">According to <em>Chadwick, </em>the flaw in the <em>Acme Galvanizing </em>standard (and, by extension, its use in Carty) was that statutes of limitations are construed in exactly the opposite direction as insurance policy exclusions. To protect consumers, \u201clatent\u201d is given a broad definition in the statute of limitations context, while, as a term in an insurance policy exclusion, it must necessarily be given a narrow one. In the wake of <em>Chadwick, </em>Scott now challenges <em>Carty </em>as mistaken. In essence, she asks us to rethink the latent defect issue. We accept the invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">In sum, we agree with <em>Chadwick </em>that the \u201cneither readily observable nor apparent on reasonable inspection\" standard articulated in <em>Acme Galvanizing </em>and later used by <em>Carty is </em>flawed. It does not comport with the ordinary sense of the word \u201clatent.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">We also agree with <em>Chadwick </em>that there can be no rule to the effect that a defect discoverable \u201conly\u201d by an expert is automatically latent. The ordinary sense of the word latent contemplates a hypothetical inspection of \u201csearching\u201d intensity, and not every expert inspection necessarily rises to that level.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">We disagree, however, with the line of out-of-state cases discussed in <em>Chadwick </em>which holds that latent defects can never be construction or design defects. Such a conclusion is both contrary to the ordinary sense of the word \u201cdefect\u201d and contrary to well-established California law.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">And in the process, we also disagree with the suggestion in those cases that a \u201clatent\u201d defect can only be one which is not discoverable by <em>any </em>test. Again, such a rule does not comport with the ordinary sense of the word \u201cdefect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">Putting our conclusions together, the bottom line is that the summary judgment must be reversed. The papers did not establish the necessity for an inspection of \u201csearching\u201d intensity.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">A <em>Latent Defect Is One Which Is Both Not Readily Observable and Not Discoverable to Any but the Most Searching Inspection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">Words in an insurance policy, unless given special meanings by the policy itself, must be understood in their ordinary sense. (E.g., <em>Waller </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number><em>Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1, 18 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619]; <em>Reserve Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Pisciotta </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 800, 807 [180 Cal.Rptr. 628, 640 P.2d 764].) In seeking to ascertain the ordinary sense of words, courts in insurance cases regularly turn to general dictionaries. <em>(A.B.S. Clothing Collection, Inc. </em>v. <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>(1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 1470, 1480 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 166] [using dictionary to determine ordinary meaning of \u201ccumulate\u201d]; <em>Shell Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 715, 745 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 815] [using dictionary as source for ordinary meaning of \u201cintend\u201d]; <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 1199, 1202 [208 Cal.Rptr. 5] [using dictionary to determine meaning of \u201caccidental\u201d in its \u201cplain and ordinary\u201d sense].)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Likewise, courts in noninsurance contexts turn to general dictionaries when they seek to ascertain the \u201cordinary\u201d meaning of words used in a statute. (E.g., <em>River Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Public Util. Com. </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 244, 247 [42 Cal.Rptr. 104, 398 P.2d 144] [using dictionary, among other sources, to show \u201cordinary concept of a carrier\u201d under public utilities statute]; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 357, 364-365 [150 Cal.Rptr. 216] [using dictionary to ascertain \u201cfailure\u201d and \u201cinability\u201d as used in drunk driving statute]; <em>Standard Oil Co. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 765, 768 [114 Cal.Rptr. 571] [using dictionary to ascertain ordinary meaning of \u201cmains,\u201d \u201clines,\u201d and \u201cpipes\u201d under tax statute]; see also <em>E.W. Bliss Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1254, 1258, in. 2 [258 Cal.Rptr. 783] [\u201cA dictionary is a proper source to determine the usual and ordinary meaning of a word or phrase in a statute\u201d]; but compare <em>People </em>v. <em>Buese </em>(1963) 220 Cal.App.2d 802, 806 [34 Cal.Rptr. 102] [asserting that dictionary definition of \u201cdrug\u201d marked \u201cthe outer limits of reason-ability\u201d for purposes of a penal statute] with <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1934) 1 Cal.App.2d Supp. 761, 765 [32 P.2d 445] [using dictionary definition of \u201cdrug\u201d to find its \u201cusual, natural and ordinary sense\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Indeed, courts in both insurance and noninsurance contexts regularly use the phrase \u201cordinary dictionary definition [or meaning]\u201d as if \u201cordinary\u201d were synonymous with \u201cdictionary.\u201d (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1968) 70 Cal.2d 15, 26 [73 Cal.Rptr. 550, 447 P.2d 942] [\u201cwe find no indication that the Legislature intended to give the words \u2018deliberate\u2019 and \u2018premeditated\u2019 other than their ordinary dictionary meanings\u201d]; <em>Ponder </em>v. <em>Blue Cross of Southern California </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 709, 722 [193 Cal.Rptr. 632] [\u201c. . . the rest of that definition is consistent with the ordinary dictionary definition of the term \u2018dental\u2019 \u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Orabuena </em>(1976) 56 Cal.App.3d 540, 545 [128 Cal.Rptr. 474] [\u201cThe words \u2018deliberate\u2019 and \u2018premeditated\u2019 are not words of art, but are to be construed in their ordinary dictionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>meaning\u201d].) It is thus safe to say that the \u201cordinary\u201d sense of a word is to be found in its dictionary definition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Sometimes the \u201cordinary dictionary\u201d meaning of a word coincides with its statutory definition. (E.g., <em>AIU Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807, 828 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253] [\u201c. . . we take the statutory and dictionary definitions described above to be the \u2018ordinary and popular\u2019 definition of \u2018damages\u2019 for interpretation purposes\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Then again, sometimes it does not. The statutory definition of \u201clatent deficiency\u201d found in section 337.15 of the Code of Civil Procedure, for example, (\u201ca deficiency which is not apparent by reasonable inspection\u201d) begins with the introductory clause, \u201c[a]s used in this section,\u201d indicating that its authors were articulating a specialized definition for specific purposes. Yet the court in <em>Acme Galvanizing </em>plucked the definition of latent deficiency from the statute merely because the definition \u201cprovided] a useful standard.\u201d <em>(Acme Galvanizing Co. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 178.) The court did not say why it was \u201cuseful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">\u201cReasonable inspection\u201d is a fairly easy definition for courts to apply, and if we were drafting an insurance contract on behalf of an insurer, we would see the merit of specially defining latent defect the way the Code of Civil Procedure does. But we cannot escape the rule that words in an insurance policy are to be construed in their ordinary sense, even if that sense provides a definition a little less tidy than some litigants, and perhaps the courts, might desire.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When ordinary people do not understand the meaning of a word, they do not turn to the Code of Civil Procedure. They turn to a dictionary. We thus agree with Chadwick\u2019s criticism of <em>Acme Galvanizing\u2019&amp; </em>\u201creasonable inspection\u201d formula as rooted in the wrong source. (See <em>Chadwick </em>v. <em>Fire Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1123-1124.)</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Still, as happened in <em>AIU Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 807, a statutory meaning and a dictionary meaning may be coterminous. Just because <em>Acme Galvanizing </em>looked to the wrong source for the meaning of latent defect does not mean it still might not have come up with the right answer, if only by coincidence. So we now examine the dictionary definition of the critical words.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The word \u201clatent\u201d derives from the Latin word which means \u201cto lie hidden,\u201d and is akin to an ancient German word for den or lair, an ancient Norse word for deceit, a Greek word for escaping notice, and an old Slavic word for lying in wait. While Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary gives a myriad of usage examples, it provides but two basic definitions, with several variations of the first basic definition. The first definition is \u201cexisting in hidden, dormant, or repressed form,\u201d as, for example, in the phrase that someone\u2019s \u201csinister qualities, formerly latent, quickened into life.\u201d A variation on that is \u201cpresent or capable of living or developing in a host without producing visible symptoms of disease,\u201d as in \u201ca latent virus.\u201d A final variation pertains simply to fingerprints: <em>\u201cof a fingerprint, </em>obtained at the scene of a crime and usu[ally] scarcely visible but capable of being developed for study,\u201d as in the \u201csearch for latent prints.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The second basic definition is merely, \u201cconcealed, disguised.\u201d But then the dictionary elaborates. \u201cLatent applies to that which is submerged and not clearly apparent or certainly present <em>to any but a most searching examination </em>but may emerge and develop with effect and significance.\u201d (Webster\u2019s Third New Intemat. Diet. (1979) p. 1275, italics added.) An example is Dickens\u2019s line about \u201c \u2018the <em>latent </em>uneasiness in Damay\u2019s mind [being] roused to vigorous life by this letter.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Two central ideas emerge from the definitions. First, if something is latent one cannot see it. One might be able to discover it, but it is not\u2014to use a phrase that fairly leaps from the dictionary definition\u2014\u201creadily observable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Second, the difficulty of discovering whether a defect is \u201clatent\u201d must be substantial. A latent quality cannot be detected with merely a cursory inspection. Something which is latent is not apparent \u201cto any but a most searching examination.\u201d It takes hard work to develop fingerprints or detect a hidden virus.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">We may now draw our first conclusion. The sense of \u201clatent\u201d as discoverable if sufficient efforts are exerted compels us to reject <em>Mattis </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>other cases to the degree they restrict the latent defect exclusion to defects that \u201ccould not be discovered by any known or customary test.\u201d <em>(Mattis v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., supra, </em>454 N.E.2d at p. 1162, citing <em>Plaza Equities Corp. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty. &amp; Surety Co. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1974) 372 F.Supp. 1325; <em>Essex House </em>v. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co. </em>(S.D. Ohio 1975) 404 F.Supp. 978; <em>General American Transp. Corp. </em>v. <em>Sun Insurance Office, Ltd. </em>(E.D.Tenn. 1965) 239 F.Supp. 844.) Not discoverable by <em>any </em>test simply does not comport with the idea that a \u201cmost searching examination\u201d <em>can </em>reveal it (as, e.g., with fingerprints).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">A tougher question, however, is whether this sense of something that is apparent only by the \u201cmost searching\u201d efforts corresponds with the \u201creasonable inspection\u201d formula enunciated in <em>Acme Galvanizing </em>and followed in <em>Carty. </em>Do \u201cmost searching\u201d efforts extend beyond \u201creasonable\u201d efforts? Instinctually, there is at least something to be said for the idea that \u201cmost searching\u201d efforts and \u201creasonable efforts\u201d are, as the British say, pretty much of a muchness. After all, practically nothing in Anglo-American law countenances unreasonable anything, much less <em>requires </em>it as part of a definition. In rethinking the issue of latent defect, can it not be said that the test used in <em>Acme Galvanizing </em>and <em>Carty </em>is the substantial equivalent of the dictionary\u2019s standard?</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">No. That would be a little like a nation which wages a foreign war, and, after having lost every battle, decides to declare victory and go home. The action does not meet the substance of the problem. Reasonable is <em>not </em>a synonym for \u201cmost searching.\u201d \u201cA most searching examination\u201d conveys a special sense of intensity not always inherent in the word \u201creasonable.\u201d Simply put, \u201creasonable inspections\u201d may not <em>always </em>be \u201cintense\u201d or \u201cmost searching.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The <em>Acme Galvanizing </em>test is thus incomplete, because it lacks the sense of intensity an ordinary person would expect. We therefore agree with <em>Chadwick </em>in its rejection of the test to the extent it would make \u201clatent\u201d a defect which is not apparent on merely a \u201creasonable\u201d inspection. To put the matter in terms of, say, a jury instruction: A latent defect is one which is both <em>not readily observable </em>and <em>not discoverable to any but the most searching examination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">\n<em>Defects Discoverable Only by Expert Examination Are Not Automatically \u201cLatent\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">Intuitively, it would seem that if a construction defect is only discoverable by an \u201cexpert\u201d examination it is most certainly \u201clatent.\u201d Surely, one might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>ask, if it takes some geotechnician or soils expert (the sort of person who understands the difference, for example, between sandy clay and clayey sand) to figure out that a contractor goofed, the defect is \u201clatent\u201d as an ordinary person would understand the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The problem with this intuitive line of reasoning is that the ordinary dictionary definition of the word focuses on the intensity of the hypothetical inspection, not who conducts it. In the light of that definition, the expert versus nonexpert distinction is what the logicians call a false dichotomy. Perhaps it is true that <em>most </em>inspections conducted by experts will be sufficiently \u201csearching\u201d to be reasonably described as \u201cmost searching.\u201d In the case before us, for example, there can be absolutely no doubt that the defect in the retaining wall did indeed become apparent after a \u201cmost searching examination.\u201d Reviewing permits, grading records and geotechnical documents, mapping out wall distress, boring through parking areas, digging test pits, testing dirt and working out 10 pages of mathematical equations represents a great deal of effort indeed to unearth the cause of a loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">But it is a logical flaw to assume that just because experts <em>conducted </em>a most searching inspection for defects that the defects were <em>only </em>discoverable by a most searching inspection. We cannot say, as a matter of law, that every expert inspection automatically is \u201ca most searching one\u201d nor that, even if a \u201cmost searching\u201d inspection was employed, an inspection of such scope was necessarily required to discover the defect. It is possible to imagine instances where a defect is not readily observable, but is still apparent to an expert\u2019s <em>cursory </em>examination and therefore not latent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, we agree with <em>Chadwick </em>that \u201cdefects discoverable only by expert examination\u201d are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>\u201cper se latent.\u201d (See <em>Chadwick </em>v. <em>Fire Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1122-1125 and particularly p. 1125.)</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\n<em>Latent Defects Include Defects in Design and Construction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">After canvassing a series of out-of-state cases predating <em>Acme Galvanizing</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the <em>Chadwick </em>court observed that those cases restricted the scope of latent defect and inherent vice exclusions to flaws or deficiencies in the materials used, such that \u201cfaulty design or construction is deemed not to come within the exclusions.\u201d <em>(Chadwick </em>v. <em>Fire Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th at p. 1121.) There is, however, a question as to whether the <em>Chadwick </em>court really endorsed the idea. In specific terms the case <em>held </em>that cracks in the interior sheetrock of a home largely due to the substitution of floor trusses for joists, together with \u201cnumerous deficiencies in the design and construction of the house\u2019s floor plan and frame\u201d created a triable issue of fact as to whether \u201ca reasonable expert inspection\u201d at the time the insurance policy was issued \u201cwould have revealed the defects causing [the] homeowners\u2019 loss and, hence, as to whether the defects came within the exclusion for latent defect or inherent vice.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1115 &amp; 1126.) Thus even though the record before the court precluded summary judgment in favor of the insurer, the court seemed to leave open the possibility that \u201cdeficiencies in design and construction\u201d <em>might </em>yet come within the exclusion if they fell outside the purview of a \u201creasonable expert inspection.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>In any event, the materials-versus-design-and-construction dichotomy discussed in <em>Chadwick </em>is just as false as the layperson-expert dichotomy we have discussed above. There is nothing in the word \u201cdefect\u201d (as in \u201clatent defect\u201d) to restrict it to just structural deficiencies in materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">\u201cDefect,\u201d when used as a noun, is a general term. It is \u201can <em>irregularity </em>in a surface or a structure that spoils the appearance or causes weakness or failure: fault, flaw . . . want or absence of <em>something </em>necessary for completeness, perfection, or adequacy in form or function: deficiency, weakness \u2014as opposed to excess.\u201d (Webster\u2019s Third New Internat. Diet., <em>supra, </em>at p. 590, italics added.) Examples of usage given by the dictionary are phrases like \u201ca moral defect in his nature,\u201d \u201cseveral defects can be found in this argument,\u201d and \u201ca defect in his hearing.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Nothing suggests a limitation to just materials or structure. Faults, flaws and irregularities can be the result of design or faulty construction just as much as mere weakness of material.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Moreover, to restrict the word to just materials not only unnaturally constricts its meaning to something less than its ordinary sense,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> but runs contrary to the well-established view that contractor negligence can, indeed, be a <em>cause </em>of first party loss. (See <em>Garvey </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 395, 408 [257 Cal.Rptr. 292, 770 P.2d 704] [rejecting contention that third party negligence of a contractor is not a covered peril].) Contractor negligence often extends to poor workmanship or design, as distinct from the selection of poor quality materials in which there is some inherent propensity for structural failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Finally, from the viewpoint of reasonable expectations the distinction makes no sense. A retaining wall might buckle because it was made of low-quality materials, or it might buckle because someone forgot reinforcing steel, or did not design it to withstand the backfill. An insured looking at the ordinary meaning of \u201cdefect\u201d would have no reason to distinguish among the possible causes. Thus to the degree that <em>Chadwick </em>may (arguably) stand for a per se rule that design and construction flaws cannot fall into the latent defect exclusion, we must respectfully part company.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number><em>Summary Judgment </em>Was <em>Not Appropriate on This Record Because There Was Insufficient Evidence as to the Intensity of Inspection Necessary to Determine the Cause of the Loss</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">As mentioned above, we have no doubt that the examination which was actually performed by the geotechnical consultants was of the \u201cmost searching\u201d variety. There are, however, some missing gaps in the evidence which preclude affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">In a word, while we know what <em>was </em>done to thoroughly study the defects after their discovery here, we do not know what was <em>needed </em>to be done to merely detect them. The record does not reveal the intensity of inspection (expert or no expert) that was necessary at the time the policy was issued to reveal the cause of any loss to the retaining wall.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> All the record reveals is that Scott <em>herself </em>was not aware of the cause of her loss until the geotechnical consultants\u2019 report, and the consultants went to considerable efforts to identify the defect. We do not know whether a more cursory examination at the time the policy was issued might have revealed the cause, <em>either </em>by Scott or an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">We decline to draw the inference that because Scott did not actually discover the cause until the expert\u2019s report that she could not have discovered it earlier, or that the cause of her loss might not have been ascertainable upon a less-than-searching examination. There are other explanations not precluded by the record. Perhaps she is an absentee landlord who never inspects her own property. Perhaps she never actually looked at the wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">At the most, the summary judgment motion here was premature; at the least, additional evidence might show that the defect was obvious upon a less than \u201csearching\u201d inspection, and therefore not latent at all. Either way, we cannot affirm.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The trial court determined that on the record before it the latent defect exclusion applied to Scott\u2019s loss as a matter of law. The judgment to that effect is reversed. Scott is to recover her costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Wallin, J., and Rylaarsdam, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Here is the summation of the consultants\u2019 findings in their own words: \u201cOur findings indicate that the wall most probably was not designed for the actual loads that have developed from the existing backfill. This has probably caused the wall to crack at its stem and then lean downslope. The wall loads can be reduced or the wall can be replaced. The wall can be expected to continue to fail.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b39-8\"><em>Tzung </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire and Cas.

Co., supra, </em>404 F.Supp. at page 992, the court observed that \u201c[n]othing more than a simple visual inspection of the Essex House and the construction plans would have been sufficient to detect the shoddy building techniques employed therein.\u201d We may leave for another day the question of whether the effort required to obtain building plans, and the expertise required to decipher them, would amount to a sufficiently \u201csearching\u201d examination under California law. However, there is a fictional example which is on \u201call fours\u201d as to whether a defect may be discovered by a mere cursory examination by an expert. It is from a humorous story entitled <em>The Builders </em>by John Cleese and Connie Booth:</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">The owners of a hotel, a married couple, desire to renovate the lobby by putting a new door through to their kitchen and block off an existing door to a drawing room. To save money, the husband hires a contractor named O\u2019Reilly, who is totally incompetent. After an initial misunderstanding about the nature of the job (O\u2019Reilly manages to block off all access to the kitchen), he hurries to put things to right before the wife arrives back from a golf excursion. Miraculously he completes the job. It looks fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">An <em>expert </em>building contractor named Stubbs arrives. The wife, apropos her low opinion of O\u2019Reilly, comments that the work will probably \u201call fall down by lunch time,\u201d and the husband, rather too smug that the bargain-basement contractor O\u2019Reilly has performed so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>well, retorts (with a pride-goes-before-the-fall confidence), \u201cWell, let\u2019s ask a real <em>exper\u00f1 </em>Do <em>you </em>think it\u2019ll all fall down by lunch, Mr Stubbs?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Initially judging by just what was readily observable, the expert Stubbs declares \u201cIt\u2019s a very good job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">The husband then shows Stubbs where the new door was knocked through and the old one was blocked off. Stubbs casually asks what was used for the lintel (the horizontal beam which usually carries the load of everything above a door)\u2014an iron girder or something made of concrete? The husband is forced to answer that a wooden one was used.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">The jig is up. The expert realizes the implications of the defect. \u201cBut that\u2019s a supporting wall! .... It could give way any moment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">The husband is last seen striding out of the hotel, carrying a garden gnome, cap pointing outward, looking for O\u2019Reilly. (Cleese &amp; Booth, <em>The Builders, </em>in The Complete Fawlty Towers (1988) at pp. 27-48, and particularly pp. 45 &amp; 47, original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">In <em>The Builders, </em>the expert\u2019s \u201cexamination\u201d is cursory indeed. One look at the wall and one casual question by an expert and the defect is revealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b46-12\">In addition to <em>Plaza Equities, Essex House, </em>and <em>General American Transp. </em>already mentioned, the <em>Chadwick </em>court discussed <em>Mellon </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1926) 14 F.2d 997 and <em>Employer\u2019s Casualty Company </em>v. <em>Holm </em>(Tex.Civ.App. 1965) 393 S.W.2d 363.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b46-13\">See <em>Chadwick </em>v. <em>Fire Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th at page 1126. By framing the question in terms of \u201creasonable expert examination,\u201d the <em>Chadwick </em>court appears to have itself fallen into the \u201creasonableness\u201d trap. (See fn. 5, <em>ante, </em>p. 30.) Perhaps most examinations which are conducted by experts are indeed of the \u201cmost searching\u201d variety. Even so, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>related above, the idea of a most searching inspection does not automatically entail an \u201cexpert\u201d examination at all. It is the nature of construction defects that each case must be judged by careful attention to its own peculiar facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b47-11\">While ambiguities are classically construed against insurers, courts must not strain to create ambiguity by artificially reducing the ordinary scope of words. To use \u201cdefect\u201d to mean <em>only </em>weakness of physical materials is to use the word more as a term of art rather than in its ordinary sense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b48-8\"><em>Chadwick </em>never discussed in detail the question of when a defect is \u201clatent\u201d for purposes of the exclusion, but a moment\u2019s reflection demonstrates that the time of the hypothetical inspection must be, as the <em>Chadwick </em>court stated, when the policy was issued. (See <em>Chadwick </em>v. <em>Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>at p. 1126.) After all, that is when the insurer assumed the risk of loss to the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b48-9\">The Chadwick court noted there is a direct relationship between the general doctrine in insurance law that a loss must be fortuitous to be insurable (see Ins. Code, \u00a7 22) and the latent defect exclusion. (See <em>Chadwick </em>v. <em>Fire Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th at p. 1119, citing Hecker &amp; Goode, <em>Wear and Tear, Inherent Vice, Deterioration, etc.: the Multi-Faceted All-Risk Exclusions </em>(1986) 21 Tort &amp; Ins. L. J. 634, 634-635, 638-640.) It appears that the latent defect and inherent vice exclusions are attempts to embody, in the text of the policy, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>need for fortuity. (See <em>Compagnie Des Bauxites </em>v. <em>Ins. Co. of No. America </em>(W.D.Pa. 1983) 554 F.Supp. 1080, 1084 [\u201cThe law is quite clear that an insurer is not liable for losses resulting from inherent vice, defect or infirmity in the subject matter insured, for this type of loss is not caused by chance or an extraneous event.\u201d].) The idea is that damage from an \u201cinherent cause\u201d is, like wear and tear, a \u201ccertainty,\u201d and therefore \u201cuninsurable.\u201d (See <em>Chadwick </em>v. <em>Fire Ins. Exchange, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th at p. 1119.) However, because the parties have not briefed the effect of the fortuity doctrine on this loss, we express no opinion on the question of whether the fortuity doctrine, to the degree that it may be separable from its embodiment in the latent defect exclusion, precludes coverage in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
