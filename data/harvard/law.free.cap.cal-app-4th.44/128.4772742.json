There is no specific legislative directive by which to resolve this issue. However, we conclude the WCAB had jurisdiction to impose the penalty as it did in this case. Our conclusion is based on the Legislature\u2019s definition of IDL as identical with temporary disability indemnity (TD) under the Labor Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Gov. Code, \u00a7 19870, subd. (a)), the Board\u2019s unquestioned jurisdiction of TD which is also available to an injured state employee, the Board\u2019s construction of its authority which is not clearly erroneous, the Legislature\u2019s salutary general purpose in authorizing the penalty in cases of unreasonably delayed payment, and the requirement that statutory enactments pertaining to workers\u2019 compensation are to be construed liberally in favor of the injured worker. Thus, we affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">\n<em>Nature of Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">The order in question was made in connection with a grant of reconsideration by the Board at the request of the State Compensation Insurance Fund (SCIF) and the state agency employer of the injured state worker.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The order\u2019s specific nature is important in the resolution of the jurisdictional issue. The order is that while WCAB does not have jurisdiction to award IDL, since jurisdiction to make such an award lies with the state\u2019s Department of Personnel Administration (DPA), it does have jurisdiction to award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>a penalty based on the lesser amount of TD (\u00a7\u00a7 3201-6002, 6100-6149) that would be due for the seven-and-one-half-month period of temporary disability and as a result of the state employer\u2019s not having paid any benefit to the worker for the temporary disability until nearly four months after the Board made the award. The amended findings on reconsideration thus provided, in pertinent part:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cThe injury caused temporary disability for the period April 27, 1992 through January 14, 1993, for which indemnity is payable in accordance with Government Code section 19871, <em>plus </em>a <em>10% [penalty] </em>against <em>that amount which would have been payable as temporary disability indemnity during that period, </em>for the unreasonable delay in payment, less credit for such payments previously made.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\n<em>Summary of Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">After suffering stress in her job as a correctional officer, a position she had held for nearly six years, Ellison asked the warden for a leave of absence, which was refused. In April 1992, Ellison filed a claim, which SCIF denied in July after a medical examination. Ellison obtained some treatment and did not work the remainder of 1992 except for three days in October, the month she retained an attorney. In February 1993, she had an examination, the results of which were reported to her attorney in April 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">In June 1993, Ellison filed her application for adjudication of claim. After two hearings before the workers\u2019 compensation judge, in January 1994, an award was made based on findings of temporary (as well as permanent<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>) disability plus medical treatment and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">On March 28, 1994, the parties stipulated to amend the full salary award for the entire seven-and-one-half-month period of temporary disability to provide instead, consistent with the IDL provisions of Government Code section 19871, that Ellison is entitled to full salary for only the first 22 days of disability and to two-thirds of gross salary thereafter for the remainder of the disability period ending January 14, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">On April 4, and again on May 6, 1994, Ellison demanded SCIF pay the full amount due under the stipulation and award, noting that the $2,984 already paid apparently was attributable to the award for permanent disability, and she had not been paid the amount due for IDL for the period April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>27, 1992, to January 14, 1993. The May 6 demand also requested SCIF to issue a 10 percent penalty. On May 9, 1994, before this proceeding seeking penalties was filed, SCIF paid the amount due for IDL, and the parties so stipulated in the penalties proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">On May 24, 1994, Ellison commenced these proceedings before the Board under sections 5814 and 5814.5, relating to penalties, for payment of benefits pursuant to the award. In January 1995, after points and authorities were filed and additional exhibits were received, the workers\u2019 compensation judge filed a supplemental opinion, findings and award stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">\u201c[T]he defendant has never since the initial Finding &amp; Award of January 14, 1994 disputed that applicant was entitled to temporary disability for the period of 4-27-92 through 1-14-93 which, even at $336.00 per week, if nothing else, is approximately $12,000.00. The dispute was over what weekly benefit was appropriate, be it full pay for the whole period or 22 days of full pay and 2/3 pay thereafter per Government Code 19871. [U This dispute was supposedly solved [by] the stipulated joint/amended Finding &amp; Award of March 28, 1994. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">\u201cHowever, despite the original Finding &amp; Award, despite this Joint Amended Finding &amp; Award the temporary disability was finally paid to the applicant only ... on 5-9-94 or some 115 days after the Finding &amp; Award and some 42 days after the Amended Award of 3-28-94.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">\u201c. . . [T]here is no excuse for this delay in payment of temporary disability per Government Code section 19871 for which the penalty should be 10% for the entire period. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">On SCIF\u2019s petition for reconsideration, the Board upheld the award of a penalty by the workers\u2019 compensation judge. The Board held, however, the penalty could only be calculated on the basis of the TD amount that would have been due during the disability period, not on the amount of the IDL payable for that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">This writ of review proceeding followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\n<em>General Applicability of Workers\u2019 Compensation to State Workers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">With respect to workers\u2019 compensation benefits generally, the state and every state agency is an \u201cemployer\u201d for purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u00a7 3300), and state workers come within the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d as persons \u201cin the service of an employer under any appointment or contract of hire or apprenticeship, express or implied, oral or written . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 3351.) In addition, \u201cThe State and each county, city, district, and public agency thereof and all State institutions are conclusively presumed to have elected to come within the provisions of this division as to all employments otherwise excluded from this division.\u201d (\u00a7 4155.)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The state insures against its liability for compensation with SCIF pursuant to certain provisions of the Insurance Code. (See Ins. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11870, 11871, 11873; and see \u00a7 3700 [\u201cEvery employer except the state shall secure the payment of compensation . . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">\n<em>The IDL Benefit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">\u201c \u2018Industrial disability leave\u2019 <em>means temporary disability as defined in Divisions 4 </em>(commencing with Section 3201) <em>and 4.5 </em>(commencing with Section 6100) <em>of the Labor Code </em>and includes any period in which the disability is permanent and stationary and the disabled employee is undergoing vocational rehabilitation.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 19870, subd. (a), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">The IDL benefit applies to state officers and employees other than \u201cstate safety\u201d class employees who are provided for by the special workers\u2019 compensation payments provisions of article 6 (commencing with section 4800), chapter 2, part 2, division 4. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 19869 [\u201cThis article does not apply to state officers and employees who are included in the provisions of Article 6 [\u00a7 4800 et seq.] of Chapter 2 of Part 2 of Division 4 of the Labor Code.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">The IDL benefit, in existence since July 1974 (former Gov. Code, \u00a7 18120 et seq.; Stats. 1974, ch. 374, \u00a7 2.5, p. 735, urgency statute, operative July 1, 1974, repealed 1981, see now Gov. Code, \u00a7 19869), provides a temporary disability benefit in an amount ordinarily greater than the amount available under TD and \u201cfor a period not exceeding 52 weeks within two years from the first day of disability.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 19871, subd. (a).) For this period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>of up to 52 weeks, the IDL amount is full pay (less ordinary deductions)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for the first 22 working days of disability and two-thirds of full pay for the remainder of the period. <em>(Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em>) </em>An employee receiving IDL may elect to supplement the payments after the 22d working day with accrued leave credits in an amount necessary to approximate the employee\u2019s full net pay. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 19872, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">While collecting IDL the injured state employee continues to receive all employee benefits. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 19871.1.) However, unless the employee elects to supplement the IDL with accrued leave credits after the 22d day, the employee may not receive paid sick leave, annual leave or TD. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 19872, subds. (a) and (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Payment of IDL is contingent on complete medical certification of the illness or injury, including diagnosis and prognosis for recovery, and contingent on the employee\u2019s agreement to cooperate and participate in a reasonable and appropriate vocational rehabilitation plan when furnished by the state subject to appropriate medical approval as determined by the DPA. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 19876, subd. (a), 19876.5.) The retraining and rehabilitation provisions of division 4.7 (commencing with section 6200) of the Labor Code do not apply to state employees to whom IDL applies. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 19873, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">After termination of IDL benefits, an employee who continues to be temporarily disabled is entitled to receive TD as well as accumulated sick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>leave, compensable overtime, vacation or annual leave for the absence unless the employee elects otherwise and so long as the employee does not receive payment in excess of full salary or wage. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 19874, subd. (a), 19863, subd. (a).) When the employee\u2019s accumulated sick leave, overtime, vacation, or annual leave, or all of them, are exhausted, the employee is still entitled to receive TD. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 19863, subd. (a).) While on TD, with or without use of all or a part of such accumulated time, the state employee is entitled to medical, surgical, and hospital treatment as provided in the Labor Code. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Concerning the applicability of IDL, Government Code section 19863, subdivision (b), provides: \u201cState officers and employees who are covered by [the IDL provisions in] Article 4 . . . shall be entitled to industrial and temporary disability benefits only as provided by that article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Thus, state workers eligible for IDL are entitled to this benefit, rather than TD, until the IDL is exhausted, at which point the employee who continues to be temporarily disabled is entitled to receive TD.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">\n<em>Administration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">In 1981, when the Legislature created the DPA (Stats. 1981, ch. 230, \u00a7 55, p. 1168 et seq.), IDL benefits became subject to the provision: \u201cThe [DPA] shall adopt any rules and regulations necessary for the administration of this article. \u201cThe appointing power of any officer or employee not a member of the civil service shall adopt any rules and regulations necessary for the administration of this article for such officers or employees.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 <em>19877.)</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">The DPA has adopted a series of regulations for IDL. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 599.755 et seq.) Among the regulations are provisions that SCIF shall make all temporary disability eligibility determinations <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 599.758) and that disabled employees have an election to receive either IDL or TD as follows: \u201cFor the first 22 working days of disability, all disabled employees shall receive Industrial Disability Leave (IDL) unless the gross amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>the IDL benefit is less than that which would be provided by Workers\u2019 Compensation Temporary Disability (WCTD) payments without supplementation, in which case the employee shall receive WCTD payments without supplementation rather than IDL payments. This initial benefit placement is subject to one opportunity to effect a retroactive change in accordance with a subsequent employee benefit choice provided by this Section. . . .\u201d <em>(Id.., </em>\u00a7 599.759.)</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Accordingly, DPA recognizes eligibility of temporarily disabled state workers for TD benefits in cases where the TD benefits without supplementation are greater than the IDL benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">With respect to appeals, the DPA regulations read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-6\">\u201cThe employee shall first seek departmental administrative remedy for complaints arising out of Industrial Disability Leave. Thereafter, the employee shall have the <em>right of appeal to:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">\u201c(a) The <em>Division of Industrial Accidents on matters within the jurisdiction of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act </em>of the Labor Code. <em>Such matters include </em>but are not limited to <em>determination of liability for </em>provision of medical care, <em>temporary disability payments, </em>vocational rehabilitation, and related items.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\">\u201c(b) The <em>Department of Personnel Administration on employee benefit matters as provided by the Government Code. Such matters include, </em>but are not limited to, <em>issues involving Industrial Disability Leave payments, </em>leave administration, and related matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-9\">\u201c(c) The Department of Rehabilitation on matters within the rehabilitation provisions of the Welfare and Institutions Code. Such matters include, but are not limited to, issues relating to the provision of services by the Department of Rehabilitation.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7 599.768, italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">Under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this regulation there is closely related jurisdiction for appeals in both WCAB and DPA. There can be no doubt that in the case of an employee who, for example, exercised the right to select TD instead of IDL because the TD benefit is greater, both WCAB and DPA would be authorized to act in the matter. If there were a dispute as to which benefit were higher, it is apparent both agencies would be empowered to act under this DPA regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">In this general connection, it is to be noted that DPA, through its director, is expressly authorized to \u201c[h]old hearings, subpoena witnesses, administer oaths, and conduct investigations concerning all matters relating to the department\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d (Gov.

Payment was not made until May 9, 1994, nearly four months after the findings and award, and forty-two days after the correct amount of IDL was stipulated to by the parties. The Board\u2019s position in this case is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">. . [After the January 14, 1994, findings and award], the only issue remaining with regard to temporary disability was the correct amount of the greater benefit, IDL (in contrast to temporary disability indemnity), to which [Ellison] was entitled as a state employee under the Government Code. That issue did not obviate [the State\u2019s] <em>duty to timely pay </em>[Ellison] at least the lesser amount of temporary disability indemnity for the period in question, a sum of almost $11,000.00, or the amount of IDL benefits which were uncontested. Even after the parties stipulated to the correct amount of IDL benefits on March 28, 1994, no benefits were paid for [Ellison\u2019s] <em>undisputed period of industrial disability </em>until 42 days later, after correspondence from [Ellison\u2019s] attorney on two separate occasions, the second of which requested penalty for unreasonable delay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">\u201c[The State] has failed to provide any explanation whatsoever for its dilatory conduct. Nor has [the State] provided any persuasive legal authority, including case law contrary to <em>Blankenship, supra, </em>or public policy argument which would allow it to escape the consequences of such conduct. On the contrary, <em>to accept [the State\u2019s] argument would allow a defendant to pay no benefits to an industrially temporarily disabled worker until whenever it chose to do so, if that worker happened to be entitled to IDL benefits.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">\u201c[The State] did not have genuine doubt from either a medical or a legal standpoint as to its liability for benefits so as to excuse the delay in payment herein. (See <em>Kerley </em>v. <em>[Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd.] </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d [223,] 273 [93 Cal.Rptr. 192, 481 P.2d 200].) <em>There is no disagreement as to the Board\u2019s lack of jurisdiction over IDL benefits, including imposing a penalty against such benefits, and the Board specifically refrained from taking any action with regard to IDL benefits in this case. </em>Thus, [the State\u2019s] discussion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>for example, as to whether IDL benefits are \u2018compensation\u2019 under Division 4 of the Labor Code, and therefore subject to penalty under Labor Code section 5814, is not germane herein. Moreover, <em>penalty was not imposed for unreasonable delay in paying IDL benefits, but for [the </em>State\u2019s] <em>continuing failure to pay </em>[Ellison] any benefits for her temporary disability, despite its legal obligation to do so. Therefore, contrary to [the State\u2019s] assertion, the Board properly acted within its jurisdiction by imposing a 10% penalty under Labor Code section 5814 against <em>the amount of temporary disability indemnity </em>[original italics] that would have been payable in this case, for [the State\u2019s] unreasonable failure to timely provide [Ellison] <em>any </em>benefits for her undisputed period of temporary disability.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\n<em>Weight to Be Accorded WCAB\u2019s Interpretation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">In the context of a ruling by the WCAB concerning its jurisdiction over a different matter, its power to award temporary total disability more than five years after an original injury (\u00a7\u00a7 4656, 5410, 5804), the Supreme Court has said: \u201c. . . [T]he WCAB\u2019s own determination that the workers\u2019 compensation judge lacked jurisdiction under section 4656, as amended, to award further temporary total disability is entitled to significant respect on judicial review. . . . The WCAB\u2019s interpretation of its jurisdictional authority to grant new and further temporary disability, as expressed in its decision on reconsideration, is not only persuasive on this issue, its interpretation and application of these three statutes is entitled to significant respect upon judicial review. (See <em>Nipper </em>v. <em>California Auto.

A statute was in effect providing, \u201cThe Uninsured Employers Fund shall not be liable for any penalties or for the payment of interest on any awards.\u201d (\u00a7 3716.2.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>The present case, of course, does not deal with the UEF or involve a statute of similar import. Thus, <em>DuBois </em>does not directly bear on this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">However, <em>DuBois </em>sets forth various reasons, in addition to the statutory language of section 3716.2, for reaching its conclusion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Among those reasons is Government Code section 818, which reads: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, a public entity is not liable for damages awarded under Section 3294 of the Civil Code or other damages imposed primarily for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Immediately after this quotation of the statute, <em>DuBois </em>states, \u201cIn light of the partially penal nature of section 5814, we believe that application of the statutory penalty provision to the UEF is not permitted, absent express legislative authorization.\u201d (DuBois, <em>supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 398.) Thus, <em>DuBois </em>suggests the section 5814 increase in the amount of the award is in the category of punitive damages for purposes of applying Government Code section 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">However, more recently, in <em>La Jolla Beach &amp; Tennis Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 27, 36 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 100, 884 P.2d 1048] <em>(La Jolla Beach &amp; Tennis </em>Club) the court states: \u201cThe statutes carefully distinguish between \u2018compensation\u2019 and \u2018damages.\u2019 \u2018\u201cCompensation\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>means compensation under Division 4 [the Workers\u2019 Compensation and Insurance section of the Labor Code] and includes every benefit or payment conferred by Division 4 upon an injured employee, including vocational rehabilitation, or in the event of his death, upon his dependents, without regard to negligence.\u2019 (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3207; Ins. Code, \u00a7 11630 [\u2018As used in this chapter [Chapter 2\u2014Workers\u2019 Compensation Policies], the term \u201ccompensation\u201d means the benefits insured by workers\u2019 compensation insurance.\u2019].) \u2018 \u201cDamages\u201d means the recovery allowed in an action at law as contrasted with compensation.\u2019 (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3209.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><em>La Jolla Beach &amp; Tennis Club </em>made this observation in the course of deciding that a workers\u2019 compensation insurer has no duty to defend a former employee\u2019s civil suit alleging wrongful termination in violation of public policy. <em>(La Jolla Beach &amp; Tennis Club, supra, </em>9 Cal.4th at p. 31.) This area also has nothing to do with the case at hand. However, the principle stated would appear to have general application as does the rule of jurisdiction set forth in the case: \u201c. . . \u2018[T]he superior court cannot award workmen\u2019s compensation benefits, and <em>the </em>[WCAB] cannot award damages for injuries.\u2019 [Citation.] The only point of concurrent jurisdiction of the two tribunals is jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction; jurisdiction once determined is exclusive, not concurrent. [Citation.]\u201d <em>((Id. </em>at p. 35, quoting <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d <em>76, </em>83 [293 P.2d 18], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">As in <em>La Jolla Beach &amp; Tennis Club, </em>the Court of Appeal in <em>Leung </em>v. <em>Chinese Six Companies </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 801, 807 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 593] <em>(Leung) </em>set forth a clear line of distinction between damages and compensation for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation law. <em>Leung </em>held that the 10 percent penalty under section 4554 applicable to an employer\u2019s willful failure to secure the payment of compensation is not recoverable in a civil action under section 3706, i.e., an action \u201cfor <em>damages </em>which substitute for the compensation that would be due an employee but for the employer\u2019s failure to secure such compensation.\u201d (2 Cal.App.4th 807, original italics.) The court explained in part that such an action under section 3706 \u201csimply does not result in \u2018compensation\u2019 within the meaning of the statutes; \u2018compensation\u2019 is specifically defined as benefits or payments made without regard to negligence while recovery of damages in a section 3706 action requires proof of the employer\u2019s liability under tort principles (albeit with the aid of statutory presumptions and limitations lightening the employee\u2019s burden).\u201d (2 Cal.App.4th at pp. 806-807.) Thus, <em>Leung </em>views such a penalty as \u201ccompensation,\u201d outside the scope of the <em>damages </em>recoverable in a section 3706 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">We are concerned, of course, with the appropriate application of Government Code section 818 and its possible bearing on this case as suggested in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number><em>DuBois, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at page 398. However, in light of the rather consistent and recent distinction made in the cases between damages and compensation (see also <em>ante, </em>p. 140), and Government Code section 818\u2019s application to \u201cdamages\u201d only, not \u201ccompensation,\u201d we are of the view that the section is inapplicable to the section 5814 penalty in this case. We observe in this connection that <em>DuBois </em>itself, with apparent acceptance, made note of the fact the cases have characterized the 10 percent penalty \u2018\u201cas an increase in the compensation awarded to the injured worker.\u2019\u201d <em>(DuBois, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at p. 396, quoting <em>Carver </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>217 Cal.App.3d at p. 1547.)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">We are persuaded the Board\u2019s interpretation of its authority to award the penalty in this case is not clearly erroneous and, in fact, is correct. A precept to this conclusion is the rule of liberal construction which is applicable to all aspects of workers\u2019 compensation, including penalties. (\u00a7 3202; <em>Kerley </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 223, 227 [93 Cal.Rptr. 192, 481 P.2d 200] [agreeing with the statement, \u201cWe think a <em>rule of liberal construction is applicable to </em>all aspects of workmen\u2019s compensation, including <em>penalties.\u201d', </em>quoting <em>Davison </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 15, 18 [50 Cal.Rptr. 76], italics added.].) This rule has been applied \u201cto resolve a wide variety of procedural and substantive questions affecting the availability and adequacy of compensation in favor of injured employees and other applicants.\u201d <em>{Johnson </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 235, 241 [207 Cal.Rptr. 857, 689 P.2d 1127].)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The Board narrowly defined its authority to impose the penalty on the state, applying section 5814 only with respect to the amount of TD over which it clearly had jurisdiction. As we have said earlier in this opinion, such a penalty is a part of compensation for \u201ctemporary disability as defined in Divisions 4 . . . and 4.5 .. . .\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 19870, subd. (a); \u00a7 3207.)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">The strong policy of helping the employee obtain benefits promptly and compelling the employer to timely provide the benefits <em>{Adams, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at p. 229) admits of no exception for one class of employee-employer relationship, that of a state worker to the state, as distinguished from the vast class of other employee-employer relationships that are subject to application of this policy. In this connection, we observe that in the context of a different penalty provision, the 50 percent (up to $10,000) penalty applicable to cases of discrimination against workers who are injured in the course and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>scope of their employment (\u00a7 132a<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>), courts have readily considered the penalty provision to be applicable to the state, though not deciding any issue about the Board\u2019s jurisdiction to award the penalty as against the state. (See <em>Dyer </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1376 [28 Cal.Rptr.2d 30], involving state Franchise Tax Board worker; see also <em>Stemler </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 577 [251 Cal.Rptr. 364], involving state Cal. Dept, of Transportation worker.)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Moreover, the Legislature has set out in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act various provisions, programs or benefits applicable to specified classes of state workers. (See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a73212.1 [firefighters of Univ. of Cal., Cal. State Univ. and Dept, of Forestry, and certain state peace officers in active law enforcement]; 3212.2 [custodial or security officer of Dept, of Corrections, Dept, of Youth Authority and Atascadero State Hospital]; 3214 [Dept, of Corrections and Dept, of Youth Authority]; 4800 et seq. [active law enforcement members of Dept, of Justice, Cal. Highway Patrol, Univ. of Cal. Police Dept., Cal. State Univ. Police Dept.].) In light of the specific applicability of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and the SCIF provisions to the state (3300; , Ins. Code, 11870, 11871, 11873), we cannot view the scattered provisions regarding specific classes of state employees as demonstrating a legislative purpose that other provisions of the act are applicable to only those classes of state workers. The initial definition of IDL as meaning TD \u201cas defined in Divisions 4 . . . and 4.5\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 19870, subd. (a)) evidences an intent to grant state workers the benefits of all of those provisions, including the penalty provision in question which is contained in division 4. The WCAB unquestionably has jurisdiction over these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Accordingly, we conclude the Board was authorized to assess the penalty against the state as it did in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The order of the WCAB is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Kremer, P.

(a)), the presence in sections 3716 and 3716.2 of language limiting the liability of the UEF to the payment of those benefits that would accrue against a properly insured employer and exempting the UEF from the payment of penalties and interest on awards, the absence of express language in section 5814 indicating that the UEF may be liable under that statute, the protective purpose served by the statute, the WCAB\u2019s view that the UEF is not liable for penalties pursuant to section 5814 (see <em>Nickelsberg </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>54 Cal.3d 288, 299-300; <em>Judson Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 658, 668-669 [150 Cal.Rptr. 250, 586 P.2d 564] [agency interpretation entitled to significant respect upon judicial review]), and the general immunity afforded governmental entities (such as the UEF) by Government Code section 818. Our examination of all of these factors leads us to conclude that the Legislature did not intend that the UEF be liable, pursuant to section 5814, for penalties premised upon its own delay, even where the delay engaged in by that entity properly may be characterized as unreasonable.\u201d <em>(DuBois, supra, </em>5 Cal.4th at pp. 398-399.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Section 132a is not part of the workers\u2019 compensation provisions here under consideration.
