Code, \u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in count 3 with genital penetration (\u00a7 289, subd. (a)), in count 4 with sexual battery (\u00a7 243.4, subd.

The jury also found defendant used a deadly weapon, a \u201cclub,\u201d in the commission of the four sex offenses (\u00a7\u00a7 12022.2, subd. (a), 12022, subd. (b)) and he inflicted great bodily injury in the commission of the two rapes (\u00a7 12022.8). The court sentenced him to an aggregate term of 52 years in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">On appeal Light contends the trial court committed several instructional errors. He also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the weapon use enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">At approximately 11:30 on the morning of November 8, 1994, Donna H. received a telephone call at her real estate office about a vacant house she had listed for sale in Bakersfield. The caller, a man, said he recently had been transferred to the area and had been referred to her by a coworker named Smith. Donna, who had a client by that name, agreed to meet the man and his wife at the house at 12:15 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Donna arrived a little early. There was no other car at the house but she noticed a green pickup parked nearby which she took to be a gardener\u2019s truck. She unlocked the front door and went into the house, leaving her purse, briefcase and other items in her car.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As she opened the blinds in the dining area, she heard a noise behind her. She turned and found Light standing about five feet away. He wore dark wraparound sunglasses and was holding a dowel, similar to a closet pole, in his two hands in front of him. He said: \u201cget down on the floor, get down on the floor or you\u2019ll get hurt, get down on the floor and you won\u2019t get hurt.\u201d His voice sounded like the person who had phoned earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">Donna ran through the family room toward the kitchen but there she caught sight of a second person standing between her and the only other exit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>She did not see the person\u2019s face, only his torso. She turned and headed back down the hallway toward the entry but Light grabbed her by the arm and pulled her into the kitchen. There he and the other man forced her to the ground both with their hands and with something on her back she assumed was the \u201cstick.\u201d Light ordered Donna to keep her face down and her eyes closed, and not to move or say anything lest she get hurt. She complied out of fear for her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Light put the dowel down on the floor near Donna\u2019s head while the two men removed the rings from her fingers, two from each hand. A few minutes passed during which Donna was aware of some activity in the kitchen before Light returned and started to undress her. She caught sight of his face when he turned her over in the process of removing her clothes. With Donna on her back, Light lifted her blouse over her head, pulled up her bra, and fondled her breasts with his hands. The blouse blocked her view but she assumed the dowel was still nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Light then stood Donna up, walked her backwards into the hallway, and put her down on her back on the floor. Once again he lifted her blouse over her head and fondled her breasts, kissing her left breast. He put his finger inside her vagina. Then he put his penis in her vagina. He ordered her to turn over onto her hands and knees whereupon he put his penis in her vagina a second time until he ejaculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Light got up and Donna, still facedown on the hall floor with her eyes closed, heard him moving about. She could not tell whether the second man was still in the house, but assumed so. Light asked her whether her purse was in her car; she responded it was. She remained on the floor for a while longer until she heard the front door close, and then she ran to a nearby house for help. Donna\u2019s purse was missing from her car and was never recovered. Police summoned to the scene found her clothes in a hall closet and the dowel on the kitchen floor. One of the closets was missing such a pole.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The results of a sexual assault examination performed later that day were consistent with Donna\u2019s account of having had nonconsensual sexual intercourse. Subsequent tests on swabs taken at the hospital confirmed the presence of semen in her vagina and saliva on her breast.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The hospital also took X-rays of Donna\u2019s right foot which was by then painful and swollen. She gave the X-rays to a doctor who had performed bunion surgery on her foot some two months earlier. He thereafter performed additional surgery to remove a dislodged pin and to reset a surgical fracture which had reopened.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>Around 12:45 in the afternoon of the incident, Margaret Rimmer saw the driver of a lime-green pickup, whom she was unable to describe, run from the truck to a dumpster with a purse in his hand matching the description of the purse stolen from Donna\u2019s car. A few minutes later Bobby Mahaffey, a construction inspector for the City of Bakersfield, was sitting in his truck eating lunch and listening to a police scanner when he heard an all-points bulletin for a lime-green Dodge pickup. Soon afterward he saw a truck matching that description. He wrote down the license number and contacted police. Upon determining the truck was registered to Light, the police included his picture in a photo lineup which they showed to Donna the next day. She picked out Light, saying he looked like the person who raped her but she could not be sure because the light in the house had been dim and the perpetrator had been wearing sunglasses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">On the basis of Donna\u2019s identification, the police obtained a search warrant for Light\u2019s home and truck. In his home they found a pair of sunglasses which Donna said were similar to those worn by her assailant. They also found \u201ca real estate ad with a real estate agent\u2019s name on it.\u201d They arrested Light and impounded his truck but found nothing significant in it during their initial search. During a subsequent phone call from jail, however, Light told his wife that one of Donna\u2019s rings was hidden in the finger of a glove in the truck. Light\u2019s wife passed this information on to police, who found the ring during a further search.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Light made two other significant admissions after his arrest. During one of his frequent phone calls to his wife he told her roommate, Aerin Easterwood, that he knew when he woke up on the day of the incident he was going to do \u201csomething wrong.\u201d He said he had recruited an \u201cex-con\u201d from the homeless shelter to help him in his tree-trimming business and together they hatched a plan to \u201crip off\u2019 the real estate lady at the house where his truck was spotted. They went there with that intention only but \u201csomething snapped\u201d and he (Light) raped her while the other man waited outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Light gave a similar account in a letter to Irma Peterson, his wife\u2019s grandmother. He wrote in part: \u201cThat day the crime happened, I knew I was going to do something wrong. That morning I went down to the shelter to find a worker &amp; I probly [szc] found the most dirty convict you could ever imagine. Now my thoughts were not to find a woman and rape her, what I was thinking was I know I am going to get into trouble. We started to do my houses &amp; I\u2019ll say about every other house we did he would . . . suggest let[\u2019]s get that house it will have money &amp; jewels. At first I blew him off, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>then I started thinking some extra money would be nice.\u2014Not that tree trimming wasn\u2019t doing good enough. I just wasn\u2019t thinking. Then I droped [\u00bfic] off the trailer &amp; we came up with the plan. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Tests on the semen and saliva samples gathered from Donna at the hospital showed Light was included in the group of potential donors representing about 30 percent of the population. Fingerprints and shoe prints collected by the police at the house did not match those taken from Light.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Light raises the following issues on appeal: (1) the adequacy of the court\u2019s reasonable doubt instruction (CALJIC No. 2.90), (2) the court\u2019s refusal to limit to the two nonsex offenses CALJIC instruction No. 2.15 regarding an inference of guilt to be drawn from a defendant\u2019s conscious possession of recently stolen property, (3) the court\u2019s failure to give a unanimity instruction as to the sexual battery charge (CALJIC No. 17.01), (4) the sufficiency of the evidence to support the weapon use enhancements, (5) the court\u2019s failure to give an armed enhancement instruction, and (6) the court\u2019s failure to give a causation instruction as to the great bodily injury enhancements (CALJIC No. 3.40).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">I. <em>The Reasonable Doubt Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">The court gave a reasonable doubt instruction based on a 1994 revision to CALJIC No. 2.90 which deleted references in the earlier version to \u201cmoral evidence\u201d and \u201cmoral certainty.\u201d The second part of the instruction, with the deletions indicated in brackets, provided: \u201cReasonable doubt is defined as follows: It is not a mere possible doubt; because everything relating to human affairs [, and depending on moral evidence,] is open to some possible or imaginary doubt. It is that state of the case which, after the entire comparison and consideration of all the evidence, leaves the minds of the jurors in that condition that they cannot say they feel an abiding conviction[, to a moral certainty,] of the truth of the charge.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">Light contends the revised instruction, by omitting the phrase \u201cmoral certainty\u201d and thus defining reasonable doubt only in terms of an \u201cabiding conviction,\u201d \u201cgave the jury no guidance as to the level of certainty to which it must be persuaded before it could reliably determine that the prosecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>had met its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Without \u201csome other language to convey the concept that a standard of proof necessarily reflects a degree of certainty,\u201d he maintains the instruction permitted the jury to convict him upon a lesser standard than due process requires.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">In arguing the instruction\u2019s \u201cabiding conviction\u201d language fails to adequately define reasonable doubt, Light relies in part on Justice Mosk\u2019s criticism of the phrase in his concurring opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Brigham </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 283 [157 Cal.Rptr. 905, 599 P.2d 100]. In <em>Brigham </em>the court disapproved use of former CALJIC No. 22 (rev.) in connection with the previous version of CALJIC No. 2.90. CALJIC No. 22 (rev.) defined \u201cmoral certainty\u201d as \u201c \u2018that degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (25 Cal.3d at p. 290.) The court concluded the instruction had \u201cserious flaws\u201d because \u201cCALJIC No. 2.90 speaks of an \u2018abiding conviction;\u2019 former CALJIC No. 22 (rev.) speaks only of \u2018conviction.\u2019 The lasting, permanent nature of the conviction connoted by \u2018abiding\u2019 is missing and the juror is not informed as to how strongly and how deeply his conviction must be held. Thus, former CALJIC No. 22 (rev.) may allow a juror to conclude that he or she could return a guilty verdict based on a strong and convincing belief which is something short of having been \u2018reasonably persuaded to a near certainty.\u2019 [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\u201cSince Penal Code section 1096 outlines the definition of reasonable doubt as contained in CALJIC No. 2.90, jurors should not be confused by having the weaker language of former CALJIC No. 22 (rev.) read with the stronger language of CALJIC No. 2.90.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 290-291, fn. omitted.) Thus \u201cabiding conviction\u201d was found to adequately convey the requirement that the jurors\u2019 belief in the truth of the charge must be both long lasting and deeply felt. Nonetheless Light argues the phrase does nothing to distinguish reasonable doubt from other lesser standards of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Justice Mosk agreed with the <em>Brigham </em>majority\u2019s disapproval of CALJIC No. 22 (rev.) but, in a lengthy concurring opinion, pointed out what he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>considered to be several \u201cequally glaring deficiencies\u201d in CALJIC No. 2.90. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brigham, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at p. 292 (cone. opn. of Mosk, J.).) Although he identified \u201cmoral certainty\u201d as the phrase most deserving of criticism, he also found fault with \u201cabiding conviction.\u201d \u201cFirst, what is an \u2018abiding\u2019 conviction? Again the word has an antique ring: while it may have been current in 1850, it has long since fallen into disuse and is no longer part of our daily speech. As with the phrase \u2018moral evidence,\u2019 the jurors are left without guidance from the trial court as to its intended meaning.\" <em>(Id. </em>at p. 299.)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Nevertheless, viewed in its entirety, Justice Mosk\u2019s concurring opinion lends little support to Light\u2019s position that CALJIC No. 2.90 must be rewritten to more completely define the degree of certainty necessary to overcome a reasonable doubt: \u201cHappily there is another alternative, a solution adopted by fully half of the states of the Union and long advocated by leading scholars. These authorities recognize that all attempts to define the phrase \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 are at once futile and unnecessary. They are futile because, as we have seen, the definition is more complicated than the phrase itself and results in confusing rather than enlightening the jury; and they are unnecessary because \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 is not a technical legal term requiring learned explanation, but a phrase of common meaning and usage that is known to and understood by the average juror. From these premises both courts and Legislatures have concluded that in criminal cases the jury should simply be instructed on the presumption of innocence and the prosecution\u2019s burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, with no effort being made to define the latter phrase.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brigham, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at p. 308 (cone. opn. of Mosk, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The Constitution does not require anything more.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\"> \u201cThe beyond a reasonable doubt standard is a requirement of due process, but the Constitution neither prohibits trial courts from defining reasonable doubt nor requires them to do so as a matter of course. [Citation.] Indeed, so long as the court instructs the jury on the necessity that the defendant\u2019s guilt be proven beyond a reasonable doubt [citation], the Constitution does not require that any particular form of words be used in advising the jury of the government\u2019s burden of proof. [Citation.] Rather, \u2018taken as a whole, the instructions [must] correctly conve[y] the concept of reasonable doubt to the jury.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska </em>(1994) 511 U.S. 1, _ [127 L.Ed.2d 583, 590, 114 S.Ct. 1239, 1243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">In <em>Victor, </em>the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the former version of CALJIC No. 2.90 against a challenge focusing on its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>use of the phrases \u201cmoral evidence\u201d and \u201cmoral certainty.\u201d The court found the reference to \u201cmoral evidence\u201d to be \u201cunproblematic\u201d because, viewed in context, it \u201ccan only mean empirical evidence offered to prove such matters \u2014the proof introduced at trial.\u201d <em>(Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska, supra, </em>511 U.S. at pp. [127 L.Ed.2d at pp. 594-596, 114 S.Ct. at pp. 1246, 1247].) The court was more concerned with the possibility that the jury might understand \u201cmoral certainty\u201d to mean \u201csomething less than the very high level of probability required by the Constitution in criminal cases.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p_[127 L.Ed.2d at p. 596, 114 S.Ct. at p. 1247].) However it concluded: \u201cAlthough in this respect moral certainty is ambiguous in the abstract, the rest of the instruction . . . lends content to the phrase. The jurors were told that they must have \u2018an abiding conviction, to a moral certainty, of the truth of the charge.\u2019 ... An instruction cast in terms of an abiding conviction as to guilt, without reference to moral certainty, correctly states the government\u2019s burden of proof. [Citations.] And the judge had already informed the jury that matters relating to human affairs are proven by moral evidence . . . ; giving the same meaning to the word moral in this part of the instruction, moral certainty can only mean certainty with respect to human affairs. As used in this instruction, therefore, we are satisfied that the reference to moral certainty, in conjunction with the abiding conviction language, \u2018impressed] upon the factfinder the need to reach a subjective state of near certitude of the guilt of the accused.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Although it held the reference to \u201cmoral certainty\u201d did not render the instruction unconstitutional, the court said: \u201cAt the same time, however, we do not condone the use of the phrase. As modem dictionary definitions of moral certainty attest, the common meaning of the phrase has changed since it was used in the <em>[Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster </em>(1850) 59 Mass. (5 Cush.) 295] instruction, and it may continue to do so to the point that it conflicts with the <em>[In re Winship </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 358 (25 L.Ed.2d 368, 90 S.Ct. 1068)] standard [of proof beyond a reasonable doubt].\u201d <em>(Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska, supra, </em>511 U.S. at p. _ [127 L.Ed.2d at p. 597, 114 S.Ct. at p. 1248].)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Our own Supreme Court has since reviewed California\u2019s reasonable doubt instruction in light of this language in <em>Victor, </em>leading to the revised version at issue in this case. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th 450, the court considered a modification to the earlier version of CALJIC No. 2.90 which told the jury in essence that \u201c. . . the phrase \u2018moral evidence\u2019 meant mortal evidence, or evidence from people or from the mouths of people.\u201d (8 Cal.4th at p. 502.) The court concluded the modification was consistent with the meaning given to the phrase by the court in <em>Victor. (Id. </em>at pp. 504-505.) But it went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-10\">\u201cAlthough modifying the standard instmction is perilous, and generally should not be done, today it might be more perilous for trial courts <em>not </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>modify it in a narrow and specific manner in light of the high court\u2019s statement that the instruction\u2019s \u2018common meaning . . . may continue to [change] to the point that it\u2019 becomes unconstitutional. <em>(\u2019Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska, supra, </em>511 U.S. at p._[127 L.Ed.2d at p. 597, 114 S.Ct. at p. 1248].) A slight modification in view of that decision might be deemed safe, indeed safer than not making it. The high court made clear that the terms \u2018moral evidence\u2019 and \u2018moral certainty\u2019 add nothing to the jury\u2019s understanding of reasonable doubt. It thus seems that trial courts might, in the future, safely delete the following phrases in the standard instruction: \u2018and depending on moral evidence,\u2019 and \u2018to a moral certainty.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">\u201cMaking these changes, and no others, would both avoid the perils that have caused appellate courts to caution trial courts against modifying the standard instruction, and satisfy the concerns the high court has expressed regarding that instruction. In light of Penal Code section 1096a, we cannot and do not require trial courts to change the standard language; rather, we note that it is permissible, and safer, to make the narrow changes suggested herein.\" <em>{People </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 504, fn. omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">In response to this suggestion, the Committee on Standard Jury Instructions, Criminal, of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (the CALJIC committee) adopted the 1994 revision to CALJIC No. 2.90. (Com. to CALJIC No. 2.90 (5th ed. Jan. 1996 pocket pt.) p. 45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Light characterizes this judicial history as \u201cdicta upon dicta\u201d which fails to establish that the phrase \u201cabiding conviction\u201d conveys \u201cthe very high level of probability required by the Constitution in criminal cases.\u201d <em>(Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska, supra, </em>511 U.S. at p._[127 L.Ed.2d at p. 596, 114 S.Ct. at p. 1247].) His claim turns on what the <em>Victor </em>court meant when it said \u201c[a]n instruction cast in terms of an abiding conviction as to guilt, without reference to moral certainty, correctly states the government\u2019s burden of proof.\u201d <em>{Ibid., </em>citing <em>Hopt </em>v. <em>People of Utah </em>(1887) 120 U.S. 430, 439 [30 L.Ed. 708, 711, 7 S.Ct. 614] [\u201cThe word \u2018abiding\u2019 here has the signification of settled and fixed, a conviction which may follow a careful examination and comparison of the whole evidence\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">The court went on to conclude that \u201c. . . the reference to moral certainty, in conjunction with the abiding conviction language, \u2018impress[ed] upon the factfinder the need to reach a subjective state of near certitude of the guilt of the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Victor </em>v. <em>Nebraska, supra, </em>511 U.S. at p__[127 L.Ed.2d at p. 596, 114 S.Ct. at p. 1247].) Light would interpret the court\u2019s statement to mean that \u201cabiding conviction\u201d alone does not convey the requisite level of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>certainty. The court in <em>Freeman </em>reached a different conclusion. Referring to the quoted passage from <em>Victor, </em>it said: \u201cThe high court made clear that the terms \u2018moral evidence\u2019 and \u2018moral certainty\u2019 add nothing to the jury\u2019s understanding of reasonable doubt. It thus seems that trial courts might, in the future, safely delete the following phrases in the standard instruction: \u2018and depending on moral evidence,\u2019 and \u2018to a moral certainty.\u2019 \u201d <em>{People </em>v. <em>Freeman, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 504, fn. omitted.) The court thus gave its approval in advance to the 1994 revision to CALJIC No. 2.90 doing just that. The court\u2019s conclusion the changes were permissible, albeit dictum, is nonetheless highly persuasive. <em>(Evans </em>v. <em>City of Bakersfield </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 321, 328 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 406].) Therefore, for the reasons expressed in <em>Freeman, </em>we reject Light\u2019s objections to the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">II.-VI.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Ardaiz, P.

The gate and the two doors were all unlocked.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b525-8\">At trial Donna positively identified Light as the person who raped her, saying she had \u201cno doubts\u201d about her identification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b526-10\">The definition of reasonable doubt in the earlier version of CALJIC No. 2.90 is taken from section 1096.

The trial court \u201cmay,\u201d but is not required to give a reasonable doubt instruction utilizing the language of section 1096.

Proof beyond a reasonable doubt requires a degree of certainty which is greater than the next lower standard of clear and convincing evidence, which lower standard requires evidence so clear as to leave no substantial doubt and sufficiently strong to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind. An abiding conviction sufficient to meet the higher standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is also one which is lasting and permanent in nature.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b527-9\">The entire instruction read: \u201c \u2018The law does not require demonstration or that degree of proof which, excluding all possibility of error, produces absolute certainty, for such degree of proof is rarely possible. Moral certainty only is required, which is that degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind.\u2019 \u201d (25 Cal.3d at p. 290, fn. 8.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b531-10\">See footnote 1, <em>ante, </em>page 879.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
