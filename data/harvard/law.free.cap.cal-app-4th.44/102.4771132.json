With commendable candor, the Attorney General has conceded error at oral argument. We reverse because the trial court instructed the jury that appellant could be convicted of battery if he acted with \u201ccriminal negligence.\u201d It is unnecessary to reach appellant\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">Pete Lara, Jr., was convicted by jury of battery with serious bodily injury. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 242 and 243, subd. (d).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a bifurcated proceeding, the jury found that appellant had suffered two \u201cstrikes\u201d within the meaning of section 667, subdivisions (d) and (e). The trial court sentenced appellant to state prison for an indeterminate term of 25 years to life pursuant to the \u201cthree strikes\u201d law. (\u00a7 667, subd. (e)(2)(A).)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">Appellant spent the weekend at the home of his girlfriend, Michelle M. On Sunday afternoon Michelle returned home from work to find appellant watching a video and drinking beer. While Michelle straightened up the house, appellant stood on the front porch watching two teenage girls walking in front of the house. Michelle became angry and an argument ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">Michelle told appellant to leave. They argued while appellant gathered his belongings. Appellant removed $60 from Michelle\u2019s purse. When he was a few steps from the front door, Michelle stood behind him, asked him to stay, and asked for the return of her money. Appellant swung around to face her and the side of his right hand struck Michelle, breaking the bone in her nose. Appellant looked shocked and said: \u201cYour nose,\u201d or \u201cI broke your nose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">Michelle picked up the telephone to dial 911. When appellant attempted to take it from her, she hit him on the hand with the receiver. Appellant left the house and dropped Michelle\u2019s money outside. Michelle retrieved her money and called 911, requesting that appellant be arrested. She then drove herself to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>At the hospital, Michelle gave a tape-recorded statement to a Ventura police officer. During the interview, Michelle stated that she did not touch appellant before he hit her. When asked whether appellant had been \u201cphysical\u201d with her before, Michelle answered: \u201cActually, ... he has never hit me. OK, the guy he pushed me . . . . It\u2019s always when I tell him to leave, you know I tell him to leave, and he\u2019ll, you know, be getting ready to leave but I start running off at the mouth .... I don\u2019t shut up so he flips out on me, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">In a subsequent interview with an investigator with the district attorney\u2019s office, Michelle stated this was the first time appellant struck her and that she had mixed feelings about the prosecution. Toward the end of the interview, Michelle claimed, for the first time, that appellant might have hit her by accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">At trial, Michelle testified that, before appellant hit her, she grabbed the back of his Pendleton shirt with such force that most of the buttons popped off the front of the shirt. Appellant turned around to free himself from her grasp and hit her in the nose by accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\n<em>Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Pursuant to the People\u2019s request, the trial court instructed the jury with CALJIC No. 3.30, the standard instruction on general criminal intent. This correctly informed the jury that: \u201cIn the crime [s] charged . . . there must exist a union or joint operation of act or conduct and general criminal intent. To constitute general criminal intent it is not necessary that there should exist an intent to violate the law. When a person intentionally does that which the law declares to be a crime, [he] [she] is acting with general criminal intent, even though [he] [she] may not know that [his] [her] act or conduct is unlawful.\u201d (CALJIC No. 3.30)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Pursuant to the defense request, the trial court instructed the jury with CALJIC No. 4.45: \u201cWhen a person commits an act or makes an omission through misfortune or by accident under circumstances that show neither criminal intent nor purpose, nor [criminal] negligence, [he] [she] does not thereby commit a crime.\u201d Unfortunately, the trial court did not delete \u201cnor criminal negligence\u201d from CALJIC No. 4.45.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">At the People\u2019s request the trial court also instructed the jury with a modified version of CALJIC No. 3,35: \u201cYou may find the defendant guilty of [the] crime charged or the lesser crimes if there exists a union or joint operation of act or conduct and criminal negligence.\u201d The \u201cuse note\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>indicates: \u201cThis instruction is limited to those few offenses where criminal negligence and not intent is involved.\u201d (CALJIC No. 3.35 (5th ed. 1988 bound vol.) p. 131.)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The reporter\u2019s transcript affirmatively shows that the genesis of the erroneous instruction was with the prosecutor. The prosecutor believed he could obtain conviction on both a general criminal intent theory and on a \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d theory: \u201cThis would allow the jury to convict Mr. Lara on either or\u2014either a finding that he possessed criminal general intent to commit the crime charged or find that he had the required criminal negligence to do so. [\u00b6] Now, I believe the evidence has been presented to the Court to justify both theories and instruction should be given. [\u00b6] This would equate criminal negligence with criminal\u2014general criminal intent. I believe it should be given because we\u2019re giving the instruction in 3.36 telling them what criminal negligence is. What value is that without being able to apply it to my case, our case. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] Accident is a defense, however, if you act with criminal negligence you\u2019re held to the same standard as willful criminal intent. That\u2019s what this instruction is for and given quite frequently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\"><em>General Intent </em>v. <em>Criminal Negligence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Our Supreme Court has recently reiterated the long-standing rule that battery is a general intent crime. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Colantuono </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 206, 217 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 908, 865 P.2d 704]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hawkins </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1373, 1376 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 434]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dollar </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1335, 1342 [279 Cal.Rptr. 502]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lisnow </em>(1978) 88 Cal.App.3d Supp. 21, 24 [151 Cal.Rptr. 621].) This necessarily excludes criminal liability when the force or violence is accomplished with a \u201clesser\u201d state of mind, i.e., \u201ccriminal negligence.\u201d As with all general intent crimes, \u201cthe required mehtal state entails only an intent to do the act that causes the harm . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 463, 519, fn. 15 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 826, 896 P.2d 119].) Thus, the crime of battery requires that the defendant actually intend to commit a \u201cwillful and unlawful use of force or violence upon the person of another.\u201d (\u00a7 242; <em>People </em>v. <em>Colantuono, supra, 1 </em>Cal.4th at p. 217.) In this context, the term \u201cwillful\u201d means \u201csimply a purpose or willingness to commit the act. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 7, subd. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">\u201cReckless conduct alone does not constitute a sufficient basis for . . . battery . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lathus </em>(1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 466, 469-470 [110 Cal.Rptr. 921].) However, if an act \u201c \u2018inherently dangerous to others\u2019 . . . [is] done \u2018with conscious disregard of human life and safety,\u2019 the perpetrator must be aware of the nature of the conduct and choose to ignore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>its potential for injury, i.e., act willfully. If these predicates are proven to the satisfaction of the trier of fact, the requisite intent is . . . established by the evidence. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Colantuono, supra, </em>7 Cal.4th at p. 220, italics omitted, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Lathus, supra, </em>35 Cal.App.3d at pp. 469-470.)</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Acting with \u201cconscious disregard\u201d within the meaning of <em>Colanatuono, supra, </em>is not the equivalent of \u201ccriminal negligence.\u201d The former requires proof that the defendant subjectively intended to engage in the conduct at issue. General criminal intent may be inferred by the conduct of the defendant if he or she acts with a \u201cconscious disregard.\u201d On the other hand, \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d requires jurors to apply an objective standard and to ask whether a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would have appreciated the risk his or her conduct posed to human life. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 290, 296 [179 Cal.Rptr. 43, 637 P.2d 279]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rippberger </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1667, 1682 [283 Cal.Rptr. 111].)</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u201cCriminal negligence\u201d requires proof of \u201caggravated, culpable, gross, or reckless conduct, which is such a departure from the conduct of an ordinarily prudent person under the same circumstances as to demonstrate an indifference to consequences or a disregard of human life.\u201d <em>(In re Jerry R. </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1432, 1439 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 155]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Oliver </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 138, 146 [258 Cal.Rptr. 138].) Where liability may be imposed based on \u201ccriminal negligence,\u201d the defendant\u2019s subjective belief or good faith is irrelevant. <em>(In re Jerry R., supra, </em>29 Cal.App.4th at p. 1439; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rippberger, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at p. 1682.) In such a case, the defendant may be found to have acted with \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d without proof that he or she intended to commit the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Here, appellant was charged with battery with serious bodily injury, a general intent crime. Accordingly, the jury should only have been instructed with CALJIC No. 3.30. As indicated, the jury was also instructed that it could convict appellant if it found that he acted with the \u201clesser\u201d mental state of \u201ccriminal negligence.\u201d This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">\n<em>Accident or Misfortune</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">The error appears to have occurred because the trial court attempted to reconcile the mental state necessary for the offense of battery with that necessary to support an accident or misfortune defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">Section 26, subdivision Five provides a defense for persons who commit an act \u201cthrough misfortune or by accident, when it appears that there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>evil design, intention, or culpable negligence.\u201d (\u00a7 26, subd. Five.) CALJIC No. 4.45, the standard instruction on accident, also provides that the defense applies where \u201ccircumstances . . . show neither criminal intent nor purpose, nor [criminal] negligence . . . .\u201d The use note for that instruction states: \u201cIf this instruction is given, an instruction defining \u2018criminal negligence\u2019 must be given sua sponte.\u201d (CALJIC No. 4.45 (5th ed. 1988 bound vol.) p. 174.) The \u201cif,\u201d however, presupposes, inter alia, that the charged offense can be committed with \u201ccriminal negligence.\u201d  Only \u201c[w]here negligence is required as a predicate for a criminal act, . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Peabody </em>(1975) 46 Cal.App.3d 43, 47 [119 Cal.Rptr. 780]) is it appropriate to instruct on \u201ccriminal negligence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Brucker</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Brucker </em>(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 230 [195 Cal.Rptr. 808], the defendant was charged with felonious assault, battery with serious bodily injury, and \u201cfelony hit and run driving.\u201d Brucker testified that he was driving away from the scene of an argument when his car struck the person with whom he had been arguing. He claimed to have not even been looking at the victim. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 235-236.) Thus, the theory of defense was accident. At Brucker\u2019s request, the trial court gave CALJIC No. 4.45.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">On appeal, Brucker argued that the trial court erred because it failed to define the term \u201cculpable negligence\u201d which we equate with the term \u201ccriminal negligence.\u201d The Court of Appeal agreed: \u201c[T]he term \u2018culpable negligence\u2019 has a technical meaning peculiar to the law which is not commonly understood by the average person and [we] thus conclude the trial court erred in failing to define this term on its own motion.\u201d (148 Cal.App.3d at p. 239, fn. omitted; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Thurmond </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 865, 872 [221 Cal.Rptr. 292].)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The <em>Brucker </em>court determined, however, that the error was harmless because the jury had been properly instructed on the general intent element of each crime and had necessarily found that Brucker acted with the necessary intent: \u201cThe factual question posed by the omitted definition [of culpable negligence]\u2014whether or not defendant had driven his car recklessly\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>was necessarily resolved adversely to defendant when the jury found defendant guilty of battery. (I.e., defendant intended to drive his car in the way he did.) Thus the failure to define \u2018culpable negligence\u2019 could not have been prejudicial to defendant since the jury necessarily found defendant\u2019s actions were intentional and not accidental.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brucker, supra, </em>148 Cal.App.3d at p. 240.)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><em>Brucker, </em>therefore, does not hold that \u201cculpable negligence\u201d or \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d is sufficient for battery or any other general intent crime. It only holds that, if the jury is instructed on the defense of accident and the tendered instruction contains a reference to \u201cculpable negligence,\u201d the jury should also be given the technical meaning of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\"><em>Brucker </em>assumes, without analysis, that the accident defense with the component of \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d is available to a defendant charged with a general intent crime. The assumption is not correct. The accident defense amounts to a claim that the defendant acted without forming the mental state necessary to make his or her actions a crime. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 823, 832 fn. 5 [194 Cal.Rptr. 633]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Calban </em>(1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 578, 584 [135 Cal.Rptr. 441]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gorgol </em>(1953) 122 Cal.App.2d 281, 308 [265 P.2d 69].) If the crime charged requires general criminal intent, then the defense should apply to acts committed \u201cthrough misfortune or by accident, when it appears there was no . . . [general intent] . . . ,\u201d (\u00a7 26, subd. Five) regardless of whether the defendant was criminally negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Where, as here, the defendant is charged with a general intent crime, instruction on \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d is erroneous. We recommend to the GALLIC committee to expressly so advise the trial courts in its use note.  The courts have long recognized that \u201c. . . the reference to \u2018criminal negligence\u2019 should be omitted [from jury instructions] where it is not an issue in the particular case.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Landry </em>(1951) 106 Cal.App.2d 8, 14 [234 P.2d 736]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Becker </em>(1949) 94 Cal.App.2d 434, 442-443 [210 P.2d 871]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Womble </em>(1945) 67 Cal.App.2d 885, 889-890 [155 P.2d 838]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Weaver </em>(1928) 96 Cal.App. 1,11-12 [274 P. 361]; <em>cf., People </em>v. <em>Mendez </em>(1924) 67 Cal.App. 724, 726-727 [228 P. 349]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Price </em>(1908) 9 Cal.App. 218, 221-222 [98 P. 547].)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\n<em>Reversal Required</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Appellant\u2019s state of mind, i.e., whether he acted with general intent or not, was the key issue in the case. Pursuant to <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468], a conviction must be reversed if one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the People\u2019s theories of the case is \u201clegally incorrect\u201d and the reviewing court cannot determine which theory the jury rested its verdict upon. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 69; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 407, 419 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 200, 886 P.2d 1193].) The <em>\u201cGreen </em>rule,\u201d however, has been questioned by our Supreme Court. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 419, fn. 7.) Pursuant to the latest direction from our Supreme Court, reversal for misinstruction on the elements of an offense is governed by the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Swain </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 593, 607 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 390, 909 P.2d 994].) Under either standard, appellant is entitled to reversal and new trial. We have no way of determining whether the jury found that appellant acted with general criminal intent or with \u201ccriminal negligence.\u201d We cannot say that this misinstruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant is entitled to a trial without reference to \u201ccriminal negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Stone (S. J.), P. J., and Gilbert, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-14\">All statutory references are to this code unless otherwise stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b85-9\">The reference to \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d in CALJIC No. 4.45 applies to crimes where the Legislature has said that \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d is a substitute for criminal intent, e.g., involuntary manslaughter. (\u00a7 192, subd. (b); see also 1 Wilkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1988) Elements of Crime, \u00a7 113, pp. 133-134.) Thus, where the defendant is charged with a crime which may be committed with \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d and defends on the theory of accident, CALJIC No. 4.45 should be modified to read: \u201cWhen a person commits an act or makes an omission through misfortune or accident under circumstances that show . . . [no] criminal negligence, he does not thereby commit a crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
