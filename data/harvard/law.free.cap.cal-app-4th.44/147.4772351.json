We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">On April 12, 1993, at 1:20 a.m., Irvine Police Officer J. M. Gunderson stopped Robertson for driving his truck \u201cagainst a red light.\u201d Gunderson noticed Robertson\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and he smelled of alcohol beverages. After testing his coordination skills, Gunderson arrested Robertson and administered a breath test.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">The first test was given at 2:19 a.m. and showed Robertson\u2019s blood-alcohol content (BAG) was .18 percent. However, the second test, given a minute later, registered \u201c.XX.\u201d At 2:22 a.m., a third test was given, producing another reading of .18 percent. At that point, Gunderson confiscated Robertson\u2019s license and issued him a temporary driving permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">At the administrative review hearing, the DMV submitted, inter alia, Gunderson\u2019s sworn statement, which included the breath test results. In turn, Robertson introduced a computer-generated document entitled \u201cADAMS Inquiry,\u201d reflecting various information about the tests. The document also contained a signed and dated handwritten notation which read, \u201cOCSD-Lab regards results with .XX (Mouth Ale Flag) invalid tests. This test is <em>not </em>valid.\u201d (Original italics.) Despite this, the hearing officer ordered Robertson\u2019s license suspended for four months.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">In his petition for mandamus relief, Robertson argued the ADAMS Inquiry notation undermined the presumed reliability of the test results. After taking the matter under submission, the trial court agreed: \u201cPetitioner challenged the reliability of the blood alcohol test results. The burden then fell to the DMV to establish the validity of the test results in order to uphold the license suspension. The DMV chose to accept the [ADAMS Inquiry] printout into evidence and do nothing to refute Petitioner\u2019s contention. [U The writ is granted. Petitioner\u2019s driver\u2019s license to be reinstated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">The DMV argues the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to rebut the presumption of reliability attendant to the breath test results. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">\n<em>Burden of Proof</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">The presumption of reliability is based on compliance with the administrative regulations governing alcohol testing procedures. <em>(Burge </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number><em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 384, 388-389 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 5].) When, as here, the officer certifies 1) the test results were obtained in the regular course of his duties, 2) he is qualified to operate the testing equipment, and 3) the test was administered pursuant to the applicable regulations, we will presume the test results are sufficiently reliable to uphold the suspension. <em>(Ibid.) </em>But once the driver shows \u201cthat official standards were in any respect not observed, the burden shifts to the [DMV] to prove that the test was reliable despite the violation. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Davenport </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 133, 144 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 818]; see also <em>Coombs </em>v. <em>Pierce </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 568 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 249].)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\n<em>Legal Limitations on the Use of Hearsay Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Government Code section 11513, subdivision (c) states, \u201cHearsay evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining other evidence but shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions.\u201d Since the ADAMS Inquiry notation is legally inadmissible hearsay, the DMV maintains it was insufficient, per se, to support the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Initially, we note Government Code section 11513, subdivision (c) serves as a check on the sufficiency of evidence to warrant a license suspension. (See <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 532 [189 Cal.Rptr. 512, 658 P.2d 1313].) While the statute guards against administrative orders lacking evidence of rational probative force <em>(ibid.), </em>it does not expressly limit the manner in which a <em>licensee\u2019s </em>evidence may be considered. In any event, the ADAMS Inquiry notation was not the <em>only </em>evidence pertaining to the reliability issue. The DMV\u2019s own evidence set forth the manner of testing and results obtained. And while this evidence showed the second breath test was \u201cinvalid,\u201d it offered no explanation for this reading. On the other hand, the ADAMS Inquiry notation explained <em>why </em>the test was bad, i.e., the presence of mouth alcohol. Thus, the hearsay notation supplemented the DMV\u2019s evidence consistent with the restrictions set forth in Government Code section 11513, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">\n<em>Review of Trial Court\u2019s Factual Findings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">The DMV alternatively contends the ADAMS Inquiry was pertinent only to the second, \u201cinvalid,\u201d breath test and did not affect the reliability of the first and third tests. The trial court\u2019s contrary interpretation of the record is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s task . . . was to determine, using its independent judgment, whether the weight of the evidence supported the administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>decision. . . . \u2018[U]nder the independent judgment rule, the trial court must weigh the evidence and make its own determination as to whether the administrative findings are sustained.\u2019 . . . The trial court has the \u2018 \u201c \u2018ultimate power of decision . . . [\u00b6] Accordingly, on appeal, we . . . \u2018review the record to determine whether the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence. We must resolve all evidentiary conflicts and draw all legitimate and reasonable inferences in favor of the trial court\u2019s decision. . . . Where the evidence supports more than one inference, we may not substitute our deductions for the trial court\u2019s. . . . We may overturn the trial court\u2019s factual findings only if the evidence before the trial court is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain those findings. . . . [\u00b6] These rules of appellate review apply even where the evidence in the administrative record is undisputed, if that evidence is \u2018subject to conflicting inferences with respect to the crucial issue. In such a case the trial court, . . . may draw its own inferences from the evidence in the record, and if the inferences so drawn are supported by substantial evidence, they are binding on the reviewing court. . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Yordamlis </em>v. <em>Zolin </em>(1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 655, 659-660 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 225], citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">There was much dispute below as to the meaning of the ADAMS Inquiry notation. Did it simply restate the obvious\u2014that the second breath test was invalid, or did it cast doubt on the accuracy of all the tests? The trial court wrestled with the issue at length, observing the notation was \u201crather ambiguous.\u201d In the end though, it found the notation signaled the test results were sufficiently suspect to rebut the presumption of reliability. In this regard, we note, \u201cThe burden imposed upon the licensee of rebutting the presumption favoring the reliability of . . . alcohol tests does not entail the marshaling of complex scientific evidence. . . . [T]he licensee [need only] show[], through cross-examination of the officer or by the introduction of affirmative evidence, that official standards were in any respect not observed[.]\u201d <em>(Davenport </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, supra, </em>6 Cal.App.4th at p. 144.)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">As we have indicated, the primary significance of the ADAMS Inquiry notation lay not in its conclusions about the validity of the test results but in its explanation of mouth alcohol as the cause of the second test reading. The very form on which Officer Gunderson recorded the test results indicates the presence of mouth alcohol requires the officer to stop the test and recommence a 15-minute observation of the driver. (See generally, Cal. Code Regs. tit. 17, \u00a7 1219.3.) Yet, Gunderson obtained a third sample from Robertson immediately after the second one activated the mouth-alcohol flag. Gunderson also overlooked the form\u2019s directive that a third breath sample should be taken \u201conly if 2 breath results do not agree with 0.02 %.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>While these facts do not affirmatively establish the test results were unreliable, they constitute sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding official testing standards were not observed. As the DMV offered no evidence indicating the test results were reliable despite this deviation, the trial court properly granted Robertson\u2019s petition for a writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">At the same time, the facts were sufficiently close to warrant the DMV vigorously litigating the case in the public interest. We cannot say the DMV\u2019s action was \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 800) or its appeal frivolous (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 907) so as to justify an award of attorney fees in Robertson\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The judgment is affirmed. Robertson shall recover his costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Crosby, Acting P. J., and Rylaarsdam, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The trial court impliedly rejected Robertson\u2019s request for attorney fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
