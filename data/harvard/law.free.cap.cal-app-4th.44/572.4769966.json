J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5o\">Appellant Louis P. Campanelli appeals from a judgment in favor of defendants-respondents, The Regents of University of California (The Regents), Robert L. Bockrath and Daniel Boggan, after the court sustained respondents\u2019 demurrer without leave to amend in his action for defamation. We agree with the trial court that the alleged defamatory remarks were nonactionable statements of opinion, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">As this case comes before us after the sustaining of a demurrer, we are guided by the following principles: \u201c \u2018We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. [Citation.] . . .\u2019 Further, we give the complaint a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context. [Citation.] . . . And when it is sustained without leave to amend, we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment: if it can be, the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse; if not, there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Blanks. Kirwan </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 [216 Cal.Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58].) We summarize the allegations of the complaint:</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">Campanelli became head basketball coach at the University of California at Berkeley (Cal) in 1985. Bockrath, who was athletic director at Cal, traveled with the team on a road trip to Arizona in February 1993. Following two difficult losses, Bockrath overheard \u201ca frustrated and angry Campanelli address sharp criticism to the players in the locker room.\u201d On February 8, Bockrath met with Cal\u2019s vice-chancellor, defendant Boggan, and Chancellor Tien, recommending that Campanelli be terminated. Later the same day both defendants met with all but two of the team\u2019s players and learned that seven were threatening to transfer to other schools unless Campanelli was fired. That afternoon, Bockrath called Campanelli into his office and fired him. The contract between Cal and Campanelli permitted Cal to terminate his employment at any time without cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Campanelli\u2019s firing received \u201cwide coverage in local and national press, radio and television.\u201d On or about February 15, 1993, Boggan gave an interview to C.W. Nevius of the San Francisco Chronicle (Chronicle). The article, which is attached as an exhibit to the complaint, states that \u201cJason Kidd\u2019s father felt that former Cal basketball coach Lou Campanelli was putting so much pressure on his son he was making him physically ill.\u201d (Nevius, <em>Cal Grew Weary of Lou\u2019s Tirades, </em>S.F Chronicle (Feb. 16, 1993) p. E1.) The statement was attributed to Boggan. Although Boggan heard the statement from Kidd\u2019s father, Boggan knew the elder Kidd wished to see Campanelli replaced to the extent that he would deliberately make false statements if it would accomplish that result. Boggan\u2019s statement was false and uttered with malice and in reckless disregard for the truth. In fact, Kidd did not become physically ill at any relevant time. Any illness he may have had was not caused by Campanelli.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The same week Bockrath gave an interview to the New York Times (Times) explaining the reasons for Campanelli\u2019s termination. Recalling the coach\u2019s final tirade, Bockrath said, \u201c \u2018There were things that were unwarranted and inexcusable. ... It was so incredibly bad. I said, \u201cSheesh, something must be done.\u201d <em>The players were beaten down and in trouble psychologically. </em>Every other word was a four-letter one. Let me tell you, if I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>hadn\u2019t made that wrong turn, I wouldn\u2019t have known the fix the team was in.\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Bockrath\u2019s allegation that Campanelli inflicted \u201cpsychological damage\u201d on his players was false and defamatory. It was uttered with malice and in reckless disregard of the truth. Bockrath had no evidence of psychological damage to any player when he made the statement that they were \u201cin trouble psychologically.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Campanelli seeks general and punitive damages against Boggan, Bockrath and the their employer, The Regents, as a result of the defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">\n<em>Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Campanelli originally filed a multicount lawsuit in federal district court, including civil rights violation (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983), breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Campanelli\u2019s complaint was dismissed by the district court for \u201cfailure to state a claim.\u201d The court declined to exercise jurisdiction over his pendent state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">Campanelli then filed the present lawsuit in San Francisco Superior Court. The court granted defendants\u2019 motion to transfer the case to Alameda County, and a petition for writ of mandate challenging that ruling was denied by this court. After the parties stipulated that the federal civil rights cause of action would not be pursued and one demurrer was sustained with leave to amend, Campanelli filed the \u201camended complaint\u201d now before us. This complaint sets forth two counts of defamation based on the statement about Jason Kidd made by Boggan and the \u201cin trouble psychologically\u201d statement made by Bockrath.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">The court sustained defendants\u2019 demurrer without leave to amend and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">\n<em>Boggan\u2019s Statement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">\u201cLibel is a false and unprivileged publication by writing . . . which exposes any person to hatred, contempt, ridicule, or obloquy, or which causes him to be shunned or avoided, or which has a tendency to injury him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>in his occupation.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 45.) However, \u201c. . . there is no such thing as a false idea\u201d <em>(Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc. </em>(1974) 418 U.S. 323, 339 [41 L.Ed.2d 789, 805, 94 S.Ct. 2997]). A publication \u201c \u2018must contain a false statement of <em>fact\u2019 </em>to give rise to liability for defamation.\u201d <em>(Jensen </em>v. <em>Hewlett-Packard Co. </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 958, 970 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 83] <em>(Jensen), </em>quoting <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 596, 600 [131 Cal.Rptr. 641, 552 P.2d 425] <em>(Gregory); </em>see also <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Hughes </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 1299, 1309 [278 Cal.Rptr. 306].) Even if they are objectively unjustified or made in bad faith, publications which are statements of <em>opinion </em>rather than fact cannot form the basis for a libel action. <em>(Jensen, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th at p. 971.)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The critical determination of whether an allegedly defamatory statement constitutes fact or opinion is a question of law for the court <em>(Baker </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Herald Examiner </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 254, 260 [228 Cal.Rptr. 206, 721 P.2d 87] <em>(Baker); Gregory, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 601) and therefore suitable for resolution by demurrer. (E.g., <em>Moyer </em>v. <em>Amador Valley J. Union High School Dist. </em>(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 720 [275 Cal.Rptr. 494] <em>(Moyer).) </em>If the court concludes the statement could reasonably be construed as either fact or opinion, the issue should be resolved by a jury. <em>(Good Government Group of Seal Beach, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 672, 680 [150 Cal.Rptr. 258, 586 P.2d 572] <em>(Good Government).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In drawing the distinction between opinion and fact \u201c \u2018California courts have developed a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test. . . .\u2019 [Citation.] The court must put itself in the place of an \u2018 \u201c \u2018average reader\u2019 \u201d \u2019 and decide the \u2018 \u201c \u2018natural and probable effect\u2019 \u201d \u2019 of the statement. [Citations.] The words themselves must be examined to see if they have a defamatory meaning, or if the \u2018 \u201c \u2018sense and meaning . . . fairly presumed to have been conveyed to those who read it\u2019 \u201d \u2019 have a defamatory meaning. [Citations.] Statements \u2018 \u201ccautiously phrased in terms of apparency\u201d \u2019 are more likely to be opinions. [Citations.] [\u00b6] In addition to the language, the context of a statement must be examined. [Citation.] The court must \u2018look at the nature and full content of the communication and to the knowledge and understanding of the audience to whom the publication was directed.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Hofmann Co. </em>v. <em>E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 390, 398 [248 Cal.Rptr. 384].)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Where, as here, the comments are made in the arena of public debate and controversy, a reviewing court has an obligation to examine the whole record in order to ensure that there is no infringement of the First Amendment guarantee of free expression. <em>(Moyer, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.3d 720, 724; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number><em>Milkovich </em>v. <em>Lorain Journal Co. </em>(1990) 497 U.S. 1, 17 [111 L.Ed.2d 1, 16-17, 110 S.Ct. 2695].)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Applying these principles, vice-chancellor Boggan\u2019s utterance that star player Jason Kidd\u2019s father \u201cfelt that . . . Campanelli was putting so much pressure on his son he was making him physically ill\u201d (Nevius, <em>Cal Grew Weary of Lou\u2019s Tirades, </em>S.F Chronicle, <em>supra, </em>at p. E1) cannot be characterized as statement of fact. First, Boggan made clear that the statement did not express his own sentiment, but was something he was told by a parent. Second, the statement was not couched in terms of a factual assertion, but a <em>feeling </em>(\u201cJason Kidd\u2019s father <em>felt </em>. . . .\u201d <em>[ibid., </em>italics added]). The very word \u201cfelt\u201d inherently connotes a subjective judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">As indicated, context can also be a major determinant of whether an alleged defamatory statement constitutes fact or opinion. <em>(Grillo </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 868, 875 [193 Cal.Rptr. 414]; <em>Good Government, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 672, 680.) \u201cThus, where potentially defamatory statements are published in a public debate, a heated labor dispute, or in another setting in which the audience may anticipate efforts by the parties to persuade others to their positions by use of epithets, fiery rhetoric or hyperbole, language which generally might be considered as statements of fact may well assume the character of statements of opinion.\u201d <em>(Gregory, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 594, 601.)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Throughout the Chronicle article, Boggan describes his concern that Campanelli\u2019s tirades were \u201ctearing] [the] kids down.\u201d (Nevius, <em>Cal Grew Weary of Lou\u2019s Tirades, </em>S.F Chronicle, <em>supra, </em>at p. E1.) Even though Kidd tried to stay out of it, \u201c[he] seemed to be having problems.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Cal player Brian Hendrick was quoted as saying, \u201cYou kind of numb yourself to it. . . but lately it came on a more consistent basis. It was happening after every loss, so many personal blows.\u201d Boggan recalled that three of the parents had called to complain about Campanelli and that Kidd\u2019s father was \u201cwatching his son get sick because he couldn\u2019t stand the pressure the coach was putting on him.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Examined against the charged atmosphere surrounding Campanelli\u2019s firing and the highly publicized facts set forth in the article, the statement by the elder Kidd about what he <em>felt </em>constituted either a subjective assessment based on parent intuition or colorful hyperbole illustrative of his apprehension over Campanelli\u2019s behavior, but cannot be construed as intending to convey a verifiable assertion regarding his son\u2019s health.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Parents are not generally thought of as experts in the medical field. A statement such as the one attributed to Kidd\u2019s father has a much different effect on the reader when made by a parent than if the same statement were uttered by a professional with some expertise in the subject matter. (See <em>Slaughter </em>v. <em>Friedman </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 149, 154 [185 Cal.Rptr. 244, 649 P.2d 886].) When a parent states that he feels someone or something is making his son sick, the general public would not reasonably expect the parent to be making an observation which could be proven true or false in a medical sense. Yet the objective \u201ctruth\u201d of such a statement is exactly what Campanelli would have a jury decide. Campanelli is not entitled to a jury trial on the issue of whether Kidd\u2019s father\u2019s \u201cfeeling\u201d about the effect of Campanelli\u2019s behavior on his son was empirically sound or medically justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">As a matter of law, no \u201creasonable fact finder could conclude that the published statements imply a provably false factual assertion.\u201d <em>(Moyer, supra, 225 </em>Cal.App.3d 720, 724-725.)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\n<em>Bockrath\u2019s Statement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AxS\">\n<em>Opinion or Fact</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The action against Bockrath is predicated on his statement to the Times that \u201cThe players were beaten down and in trouble psychologically . . .\u2019\u2019 which, Campanelli asserts, amounts to a false charge that he inflicted psychological damage on his players.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">As with the Boggan statement, context is a crucial factor. The article attached to the complaint is entitled \u201cCampanelli\u2019s tirade last straw for Bockrath.\u201d In it, Bockrath describes how, on the evening of a loss to Arizona State, he entered a wrong door by accident and was shocked when he overheard Campanelli\u2019s lecture to his team. Bockrath, a former football player himself, told the Times \u201c T can swear with the rest,\u2019 but he found himself appalled by what he called Campanelli\u2019s \u2018personal attacks\u2019 on the players.\u201d Bockrath then decided that something must be done. It is at this point Bockrath states that the players were \u201cbeaten down and in trouble psychologically.\u201d The article goes on to relate Campanelli\u2019s side of it as well: \u201c \u2018What you say in a locker room should be between the coach and the players,\u2019 Campanelli said Friday. \u2018No one else\u2019s business. I may have used some curse words . . . there\u2019s not a coach in the country who doesn\u2019t.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Campanelli admits that for purposes of the present action he was a public figure, and that the subject matter was highly publicized. In considering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>totality of the circumstances, the court must factor into the equation the extent to which the public is legitimately concerned with the issue discussed, that is to say, whether the matter is one of public concern.  \u201c[T]he public has an interest in receiving information on issues of public importance even if the trustworthiness of the information is not absolutely certain. The First Amendment is served not only by articles and columns that purport to be definitive but by those articles that, more modestly, raise questions and prompt investigation or debate.\u201d <em>(Ollman </em>v. <em>Evans </em>(D.C. Cir. 1984, en banc) 750 F.2d 970, 983 [242 App.D.C. 301], quoted in <em>Baker, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d 254, 269.) Furthermore, an employer\u2019s evaluation of his employee\u2019s performance contains an inherent degree of subjectivity, and courts should be extremely cautious before allowing such comments to become the basis of a libel action. <em>(Jensen, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th 958, 964-965.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In light of the nature of the controversy and the overall tenor of the article, we cannot conclude the Bockrath statement was intended to be a factual assertion. Bockrath was not seriously maintaining that Cal\u2019s players had suffered \u201cpsychological damage\u201d in any scientific, verifiable sense. Instead, the phrase \u201cin trouble psychologically\u201d was an emphatic way of expressing Bockrath\u2019s central theme that he thought the players felt \u201cbeaten down\u201d as a result of Campanelli\u2019s harsh methods. The totality of the remarks and the background against which they were made dispel the notion that Bockrath\u2019s comment was imbued with the meaning which Campanelli would ascribe to it, i.e., that Cal\u2019s players had suffered measurable damage to their psyches, which could be causally attributed to Campanelli. Instead, Bockrath\u2019s statement was of the kind typically generated in a spirited dispute between two divergent viewpoints\u2014in short, nonactionable opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\n<em>Truth as a Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">In his pleading, Campanelli admits that he was a \u201cstrict disciplinarian\" who exhibited an \u201cemotional outburst\u201d in which he leveled \u201csharp criticism\u201d at the players in a \u201cfit of anger.\u201d The complaint itself alleges that, at the time of his termination, seven of Cal\u2019s players had threatened to leave the team if Campanelli stayed on. In the articles which Campanelli attaches to his complaint, Bockrath calls his outburst \u201cprofane and abusive,\u201d and Cal player Hendricks is quoted as saying Campanelli\u2019s tirades included \u201cso many personal blows\u201d against which the players tried to \u201cnumb\u201d themselves. Campanelli\u2019s complaint does not deny the truth of any of these statements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Truth, of course, is an absolute defense to any libel action. <em>(Gill </em>v. <em>Hughes, supra, </em>227 Cal.App.3d 1299, 1309.) In order to establish the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>defense, the defendant need not prove the literal truth of the allegedly libelous accusation, so long as the imputation is substantially true so as to justify the \u201cgist or sting\u201d of the remark. <em>(Emde </em>v. <em>San Joaquin County etc. Council </em>(1943) 23 Cal.2d 146, 160 [143 P.2d 20, 150 A.L.R. 916].)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Campanelli\u2019s own allegations, coupled with assertions of fact which he attached to his complaint and incorporated therein, show that he engaged in temper tantrums directed at his players which included verbally abusive and profane remarks of a personal nature, to the extent that seven members of the team wanted to transfer unless he was fired. Through these concessions, Campanelli has admitted the essential accuracy of Bockrath\u2019s statement that the players were \u201cin trouble psychologically.\u201d For this additional reason, the demurrer to the cause of action against Bockrath was properly sustained without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Our conclusion that the trial court\u2019s ruling on the demurrer was correct renders it unnecessary to reach Campanelli\u2019s second contention that the San Francisco Superior Court erred in transferring the case to Alameda County. On these allegations, defendants would be entitled to judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Phelan, J., and Haerle, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Even though the article was attached to the complaint in its entirety, none of the above quotations were alleged to be false or libelous, except Boggan\u2019s repetition of the comment by Kidd\u2019s father.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Although he alleges that the Times interview was the inspiration for a Washington Post \u201cop-ed\u201d piece calling Campanelli \u201can abusive bully\u201d who \u201ccursed his players incessantly\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>\u201ctreated his players shabbily,\u201d Campanelli neither denied these charges, nor did he name either the Post or the author of the article as defendants in this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
