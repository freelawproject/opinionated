Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">The Department is the regulatory agency charged with enforcing the Hazardous Waste Control Law (HWCL). (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25100 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">On December 31, 1993, real party in interest, Leach Oil Company, Inc. (Leach Oil) received a grant of interim status<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to operate as an existing hazardous facility. It is authorized to treat, store and/or dispose of used oil, a \u201chazardous waste\u201d under California law. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25250.4.) Leach Oil earlier operated as an authorized used oil recycling facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">On November 2, 1995, the Department filed suit against Leach Oil alleging violations of the HWCL dating back to 1989, and seeking civil penalties, injunctive relief and recovery of investigative costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">On November 8, 1995, employees of the Department arrived at Leach Oil\u2019s facility to conduct an annual inspection, the purpose of which was to determine whether Leach Oil was in compliance with the HWCL. The facility manager denied entry to the premises, and informed the Department it would consent to a subsequent inspection only if Leach Oil\u2019s counsel could be present. The Department informed Leach Oil that it had no objection to the attendance of Leach Oil\u2019s counsel at such an inspection, but that the Department could not agree to waive its ability to conduct unannounced inspections.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">On November 14, 1995, the Department applied to the superior court for an administrative inspection warrant pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1822.50 et seq.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The superior court denied the application stating that the Department\u2019s regularly scheduled inspection would constitute \u201cfree discovery\u201d in the pending lawsuit, and that the Department could gain access to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1422\">*1422</page-number>and inspect the facility only through the civil discovery process.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This petition for writ of mandate followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">A. <em>Contention</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">The Department contends the superior court\u2019s \u201cdenial of the inspection warrant... is clearly erroneous as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">B. <em>Administrative Inspection Warrants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\"><em>Camara </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 523 [18 L.Ed.2d 930, 87 S.Ct. 1727] <em>(Camara), </em>sets the standard for administrative inspection warrants. In that case, a city health inspector entered an apartment building to make a routine annual inspection for possible violations of the city\u2019s housing code. The inspector was informed by the apartment manager that Camara was using the rear of his leasehold as a personal residence. The inspector, claiming that the building\u2019s occupancy permit did not allow residential use of the ground floor, confronted Camara and demanded that he permit an inspection of the premises. Camara refused to allow the inspection because the inspector lacked a search warrant. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 526-527 [18 L.Ed.2d at pp. 933-934].) The court held that such searches without a warrant violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 540 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 942].) In so doing, the court stated that \u201c[i]n cases in which the Fourth Amendment requires that a warrant to search be obtained, \u2018probable cause\u2019 is the standard by which a particular decision to search is tested against the constitutional mandate of reasonableness. To apply this standard, it is obviously necessary first to focus upon the governmental interest which allegedly justifies official intrusion upon the constitutionally protected interests of the private citizen.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 534-535 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 939].) In <em>Camara, </em>the inspection programs at issue were \u201caimed at securing city-wide compliance with minimum physical standards for private property.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 535 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 939].) The primary governmental interest at stake was \u201cto prevent even the unintentional development of conditions which are hazardous to public health and safety.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court concluded that \u201c[i]n determining whether a particular inspection is reasonable\u2014and thus in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1423\">*1423</page-number>whether there is probable cause to issue a warrant for that inspection\u2014the need for the inspection must be weighed in terms of these reasonable goals of code enforcement.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court, acknowledging that \u201cthere can be no ready test for determining reasonableness other than by balancing the need to search against the invasion which the search entails,\u201d concluded area code-enforcement inspections are reasonable. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 536-537 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 940].) The court went on to state, \u201cHaving concluded that the area inspection is a \u2018reasonable\u2019 search of private property within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, it is obvious that \u2018probable cause\u2019 to issue a warrant to inspect must exist if reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting an area inspection are satisfied with respect to a particular dwelling. Such standards, which will vary with the municipal program being enforced, may be based upon the passage of time, the nature of the building ... or the condition of the entire area, but they will not necessarily depend upon specific knowledge of the condition of the particular dwelling. It has been suggested that so to vary the probable cause test from the standard applied in criminal cases would be to authorize a \u2018synthetic search warrant\u2019 and thereby to lessen the overall protections of the Fourth Amendment. [Citation.] But we do not agree. The warrant procedure is designed to guarantee that a decision to search private property is justified by a reasonable governmental interest. But reasonableness is still the ultimate standard. If a valid public interest justifies the intrusion contemplated, then there is probable cause to issue a suitably restricted search warrant.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 538-539 [18 L.Ed.2d at p. 941.)</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">In order to carry out the purposes of the HWCL, the Department is authorized \u201cat any reasonable hour of the day,\u201d to enter and inspect a facility where \u201chazardous wastes are stored, handled, processed, disposed of, or being treated to recover resources.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a725185, subd. (a)(1).) Section 25185 specifically authorizes the Department to obtain, if necessary, an administrative inspection warrant pursuant to section 1822.50 et seq. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25185, subd. (a).) Section 1822.50 is coexistent with the rule established in <em>Camara.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Under section 1822.51 an inspection warrant \u201cshall be issued upon cause . . . supported by an affidavit, particularly describing ... the purpose for which the inspection is made.\u201d Under section 1822.52: \u201cCause shall be deemed to exist if either reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting a routine or area inspection are satisfied with respect to the particular place, dwelling, structure, premises, or vehicle, or there is reason to believe that a condition of nonconformity exists with respect to the particular place, dwelling, structure, premises or vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1424\">*1424</page-number>(1) <em>Public Interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Our Legislature enacted the HWCL to protect California\u2019s citizens and its environment from the unreasonable threat posed by the improper treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25100.) In so doing, our legislators emphasized the long-term threat to public health and to air and water quality posed by mishandled hazardous wastes. (See Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25100, subds. (a), (b).) Regarding used oil, the Legislature found that \u201csignificant quantities of used oil are wastefully disposed of or improperly used by means which pollute the water, land, and air, and endanger the public health, safety, and welfare.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25250, subd. (a); see also \u00a7 25250.4.)  Our Legislature then declared that in order to provide the type of protection our citizens and environment deserve, \u201c. . . it is in the public interest to establish regulations and incentives which ensure that the generators of hazardous waste employ technology and management practices for the safe handling, treatment, recycling, and destruction of their hazardous wastes prior to disposal.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25101, subd. (a).) \u201c[W]hat constitutes a public purpose is primarily a matter for the Legislature, and its discretion will not be disturbed by the courts so long as that determination has a reasonable basis. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Board of Supervisors </em>v. <em>Dolan </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 237, 243 [119 Cal.Rptr. 347].)</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">(2) <em>Reasonable Legislative or Administrative Standards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">Our Legislature has declared that \u201c[hazardous waste laws must be enforced by qualified public officials to protect the health and safety of California workers and residents as well as the environment,\u201d and that \u201cviolations must receive enforcement attention and action quickly and in relation to the severity of the offense as measured by the danger to, or potential to endanger, public health and safety and the environment.\u201d (See Historical and Statutory Notes, 40B West\u2019s Ann. Health &amp; Saf. Code (1996 pocket supp.) \u00a7 25110.8.5, p. 91.) Enforcement cannot be accomplished without the unannounced, routine inspections authorized by Health and Safety Code section 25185.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">Health and Safety Code section 25185 authorizes the Department to enter, inspect and photograph hazardous waste management facilities, to take samples of any waste materials existing on site, and inspect and copy records.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">Because Leach Oil operates under \u201cinterim status\u201d and handles used oil, it is subject to additional regulations. For example, it is obligated to comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1425\">*1425</page-number>with certain detailed requirements of chapter 15 of the Department\u2019s regulations. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 67800.1, subd. (c).) These regulations include training requirements, hazardous waste acceptance and testing procedures, self-inspection requirements, emergency planning, recordkeeping, and hazardous waste tank construction. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 66265.13 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The foregoing regulations and legislative declarations provide ample evidence of the Legislature\u2019s intent to closely regulate and monitor hazardous waste facilities such as Leach Oil, and demonstrate that the legislative and administrative standards for conducting unannounced, routine inspections of such facilities are reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The affidavit in support of the inspection warrant specified the state code sections authorizing the Department to conduct the inspection, and described the standards for the inspection. The affidavit thus provided the necessary probable cause for the warrant to issue, pursuant to sections 1822.51 and 1822.S2.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">C. <em>Pendency of the Civil Suit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">The superior court ruled that the Department could not conduct its ordinary compliance inspection at Leach Oil as long as it had litigation pending against the company, and that the Department was required to conduct any inspection through the civil discovery process. The court\u2019s decision is flawed for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">First, the ruling would exempt the greatest part of Leach Oil\u2019s operations from regulatory oversight. The Department has set forth 14 causes of action alleging, among other things, that \u201c[s]oil and gravel contaminated with hazardous wastes and constituents are present throughout the Leach Oil facility.\u201d Although the behavior alleged is egregious, it does not touch upon all of Leach Oil\u2019s regulatory requirements. Unless the Department is allowed to conduct its regular inspection, it will be unable to verify Leach Oil\u2019s compliance with those statutory and regulatory requirements that are not part of the pending litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">Second, the conducting of an administrative inspection through the civil discovery process would effectively be limited by section 2017, subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1426\">*1426</page-number>(a) which provides that only information \u201crelevant\u201d to the subject matter involved in the pending action may be discovered. (See <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1539, 1546 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 896].) Imposing such a limitation on the Department would prevent it from conducting the comprehensive review of the facility, its financial records, etc., contemplated by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Third, the superior court\u2019s ruling would foreclose an unannounced inspection. Requiring the Department to proceed by \u201ccivil discovery\u201d means the Department would be required to conduct any inspection pursuant to section 2031. Rather than showing up unannounced, the Department\u2019s representatives would henceforth be required to give at least 30 days\u2019 notice. (\u00a7 2031, subd. (c)(2).) The Department conducts its annual regulatory inspection without advance notice to the facility. Such \u201csurprise inspections\u201d enable the Department to get an accurate picture of each facility\u2019s operations. Even advance notice of a few hours may be sufficient time for a hazardous waste management facility to straighten up, to update records, and to otherwise conceal or eliminate violations. If an inspection is to \u201cbe effective and serve as a credible deterrent, unannounced . . . inspections are essential.\u201d <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Biswell </em>(1972) 406 U.S. 311, 316 [32 L.Ed.2d 87, 92, 92 S.Ct. 1593] [recognizing that a gun dealer could quickly conceal gun control law violations].)</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The court in <em>In re Stanley Plating Co., Inc. </em>(D.Conn. 1986) 637 F.Supp. 71 passed on a problem similar to the one facing this court. There, an interim status hazardous waste management facility sought to prevent the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from conducting its usual compliance evaluation inspection. Stanley Plating argued that because it was a defendant in a civil enforcement action filed by the EPA, the agency could gain access to the facility only through a motion to inspect under rule 34(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C.).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court held that \u201c[t]here is nothing in the statutes that suggests any such limitation being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1427\">*1427</page-number>so intended by Congress. Further, there is no logic to such a restriction.\u201d <em>(In re Stanley Plating Co., Inc., supra, </em>637 F.Supp. at p. 72.)</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Important public policy concerns are at issue here. The Department inspects hazardous facilities annually and, in the course of so doing, routinely discovers violations of the hazardous waste requirements. Typically, the Department files litigation only against those facilities that are intransigent or whose violations significantly threaten health and safety. If the court\u2019s order were the general rule, it is precisely those facilities with a record of enforcement violations which would receive the least surveillance. A hazardous waste management facility whose non compliance warrants civil litigation should not be rewarded by restrictions on the enforcement agency\u2019s ability to monitor compliance with public health and environmental requirements during the litigation. Nothing in the HWCL, or the Code of Civil Procedure, suggests otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">III. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">This is a proper case for issuance of a peremptory writ in the first instance. (\u00a7 1008; <em>Palma </em>v. <em>U.S. Industrial Fasteners, Inc. </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 171, 177-180 [203 Cal.Rptr. 626, 681 P.2d 893].) The matter having been fully briefed, issuance of an alternative writ would add nothing to the exposition of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing respondent to vacate its order of November 14, 1995, denying petitioner\u2019s application for an administrative inspection warrant, and to enter a new and different order granting the application. The stay imposed on January 24, 1996, is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">Boren, P. J., and Zebrowski, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-12\">\u201cInterim status\u201d is an authorization granted by the Department which allows a facility to continue to operate pending review and decision on the facility\u2019s formal permit application.
