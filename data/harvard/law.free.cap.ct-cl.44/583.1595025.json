The claimant not coming within the terms of the act 3d March, \u00cd865, giving three months\u2019 extra pay to certain military officers, the Court of Claims decides that <em>\u201c the claim is neither a legal nor an equitable claim against the United States and that the court is therefore without jurisdiction to liquidate the amount, the same resting in the bounty of Congress.\u201d </em>The claimant files a motion in the Supreme Court for a mandamus to compel the Court of Claims \u201c <em>to find the liquidated amount to which the petitioner will be entitled,\u201d </em>if the bill for his relief should be enacted as a law.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b615-11\">Ordered by the Supreme Court that the petitioner\u2019s motion be denied.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number><em>The Reporter's </em>statement of the case:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-5\">The following is the record presented by the claimant to the Supreme Court and the final order of the court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-6\">In the Supreme Court of the United States.

Pearson was enrolled July 1, 1863, as private, Company M, Twenty-first Pennsylvania Cavalry Volunteers, for six months. He reenlisted for three years as a veteran volunteer on February 10, 1864, was promoted to first lieutenant and adjutant February 26, 1864, and was in the service of the United States in such grade of first lieutenant and adjutant on March 3, 1865. Said claimant continued in the service of the United States from March 3, 1865, until April 7, 1865, at which time he was discharged from the military service by order of the Secretary of War \u201c on account of physical disability from wounds received in action.\u201d The claim herein is neither a legal nor an equitable claim against the United States and the court is therefore without jurisdiction to liquidate the amount, the same resting in the bounty of Congress.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-17\">BRIEF IN SUPPORT OF PETITION.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-18\">Point I.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-19\"><em>Pearson has a clear legal right to have the Court of Claims report to the President of the Senate the amount which he will receive and the Government pay if Congress should see fit to enact into law Senate hill </em>7013, <em>first session Sixtieth Congress.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-20\">The constitutional right of petition to Congress becomes a farce if the machinery provided by Congress for the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>position of such petitions is to be stopped. Congress was fully justified in refusing to legislate upon private claims without a full knowledge of the facts, one of the most important of which in the case of a petition for a gift, grant, or bounty alleged to be founded on some meritorious consideration is the amount of the public moneys demanded by the claimant or which will be withdrawn from the public treasury if some bill introduced for the payment of his claim should become a law. When, therefore, the Court of Claims is directed to ascertain in a judicial manner what the facts are in relation to any such claim it might well be argued that the amount of the claim is not the least important to them. To avoid, however, the slightest room for doubt Congress has expressly required that the Court of Claims find and report to it the amount. There is but one qualification imposed by the Tucker Act upon the duty thus to find the amount, and that is that the same can be liquidated. In the case at bar not only can the amount be liquidated, but it is already liquidated and requires of the court nothing but a statement of what the evidence, consisting of official records of the United States, show to be the amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-5\">The petitioner in his request to the court to find the facts material to a proper consideration of his claim by Congress asked the court to find and report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-6\">\u201c 4. Three months\u2019 pay proper of claimant\u2019s grade would amount to $189.66.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-7\">This the court declined to do on the sole ground that the claim was not \u201c legal or equitable.\u201d Its determination that the claim is not \u201c legal or equitable \u201d is final and can not be inquired into by this court in this proceeding. The court below did, however, find that the bill was one to pay a gift, grant, or bounty, as otherwise it would have been without jurisdiction to find any of the facts. It is the petitioner\u2019s contention that if Senate bill 1013 is for a gift, grant, or bounty it is equally the duty of the Court of Claims to find and report the amount to the Senate. It is submitted that the language of the Tucker Act is plain and unequivocal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-8\">Great weight should be given to the practical and long continued- construction of this act given to it by the court to which it is uniquely addressed. From 1881 until 1907 it never appears to have been even suggested by the court that its duty to find the amount depended upon the court finding as a conclusion of law that the claim was legal or equitable, or that in addition to merely finding the facts it was its duty to advise Congress of the propriety or irnpro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>priety of the proposed legislation. During that period of twenty years thousands of findings of facts have been transmitted to the Houses referring the bills. The new construction of the fourteenth section of the Tucker Act began with the following obiter in the case of <em>\"Widmayer </em>v. <em>U. 8., </em>42 Ct. Cls. 524:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-4\">\u201cAs the matter before us is not a legal or equitable demand against the District of Columbia or the General Government^ it is for Congress to proceed with the matter as an act of charity, if at all, and by way of exception to the policy of the Government in such cases. The amount of an appropriation, if . any shall be made, also, rests with Congress. For this reason and because the demand is not a legal or equitable claim, the court can not estimate an amount.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-5\"><em>(WTidmayer </em>v. <em>U. 8., </em>supra.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-6\">If Senate bill 7013 has for its purpose making Pearson and the other volunteer officers therein named objects of the Government\u2019s charity, such charity can not at least be truly said to be \u201c by way of exception to the policy of the Government in such cases.\u201d The bounty or gratuity in question was given by the act of March 3, 1865, to some thousands of officers, and when that act was before this court in the case of <em>U. 8. </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>9 Wall., 614, there was no suggestion that it involved an unconstitutional dissipation of the public moneys of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-7\">That a case of that kind might possibly arise is suggested but not passed upon by this court in <em>U. 8. </em>v. <em>Realty Go., </em>163 U. S., 427. The benefits of the act of March 3, 1865, were afterwards extended by the act of July 3, 1884, to include the families of officers killed in action between March 3, 1865, and April 9, 1865, or even to those who died of disabilities incurred in the service between those dates. It is submitted that to further extend the benefit of the act of 1865 to an officer discharged, because of a gunshot wound received in battle two days before he would have become legally entitled to the three months\u2019 extra pay, which this court in the Merrill case said was given to enable the volunteer officers to live until they could readjust themselves to civil life, would not be to perform' an act of charity by way of exception to the policy of the Government or make an unconstitutional use of the public moneys.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b621-8\">It is further submitted that if Senate bill 7013 became a law and the accounting officers refused to pay Pearson $189.66 because of the unconstitutionality of the law, then if Pearson sued in the Court of Claims that court might. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>find it necessary to pass upon the act in question as involving a mere \u201c gratuity \u201d or \u201c act of charity.\u201d To do so in advance is not to comply with either the letter or spirit of the fourteenth section of the Tucker Act, which imposes no such duty upon the Court of Claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-5\">POINT II.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-6\">The duty of the Court of Claims, under the Tucker Act, to find the amount to which the petitioner would be entitled under Senate bill 7018, is plain and unequivocal. Congress has not called upon that court to express its opinion as to whether any amount should be appropriated by it for the relief of petitioner; it requests that court to furnish it information from which it may form its own opinion as to the propriety of the proposed legislation. This it has refused to do upon the mistaken theory that its jurisdiction extends only to references of such bills as have for their object the payment of a \u201c claim legal or equitable,\u201d and not to bills conferring a \u201c grant, gift, or bounty.\u201d Its action in such cases being final (there being no appeal or writ of error) operates as a partial repeal of the act, unless this court af-' fords a remedy. When a court refuses to take jurisdiction of a 'case properly before it, or having taken jurisdiction refuses to proceed and determine it, mandamus lies. This court has original jurisdiction to issue the writ to any federal court over which it has immediate appellate jurisdiction. (Ex parte Connaway, 178 U. S., 421; ex parte Ho-horst, 150 U. S., 653.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ABu\">_ The writ has twice issued from this court to the Court of Claims, once on the application of the claimant to compel the court to hear a motion for a new trial (Ex parte Roberts, 15 Wall., 384) and once on the application of the Attorney-General (16 Wall., 699).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-8\">Respectfully submitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-9\">Charles D.
