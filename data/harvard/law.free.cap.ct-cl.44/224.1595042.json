Cls. R., 178. The principal fact continues to be that the War Department notified the citizens of Pittsburg before the work was done that fortifications around the city were no part of the plan of the department and that if temporary defenses were to be thrown up the citizens must do the work themselves at their own cost. The Senate refers under the Tucker Act a bill providing for payment to the claimants of the amounts expended by them for labor and material furnished by them \u201c <em>to General Broolcs on the fortifications around Pittsburg for the benefit of the United States.\"</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b256-9\">I.The <em>allowances </em>made by the court in Congressional cases are not allowances in the sense in which the term is used in judicial tribunals, but are merely ancillary and advisory to Congress.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b256-10\">II.In these cases the findings do not imply that the claims are payable at law or in equity.

That they are residents of the city of Pittsburg, State of Pennsylvania, and citizens of the United States of America.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-6\">II.

That.Maj. Gen. W. T. Brooks, of the United States Army, now deceased, was in the year 1863 in command of th\u00e9 Department of the Monongahela, with headquarters at Pittsburg, Pa., by order of the Secretary of War, issued June 8, 1863.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-8\">IV. That on his arrival in Pittsburg two days later he found a telegram from the War Department awaiting him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>to the effect that he could not be too early or too busily at work, as Pittsburg would certainly be the point aimed at by Stuart\u2019s raid which was daily expected, and that he should frankly inform the people of Pittsburg that they should be at work.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-4\">V. That on June 14, 1863, he received a telegram from General Halleck informing him that Lee\u2019s army was in motion toward the Shenandoah Valley, and that Pittsburg should be put in a defensible condition as rapidly as possible; that immediately upon the receipt of the dispatches aforesaid, General Brooks called together as many of the leading manufacturers and business men of Pittsburg as he could reach, to meet him Sunday night, June 14, 1863, at the Monongahela Plouse in said city for a conference. At that meeting General Brooks explained the military exigency which existed, and the necessity for immediately fortifying* the city; that he had neither men nor money to erect fortifications, and appealed to them to close their factories and workshops, and early next morning furnish him the needed men. He also stated that he would issue vouchers which would be paid by the Government at the rate of $1.25 a day, for the wages which he desired them to advance to the men whom they would furnish; that thereupon the citizens present adopted a resolution to \u201c close their establishments at once and obtain and place at the disposal of General Brooks all the men they could from their workshops, for the purpose of fortifying the city.\u201d They further pledged themselves to the men engaged at their respective establishments \u201c that they would keep an account of their time, and pay at' the rate of $1.25 per day for their labor on said fortifications.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-5\">VI. That promptly the next morning, at the time and place agreed upon, the men required were so furnished, as were also horses and carts; that upon the completion of the fortifications General Brooks reported toithe War Department that in answer to the call for labor on the defensive works the whole community responded in the most gratifying manner. Mills, factories, and workshops of various kinds had been closed; that rifle pits had been made by miles, and batteries and forts constructed sufficient to mount guns by the hundred.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>VII. That soon after the fortifications were so completed the claimants furnished General Brooks a sworn account of the labor and materials furnished by them, together with the amount of wages paid by them to the men, whereupon General Brooks, in compliance with his promise made at the conference aforesaid that the vouchers would be paid by the Government, attached to said account a voucher certifying to the correctness of the account, and that the labor was furnished on appeal from him to the citizens of Pittsburg to put the place in a state of defense, and that the labor was necessary for the public service.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-5\">VIII. That about the same time other vouchers issued to other persons by the quartermaster of the 'Department of the Monongahela, for work done by General Brooks\u2019 order in connection with said fortifications, were paid by the United States on presentation, and by public act of Congress, No. 99, approved February 24, 1905, pages 23 and 24, identical vouchers issued by General Brooks for work done at about the same time on said fortifications have been paid, but the vouchers issued to claimants have not been paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-6\">IX. That at the time of the appeal aforesaid General Brooks was without men or means to erect such fortifications; that the erection of the fortifications was rendered necessary for the protection of Pittsburg and Allegheny City, as these cities were at the time important military depots, with large depositories of army supplies belonging to the United States, and also the principal line of railroad communication between the Eastern and the Western States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-7\">X. That these claims were presented to the War Department for payment in March, 1866, where they remained under xrarious adverse rulings as to the legal liability of the Government to pay, when in June, 1875, they were sent to the accounting officers of the Treasury Department, and in August, 1875, the Third Auditor advised the allowance of these claims, but his decision was overruled by the Comptroller, and the latter on June 29,. 1876, advised that they be sent to this court, as the accounting officers had no jurisdiction of them, and in May, 1890, the Secretary of the Treasury referred them to this court under section 1063 of the Bevised Statutes, whereupon petitions were filed in this court Janu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>ary 20, 1892, praying judgment, but the petitions were dismissed March 5, 1894, on the ground that the reference did not give the court jurisdiction; no decision was had on the merits of the claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-5\">Thereafter the papers at the request of claimants were returned to the Treasury Department, where various unsuccessful efforts were made, running over several years, to have these claims reopened and allowed, and finally the claimants made repeated applications to Congress for relief, in the Fifty-fourth, Fifty-fifth, Fifty-sixth, Fifty-seventh, and Fifty-eighth Congresses, and while Senate bill 1360 was pending in the Fifty-eighth Congress it was by resolution of the United States Senate, on the 3d day of March, 1905, referred to this court for a finding of facts under the act of Congress approved March 3, 1887, commonly known as the Tucker Act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-6\">XI. During the whole period from the time these claims were first presented to the War Department, in 1866, to the present time they have been prosecuted with reasonable diligence. The petitioners, as aforesaid, are the sole owners of said claims, and that no assignment or any part thereof, or interest therein has been made, and that the claimants as aforesaid, are justly entitled to the amount claimed from the United States, after allowing all just credits and offsets, and they request that a finding of facts be made and certified to Congress as required by the act of Congress approved March 3, 1887, known as the Tucker Act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-7\">The cases were brought to a hearing on the 19th day of October, 1908.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-8\">Mr. Vedantus B. Edwards appeared for the claimants, and the Attorney-General, by S. S. Ashbaugh, his assistant and under his direction, appeared for the defense of the interests of the United States.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-9\">The court, upon the evidence and after considering the briefs and arguments of counsel on both sides, made the following findings of fact:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-10\">I. The claimants herein were loyal to the Government of the United States throughout the late civil war.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-11\">II. On or about the month of May or early in June, 1863, the citizens of Pittsburg, Pa., became alarmed for the safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>of the place because the Confederate forces were invading Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and southern Ohio. They appointed a committee of their number to wait on the Secretary of War and General Halleck, and <em>requested that shillful engineer officers be detailed to superintend the construction of fortifications around the </em>city, <em>which was done. The committee were at the time informed by the Secretary of War that the fortifications around the city of Pittsburg constituted no part of the plan or purpose of the War Department; that the men and money at the disposal of the Department were needed to carry out other purposes of the Govern</em>ment.i <em>and that neither men nor money could be furnished </em>them, <em>but that the citizens must do the worh themselves at their own expense.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-5\">III. Thereafter, pursuant to the request made by the citi.zens of Pittsburg, Pa., upon the United States to cooperate with said citizens in the defense of Pittsburg, an order was issued assigning Major-General Brooks to the command of the Department of the Monongahela, with headquarters at Pittsburg, to embrace that portion of Pennsylvania west of Johnstown and Laurel Hill range of mountains, and Hancock, Brooke, and Ohio counties in the State of Virginia, and Columbiana, Jefferson, and Belmont counties in the State of Ohio. Volunteer infantry, artillery, and cavalry were ordered enrolled and organized for the protection and defense of public property there. On June 11, 1863, General Brooks assumed command, and ivas told by the general in chief of the army that Pittsburg and Wheeling should be put in a defensible condition. The Secretary of War likewise informed General Brooks that Pittsburg would be a point aimed at by Stuart\u2019s raid, which might be daily expected, and that General Brooks should frankly inform the people of Pittsburg that they must be at work. Whether General Brooks informed the people of Pittsburg does not appear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-6\">IV. Thereupon General Brooks notified leading manufacturers and business men of Pittsburg as to the necessity for a conference and immediate action, and thereupon the following resolutions were adopted by the citizens present, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>\u201cAt a meeting of the manufacturers and business men of the city, assembled at the Monongahela House Sunday evening, Thomas Bakewell, esq., was called to the chair, and G.

Brooks to declare martial law forthwith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-8\">\u201c 4. Resolved, That the manufacturers and business men hereby pledge themselves to stop their establishments tomorrow (Monday), and that they will obtain and place at the disposal of Maj. Gen. Brooks all the men they can from their differenent establishments for the purpose of fortifying the city; and, further, that they pledge themselves to the persons engaged at their respective establishments that they will keep an account of their time and pay at the rate of $1.25 per day for said labor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-9\">\u201c5. Resolved, That the directors of the Pittsburg, Steuben-ville and Pennsylvania and other railroads be requested to transfer their laborers and implements to the orders of the commandant of the department.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-10\">\u201c 6.

The whole community responded to the call for labor on defensive works and intrenchments. Mills, factories, and works of various kinds were closed, and their employees sent to the intrenchments. Stores, wholesale and retail, were closed and represented on the works. Liquor dealers, miners, builders, and others, including the colored population, were well represented and did their share in fortifying their city. Every class of people or business was represented.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>VI. Some time after the completion of the work certificates were issued for work on the fortifications and intrenchments around Pittsburg. General Brooks attached his certificate to the effect that he believed the account as shown by the \u2022certificate was correct and just, and that the labor was furnished on an appeal from him to the citizens of Pittsburg to put the place in a state of defense, and that the labor was necessary for the public service.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-5\">VII. Before any of this work was done the general in \u25a0chief addressed a letter of instructions to Brigadier-General Barnard (an engineer ofiicer assigned to duty at Pitts-burg), under date of June 8, 1863, stating to him that it was not anticipated that any hostile demonstration would be made against Pittsburg other than a mere raid, and as any projected works must be constructed by the voluntary labor of the citizens, the projected defenses should be of limited extent and of the most simple character \u2014 mere earth batteries- and rifle pits. This letter of instructions was accompanied with the following statement from General in Chief H. W. Halleck, in words and figures following, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-6\">\u201c I would also suggest the propriety of your calling on and \u25a0consulting the mayor and municipal authorities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-7\">\u201c It should be distinctly understood that there is no appropriation for fortifying Pittsburg, and no troops which can probably be spared for garrisoning that place. The sole object of your mission and that of Capt. Comstock, at the present time, is to give to the citizens of Pittsburg such assistance and instruction as may be practicable in preparing themselves against a possible rebel raid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-8\">Brigadier-General Barnard remained in Pittsburg but four days, and by the act of then leaving under orders dissolved all official connection with the defenses of Pittsburg. His official report shows that certain employees were ordered from Washington to aid in the defenses. Whether General' Barnard informed the people of Pittsburg of the order given to him by General Halleck does not appear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-9\">VIII. June 14, 1863, Major-General Brooks issued an order directing that the requisite transportation be furnished to supply subsistence to the troops in the different camps and working parties employed on the fortification or in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>vicinity. In compliance witli the instructions, teams, carts, and drivers were employed and rendered service, for which, certificates were made out and <em>were paid.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-5\">IX.

The claim of Jones &amp; Laughlins was presented to the War Department in March, 1866, and referred with the other claimants herein to the Chief of Engineers of the United States Army April 17, 1866. The Chief of Engineers, United States Army, made an adverse report on the ground that the claims were not presented in the names of the parties who actually performed the work, but in those of their employers, and that Captain Craighill, who supervised the construction of the work, had no funds to pay, which the citizens knew, and that the only expense to which the Government was to be put was for involuntary work; that much of the work was voluntary, and such as was not was claimed to be paid by individual citizens whose property was threatened; that so far as the Government was concerned, all the Avork was voluntary, since it had made no demand or request for the same, and it was only asked to furnish scientific minds to direct the proper labor, and that this was readily furnished by the Government; that there having been no requisition made upon the Government to meet these contemplated outlays and no authority having been given to conduct this work for the Government, nothing could be done Avithout special legislation upon the subject; that from the statements of the engineer officers who superintended the construction of the defensive works, these works were built and the outlays made by and at the desire of the citizens of Pittsburg to save their property, their workshops, and their foundries from threatened destruction and without the thought or object of defending any other portion of the State, and Avhich Avorks were unconnected Avith any other system of government defenses. That these claims Avere parallel to the cases of the cities of New York and Philadelphia in the war of 1812, when those cities were threatened by the British, when men of every trade, occupation, and profession left their daily avocations and rushed to the heights surrounding those cities and threw up works necessary to defend them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-5\">September 3, 1866, the claims were referred by the Secretary of War to the claims commission of the War Department, and on October 17, 1866, that commission decided against their validity on the ground that the expenses were incurred by the citizens of Pittsburg for their personal pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>tection and that of their property, and formed no part of the plans adopted by the United States for the defense of the State of Pennsylvania and the expulsion of the invaders; that it was an independent and spontaneous movement on the part of the citizens, entered into without reference to the plans and arrangements of the federal authorities, and to forward which they asked the aid and supervision\u2018of skillful officers and nothing more; that the whole affair was a private enterprise on the part of the citizens of Pittsburg, not needed in the opinion of the military authorities or embraced in their plan of operations, but which they were willing to further in the manner proposed by the citizens, in order to allay public excitement and induce a greater feeling of security.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-5\">October 25, 1866, Secretary of War Stanton approved and confirmed the decision of the claims commission rejecting the claims of a large number of the claimants, Avhich included Jones &amp; Laughlins and the other claimants herein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-6\">June, 1872, one of the claimants, who alleged that he had expended money in defending his city, resubmitted his claim to the Secretary of War, and it was referred to the Chief of Engineers, United States Army, who reported that he could see \u201c no good reason for payment of this claim or of the remaining 158 * * * of similar character,\u201d and on July 5, 1872, the Secretary of War decided to adhere to the original decision of Hon.

On March 5, 1894, said cause was heard by the Court of Claims, and upon the findings of fact made by the court and specifically set forth in the case of <em>Armstrong et al. </em>v. <em>United States </em>(29 C.

After the cases were consolidated, by consent, they were remanded with leave to all the claimants to amend and take testimony. It had not been shown that the payments for the expenses alleged to have been incurred had been made, but the allegation on that point rested in each case entirely upon <em>the belief </em>of an army officer, which was insufficient to prove a material fact. <em>(Jones &amp; Laughlins et al. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>42 C. Cls. R., 178.)</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">The findings now show payment in 7 of the original petitions, but the competent evidence does not establish the payment of any amount in the claims of James Wood &amp; Co. and Lyon, Shorb &amp; Co. The claim set forth in the petition of Singer, Nimmick &amp; Co., has been abandoned because the principal party in interest deemed it better to discontinue on account of the number of heirs and the smallness of the share of each and from the fact that he was too busy to give the matter attention. The claim of King &amp; Pennock has likewise been abandoned by the claimants because the facts could not be proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">Bills for the relief of the parties directed the Secretary of the Treasury to pay out of any money not otherwise appropriated the sums of money expended and paid by the claimants, or by the firms respectively represented by them, \u201c for labor and materials furnished in eighteen hundred and sixty-three to General Brooks and the fortifications around Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, <em>for the benefit of the United </em>States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>The reference of these bills with the accompanying papers creates no cause of action and no legal right save that of making the Government defendant in a judicial tribunal, and of having the facts found with an amount. Because it is sometimes erroneously stated that the reports transmitting our findings of fact under the fourteenth section' of the statute cited are \u201c allowances \u201d in the full sense in which the term is employed as applied to the action of judicial tribunals, the court takes occasion to show that references of the kind here mentioned are merely ancillary and advisory to Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">This is entirely plain from the language of the section, but is adverted to because of the confusion created by the frequent repetition of the statement that the action of the court in finding facts has the same effect as in cases under the general jurisdiction, where judgment may be rendered against the Government with the right of appeal to the Supreme Court in all cases where the judgment is against the United States. In finding and reporting facts in cases strictly congressional there is no implication that any claim referred under the fourteenth section of the Tucker Act is well founded in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The findings on these particular claims which show payments for certain expenses incurred do not mean that the court \u201c allows \u201d the amounts or recommends payment. Nor do the findings raise any implication that the claims were ever payable at law or in equity. On the contrary, they were never actionable under any rule or statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">But it is alleged in the respective petitions that the claims were presented to the War Department for payment in 1866. That is true. In 1815 the claims appear to have been sent to the accounting- officers of the Treasury, and upon the suggestion of the third auditor were allowed. But this officer\u2019s decision was overruled, and in 1890 the Secretary of the Treasury referred the claims to this court under section 1063 of the Revised Statutes. As the reference did not give the court jurisdiction the claims were returned to the Secretary of the Treasury with the statement that the cases were <em>res judicata </em>in the department; that is, against payment. <em>(Arm</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number><em>strong et al. </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 29 C. Cls. R., 148.) Applications were subsequently made to Congress for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The claims are of a class. They all originated early in June, 1863, when the citizens of Pittsburg, Pa., became alarmed for the safety of the place because the military forces under command of General Lee were invading Pennsylvania and West Virginia, 155 miles east. The citizens of Pittsburg appointed a committee of their number to wait on the Secretary of War and General Halleck and request that skillful engineer officers be detailed to superintend the construction of fortifications around their city. The committee was informed by the Secretary of War that the fortifications around Pittsburg constituted no part of the plan or purpose of the War Department to defend, and that the men and money at the disposal of the department were needed to carry out other purposes, and that neither men nor money could be furnished, but that the citizens must do the work themselves at their own expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Pursuant to the request made by the citizens aforesaid upon the United States to cooperate with them, an order was issued assigning General Brooks to command.in that region with instructions to put Pittsburg and Wheeling in a defensible condition, inasmuch as Pittsburg would be a point aimed at by the possible raid of a cavalry command under General Stuart. General Brooks was directed to inform the people of Pittsburg that they must be at work, and the business men of Pittsburg under information from that officer responded to the call for labor on defensive works and in-trenchments. Before any of the work was done, however, General Halleck addressed a letter of instruction to Brigadier-General Barnard, the U. S. engineer officer who was sent by the Government to Pittsburg, under date of June 8, 1863, stating that it was not anticipated that any hostile demonstrations would be made against Pittsburg other than a mere raid, and as any projected works must be constructed <em>by the voluntary labor of the citizens </em>the defenses should be of limited extent and of the most simple character. General Halleck also stated that the mayor and municipal authorities of Pittsburg should be consulted, and that it should be distinctly understood that there was no appropriation for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>fortifying Pittsburg, and \u201c to give to the citizens of Pitts-burg such assistance and instruction as might be practicable in preparing themselves against a possible raid.\u201d Certificates as to these claims were given in which the principal officer on duty there certified that he <em>believed </em>the amounts were paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">When payment was asked of the Government the demands were referred to the claims commission of the War Department, which decided against their validity on the ground that the expenses were incurred by the citizens for their personal protection and that of their property; that it was an independent and spontaneous movement on the part of the citizens entered into without reference to the plans and arrangements of the authorities; and that the whole affair was a private enterprise on the part of the citizens not needed in the opinion of the military authorities or embraced in their plan of operations, but which the department was willing to further in the manner proposed by the citizens in order to allay public excitement and induce a greater feeling of security. The Secretary of War (Stanton) approved and affirmed the decision of the claims commission, and upon a resubmission in 1872 the claims were referred to the Chief of Engineers of the United States Army, who reported that he could see no good reason for the payment of these or of the remaining 158 claims of similar character. May 11,1875, the Assistant Judge-Advocate-General of the Army'' made a report to the Secretary of War stating that no liability existed on the part of the War Department, because it appeared that the labor and expenditures were voluntary acts on the part of the claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">. Whether the claimants are entitled or not entitled to an appropriation on the findings is not a question before the court. If the power which holds the purse strings of the nation shall in the exercise of its discretion apply public money to the payment of these claims that is the right of the Congress. But that right can not be made to rest upon the existence of a claim in the sense of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">There are circumstances where the Government may recognize as equitable matters that appeal to the public conscience. It has been pointed out by the Supreme Court that some of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>the acts directing payment have been based upon considerations \u201c of pure charity \u201d \u2014 payments not of right but in the nature of gratuities. The claims at bar may come within this category; but none of them depend upon any such right as to make them legal claims to reimbursement. In so far as they depend upon equitable considerations the court can not ignore the ruling of the Secretary of War. Congress only can do that with full knowledge of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">As to these claims, the effect that may be given to the contentions of the claimants that their demands are equitable must depend upon whatever view the Congress may assert with respect to the right of the petitioners to recover from the Public Treasury expenditures made for the supposed defense of their locality as a part of the whole country under the circumstances attending the voluntary disbursement of money from their own private means.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The status of the claims being given, it is for Congress to take such action as may be deemed proper in the discretion of those bodies.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
