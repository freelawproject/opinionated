Ryan, </em>No. 09-99018, a case involving related issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-18\">A judge of this Court <em>sua sponte </em>requested a vote as to whether the panel\u2019s April 8, 2014, order should be reheard en banc. A majority of the nonrecused active judges voted in favor of rehearing the order en banc. On September 4, 2014, an order was issued granting en banc review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-19\">Subsequently, upon the vote of a majority of the nonrecused active judges, this case was designated as a related case to <em>McKinney </em>and consolidated for rehearing en banc before the same en banc-panel. <em>See </em>Ninth Circuit Rule 35-3. On December 15, 2014, in Pasadena, California, the en banc panel heard oral argument in <em>McKinney </em>and held a subsequent conference on both the <em>McKinney </em>and <em>Henry </em>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-20\">Having heard the argument in <em>McKinney, </em>and having considered the record and the briefs filed by the parties in this case, the Court concludes that: (1) the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the briefs and record, and that the decisional process would not be significantly aided by oral argument; and (2) a stay of proceedings and further en banc consideration in <em>Henry </em>is not necessary to secure or maintain the uniformity of the Court\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-21\">Therefore, this case is submitted for decision without oral argument. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2). Henry\u2019s motion for a stay of proceedings pending the issuance of a decision in <em>McKinney </em>is DENIED. En banc proceedings in this case are concluded. The Clerk is directed to issue the mandate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
