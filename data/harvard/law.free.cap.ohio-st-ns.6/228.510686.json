No disposition was made of these motions, at the said November term, but a general order of continuance, of cases not disposed of, was made upon the journal and carried the motions over to March term, 1849.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-5\">On the 4th of December, 1848, and before the adjournment of the court at which the verdict was returned and judgment rendered, David Dial died, and Joshua Dial was appointed his administrator. At the March term of the court, 1849, a suggestion of the death of Dial and of the appointment of an administrator, was made. The latter thereupon moved the court to strike out the entry of the judgment of the November term, because it was entered while the motions for new trial and in arrest were pending, and because the said David Dial had departed this life. The court overruled this motion and would not permit Joshua Dial to bo made party to the proceedings. The motions for a new trial and in arrest were declared abated by the death of Dial, and therefore overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-6\">*A writ of error was jn-osecuted in the Supreme Court of [231 the county to the ruling of the common pleas on the above motions, and at the May derm, 1850, the judgment was reversed, because the court below had refused to allow the administrator to enter an appearance for the deceased, and to be heard on said motions, and the cause remanded to the common pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-7\">At the July term, 1850, of the common pleas, Joshua Dial was made a party to the suit, and the motions were then heard and overruled, and a judgment entered against the' administrator for the amount of the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-8\">A second writ of error was prosecuted by the administrator, and the last judgment reversed, on the ground that it was given against him as administrator, and the cause was again remanded to the \u2018common pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-9\">At the November term, 1851, the court of common pleas made the following order in the case:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-10\">\u201c It is now here considered by the court that the said Alfred Holter recover of said defendant, David Dial, the said sum of $500, the damages assessed by the jury aforesaid, at the said November term of this court in the year 1848, and also, his costs herein expended; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>\u25a0\u25a0and it is further ordered and adjudged that this judgment shall \u00a1stand for and be considered as the judgment of this court rendered \u00a1as of and at the November term of this court in the year 1848.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-5\">A third writ of error was sued out of the district court of the \u25a0county, in 1853, to the last judgment, but that court affirmed it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-6\">This petition is filed to reverse the judgment of affirmance of \u25a0the district court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-7\">It is assigned for error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-8\">1.

The replication to the first plea to the first count of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233, 234\">*233, 234</page-number>^declaration was insufficient, because it did not aver \u201c want [333 \u25a0of probable cause,\u201d as well as malice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-4\">The court erred in overruling the demurrer to said replication.

The first count is good \u2014 the law being, that any malicious publication of printed or written matter, tending to bring an individual into disgrace or ridicule, is, if untrue, libelous, and <em>per se </em>actionable. Watson <em>v. </em>Trask, 6 Ohio, 531; Tappan <em>v. </em>Wilson, 7 Ohio (pt. 1), 190, 193; Newbraugh <em>v. </em>Curry, Wright, 97; White <em>v. </em>*Nichols, 3 How. U.

Being sufficient, it would sustain the verdict and judgment, even were the second count bad \u2014 the law in Ohio being, by force \u2022of our statutes, that a single good count will support a general verdict in a civil case. Johnson <em>v. </em>Mullin, 12 Ohio, 10; Swearinger <em>v. </em>Bank of Mount Pleasant, 13 Ohio, 208.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-12\">III. The second count is good. That the defamatory words laid in it are actionable, per <em>se, </em>was expressly decided in Young <em>v. </em>Miller, 3 Hill, 21, and Todd <em>v. </em>Rough, 10 S. &amp; R. 18.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-13\">That they are so upon principle is clear. There are <em>all </em>the elements which <em>any </em>court holds to be necessary to constitute actionable words in themselves, and more than the current of authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>requires; for they import the commission of an indictable offense, involving moral turpitude, calculated to disgrace the offender, and punishable corporally.

The replication of July 17, 1848, to the first plea to the first count is sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATX\">*An express admission of the church membership of the-parties, and that the charges were preferred in the way of church discipline, is not necessary in the replication. <em>Color </em>is given to these allegations of the plea, which is enough. Traversable matters-not denied are confessed, and a formal confession is unnecessary. Stephen on Pleading, 199, 200, 202, 203, 217.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-8\">The replication does answer the whole of the plea.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-9\">It is not necessary that the replication should deny the existence-of probable cause. For:</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-10\">1. Probable cause is no defense, in cases like this, if the defendant, in making the publication, was actuated by <em>express </em>malice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-11\">There is but one class of cases in which probable cause protects-a malicious libeler, to wit, cases in which the libelous charge is-made in the ordinary and proper course of <em>judicial </em>proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-12\">Thorn <em>v. </em>Blanchard, 5 Johns. 508, seemed to establish another class, to wit, memorials for removal from office, but the clear weight of authority is now against that decision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-13\">But in cases like the present \u2014 although there is some loose language in the books \u2014 the well-settled rule is this :</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-14-pl-split\">In the absence of <em>express </em>malice, the existence of probable causer coupled with an occasion which makes the libel a privileged communication, will rebut the ordinary <em>legal presumption </em>of malice, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>defeat the action. But if the plaintiff can show that the publication was <em>expressly </em>malicious, the action will lie, notwithstanding the existence of probable cause. White <em>v. </em>Nichols, 3 How. U. S. 266; Gray <em>v. </em>Pentland, 2 S. &amp; R. 23; Vanderzee <em>v. </em>McGregor, 12 Wend. 545; O\u2019Donaghue <em>v. </em>McGovern, 23 Wend. 30; The King <em>v. </em>Baillie, 21 State Tr. 67; Hodgson <em>v. </em>Scarlett, 1 B. &amp; Ald. 247; 1 Starkie on Slander, chap. 13; 2 Chitty\u2019s Pl. (8 Am. ed.) 630a, note <em>k.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-5\">*In the King <em>v. </em>Hart, 1 Wm. Bla. 385; and Fairman <em>v. </em>Ives, [236 7 Eng. Com. Law, 220, cited by Mr. Jolliffe, there was no proof of \u25a0express malice, nor any question whether probable cause is or is not a substantive ground of defense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-6\">Again, where want of probable cause is essential to the right of action, the party aggrieved can not bring an ordinary action for libel, but must bring a special action on the case, and aver not merely the publication, but also the occasion and manner of it, and both malice and want of probable cause. 1 Starkie on Slander, chap. 12, 276.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-7\">But in case of privileged communications, like the present, it has never been doubted that the ordinary action and declaration for libel are sufficient; and no precedent can be found of such a declaration with an averment and want of probable cause. 2 Starkie on Slander, appendix; 2 Chitty\u2019s Pl. 630a, 641&amp;, 641f. White <em>v. </em>Nichols, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-8\">In averring malice, it is never necessary to employ the term, \u2022\u201cexpress malice.\u201d \u201cMalice\u201d or \u201cmaliciously\u201d includes all kinds of malice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-9\">If the authorities are conflicting \u2014 the question being of common \u25a0law \u2014 the court will incline to prefer the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in White <em>v. </em>Nichols; because such a rule of preference tends to produce uniformity of decision; Carlisle <em>v. </em>Wishart, 11 Ohio, 191; Treon <em>v. </em>Brown, 14 Ohio, 488.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-10\">2. Were probable cause a substantive ground of defense, it should have been averred in the plea. But there is no such averment. It matters not, therefore, whether the replication is good or not \u2014 a bad replication being good enough for a bad plea. For the publication was <em>prima facie </em>libelous, and the burden of averment \u2022and proof of the contrary lay upon the defendant. Gray <em>v. </em>Pentland, <em>supra; </em>O\u2019Donaghue <em>v. </em>McGovern, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-11\">3. The plea amounts to the general issue, and. is therefore bad. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237, 238\">*237, 238</page-number>287] *And this defect is reached by the <em>special </em>demurrer to the replication. O\u2019Donaghue <em>v. </em>McGovern, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-5\">Y. The absence of a joinder in demurrer is no ground for reversing a judgment. A joinder is a mere acceptance of the issue of law tendered by the demurrer. But that issue must be accepted \u2014 hence-the joinder is a mere idle formality. Stephen on Pleading, 55, 56.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-6\">Even in error, although there is an option to plead or join, if no-answer to the assignment of errors be filed, the case will be considered as if the common joinder were filed. Wells <em>v. </em>Martin, 1 Ohio St. 388.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-7\">Besides, the objection is removed by statute, and the joinder might be filed even now. 2 Curwen, 211, 1059, 1060; Taylor <em>v. </em>Browder, 1 Ohio St. 232; Huntington <em>v. </em>Ziegler, 2 Ohio St. 11.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-8\">YL. The replications <em>de injuria </em>to the second and third pleas,, were proper. Stephen on Pleading, 163, 164, 264.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-9\">YII. The verdict is technically, as well as substantially correct..</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-10\">YIII. The 9th assignment of error objects to the judgment of November 17,1848. But that judgment was reversed upon the first writ of error. The judgment under consideration was rendered November 7, 1851.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-11\">IX. The motions for a new trial, and in arrest of judgment were-overruled before the judgment in question was rendered. There-can not be a judgment for a <em>defendant, non obstante </em>veredicto; hence, the motion for that judgment was frivolous. Buckingham <em>v. </em>McCracken, 2 Ohio St. 287.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-12\">A judgment will not be reversed because a motion previously made was not decided, if there was no ground for the motion.

Besides, it does not appear that the delay in that case was occasioned by a motion for a new trial, or in arrest of judgment, or a <em>cui ad vult.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>In Crisp <em>v. </em>The Mayor, etc., of Berwick, Levinz, 252, 1 Mod. 36, no decision was made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-4\">XI. As to the p.oint, that there was a time when the common pleas had no jurisdiction of the case, the same thing might he said of every case in which further proceedings are had in that court after a reversal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-5\">XII. Mr. Jolliffe asks, what was the use of reversing the first judgment, if another judgment could be rendered <em>nunc pro tunc, to </em>take its place ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-6\">The answer is plain. The first judgment was reversed, because the motions for a new trial, etc., were not decided. Thereupon they were overruled, and being out of the way, a proper judgment could be rendered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-7\">XIII. Mr. Jolliffe insists, that a judgment <em>nunc pro tunc </em>can not be entered in an action for defamation, because such an action abates by the death of the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-8\">A strange point\u2019. The very reason for a judgment <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>is, that the action abates by death, and therefore, such a judgment is necessary to do justice. At common law, all personal actions abated by death, and it was for this reason that judgments <em>nunc pro tunc </em>were invented. Were there no abatement, there would be no necessity *for such a judgment, for the personal representa- [239 tive of the decedent might be made a party, and judgment be given against him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-9\">XIY. If a judgment <em>nunc pro tunc </em>can be rendered three years after verdict, it may be twenty years after; \u201c and to the prejudice of intervening rights,\u201d says Mr. Jolliffe. I reply:</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-10\">1. That a power mighr be abused, does not prove its non-existence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-11\">2. The court may impose conditions to protect intervening rights that ought to be protected. Mara <em>v. </em>Quin, Executrix, 6 Mod. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-12\">And this is an answer to all Mr. Jolliffe\u2019s argument, founded on our statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-13\">XY. But, in truth, the statutes create no difficulty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-14\">1. As to liens. As between the surviving party and the heirs of the decedent, a judgment <em>nunc pro tunc </em>may well be a lien as of the date for which it is rendered; but as to <em>bona fide </em>intervening rights of third persons, the lien may be held to date from the time of the <em>actual </em>rendition of the judgment, upon the principle of the O. L. Ins. and Tr. Co. <em>v. </em>The Urbana Ins. Co., 13 Ohio, 220.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-15\">The provision that between executions sued out during the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>judgment term, or within ten days thereafter, there shall be no preference, can give no trouble; for if the judgment <em>nunc pro tunc </em>be actually rendered more than ten days after the term for a judgment of which it is to stand, there can have been no execution thus issued upon it. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-5\">So, if more than a year has elapsed between the term for which the judgment is to stand and that at which it is actually rendered, it will not prejudice a <em>bona fide </em>judgment rendered within the year. This is, in effect, settled by McCormick <em>v. </em>Alexander, 2 Ohio, 65, and Patten <em>v. </em>Sheriff of Pickaway, Ib. 395.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARi\">*2. Nor does the limitation act in respect to writs of error, create any difficulty; for the time begins to run from the date of the <em>actual </em>rendition of the judgment. Under the old system a decree of the court in bank was generally certified to the county and entered as a decree of the court in the county of the term of the reservation of the cause. Chase <em>v. </em>Washburn, 2 Ohio St. 99, 100; Wilcox Forms (2 ed.), 5, and cases there cited. But it was uniformly held that the five years within which to file a bill of review began to run from the time of the <em>actual </em>rendition of the decree in the court in bank, and not from the reservation term in the county; so expressly ruled, after full argument, in Miner <em>v. </em>Wallace, ultimately decided by this court. 5 Ohio St.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-7\">3. As to dormancy. The five years begin to run from the day of the actual rendition of judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-8\">4. As to appeals. Neither in 1848 nor in 1851 could this cause have been appealed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-9\">5. As to interest. It is.perfectly right that a judgment <em>nunc pro tunc </em>should bear interest from the term of which it is to stand as a j udgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-10\">XVI. Judgments <em>nunc pro tunc </em>rest upon a most solid foundation of justice; for it would be manifestly unjust that a party who had, by the verdict of a jury, established a right to recover, should be deprived of it by delay in entering judgment, occasioned not by liis fault, but by the course of his adversary, or the act of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-11\">XVII. The judgment of 1848, rendered in the lifetime of Dial, was improperly reversed. Instead of reversing it, the court should have reversed the order deciding the motions for a new trial, etc., to be abated, and have awarded a procedendo or issued a mandamus to compel the decision of those motions.. The motions have now been heard and overruled, and the plaintiff in error is in no worse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241, 242\">*241, 242</page-number>condition *by the judgment of 1851, than he would be in had [241 the judgment of 1848 remained in force, as it should have done. Upon the whole record, then, he is not prejudiced by the judgment of 1851, and, therefore, it ought not to be reversed. Harman <em>v. </em>Kelly et al., 14 Ohio, 502; Gano &amp; Thomas <em>v. </em>Samuel, Ib. 592.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-5\">And the correctness of the judgment of reversal may be inquired into in this case. Aubrey <em>v. </em>Almey, 4 Ohio St. 524.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b193-6\">Bowen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4L\">Three questions are presented in the record for decision, which, for convenience, may be stated as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">1. Does the second count of the declaration contain actionable words ?</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">- 2. Does the special plea of the defendant contain matter sufficient to bar a recovery by the plaintiff?</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">3. \"Was it competent for the court of common pleas, at its November term, 1851, to enter a judgment <em>nunc pro tune </em>upon a verdict found in the same court at its November term, 1848?</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">To determine the question whether the words are actionable in themselves, when not spoken of the plaintiff in his office, profession, or calling, we must ascertain whether the charge, if true, will subject the party charged to an indictment for crime, involving moral turpitude, or subject him to an infamous punishment, or will tend to render him loathsome to society in which he moves. If any such result would be likely to attach to the plaintiff, by means of the speaking of such defamatory words, then they will be, in themselves, actionable. Brooks <em>v. </em>Coffin, 5 Johns. 188; Martin <em>v. </em>Stillwell, 13 Ib. 275. By this rule the <em>infamy </em>of the offense or of the <em>punishment </em>constitutes the test whether the words are actionable, when an indictable *offense is charged upon the plaintiff. [242 And so it must be understood when he has imputed to him acts not subject to indictment, but which, nevertheless, involve great moral turpitude, and, if believed, would exclude him from the favor and countenance of all moral persons; as, for example, the crime of sodomy, or a charge that the plaintiff was laboring under some loathsome disease. The nature and turpitude of the act charged are the criterions by which to decide whether the injury is such as to be the foundation of an action. A charge of assault and battery \u2014 of fighting at fisticuffs \u2014 of refusing aid to an officer to arrest criminals \u2014 resisting an officer in the execution of process \u2014 keeping a ferry or tavern without license, and others of the like class, ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>\u2022though subject to indictment and punishment, and of themselves reprehensible as violations of positive law, do not imply that degree of moral depravity which will sustain an action of slander for words spoken imputing such offense.</p>\n<p id=\"Amh\">Section 101 of the act punishing such offenses (Statutes, 286), enacts: \u201cThat if any person shall knowingly, willfully, and maliciously cut, fell, deface, alter, or remove anydandmark, corner, or bearing-tree, properly established, the person so offending shall, on conviction thereof, be fined in any sum not exceeding five hundred dollars, or imprisoned in the cell or dungeon of the jail of the county, and be fed on bread and water only, not exceeding thirty days, or both, at the discretion of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In a conviction under this act, not only would the plaintiff be subject to pecuniary loss, but to loss of character, because the removal of boundaries has always been held in execration. The curse of God was denounced against it by the Mosaic law. Deut. ix: 14. Dr. Scott says that the removal of landmarks was a crime among the Israelites similar to forging, altering, destroying, or canceling 243] *the title deeds of an estate at this day. The Romans considered it an infamous offense, and all civilized nations have been of the same opinion. Todd <em>v. </em>Rough, 10 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 22; Young <em>v. </em>Miller, 3 Hill, 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">We are satisfied that both counts of the declaration contain allegations sufficient to maintain the action, and that the motion in arrest was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">2. The special plea to the first count of the declaration attempts to repel any malicious and. slanderous intentions in making the publication. Both parties were members of a religious church, whose discipline authorizes and makes it the duty of those who fall out or differ in their secular affairs to come before the body of which they constitute a part, and have an investigation into and settlement of disputes between them. For this purpose either may prefer his petition to the church, specifying the cause of complaint he has against his brother member. By this means the subject is brought officially to the notice of those charged with its adjudication. Having this clearly authorized right thus to appear in the character of a petitioner, and to ask for a hearing and decision according to the rules which all of the members undertake to observe, he may pursue it, whenever necessary, against another member, subject to this restriction: he must not institute the proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244, 245\">*244, 245</page-number><em>maliciously. </em>He can not shield himself, under the cover of church privilege, from an intentional and willful attack upon another\u2019s-character, under pretense of'inviting a religious inquiry into the-charges he makes. The declaration avers that the defendant charged 'the plaintiff with \u201c knowingly and maliciously removing the cornerstone.\u201d This the defendant, in his plea, says he did without malice,, for the purpose of bringing the plaintiff to trial on the charge before-\u25a0a committee of the church. The plaintiff replies, that the defendant willfully and maliciously ^exhibited the charge to the church, [244 for the purpose of harassing, injuring, and defaming him. It thus-becomes a question of fact for the jury to decide, whether the defendant, in preferring the charge, was governed by a sense of Christian duty and his obligations to the rules of the church, or whether those pure and commendable principles were disregarded by him, and an evil and malignant desire to degrade and injure his neighbor-permitted to control his action. This issue the parties themselves-made, and when settled by verdict must be conclusive, unless the court should set the finding aside. The jury found that the charge-was maliciously made; that the defendant exceeded the privilege of a church member, and should be held for the injury committed-while thus acting contrary to the object and spirit of the discipline. It was not erroneous to allow the jury to pass upon the question thus made up by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">It is said,.however, that the replication does not deny probable-cause on the part of the defendant to make the charge. This was not necessary. The replication was good without it.. If there was-any necessity to aver or to negative the existence of probable cause, on the part of the defendant, that necessity rested with the defendant. It was incumbent on him to place a full and perfect defense upon the record. \"Whatever defect, therefore, attaches to the pleadings by the omission of those words, is chargeable to the plea; for-if the principle before alluded to be correct, that such publication as that made by the defendant is only privileged when made in strict compliance with the rules of the church, and i\u00f1 good faith,, without malice, it follows that the plaintiff was only bound to answer a general denial of malice, by a roaffirmance of it. Hence,, if the demurrer to the replication had been sustained, as it is claimed ought to have been done, the judgment of the *court would [245 have reached the plea, and set it aside for insufficiency. Wo think that the demurrer was correctly overruled..</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>3. It is urged with much ability by the counsel for plaintiff in \u2022error, that the action of the court below, at the November term, 1851, in giving a judgment <em>nunc pro-tunc </em>upon the verdict of November, 1848, is not warranted by the laws of this state. Dial was in life when the verdict was returned and the judgment entered upon it: and by filing motions for a new trial and in arrest, within the rules of the court, he superseded the judgment, though not the verdict, until the court should make a disposition of them. No decision, however, of the motions was had at that term, and the general \u25a0order of continuance carried the verdict, the judgment, and the motion to the next term for further action thereon. Before the November term of the court had expired, but after the motions were \u25a0filed, the defendant died. This occurrence divested the court of .any further power over the case, except to hear and determine the motions, and, if overruled, to enter judgment upon the verdict. But if a new trial had been allowed, or the judgment arrested, the \u2022cause could not have proceeded any further, as the death of the party abated it. Neither of the orders of reversal of the Supreme Court reached or attempted to go behind the verdict, but both allowed that to remain undisturbed. Later irregularities only, were .affected by the reversals. And this brings us to the inquiry whether the court, after overruling the motions for a new trial and in arrest, which left the verdict unimpaired, could predicate a judgment upon it as of the term in which it was found; and thereby save the cause from abating, and the plainttiff from losing his recov\u25a0ery of-damages.</p>\n<p id=\"AsA\">The power of the courts to enter <em>nunc pro tunc </em>orders *and judgments is discretionary. It may be exercised, in a proper case, \u2022to prevent injustice. Whenever there is a foundation presented by the facts of the case, for the exercise of such power, there should be no hesitation in making the entry. It has been frequently done in this state, and is a practice well known and often followed in the -common-law courts of England and of this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Personal actions, by the common law, as well as by our statute, abate by the death of the party. If, before verdict,'such an event happens to one of the suitors, the cause is brought to an end. But if after verdict, and before judgment, he dies, the rule is different. The right to recover being established, and the amount of damages \u25a0determined by the verdict, it shall continue in force, and a judgment may be given upon it as of the term when it was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>In Collins <em>v. </em>Prentice, 15 Conn. 423, it was beld, where a defendant in an action of trespass died after a trial in the superior court, and a verdict for the plaintiff, and during the pendency of a motion for a new trial by the defendant, that after the rule for such motion was discharged, a judgment might be entered for the plaintiff as of the term in which the verdict was had.</p>\n<p id=\"Apd\">In Ryghtmyre <em>v. </em>Durham et al., 12 Wend. 245, the same order was made. And so in Mackay <em>v. </em>Rhinelander, 1 Johns. Cases, 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">These and other cases to the same point, proceed upon the supposition that judgment might and undoubtedly would have been entered for the plaintiff in time, had it not been for the delay occasioned by the defendant in filing his motion for a new trial, and that when the motion does not prevail, it ought not to work any prejudice to the rights of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The court of common pleas being satisfied that the *mo- [247' tions of the defendant should be overruled, and having before it the record showing that the motions had operated to delay the verdict of the jury, as well as the judgment of the court entered on its journal during the lifetime of the defendant, conceived it to be justly due to the plaintiff to give him the same benefit from the' verdict as if the motions of defendant had not been interposed. In this we think there was no <em>error; </em>and do, therefore, affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b197-8\">, Bartley, C.
