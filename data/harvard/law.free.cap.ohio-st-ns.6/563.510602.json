Children, in its primary sense, is a word of purchase, and not of limitation. Heirs, issue, son, etc., are generally words of limitation, but they are all words of purchase or limitation, as indicated by the context or subjectmatter. 15 Ohio, 59; 3 Denio, 490; 1 Sumner, 235; 4 Comstock, 263; 10 Barbour, 393, 395; 10 Met. 502; 6 Coke, 17; Wild\u2019s case; 2 Bos. &amp; Pull. 492; 4 Barn. &amp; Ald. 43; 2 Jarman on Wills, 69, 328.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-11\">VI.

A vested remainder is an estate in lands, limited on a particular estate, that comes into possession ujion the termination of the particular estate. It is a present interest vested, to come into possession at a future day upon the happening of a certain event.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-5\">A contingent remainder is an estate in lands limited upon a contingency, and does not vest until it happens; and when it does happen, the remainder becomes vested, and ceases to be contingent. It vests before or at the end of the particular estate upon which it is limited. 11 Wend. 268; 2 Thomas Coke, 127, note <em>d, </em>128, note e; 2 Cruise Dig. 262, 264, 273; Fearne on Remainders, 1-6; 2 Black.

An estate in lands given <em>when </em>or <em>after </em>an event happens, is not contingent, but vested ; but an estate in lands given <em>upon </em>condition, or <em>if </em>until, provided, etc., an event ^happens, is generally . [567 contingent, and does not vest until it happens, but when it happens it ceases to bo contingent, and becomes vested.

All future limitations in wills are held to be contingent remainders, and not executory devises, when consistent with the rules of law as to contingent remainders. 11 Wend. 279; 5 Barn. &amp; Cress. 866; 3 Term, 276, 277, note a; 2 Doug. 729; 5 Met. 134, 148; 4 Met. 190; 23 Pick. 287; 2 Comst. 442; Fearne on Remainders, *296, *999; 2 Cruise Dig. 287, see. 59; 6 Cruise Dig. 475, sec. 6-13; 464, sec. 11; 1 Jarman on Wills, 655.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-9\">XIII.

A devise to four sons, or the survivors and their heirs, to be -equally divided <em>when </em>the youngest attains the age of twenty-one, \u25a0568] vests an estate in the sons at the death *of the testator, and 'upon the death of the sons, it passes by descent, and not in remainder. 10 Ohio, 37, 41.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-6\">XYI. A devise limited to take effect after a dying without issue, or without heirs, or on failure of issue, or without leaving issue, is hold to be void, because the contingency is too remote, as it does not take place until after the indefinite failure of issue. But if there be any terms to fix the limit upon the definite failure of issue, it will be good. 4 Comst. 257; 2 Comst. 436; 9 Paige, 269; 26 Wend. 232; 11 Wend. 277; 17 S. &amp; R. 61, 441; 16 Johns. 382, 388, 399, 430; 7 East, 321; 6 Term, 589; 17 Vesey, 479; 2 P.

This case is, in fact, a limitation over to <em>survivors </em>dying without children, and is like the case in 16 Johns. 382, and others of the same kind; 1 P. Wms. 534. The cases in 1 Johns. 439; 3 Johns, 299; 10 Johns. 12; 11 Johns; 377, are like that in 5 Day, 517.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-7\">XYII. In the construction of wills limiting estates after the failure of issue, etc., the courts lean to any circumstance, however slight, to take the case out of the rule of the indefinite failure of issue. 16 Johns. 382; 11 Johns. 337; 10 Johns. 16; 3 Johns. 189; 1 Johns. 440; 8 Johns. 348; 8 Simons, 4.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-8\">XYIII. The devise to Elizabeth A. vested in her a life estate. 'The devise to her children (if she should have any heirs), their heirs and assigns forever, and if she died without children, then \u2022and in that case, to his brothers and sisters, etc., created alternative remainders, and upon the birth of her child the remainder vested .absolutely in such child and its heirs, subject to- open and let in after born children, but cut off the remainder over to the testator\u2019s 569] ^brothers and sisters. 4 Comst. 257; 2 Comst. 436, 2 Barb.

The devise to Elizabeth\u2019s children (if she should have any heirs), their heirs and assigns for ever, <em>after </em>Elizabeth is done using \u25a0or occupying it, and at Elizabeth\u2019s death, does not postpone the vesting of the estate in her child or children till her death, but points to the time when possession is to be taken by her child or children. 2 Thos. Coke, 131, note <em>e</em>; Fearne on Remainders, 241; 2 Cruise Dig. *295, secs. 79-86; 1 Jarman on Wills, 620, 624, 625; 3 Term, 41; 2 Johns.

In the devise to Elizabeth\u2019s children (should she have any heirs), the word heirs means children. 3 Ohio St. 369; 19 Barb. 500; 15 Ohio, 59; 12 Wend. 83; 3 Wend. 513, 524; 26 Wend. 9; 3 Term, 143; 7 Mees. &amp; Welsby, 293; 1 Doug. 266, 341; 3 Call. 351; 5 Barn. &amp; Cress. 866; 1 Sumner, 241, 244; 2 A. K. Marsh. 465; 19 Conn. 107.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-8\">The testator means to show by the parenthetical clause (\u201cif *she shall have any heirs\u201d), that he then had in his mind [570 the fact that his daughter was a maiden and had no children, and possibly might not have any. Without it, the will would assume, contrary to the fact, that she then had children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-9\">XXI. \u201cIf my daughter Elizabeth A. shall die without children,\u201d means \u201c shall die without having had children,\u201d and not leaving children surviving her. 7 Cush. 105, 508; 1 Doug. 264; 2 Doug. 504; 7 East, 521; 3 Call. 352; 3 Term, 484; 16 Johns. 382, 399, <em>26 </em>Wend. 229; 9 Paige, 265; 5 Paige, 512; 5 Russell &amp; Mylne, <em>416; </em>2 Comst. 436; 2 Jarman on Wills, 273, 302; 30 Eng.

The limitation to Elizabeth\u2019s children and their heirs was a contingent remainder in fee. The limitation over, if she should die without children, was also from necessity a contingent remainder in fee, because there can not be a vested remainder after a limitation in fee, or mounted on a remainder or limitation in fee, inasmuch as a limitation in fee exhausts the entire estate in fee. 4 Comst. 257; 2 Comst. 436; 2 Barb.

The limitation over, 'if Elizabeth die without children, refers not to the failure of the issue or heirs of such children, but the failure of the children of Elizabeth, and can not be extended beyond the words used. It is the failure of her children altogether that casts the estate over, but having had children, the limitation over was cut off. Fearne on Remainders, *295; 2 Jarman on Wills, 170; 7 East, 521; 1 Doug. 264; 3 Term, 484; 5 Paige, 512; 9 Paige, 265; 26 Wend. 229; 10 Yerger, 292; 7 Cush. 105; 1 Keen, 240; 2 Russ. &amp; Mylne, 416.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-11\">XXY. The policy of society is opposed to all restraints upon the alienation of real estate, and hence, prior to the introduction of uses and executory devises, remainders limited upon remote contingencies or possibilities were held void, and since perpetuities have been limited to lives in being, and twenty-one years under uses and devises, but remainders stand upon the old ground of contingencies or possibilities, proximate or remote. 1 Jarm. on Wills, 250; 2 Jarm. on Wills, 515; 15 Pick. 104; 20 Wend. 564; 8 Paige, 104; 3 J.

In the case of Ferris\u2019 will, the limitation over is in ease his daughter should die without children. It will be seen where the limitation over is when a devise is for life, and remainder to children and their heirs, and for default of issue means for default of children, and so construed vests an estate in fee in children. 2 Jarm. on Wills, 267, 297; Fearne on Remainders, *295; 1 Doug. 264; 5 Paige, 512; 26 Wend. 229; 4 Comst. 257; 7 Cush. 105; 30 Eng.

In the case at bar, the testator could not have intended the estate given to the children of his daughter not to vest in interest until her death, but if she had had children, who died in her lifetime having children who survived her, such children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>\u25a0could not take, yet the testator intends that her children and their heirs shall take the estate in possession at the death of their mother. 3 Term, 484; 11 Eng.

The rule of law as to the definite or indefinite failure of issue, when unexplained by the context, applies alike to real and personal estate. There are two exceptions to this rule: 1. <em>Leaving </em>no issue as to personalty, imports failure of issue at death, but as to realty, a general indefinite failure of issue; 2. \"When the testator having no issue devises property in default of issue of himself, imports a failure of issue at death. 2 Jarm. on Wills, 300, 307, 317; 11 Wend. 277.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-6\">XXIX. The failure of issue is restrained to such failure at death as to real estate: 1. \"When dying is confined to a definite age; 2. \"When there are superadded words showing a restricted sense; 3. \"When the subject-matter and the ulterior devise required a restricted sense; 4. \"When the ulterior devise confers only a life estate; 5. Overcharging the devise with money to be disposed of by will by the first devisee. 2 Jarm. on Wills, 307, 310-313, 317; 4 Kent Com. 277; 16 Eng.

H. 224, 3 category; 4 Conn. 257, 5 category.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-7\">XXX. The phrase, dying without children, is identical with the phrase, dying without issue. They do not either *of them [573 point to the death of the first taker, without superadded words. There is no distinction between them. 2 Jarm. on Wills, 82; 5 Day, 534; 5 Mass. 56; 16 Eng. L. &amp; E. 550; 7 Paige, 328, 332; 4 Eng. Ch. 163. This case turns upon superadded words, \u201c <em>in case of her death.\u201d </em>14 N.

Swan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYi\">The second item of the will of Ferx'is creates an estate for life in Elizabeth, his daughter. By the third item the devises to Elizabeth\u2019s children (if she shall have any heirs) the same lands in fee. The foux\u2019th item provides that if Elizabeth shall die without children, the same lands shall pass to his brothex-s and sistex's.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10-pl-split\">It is claimed by the plaintiffs that the foux\u2019th item of the will: \u201cIf my daughter, Elizabeth A., shall die without childx\u2019en, then and in that case, I give and bequeath said laxxds to my brothers and sisters, their heirs and assigns forever, after the death of Elizabeth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575, 576\">*575, 576</page-number>A., as aforesaid,\u201d is a limitation, upon the estate in fee of the children of Elizabeth A.; that an estate tail in her children was created by the words, \u201c if Elizabeth A. shall die without children,\u201d and the estate in them was thereby limited to the issue and the issue of the issue of such children until their extinction. *In [575 other words, Ferris intended, by the fourth item of his will, to cut down the fee simple created in the children of Elizabeth by the third item of his will, to a fee tail, and thereby create an estate-tail in the issue of Elizabeth, limited only by the indefinite failure of such issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">It is the settled law of England, and has been followed in many of the states in this country, that where there is a devise in fee to-A, but in case he die \u201cwithout heirs,\u201d or \u201cwithout issue,\u201d or \u201c on failure of issue,\u201d then to B in fee; the words, \u201cif he die without issue,\u201d or words of similar import, do not mean, as the terms obviously import, a dying without issue at the time of the death of A, but means a failure of issue whenever it shall happen, and that these words are not satisfied until the issue and the issue of the issue of A and their descendants become extinct. Under this construction of such terms in a will, the estate of the issue of A is considered an estate tail, limited only by an indefinite failure of issue, and consequently that, when there is no longer any issue of the issue of A, the estate would devolve upon B. The courts, first perverting the language of the will by holding that these words created an estate tail limited only by an indefinite failure of issue, declared such a limitation void, because the contingency, upon which the estate of B would accrue, was too remote, depending, as it did, upon a general failure of issue. It is quite difficult to comprehend how the words, \u201cif he die without issue,\u201d should be taken to mean whenever his issue shall fail indefinitely at and after his death, or how a man who has died with issue living can ever afterward be said to have <em>died </em>without issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">This strange construction of such words seems to have arisen from the language of the statute <em>de donis, </em>regulating estates tail, which required that when lands were given by one to another and <em>the heirs of his body, </em>such lands should remain unto <em>the issue </em>of them to whom it was given after *their death, or should [57i&gt; revert to the donor or his heirs <em>if issue fail.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The English courts, as if to judicially announce that this construction of such words was forced and unsound, have held that the same words, when used in relation to the disposition of per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>eonal property, meant simply if A, the first taker, dies without issue living at the time of his decease. And the English judges, who have deplored this absurd and unreasonable perversion of the meaning of the words, and disregard of the. intention of testators, have, notwithstanding, invcterately but reluctantly followed this construction of devises in respect to real estate, because imbedded in the peculiar and complicated, system of English titles.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5-pl-split\">The English courts, however, have sought, with eager ingenuity, words in wills or circumstances which would avoid the rule. Thus it has been held that if the limitation over was upon the first taker dying without issue living, or dying without leaving issue behind him, that the will meant issue living at the death of the first taker. But the disposition in this country to break in upon the old English construction upon this subject is very manifest. Thus, in the case of Morgan <em>v. </em>Morgan, 5 Day, 517, which was like the case now before us. In that case A devised his real estate to his sons B, C, and D, \u201ctheir heirs and assigns foreverand in case either of his sons should \u201c die without children, his brothers should have his part in equal proportions.\u201d B married, and had issue, a son, who died during the life of B. B died, and left no children living at the time of his death. The court held that the limitation over was good by way of executory devise, and that the words, \u201c die without children,\u201d was intended a dying without children living at the death of B. In Harris <em>v. </em>Smith, 16 Georgia, 577] 545, a testator devised land to A, and if A ^should \u201c die leaving no lawful heirs, then, and in that case, it is my will that all of the said property shall be divided, share and share alike, between the children of B.\u201d It was held that the words, \u201c die leaving no lawful heirs,\u201d were equivalent to the words to \u201c die without children,\u201d which were equivalent to <em>\u201c </em>die without children living at the death of A.\u201d In the case of Anderson <em>v. </em>Jackson, 16 Johns. 382, it was decided that after the devise to the sons of A and B in fee, the limitation, that if either should die without lawful issue, his share to go to the survivor, was good as an executory devise, and that the true construction was a failure of issue, living at the death of the first taker. It will be perceived from these cases, and others might be cited to the same effect, that in those countries where the old English interpretation of the words, \u201cif he die without issue,\u201d have not been expressly disclaimed, courts have constantly evaded that interpretation by seizing hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>of circumstances and words deemed sufficient to establish the natural sense of the words; so that the interpretation and effect of these words may be considered a rule of property, depending upon the variable opinions and feelings of judges, some of whom may think these words sufficiently restricted by other words or cireum - stances, which other judges may consider as wholly inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">It is a singular fact that with the repeated decisions of the English courts upon this subject, testators, from generation to genera\u2022ation, persisted in using these natural words, and which were held to be inoperative and void, until, in the first year of the reign of the present Queen, a statute was passed declaring that the words \u201c die without issue,\u201d or other words which may import a want or or failure of issue, should be construed to mean dying without issue living at the death of the person, and not an indefinite failure of issue, unless a contrary intention appear by the *will. The [578 English rule adopted in Virginia, and in a modified form in New York, has met the same fate by legislative interposition. In Ohio, as in Kentucky, the English rule of interpretation has never been sanctioned; and in the latter state the subject was very fully considered in the case of Daniel <em>v. </em>Thomson, 14 B. Mon. 662; and the English rule was rejected as one unknown to the community; contrary to the natural sense and common use of words ; founded upon laws and estates inapplicable to titles in Kentucky, where, as here, estates tail are abrogated; and so evaded by courts as to be made to depend upon the discretion and variable opinions of judges. If there be any rule of interpretation of words which defeats the intention of the testator, and to which the following language of Justice Hitchcock is applicable, it is the English rule now under consideration: \u201c I must be permitted to say that these rules, in most eases, are applied not for the purpose of ascertaining, but of defeating the intention of the devisor. In this state, however, we are required by statute, to carry out this intention ; and I presume no such statute would have been passed, had it not been supposed that these antiquated rules of construction were too much regarded by our courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">We are all of the opinion, for the reasons which have been indicated, that the words, \u201c if he die without issue,\u201d or \u201c without leaving issue,\u201d or \u201cheirs of his body,\u201d or \u201cchildren,\u201d or other words of similar import, are to be interpreted according to their plain, popular, and natural meaning, as referring to the time of the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579, 580\">*579, 580</page-number>son\u2019s death, unless the contrary intention is plainly expressed in the will, or is necessary to carry out its undoubted purposes. We could, without impeaching the old English rule of interpretation, find in the words of the will before us, and in the fact that the broth-579] ers and sisters of the testator were living at the *time he made his will, sufficient to restrict the contingency and the devise over, to the time of the decease of his daughter. But we are unwilling to make an exception by which we sanction the English construction of the words under consideration, as referring in general to an indefinite failure-of issue, and at the same time make the case before us an exception to that rule ; thus leaving open a wide field of uncertain interpretation of words and circumstances, so that'no man would know the nature of an estate which depended upon the interpretation of these or the like words, until there had been a decision on the particular will, on which the question might arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">If the English rule of interpretation had been recognized by our courts as a rule of property we would not disturb it. It would then be a fit subject of legislation. But it never has been recognized ; and the uniform course of the decisions of the courts of this state has been to so construe wills as to carry into effect the intention of testators. To adopt the English rule, is clearly to defeat what every person must acknowledge is the real and the lawful intention of testators; it is to presume that a testator intended to create an estate forbidden by our statute relating to entailments; and a rule too, which, wherever recognized by courts, has been changed by legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Indeed, the only certain and stable principle is to hold that these words in a will, as in other cases, must be taken in their natural sense, unless a contrary intention is plainly expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Applying this rule to the case before us, the will provides that if Elizabeth should die without children, the estate should pass to the brothel\u2019s and sisters of the testator. Elizabeth had no children, nor grandchildren, when she died, and the contingency provided for by the will \u2014 -the existence of children \u2014 at that time occurred. Upon 580] her ^decease the title vested in the brothers and sisters of the testator, and, under the counter-claim, judgment must be entered accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b450-9\">Bartley, C.
