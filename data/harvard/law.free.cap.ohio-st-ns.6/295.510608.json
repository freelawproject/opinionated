It was agreed that the capital to be -employed should not be less than $800, to be divided into thirty-two shares of $25 each, and that the members should select from their own numbers such men as they wished to send to the gold regions to obtain gold; and that the persons so selected should be \u25a0required to go to the mines and use all honorable means to acquire :as much gold and other articles of value as possible, and return the \u25a0same to the association in Mohicansville within two and a half years from the time they should start. The association was to furnish the equipments and expenses of those who should be sent to the mines. The gold and articles of value which should be acquired, were to be divided as follows: First, The expenses of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>who should go to California (over $200 to be advanced by the association to each one of them), was to be first taken out. <em>Second, </em>One-half of the balance to be retained by them. <em>Third,, </em>The remaining half to be divided among the members of the association in proportion to the amount of stock owned by each. If no gold was obtained, th'e stockholders were to lose their stock, and those who went to California were to lose their time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-5\">There were some thirty subscribers to what they called their constitution, and. about $1,700 paid in as stock. The members then elected eight of their number to go to California, of whom the defendant was one. The whole amount of the money which had been raised as stock, was expended in furnishing these men their outfits .and expenses for the journey, and with implements to use after arriving in the gold regions; and on the 5th of April, 1849, they *left Mohicansville, in Ashland county, for California, by the [297 overland route, and arrived at Sacramento about the 15th of September of that year. On the way they had difficulties and quarrels among themselves, and in four or five days after reaching California they sold out what property was on hand, divided the proceeds among themselves, and each one took his own way. Several of them said \u201cthey would not pay a d \u2014 d cent to the company;\u201d but Bucher said he would do what was right, provided the rest would. Before the expiration of the two and a half years, David Kauffman, one of the eight, died. The defendant and four others-returned to Mohicansville. The other two remain in California. During the two and a half years no intercourse was had between the association and any of the eight in California.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-6\">Bucher returned home in 1851, bringing with him a large amount of gold, but he refused to pay anything into the treasury of the association, or to give any account of his earnings, or to acknowledge in any way the right of the other members of the association to share with him his earnings. Philip Wertsbaugher, one of the. eight, returned with a small amount of gold, and settled with the association, or at least offered to comply with the constitutional requirements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-7\">This bill is filed in the names of the other members of the association against Bucher, to compel an account and payment by him pursuant to the articles of the constitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-8\">Bucher in his answer offers to refund to the association one-eighth of the $1,700 which he and his seven companions received, deduct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298, 299\">*298, 299</page-number>ing therefrom his subscription of stock; but he protests that the-.other members have no legal or equitable claim upon him for any further share of the avails of his labor or enterprise, accruing after 298] he *was abandoned by his associates, and after the design of the association had been defeated by what he claims was its dissolution.

The object of thus uniting together is fully defined. It was limited to one purpose \u2014 a mining adventure \u2014 to be conducted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>upon terms set forth and agreed upon. In the fruits of that adventure all were to participate according to what were deemed equitable rules. To carry on the enterprise capital was necessary to be \u2022raised and expended, and labor must be performed in a region two thousand miles or more distant from the locality of the associated body. These two points were therefore primarily considered and decided upon. From the members of the association eight were to \u2022be chosen to perform the journey to the mines, and, after reaching there, to employ their skill and industry in procuring the golden treasure for themselves and companions in the enterprise. Within \u25a0a given period they were to return and place into the treasury of the parent institution the productions of their labor for distribution \u2022among its several members. When they separated from the association, to go to their remote place of employment, they took with them in teams, implements for mining, provisions, and money, all of its resources. These they were to retain, as well as one-half of their net gains, but were to divide the other half with their fellow-associates. They must be regarded as employes \u2014 as hired men\u2014 laboring by contract for the association, whose delegates and servants they were. They might properly co-operate together, might choose a captain and other officers from their own members to direct their affairs on the way, and during their continuance abroad. This they attempted to do ; and while we are free to concede that they had full power, as detached and separate members of the association, required by the nature of their ^undertaking, to act [300 without its presence and advice, to regulate by rules of their own the duties to be observed by themselves, yet they could not, by such private regulations, dissolve the association, nor release themselves from their contract to labor and account for their earnings, or to -answer in damages for a breach of-it. The determination which they formed and acted upon after reaching California, of appropriating the property of the association among themselves individually, and of working separately, in disregard of their obligations to the association, was a most inexcusable and immoral violation of their written and valid obligations to their principals. That act can only be characterized as one of marked dishonesty and bad faith. As between the eight, it was a relinquishment of each to the others of all claims to their joint earnings. Each accepted the proposal to work alone, and share separately the benefits of his individual labor, without any recourse upon the others; but as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>association into whose service they had entered, and whose interest they had undertaken to promote, they could not, by this <em>ex parte </em>and wrongful movement, relieve themselves from liability. Whether they wrought jointly or separately; whether their earnings were large or small; they were nevertheless responsible to the association, and could be required to account to it for whatever they made during the time they were thus employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The principle relied upon by-defendant\u2019s counsel, that a partnership may be dissolved by the act of one of the partners, we do not, in the view we take of this case, intend to impugn. That is too well settled to be now questioned. But to effect that purpose the act must be done with a view to its accomplishment. It should be communicated at once to the other members of the firm. They must be advised of the new relations created by the withdrawal of 301] *a member, or a- transfer of his interest in the concern. Their future relations toward each other, and their pursuit of the particular enterprise, depend on the acquisition of such knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Now, whether the eight men intended anything more than the dissolution of their own organization, and liberty to each to work when and -where it best suited him, does not seem to be very clear. Some of them said they would never pay anything to the association. But they did not, certainly, by any expression or act signify that they intended to dissolve the original association. Their acts do not indicate that to have been their object. They were willing, doubtless, to free themselves from working together, and from, reporting any account of their gains. . But as we have before shown, while they might accomplish these ends as between themselves, they could not, standing as they did in the places of hired men, far removed from the observation of, and without the means of communicating with, their co-members at home \u2014 bound by their agreements to serve as such, and to give statements of their labor within the time agreed on \u2014 disconnect and discharge themselves from the association.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">If the defendant was fortunate in his visit to and labors in the mines- \u2014 if his hopes were more than realized by his good luck in procuring gold in large amounts \u2014 he ought to have borne in mind that the aid of the Mohieansville association\" rendered to him had mainly contributed to his good fortune \u2014 that in reality he owed it to the organization of that body and the employment of the means it gave him to engage in the enterprise; and that, however others <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302, 303\">*302, 303</page-number>bad fared wbo bad gone on tbe same errand with himself, or however faithless they may have been to their employes, it was bis duty, in tbe true spirit of tbe agreement, to share with his patrons tbe fruits of his toil *and good management. This be de- [302 elined to do, and it is in this proceeding sought to coerce him to perform that which be has, against equity and conscience, refrained from doing; and we think the appropriate relief should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Tbe exceptions to tbe master\u2019s report must be sustained, and an account taken as to tbe amount of money earned by the defendant. One-half of tbe sum found to be in his hands, be will be allowed to retain. Tbe other half must be distributed to tbe holders of tbe stock of tbe association, <em>pro rata, </em>but excluding all of the eight wbo went to California, except tbe defendant and Philip Wertsbaugher. Tbe stock subscribed by them to share in tbe distribution with the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b239-7\">Bartley, C.
