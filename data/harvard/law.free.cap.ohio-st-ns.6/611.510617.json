Reserved in the district court of Seneca county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-11\">The facts in this case, so far as it is necessary to state them, are as follows;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-12\">On the 11th day of November, 1854, the defendant Coonrod, a dry-goods merchant of Tiffin, Ohio, claiming to be indebted to many persons in large sums of money, which he was unable to pay, made an assignment of all his property, consisting of a stock of goods and book accounts, to defendant Crum, in trust, for the benefit of his (Coonrod\u2019s) creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-13\">The instrument of assignment authorizes the trustee \u201c to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613, 614\">*613, 614</page-number>immediate possession of the property hereby assigned, and sell, amd dispose of the same with convenient diligence, either, at public or private sale, and for the best prices he can obtain therefor for cash or upon such terms of credit as he may deem advisable to convert the same into money to advantage for those interested in the 613] premises, and to ^barter and exchange the same or any part thereof as he may deem proper for the benefit of the creditors of the said Coonrod, and to dispose of the same in any manner whatsoever as freely and lawfully as the said Coonrod could do himself, which the said Crum may deem advisable to do, tending in his opinion to convert the same into money, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of all interested under this assignment, and to collect all such debts and demands as may be collectible, and to settle, compound, and adjust, and to discharge-the same for payment in cash or in property, or for part payment only, as aforesaid, any as well as all the claims and demands due, owing, or accruing due to said Coonrod, as well as the claims in which the said Coonrod has any interest whatever, and finally to make at his discretion any such disposition of the property hereby assigned and transferred, or any part thereof, as the said Coonrod could .do himself before the execution of these presents.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-6\">The trustee is directed to pay out of the proceeds of the property \u201c all just and reasonable expenses, services, costs, and charges of executing this \u25a0 assignment and of carrying into effect the trust hereby created, together with a reasonable commission or compensation to the said Crum for his own services in executing said trust.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-7\">With the residue, the trustee is directed to pay all the debts and liabilities of Coonrod, in full, if sufficient for that purpose; if not, then to pay the same <em>pro rata. </em>After payment in full, the balance to be returned to Coonrod.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b476-8\">Crum accepted this trust, and it appears from his answer and deposition, that he took immediate possession of the property, and proceeded to collect the accounts, and while so doing, and while 'seeking an opportunity to sell the entire stock of goods, ho retailed, up to the 3d of March, 1855, about fifteen hundred; dollars\u2019 worth to different persons, some for cash and some on credit, to be paid when called for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A1ef\">*The greater portion of the goods thus sold on credit was to the creditors of Coonrod, and to each an amount not to exceed their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>probable dividend under the assignment, and the remainder so sold was to responsible persons.,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-5\">On or about the 3d day of March, 1855, the trustee sold all the remainder of said goods, amounting to about sixty-five hundred dollars, at the original New York cost, to Warren P. Noble, at forty-five cents on the dollar of the appraisement, taking his notes therefor at one, two, and three years, with interest after the first year, and without security.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-6\">The trustee, in his deposition, states that Noble is abundantly, good and responsible for the amount of his purchase, and that the \u25a0sale of the goods to him was the best that could be made or obtained for them in the condition they were in.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-7\">After this sale, on the 5th day of March, 1855, Coonrod, by another instrument of writing of that date, referring to the assignment in trust above-mentioned, and expressing his fears that a perfect title to the property and effects attempted thereby to bo assigned might not have passed to the trustee, assigned and transferred all his property and effects to said Crum in trust for his (Ooonrod\u2019s) creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-8\">This last agreement directs the trustee to take immediate possession of the property assigned, and with convenient diligence \u2022convert the same, into money, either at public or private sale, collect the debts, and pay out the proceeds of the property in the same manner as provided in the first agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-9\">Crum accepted this trust and took and retained possession of the property under it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-10\">It appears 11 that the first assignment was satisfactory to one or more of the creditors of Coonrod, or that they simply made no objection to it; and the trustee, Crum, was notified *by plaint- [615 iffs that the first assignment was a fraudulent one, and that plaintiffs would not be concluded by its provisions, but would institute proceedings to have it set aside. This notice was given about two months before the execution of the second assignment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-11\">The petition avers that the plaintiffs are judgment creditors of \u25a0Coonrod; that the assignment was made with intent to hinder, de-, lay, and defraud the plaintiffs in the collection of their debt; and that its operation has that effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b477-12\">Plaintiffs ask that the assignment be held as fraudulent and void; that the trustee be ordered to pay the amount due upon their judgment out of the assets in his hands; and for other relief.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number><em>George E. Seney, </em>for plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2-\">made the following points:</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-5\">1. The assignment in this case is not within the statute of 1853r because it shows no design to <em>prefer </em>one creditor and <em>exclude </em>another; but, on the contrary, it <em>expressly </em>appears it was for no such, purpose. See Hull <em>v. </em>Jeffrey, 8 Ohio, 390. This assignment must \u2019 therefore stand or fall upon the common law, subject to impeachment upon the ground of fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-6\">The plaintiffs are entitled to all the advantage due to their vigilance. Doremus <em>v. </em>O\u2019Harra, 1 Ohio St. 45; Atkinson <em>v. </em>Tomlinson, Ib. 237.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-7\">The court has no power to control this assignment by taking from it any of its illegal or fraudulent provisions, to the end that the trust itself, divested of all such features, may stand.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-8\">An assignment void in part is void in toto. 2 Kent, 536; 6 Hill, 438; 2 Comst. 371; 11 Wend. 187; 9 Barb. 255; Swan\u2019s Rev. Stat. 435.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACs\">*2. The assignment of November 4th is fraudulent because:</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-10\">1. It gives the trustees power to sell upon <em>credit. </em>Swan\u2019s Rev. Stat. 435; Vannest <em>v. </em>Yoe, Sandf. Ch. 4; Burdick <em>v. </em>Post, 12 Barb. 168; Barney <em>v. </em>Griffin, 2 Comst. 465; Nicholson <em>v. </em>Leavitt, 2 Seld. 510; Neally <em>v. </em>Ambrose, 21 Pick. 185; Hopkins <em>v. </em>Ray, 1 Met. 79; Woodburn <em>v. </em>Mosher, 9 Barb. 255.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-11\">2. It gives the trustee power to sell at <em>private sale. </em>We think the-trust must fall for this reason, and refer the court to the case of Meacham <em>v. </em>Sternes, 9 Paige Ch. 390.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-12\">3. It gives the trustee the power of <em>barter and exchange. </em>Plack <em>v. </em>Schemerhorn, 3 Bar. 646; Burrill on Assignments, 209, 210.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-13\">4. It gives the trustee power to <em>compromise debts. </em>Murphy <em>v. </em>Bell, 8 How. Prac. 468; Woodburn <em>v. </em>Mosher, 9 Barb. 255; Hudson <em>v. </em>Bell, 3 Scam. 578; Grover <em>v. </em>Wakeman, 11 Wend. 187.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-14\">5. It gives the trustee <em>full discretionary power </em>in aid of the specific-powers mentioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-15\">The question to be considered is not whether fraud <em>may </em>be committed by the trustee, but whether the provisions of the instrument are such that, when carried out according to their reasonable and apparent intent, they will be fraudulent in <em>their operation. </em>Ward <em>v. </em>Tingley, 4 Sandf. 476. If an assignment is so drawn.that it must in its execution <em>tend </em>to hinder, delay, and defraud creditors, the legal presumption is that it was framed with that intent. The law presumes every man to intend the legal consequences which must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617, 618\">*617, 618</page-number>naturally flow from his own voluntary act. When the legal effect of a conveyance is to hinder, delay, and defraud creditors, no matter what the <em>actual </em>intention may have been, it isa <em>fraud </em>in law, and the courts are so bound to declare it. Gibson <em>v. </em>Love, 4 Fla. 217. It is sufficient, *if the <em>effect </em>of the conveyance is to hinder [617 or delay creditors in the collection of their debts. Buck <em>v. </em>Sherman, 2 Doug. 176. An assignment to be valid, must be free from all provisions <em>tending </em>to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors. Burrill on Assignments, 236.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-5\">It has been determined by high authority, that an assignment to a brother, who was irresponsible, was a <em>fraud, </em>in law, as to creditors \u2014the selection of an insolvent person as trustee, is a <em>fraud. </em>Cormah <em>v. </em>Sedgewick, 1 Bar. Ch. 210. The assignor remaining in possession, has been determined to be a <em>fraud. </em>So the selection of an incompetent person. An assignment to a clerk, the debtor exercising authority, has been held a fraud. An assignment which directed the assignee to delay the sale of the property for the purpose of obtaining higher prices, has been decided <em>fraudulent </em>and void. Hart <em>v. </em>Crane, 7 Paige Ch. 37.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-6\">The assignment is void by the statute of frauds, as to the creditors of the party making such conveyance. Brown <em>v. </em>Webb, 20 Ohio, 389; Peck <em>v. </em>Land, 2 Kelley, 1; Trotter <em>v. </em>Watson, 6 Humph. 509.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-7\">When the <em>object </em>and <em>intent </em>of a deed is to hinder and delay creditors, and both.the grantor and grantee participate in it, the deed is void, as between a creditor and fraudulent grantee. Tatum <em>v. </em>Hunter, 14 Ala. 557; Johnson <em>v. </em>Brandis, 1 Smith, 263.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-8\">The assignment of March 5, 1855, can not affect the rights of the plaintiffs to have the first set aside.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-9\">After any of the trusts have been actually executed, it is too late to revoke an assignment. Burrill on Assignments, 419; Petrikin <em>v. </em>Davis, 1 Morris, 296. When an assignee accepts the assignment it operates as a <em>conveyance. </em>Hall <em>v. </em>Denison, 17 Vt. 310; Ingraham <em>v. </em>Kirkpatrick, 6 Ired. Eq. 462.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-10\">This last assignment will not operate to defeat our right *to set [618 aside the first assignment, it being fraudulent. Brownell <em>v. </em>Curtis, 10 Paige, 210; Leach <em>v. </em>Kelsey, 7 Barb. 466; Browning <em>v. </em>Hart, 6 Ib. 91.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-11\">In the Ohio statute of frauds and perjuries, the words <em>hinder </em>and delay, are omitted; this omission is not material. Any conveyance which materially hinders and delays creditors is <em>fraudulent </em>and <em>void. </em>Nicholson <em>v. </em>Leavitt, 2 Selden, 517; Burdick <em>v. </em>Post, 12 Barb. 168; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Arthur <em>v. </em>Com. and Railroad Bank, 9 S. &amp; M. 394; Burrill on Assignments, 386.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-5\">In Wallack\u2019s notes to American Leading Cases, Sheldon <em>v. </em>Lodge, 4 Denio, 217; Bodley <em>v. </em>Goodrich, 7 How. 277, the doctrine is declared to be, that an assignment that <em>\u201c </em>tends \u201d to hinder and delay, by its provisions, is not only'void, <em>butfraudulent. </em>See also Vernon <em>v. </em>Morton, 8 Dana, 247, 263; Cadogus <em>v. </em>Bennett, Cow. 434; Atkinson <em>v. </em>Tomlinson, 1 Ohio St. 237.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b480-6\"><em>Luther A. Hall </em>and <em>James </em>Pillars, for the defendants :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-7\">Where a debtor in contemplation of <em>insolvency, and not of fraud, </em>assigns his property to \u00e1 trustee for the express benefit of all his creditors, our statute \u201c declaring the effect of assignments to trustees in contemplation of insolvency,\u201d by its <em>spirit and policy, </em>lays its hand upon such an assignment, takes it aside from the operation of the principles of the act for the. prevention of frauds and perjuries, and controls it, even if the instrument of assignment contains provisions, or directions to the trustee, contrary to the policy of the law, or the 1\u2018ights of creditors, which he may follow, in the mere execution or carrying out of the trust. Swift <em>v. </em>Holdridge, 10 Ohio, 230.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-8\">This assignment in trust, claimed only to be <em>fraudulent </em>(and that 619] simply in some of its incidents), must stand *and be executed. Harshman <em>v. </em>Lowe, 9 Ohio, 92; Hull <em>v. </em>Jeffrey, 8 Ohio, 390; Mitchell <em>v. </em>Gazzam, 12 Ohio, 315; Bancroft <em>v. </em>Blizzard, 13 Ohio. 30.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-9\">To avoid a conveyance made to defraud creditors, both the grantor and grantee must be <em>partakers of the fraud, </em>or <em>tainted </em>with the <em>fraudulent intent. </em>But in this case, the <em>cestuis que trust </em>are not parties to the assignment. It is made only for their <em>benefit. </em>Their assent even is not essential to its validity. Neither is the trustee a party to it, in the strict sense of the word. He signed and sealed the instrument of assignment, but that was <em>mere form. </em>He has but a <em>naked legal interest </em>in the trust property, with no substantial advantage to himself from the execution of the trust.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-10\">The law, therefore, can not consider him as participating in any fraud or fraudulent intent, so as to avoid the assignment. Vide 9 Ohio, 93.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b480-11-pl-split\">If an assignment of his property by an insolvent debtor to a trustee, in trust for creditors, contains any provisions or directions to the trustee, contrary to law or the rights of the creditors, in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>proper action for that purpose, the court can control and modify the trust or the action of the trustee, purge the assignment of any objectionable feature, and leave the <em>body </em>of the trust to stand, and order the same, thus <em>vastated, </em>to be executed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b481-5\">It is only when the illegal provisions in a trust are indivisible from, and constitute the main object or body of the trust, that the <em>whole </em>will be .declared void. Tritt <em>v. </em>Crotzer, 13 Penn. St. 451; Greenfield\u2019s Estate, 14 Penn. St. 480; Dupre <em>v. </em>Thompson, 4 Barb. S. C. 279; Humberston <em>v. </em>Humberston, 2 Vern. 737; 1 P.

C. 5, and in which the words with <em>intent </em>to <em>hinder </em>or <em>delay </em>creditors, are its <em>emphatic </em>words.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b481-7\">But there is still \u00e1 conflict of opinion on this question in the courts of that state. Vide, 2 Comst. 365; 4 Sandf. 252; 11 Barb. 138; 22 Wend. 486; 2 Sold. 510; 1 Sandf. Ch. 4; 7 Paige, 272.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b481-8\">The fact that the assignment gives to the trustee power to sell on credit, does not of itself indicate fraud. O\u2019Connell <em>v. </em>Cruise, 1 Sup. Ct. Rep. (Cincinnati), 163, 167, 168.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b481-9\">It is now <em>too.late </em>to raise this question; the <em>sale </em>had been made before this action was brought, and the purchaser is not a party to this action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b481-10\">The second assignment is not void, but operative as to its subject-matter \u2014 the notes and accounts. Burrill on Assignments, 277, 278, 292, 419, 420; Conkling <em>v. </em>Carson, 11 Ill. 503; 20 Conn. 98, 102; Small <em>v. </em>Sproat, 3 Met. 303; Hone <em>v. </em>Woolsey, 2 Edw. Ch. 289.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b481-11\">J. R. Swan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACR\">A sale by a trustee, upon reasonable time of credit, taking the usual security, is an act of good faith, and is recognized by our laws relating to the settlement of the estates of deceased persons, and is frequently directed by the court. An absolute and inflexible rule, that a trustee for the payment of debts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621, 622\">*621, 622</page-number>621] must at all times, and under all *circumstances, sell for cash, would not be for the interest of creditors. And if this be so, a provision in the trust deed in regard to credit, not specifically requiring a credit beyond what a court would sanction in the absence of such provision, can not, in our opinion, be deemed <em>per se </em>fraudulent. The courts of New York, however, hold that an assignment by an insolvent debtor, authorizing the trustee to sell \u201cfor cash, or upon credit, or partly for cash and partly for credit, as the trustee shall think reasonable and proper,\u201d is fraudulent and void. Nicholson et al. <em>v. </em>Leavitt et al., 2 Seld. 510; Burdick <em>v. </em>Post et al., 12 Barb. 168. But this seems to be law peculiar to Now York; and the dissenting opinion of Brown, J., in the case of Burdick <em>v. </em>Post et al., above referred to, shows very conclusively to our minds that the decision of the majority can not bo sustained upon principle or authority, and we must refer to that dissenting opinion for the reasons upon which our own opinion is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">An assignment requiring a credit to be given beyond that authorized by law on sales by executors and administrators would, in general, bo deemed conclusive evidence of an intent to hinder and delay creditors, and therefore void. And when the assignment, as in the case before us, gives the assignee a discretion as to credit, we arc of the opinion that a sale giving a credit beyond that authorized by law on sales by executors and administrators, would be an abuse of discretion; and in many cases the nature of the property and the state of the market, and other circumstances, would require the trustees to sell for cash, or on a shorter credit than executors or administrators are permitted to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Where, as in this case, the trustee has abused the discretion given 622] him., the creditors may require the notes taken *for the property to be sold, and may have such remedy against the trustee as the circumstances may require.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The other provisions of the assignment we do not think, <em>per se, </em>fraudulent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b482-9\">Bartley, C.
