Superior Court </em>(1986) 478 U.S. 1, 7 [92 L.Ed.2d 1, 106 S.Ct. 2735] <em>(Press-Enterprise II).) </em>\u201cUnderlying the First Amendment right of access to criminal trials is the common understanding that \u2018a major purpose of that Amendment was to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs,\u2019 . . . [and] to ensure that this constitutionally protected \u2018discussion of governmental affairs\u2019 is an informed one.\u201d <em>(Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1982) 457 U.S. 596, 604-605 [73 L.Ed.2d 248, 102 S.Ct. 2613].) In California, this right of access is protected by Code of Civil Procedure section 124, which provides that \u201cthe sittings of every court shall be public.\u201d (See <em>NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178, 1216 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 778, 980 P.2d 337] [First Amend, cases \u201cinform our interpretation of [Code Civ.

Petrol Stops Northwest </em>(1979) 441 U.S. 211, 218-219 [60 L.Ed.2d 156, 99 S.Ct. 1667]; see also <em>McClatchy Newspapers v. Superior Court </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1162, 1175 [245 Cal.Rptr. 774, 751 P.2d 1329] [\u201cThe importance of secrecy is well established in the context of the grand jury\u2019s criminal indictment function\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The instant petition for writ of mandate, filed by the Los Angeles Times and the Los Angeles Daily Journal, raises an issue of first impression: whether the general California rule of grand jury secrecy applies to <em>ancillary proceedings </em>such as the motions to quash grand jury subpoenas being litigated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">After careful research and consideration, we conclude the motion to quash hearings, and the documents filed in connection therewith, should be closed and sealed <em>to the extent necessary to prevent disclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury. </em>Accordingly, we will grant the writ petition in part and deny it in part, and remand this matter to the superior court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">1. <em>The underlying grand jury proceeding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">The writ petition arises out of a grand jury investigation into allegations that certain Roman Catholic priests, employed by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, committed acts of child molestation. As we noted in our previous opinion in this on-going matter, \u201cOn June 12, 2002, the Los Angeles County District Attorney served grand jury subpoenas on the archdiocese\u2019s custodian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>of records, seeking all documents in the archdiocese\u2019s possession or control\u2014including \u2018confidential personnel files\u2019\u2014that \u2018relate in any way to allegations of child molestation or sexual abuse\u2019 by any of the petitioners [three Roman Catholic priests]. The archdiocese produced the requested documents, which the trial court sealed[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] because the [priests] immediately moved to quash the subpoenas.\u201d <em>(M.B. v. Superior Court </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 1384, 1386 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 454], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">When the superior court ruled the subpoenas were not facially defective for failing to meet the affidavit requirements set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 1985, subdivision (b) (affidavit shall be served with subpoena duces tecum showing good cause and materiality) and 1987.5 (service of subpoena duces tecum is invalid without affidavit), several of the priests filed a petition for writ of mandate in this court. That writ petition argued the subpoenas should be quashed because the grand jury had no authority to issue subpoenas duces tecum and, even if it did, the subpoenas were facially defective. The substantive evidentiary privilege claims being asserted against the subpoena demands were held in abeyance pending our resolution of the writ petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">On December 2, 2002, in response to that writ petition, this court issued <em>M.B. v. Superior Court, </em>in which we held that \u201cCalifornia criminal grand juries have the power to issue subpoenas duces tecum, and . . . such subpoenas do not require good cause affidavits.\u201d <em>(M.B. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at p. 1386.)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">2. <em>Appointment of discovery referee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">After our opinion was filed, the People, the individual priests and the Archdiocese stipulated to the appointment of Judge (Retired) Thomas Nuss (the referee) to resolve the substantive issues raised by the motions to quash. According to the referee, he had been appointed \u201cto hear and determine any and all of the issues with regard to the [subpoenas duces tecum], whether of fact or of law, and to report a statement of decision in writing\u201d to the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">On April 1, 2003, the referee held a hearing on the motions to quash, during which counsel argued the general legal principles they felt applied to the various evidentiary privileges being asserted against the demands made in the subpoenas duces tecum. Almost the entire hearing was conducted in open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>court; out of a 135-page transcript, only 16 pages were filed under seal. However, the referee subsequently decided it had been a mistake to hold a public hearing. On August 27, 2003, he issued an \u201cOrder Denying Public Access To Pleadings and Decision Related to Grand Jury Subpoenas\u201d which directed that all future pleadings, orders and hearings involved in litigating the motions to quash would be closed and sealed. On September 11, 2003, the Los Angeles Times and the Los Angeles Daily Journal filed the instant writ petition, seeking to overturn the referee\u2019s closure order.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">ISSUES RAISED</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">1. Petitioners, asserting there is \u201cenormous public interest\u201d in this case, ask us to vacate the referee\u2019s August 27 sealing order on the ground it violates their <em>presumptive right of public access </em>to judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Petitioners also contend there is no legal justification for keeping under seal the superior court order appointing Judge Nuss to act as the discovery referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">2. Real Party in. Interest District Attorney of Los Angeles contends there is no presumptive right of public access to grand jury proceedings. However, the District Attorney also contends, <em>\u201cthe privilege litigation concerning the motion to quash the grand jury subpoenas in this case is merely ancillary to the grand jury proceeding itself </em>Since there is intense public interest in the subject of the grand jury proceedings and the litigation of the motions to quash the subpoenas does not require disclosure of grand jury materials, there is no countervailing reason to maintain secrecy for these proceedings.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">3. Real Parties in Interest the Priests<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the Archdiocese<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> contend the writ petition must be dismissed as <em>procedurally </em>defective on the ground petitioners never made a formal motion in the superior court seeking to reverse the referee\u2019s sealing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">As to the substantive issues, these real parties in interest agree with the District Attorney that there is no presumptive right of public access to grand jury proceedings. But, contrary to the District Attorney\u2019s position, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>contend the <em>general rule of grand jury secrecy justifies the referee\u2019s blanket order sealing these ancillary grand jury proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">1. <em>The writ petition is not procedurally barred.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Real parties in interest the Archdiocese and the Priests ask us to dismiss the writ petition as premature because petitioners allegedly did not first exhaust all available remedies in the superior court. (See <em>Phelan v. Superior Court </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 363, 366 [217 P.2d 951] [\u201cAlthough [Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1086] does not expressly forbid the issuance of the writ if another adequate remedy exists, it has long been established as a general rule that the writ will not be issued if another such remedy was available to the petitioner.\u201d].) The Archdiocese acknowledges petitioners did request access to the proceedings by informal letter, but the Archdiocese contends the writ petition must be dismissed because petitioners never filed a formal motion in the superior court asking to have the referee\u2019s sealing order reversed. This claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">One of petitioners\u2019 informal letters was quite extensive, citing and discussing the same California and United States Supreme Court cases petitioners rely on in the writ petition itself. Moreover, the referee treated petitioners\u2019 informal requests as actual motions, saying: \u201cAlthough a formal motion has not been filed, the referee is aware that the media have sought access to the pleadings and orders related to these proceedings,\u201d and \u201cThe referee ... is aware that the media have sought access to the pleadings and orders related to these proceedings. The court treats those efforts as a request to hold public hearings and to permit public inspection of the pleadings and the referee\u2019s decision. In ruling on that motion, the court denies the requests for the reasons set forth herein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Given the referee\u2019s treatment of petitioners\u2019 letters, we cannot see how forcing petitioners to make a more formal request for public access would amount to anything but a waste of time and effort. The request to dismiss the writ petition as premature is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">2. <em>Referee\u2019s appointment order will be made public.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">Petitioners ask us to make public the superior court\u2019s January 9, 2003, \u201cStipulation and Order for Reference\u201d appointing Judge Nuss to be the discovery referee. No party objects to this, and we agree there is no reason to keep this aspect of the proceedings secret.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>3. <em>Petitioners have no presumptive right of access to grand jury proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Petitioners contend the referee\u2019s sealing order must be reversed because it violates their presumptive First Amendment right of access to judicial proceedings. This claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">a. <em>General rule of grand jury secrecy indicates no presumptive right.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Petitioners contend that closing the hearings and sealing the pleadings involved in litigating the motions to quash will violate their right of access as established by <em>NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th 1178 <em>(NBC </em>Subsidiary).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petitioners assert a \u201cpresumptive right of access\u201d to the materials they seek, and argue, \u201cthe only questions are whether some exception to the public\u2019s presumptive access rights applies to the proceedings and records at issue, or if no exception applies, whether there is some compelling justification for the blanket closure and sealing order issued by Respondent. Neither requirement is present here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">The claim that <em>NBC Subsidiary </em>gives petitioners a presumptive right of access to grand jury proceedings is incorrect. In construing Code of Civil Procedure section 124\u2019s mandate that \u201cthe sittings of every court shall be public,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>NBC Subsidiary </em>said: \u201c[I]t is clear today that substantive courtroom proceedings in ordinary civil [and criminal][<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] cases are \u2018presumptively open\u2019 and that section 124 must be interpreted to preclude closure of proceedings that satisfy the high court\u2019s historical tradition/utility considerations . . . .\u201d <em>(NBC Subsidiary, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 1217.) <em>But NBC Subsidiary also pointed out this presumptive right of access did not apply to grand jury proceedings, </em>saying: \u201cIn <em>Press-Enterprise II, </em>the high court distinguished \u2018presumptively open\u2019 preliminary hearings from other proceedings as to which there is no First Amendment right of access. It observed: <em>\u2018Although many governmental processes operate best under public scrutiny, it takes little imagination to recognize that there are some kinds of government operations that would be totally frustrated if conducted openly. A classic </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number><em>example is that \u201cthe proper functioning of our grand jury system depends upon the secrecy of grand jury </em>proceedings.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(NBC Subsidiary, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 1212, fn. 29, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Petitioners denigrate this language as mere \u201cdicta in a footnote in <em>NBC Subsidiary, </em>which in turn quotes dicta from <em>Press-Enterprise II.\u201d </em>Nevertheless, it is language that correctly states an essential principle about which petitioners are mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\"><em>Press-Enterprise II </em>described a two-part test for access claims. \u201cIn cases dealing with the claim of a First Amendment right of access to criminal proceedings, our decisions have emphasized two complementary considerations. First, because a \u2018 \u201ctradition of accessibility implies the favorable judgment of experiences,\u201d \u2019 [citation], we have considered whether the place and process have historically been open to the press and general public, [f] . . . [f] Second, ... the Court has traditionally considered whether public access plays a significant positive role in the functioning of the particular process in question.\u201d <em>(Press-Enterprise II, supra, </em>478 U.S. at p. 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Grand jury proceedings fail both steps in this two-part test and, as a result, the usual presumption of access is reversed. (See, e.g., <em>Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, supra, </em>441 U.S. 211, 222, 223 [when deciding if \u201cthe traditional secrecy of the grand jury may be broken,\u201d \u201c[i]t is clear . . . that disclosure is appropriate only in those cases where the need for it outweighs the public interest in secrecy, and that the burden of demonstrating this balance rests upon the private party seeking disclosure\u201d]; <em>United States v. Smith </em>(3d Cir. 1997) 123 F.3d 140, 148 <em>[Douglas Oil </em>\u201cimplicitly makes clear that grand jury proceedings are not subject to a First Amendment right of access under the test of \u2018experience and logic.\u2019 Historically, such proceedings have been closed to the public. Moreover, public access to grand jury proceedings would hinder, rather than further, the efficient functioning of the proceedings. [][] Not only are grand jury proceedings not subject to any First Amendment right of access, but third parties can gain access to grand jury matters only under limited circumstances.\u201d]; <em>In re Subpoena to Testify Before Grand Jury Directed to Custodian of Records </em>(11th Cir. 1989) 864 F.2d 1559, 1562 [\u201cIn order to justify lifting the secrecy that normally surrounds the grand jury proceedings, courts must find a \u2018particularized need\u2019 for the disclosure that outweighs the benefits of maintaining the secrecy. [Citation.] Even when the person requesting such disclosure has shown a particularized need for the materials, access is limited and covers only those materials actually needed.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>b. <em>California case law likewise demonstrates no presumptive right.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Petitioners have no presumptive right of access to grand jury proceedings or materials under California law. A trilogy of seminal California Supreme Court cases demonstrates that <em>NBC </em>Subsidiary's footnote 29 correctly states the general rule regarding grand jury secrecy. These cases demonstrate the power to disclose grand jury material is far more restricted than the power to prevent disclosure, and that a superior court exercising supervisory authority over a grand jury has inherent power to prevent unauthorized disclosures of grand jury material.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (1973 Grand Jury) </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 430 [119 Cal.Rptr. 193, 531 P.2d 761], held that \u201cif a proposed grand jury report exceeds established legal limits, the superior court which convenes the grand jury and which is responsible for its supervision may properly refuse to file the report. <em>Although no California statute explicitly authorizes such judicial action, this limited review is implicit in the statutory scheme </em>confining the grand jury\u2019s investigatory authority to specifically enumerated subjects . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 433, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\"><em>McClatchy Newspapers v. Superior Court, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 1162, held a superior court had properly prevented a grand jury from disclosing \u201craw evidentiary materials gathered during a secret watchdog investigation, including transcripts of testimony, summaries and analyses of testimony, and documentary exhibits.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1167.) <em>McClatchy </em>reasoned: \u201c[The] use of secrecy to protect grand jurors from the abuses of the Crown dates from the 17th century; for the most part, grand jury proceedings since that time have been closed to the public and records of such proceedings have been kept from the public eye. [Citation.] Most importantly, \u2018The right and duty of the grand jurors to conduct their investigations, deliberations and voting in secret, which were won and established in England, are substantially the same for the modem California grand jurors.\u2019 [Citation.] [f] <em>That the Legislature intended to incorporate this well-established heritage of secrecy into the present grand jury system is plainly and amply shown in the governing provisions of the Penal Code.'' (Id. </em>at p. 1173, italics added.) \u201c[G]rand jury secrecy is the mle and openness the exception, permitted only when specifically authorized by statute.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1180.)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\"><em>Daily Journal Corporation v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1117 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 623, 979 P.2d 982], held a superior court could not disclose materials gathered during a grand jury investigation into the notorious Orange County bankruptcy case, after the grand jury terminated without indicting anyone. \u201cThe question before us is whether the superior court in this matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>had authority to disclose grand jury materials to the public when none of the [grand jury] statutes was applicable. The Court of Appeal determined that the answer is yes, based on the superior court\u2019s inherent powers, including its power to supervise grand jury proceedings. ... [ft] The Court of Appeal purported to find no statutes or cases that would prohibit the disclosure of criminal grand jury materials in this matter. Concluding that the Legislature \u2018seems not to have addressed the question, \u2019 it ruled that, in effect, whatever exercise of authority to disclose grand jury materials has not been expressly prohibited by the Legislature is permitted. We disagree.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1124.) Rather, \u201cthe Legislature has addressed the question of grand jury secrecy and disclosure of grand jury materials extensively and comprehensively in the Penal Code. Viewing that statutory scheme as a whole, it appears that the Legislature intended disclosure of grand jury materials to be strictly limited. As we explained more than a century ago: \u2018In this State the whole matter [of disclosing grand jury proceedings] is regulated by statute.\u2019 [Citation.] By enacting the statutes governing the \u2018exceptional cases\u2019 [citation] in which a court may order disclosure of grand jury materials, the Legislature has, in effect, occupied the field; absent express legislative authorization, a court may not require disclosure.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1124-1125, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">This line of cases establishes that nondisclosure is the preeminent rule for California grand jury proceedings, that public access is regulated by express statutory authorization, and that even the inherent powers of a superior court supervising a grand jury are severely restricted when the court seeks to disclose grand jury materials. Clearly there is no presumptive right of public access to grand jury proceedings in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">4. <em>Status of \u201cancillary grand jury proceedings\u201d in the superior court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">All the parties agree that whether the California rules governing grand jury secrecy apply to <em>ancillary proceedings, </em>such as the motions to quash grand jury subpoenas being litigated herein, is a question of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Petitioners argue all of the case law we have discussed so far is irrelevant because the \u201cPenal Code provisions governing grand jury secrecy . . . only apply to the disclosure of \u2018testimony and materials placed before\u2019 the grand jury, and have no application to the pleadings, orders, or hearings in the matter pending before Judge Nuss.\u201d Petitioners assert, \u201cRespondent\u2019s August 27 Order is based solely on the rationale that secrecy is necessary to protect the confidentiality of grand jury proceedings. [Citation.] But Petitioners are not seeking access to documents subpoenaed by the grand jury, to any witnesses\u2019 testimony before the grand jury, or to grand jury deliberations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">No California case has dealt with the problem of so-called <em>ancillary grand jury proceedings, </em>proceedings that relate to a grand jury\u2019s investigation but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>do not occur in front of the grand jurors themselves, such as the discovery matters being litigated in front of Judge Nuss. Fortunately, however, we do not write on a completely blank slate. We have found it useful to examine how the federal rules and other states have approached this problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">a. <em>Consideration of former rule 6, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (28 U.S.C.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Before 1983, federal grand juries were governed by a general rule of secrecy which, like California\u2019s grand jury statutory scheme, did not expressly address <em>ancillary proceedings. </em>Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, former rule 6(e), provided only that a \u201cgrand juror, an interpreter, a stenographer [etc.] . . . shall not disclose <em>matters occurring before the grand jury, </em>except as otherwise provided for in these rules.\u201d (Italics added.) (See <em>Securities &amp; Exchange Com\u2019n v. Dresser Indus. </em>(D.C.

(See, e.g., <em>In re Grand Jury Investigation </em>(5th Cir. 1980) 610 F.2d 202, 216 [former rule 6(e) applies \u201cnot only to information drawn from transcripts of grand jury proceedings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>but also to anything which \u2018may tend to reveal what transpired before the grand jury.\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Application of State of California </em>(E.D.Pa. 1961) 195 F.Supp. 37, 40 [although \u201cnot matters occurring before the grand jury, it seems obvious that the names of witnesses subpoenaed to testify, as well as documents subpoenaed and used by them in their deliberations, are matters \u2018occurring before the grand jury.\u2019 \u201d]; <em>State ex rel.

Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure, rule 6(e)(5) (28 U.S.C.), now provides; \u201cSubject to any right to an open hearing in a contempt proceeding, the court must close any hearing to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>extent necessary to prevent disclosure of a matter occurring before a grand jury.\u201d Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure, rule 6(e)(6) (28 U.S.C.), now provides: \u201cRecords, orders, and subpoenas relating to grand-jury proceedings must be kept under seal to the extent and as long as necessary to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of a matter occurring before a grand jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">In formulating a California approach to the problem of ancillary grand jury proceedings, we can be guided by the amended federal rule. We agree with the view of one federal court, which explained: \u201cAs <em>a matter of judicial administration, initially closing all ancillary proceedings makes good sense. If a hearing is about something \u2018affecting\u2019 a grand jury investigation, there will nearly always be a danger of revealing grand jury matters. </em>Consider a challenge to a witness\u2019s claim of a testimonial privilege. The prosecutor appears before the Chief Judge seeking an order to compel testimony. The witness\u2019s identity, the fact that he was subpoenaed to testify, the fact that he invoked the privilege in response to questions, the nature of the questions asked\u2014all these would be, according to our precedent, [citation], \u2018matters occurring before the grand jury.\u2019 To suppose that the First Amendment compels the court to conduct such hearings by placing the witness behind a screen and by emptying the courtroom each time a grand jury matter reaches the tip of an attorney\u2019s or the judge\u2019s tongue is to suppose the ridiculous .... \u2018[C]ourts cannot conduct their business that way,\u2019 nor should they be compelled to do so.\u201d <em>(In re Motions of Dow Jones &amp; Co., Inc. </em>(D.C. Cir. 1998) 142 F.3d 496, 501-502, fn. omitted, italics added.) \u201cA <em>proceeding in the district court to quash a subpoena, or to compel testimony, or to immunize a witness would, it seems to us, almost invariably reveal matters occurring before the grand jury, and thus may properly be closed to the public. In ancillary proceedings dealing with other subjects, however, it may be difficult to determine at the outset whether grand jury matters might wind up being discussed.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 502, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">We find the current federal rule addressing ancillary grand jury proceedings to be relevant, reasonable and persuasive. It does not conflict with the express provisions of California\u2019s grand jury statutory scheme, and it is consistent with our Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of that statutory scheme. It provides an excellent model for our guidance in this matter. (See <em>State Department of Health Services v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1026, 1044 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 441, 79 P.3d 556] [\u201cto the extent the United States Supreme Court grounded the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>[Title VII] defense in the doctrine of avoidable consequences [citations], its reasoning applies to California\u2019s FEHA\u201d because it was \u201cconsistent with the two main purposes of the FEHA\u201d and \u201c[n]othing in the language of the FEHA precludes application of the avoidable consequences doctrine\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>5. <em>Conclusion: Ancillary proceedings to be secret \u201cto the extent necessary. \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Hence, we conclude the motion to quash litigation to be conducted by Judge Nuss, the discovery referee in this case, constitutes an ancillary grand jury proceeding. We further conclude this <em>ancillary proceeding should be closed and sealed to the extent necessary to prevent disclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury, </em>which would include preventing disclosure of information that might reveal the nature, scope or direction of the grand jury\u2019s investigation. (See, e.g., <em>In re Motions of Dow Jones &amp; Co., Inc., supra, </em>142 F.3d at pp. 500-501 [phrase \u201cmatters occurring before the grand jury\u201d \u201cincludes not only what has occurred and what is occurring, but also what is likely to occur\u201d and \u201c[ejncompassed within the rule of secrecy are . . . \u2018the strategy or direction of the investigation[]\u2019 \u201d]; <em>In re Subpoena to Testify Before Grand Jury </em>(11th Cir. 1989) 864 F.2d 1559, 1564 [\u201cNaturally, in responding to requests for release of information, the University is obligated to avoid revealing the direction of the grand jury investigation\u201d]; <em>In re Grand Jury Proceedings Relative to Perl </em>(8th Cir. 1988) 838 F.2d 304, 307 [\u201cWhile the disclosure of [business records] created independently of the grand jury investigation is less likely to impinge upon the policy underlying grand jury secrecy, the disclosure of these documents reveals \u2018at the very least, the direction of the grand jury\u2019s investigation and the names of persons involved, and thus falls within Rule 6(e)(2).\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">This rule will necessitate \u201can individualized determination whether a given disclosure will, when reasonably considered in the context of the particular grand jury inquiry, tend to reveal some secret aspect of the grand jury investigation.\u201d <em>(In re Grand Jury Proceedings </em>(6th Cir. 1988) 851 F.2d 860, 863.) We acknowledge this procedure \u201cmay sometimes require considerable expenditure of judicial time to carry out the often close analysis necessary to determine whether disclosure of given documentary evidence will reveal the nature, scope, or direction of grand jury proceedings. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 865.) However, we believe this approach will provide for the judicial supervision needed to safeguard the grand jury\u2019s effective operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">6. <em>Remand to superior court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">In the case at bar, the referee\u2019s August 27 decision stated: \u201cThe legislative and common law secrecy afforded Grand Jury proceedings reflect an overriding interest in the confidentiality of Grand Jury proceedings. There is a substantial probability that interest will be prejudiced absent the sealing of the orders and decisions at issue herein. Given the broad mandate of Grand Jury secrecy, there is no more narrow or less restrictive means of achieving that overriding interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>This language appears to have been taken from <em>NBC Subsidiary, </em>which held that <em>\u201cbefore </em>substantive courtroom proceedings are closed or transcripts are ordered sealed, a trial court must hold a hearing and expressly find that (i) there exists an overriding interest supporting closure and/or sealing; (ii) there is a substantial probability that the interest will be prejudiced absent closure and/or sealing; (iii) the proposed closure and/or sealing is narrowly tailored to serve the overriding interest; and (iv) there is no less restrictive means of achieving the overriding interest.\u201d <em>(NBC Subsidiary, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at pp. 1217-1218, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">But, as we have held in this opinion, <em>NBC Subsidiary </em>is not the correct test for determining the appropriate degree of public access to grand jury proceedings and materials. As a general matter, there is no public right of access to grand jury proceedings and materials, and it is the party seeking disclosure who has the burden of overcoming a presumption of grand jury secrecy. This strong principle of grand jury secrecy warrants applying the same nondisclosure presumption to the ancillary grand jury proceeding at issue here. Contrary to the District Attorney\u2019s contention, it is not at all clear the motion to quash litigation can be carried out publicly without disclosing grand jury matters that should remain secret. At the same time, it is at least theoretically possible that some aspect of this privilege litigation can be safely disclosed.
