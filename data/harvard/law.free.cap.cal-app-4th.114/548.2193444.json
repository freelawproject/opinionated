We disagree with plaintiff\u2019s argument and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Plaintiff purchased a commercial insurance policy from defendant covering the policy period of February 28, 1999 to February 28, 2000. On November 9, 1999, while plaintiff was in the process of updating its Oracle computer database, human error caused the database system to \u201ccrash,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> resulting in the loss of plaintiff\u2019s electronically stored data used to service its clients\u2019 insurance policies. Plaintiff hired consultants to restore the database, and data was manually inputted so that plaintiff could resume its normal business operations. Plaintiff incurred extra expenses restoring its data, and also suffered the loss of business income because of the disruption. Plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>quantified the loss in the amount of \u201c$53,586.83 in extra expenses to restore the database,\u201d and \u201c$209,442.80 in business income[,] losses of productivity, commissions and profits.\u201d Plaintiff made a claim on its insurance policy, hoping to recover its losses. Except for a small payment of $5,000, defendant denied the insurance claim, asserting other losses were not covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">Plaintiff argues its losses are covered under the policy\u2019s \u201cBuilding and Personal Property Coverage Form,\u201d and under certain policy endorsements. These endorsements are called: \u201cValuable Papers and Records Coverage Form\u201d; \u201cElectronic Equipment and Software Coverage\u201d; \u201cElectronic Data Processing Coverage Form\u201d; and \u201cBusiness Income Coverage Form (And Extra Expense) Actual Loss Sustained.\u201d Defendant asserts coverage for the type of loss suffered by plaintiff is not available under any of these coverage forms because each requires a \u201cdirect physical loss of or damage to\u201d property, and none of the loss or damage suffered by plaintiff was a \u201cdirect physical loss.\u201d Defendant also contends plaintiff\u2019s losses are excluded from coverage under the various exclusions in the coverage forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Procedurally, plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged causes of action against defendant for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, reformation, and declaratory relief, and a cause of action against the insurance broker for negligence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiff moved for summary adjudication of issues on the first cause of action for breach of contract and the fourth cause of action for declaratory relief, seeking a declaration of coverage and recovery for breach of contract in the event the court found in plaintiff\u2019s favor on the coverage issue. Defendant moved for summary adjudication of issues on all causes of action and on the claim for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The court granted defendant\u2019s motion for summary adjudication on the second (bad faith) and third (reformation) causes of action because plaintiff failed to submit a separate statement in response to defendant\u2019s separate statement as required by section 437c, subdivision (b), of the Code of Civil Procedure. With those matters resolved, the court adjudicated the remaining cross-motions for summary adjudication of the first and fourth causes of action by granting defendant\u2019s motion and denying plaintiff\u2019s motion. In short, the court ruled there was no insurance coverage for plaintiff\u2019s loss, and the breach of contract action necessarily failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">We independently review the court\u2019s decision on a motion for summary adjudication, \u201cconsidering all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion (except that which the court properly excluded) and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports.\u201d <em>(Merrill v. Navegan Inc. </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 465, 476 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 28 P.3d 116]; see also <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 24 Cal.4th 945, 972 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 672, 16 P.3d 94].) Further, to the extent our decision requires the interpretation of an insurance policy, we also conduct an independent review. <em>(Bluehawk v. Continental Ins. Co. </em>(1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1126, 1131 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 147].) Here, the issues argued on appeal raise no factual dispute. The sole disagreement concerns the proper interpretation of the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\n<em>Principles of Interpretation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">The principles by which insurance contracts are interpreted are well worn, but these bedrock principles bear repeating. \u201cWhile insurance contracts have special features, they are still contracts to which the ordinary rules of contractual interpretation apply. [Citation.] The fundamental goal of contractual interpretation is to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties. [Citation.] If contractual language is clear and explicit, it governs.\u201d <em>(Bank of the West v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1264 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545].) \u201cThe \u2018clear and explicit\u2019 meaning of [contractual] provisions, interpreted in their \u2018ordinary and popular sense,\u2019 unless \u2018used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage\u2019 [citation], controls judicial interpretation. [Citation.] Thus, if the meaning a layperson would ascribe to contract language is not ambiguous, we apply that meaning.\u201d <em>(AIU Ins. Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807, 822 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253].) We must also infer the intent of the parties, if possible, \u201csolely from the written provisions of the contract.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>Civ. Code, \u00a7 1639.)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">\u201cA policy provision will be considered ambiguous when it is capable of two or more constructions, both of which are reasonable. [Citation.] But language in a contract must be interpreted as a whole, and in the circumstances of the case, and cannot be found to be ambiguous in the abstract. [Citation.] Courts will not strain to create an ambiguity where none exists.\u201d <em>(Waller v. Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1, 18-19 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619].) \u201cThe fact that a term is not defined in the policies does not make it ambiguous.\u201d <em>(Foster-Gardner, Inc. v. National </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number><em>Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 857, 868 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 107, 959 P.2d 265].) \u201cIf there is ambiguity, however, it is resolved by interpreting the ambiguous provisions in the sense the promisor (i.e., the insurer) believed the promisee understood them at the time of formation.\u201d <em>(AIU Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 807, 822.) \u201cIf an asserted ambiguity is not ehminated by the language and context of the policy, courts then invoke the principle that ambiguities are generally construed against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist (i.e., the insurer) in order to protect the insured\u2019s reasonable expectation of coverage.\u201d <em>(La Jolla Beach &amp; Tennis Club, Inc. v. Industrial Indemnity Co. </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 27, 37 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 100, 884 P.2d 1048].)</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Plaintiff suggests public policy favors coverage in this case because of the importance to our economy of computers and the database systems they support. We decline to use public policy as an interpretive aid. An insurance policy is a contract, to be interpreted and enforced as such. The principles of contractual interpretation, as applied to insurance policies, are discussed, <em>ante. </em>These principles do <em>not </em>include using public policy to redefine the scope of coverage. <em>(AIU Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 807, 818 [\u201cThe answer [to coverage determinations] is to be found solely in the language of the policies, not in public policy considerations\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\n<em>Losses Claimed by Plaintiff</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Analysis of the coverage provided by the insurance policy must begin with an understanding of the claims made by plaintiff. Plaintiff\u2019s motion asserted that during the updating of its Oracle database, the database system \u201ccrashfed], resulting in the compromise, corruption and/or loss of all electronically stored data relating to [plaintiff\u2019s] business operations.\u201d As a result of this event, plaintiff \u201cincurred expenses, including data restoration costs, loss of net commission revenue, lost fees and loss of business income,\u201d in the amount of \u201c$53,586.83 in extra expenses to restore the database,\u201d and \u201c$209,442.80 in business income[,] losses of productivity, commissions and profits.\u201d Plaintiff did not claim the replacement or repair cost for any item of hardware or the storage medium. Instead, plaintiff limited its claim to the extra labor expenses incurred to recover from loss of the database as well as income lost during the period of recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\n<em>The Policy Provisions at Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">As we will show, the provisions of the insurance policy relied upon by plaintiff do not provide coverage unless a \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d to property covered by the policy has been suffered. The basic \u201cBuilding and Personal Property Coverage Form\u201d (BPP form) provides coverage for \u201cdirect physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>loss of or damage to Covered Property at the premises . . . caused by or resulting from any Covered Cause of Loss.\u201d A \u201cCovered Cause of Loss\u201d is defined in the \u201cCauses of Loss\u2014Special Form\u201d as \u201cRISKS OF DIRECT PHYSICAL LOSS\u201d unless otherwise excluded or limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Although plaintiff has not argued the point, we have considered whether the phrase \u201cdirect physical loss of or damage to Covered Property\u201d should be interpreted to mean that coverage is afforded both for a \u201cdirect physical loss of Covered Property\u201d and for \u201cdamage to Covered Property,\u201d whether the \u201cdamage\u201d is physical or nonphysical, direct or indirect. We do not adopt this interpretation, however, because it constitutes a strained and clumsy meaning, not an ordinary and popular meaning. Most readers expect the first adjective in a series of nouns or phrases to modify each noun or phrase in the following series unless another adjective appears. For example, if a writer were to say, \u201cThe orphanage relies on donors in the community to supply the children with used shirts, pants, dresses, and shoes,\u201d the reader expects the adjective \u201cused\u201d to modify each element in the series of nouns, \u201cshirts,\u201d \u201cpants,\u201d \u201cdresses,\u201d and \u201cshoes.\u201d The reader does not expect the writer to have meant that donors supply \u201cused shirts,\u201d but supply \u201cnew\u201d articles of the other types of clothing. Thus, we construe the words \u201cdirect physical\u201d to modify both \u201closs of\u2019 and \u201cdamage to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Even if we were to interpret the language in the BPP form to cover nonphysical damage as well as physical loss, coverage is triggered only if the loss results from a \u201cRISKQ OF DIRECT PHYSICAL LOSS.\u201d The risk encountered in this case was a negligent computer operator, or, perhaps, a defective computer program. Unless the harm suffered, i.e., the loss of electronically stored data without loss or damage of the storage media, is determined to be a \u201cphysical loss,\u201d we cannot say that the risk encountered in this case, a negligent operator, constitutes a risk of direct physical loss. We do not understand that a computer operator, sitting at a keyboard pressing keys or moving a mouse, presents any other relevant type of risk. Thus, under either an ordinary or a strained interpretation of the phrase \u201cdirect physical loss of or damage to Covered Property,\u201d coverage for plaintiff\u2019s claim under the BPP form depends on whether the loss of electronically stored data, without loss or damage of the storage media, constitutes a \u201cdirect physical loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">We reach the same conclusion for each of the other provisions of the policy urged by plaintiff as providing coverage. The coverage form called \u201cBusiness Income Coverage Form (And Extra Expense) Actual Loss Sustained\u201d provides coverage for the \u201cactual loss of Business Income\u201d sustained by the insured \u201cdue to the necessary suspension of [the insured\u2019s] \u2018operations\u2019 during the \u2018period of restoration.\u2019 \u201d But \u201c[t]he suspension must be caused by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>direct physical loss of or damage to property at the premises described in the Declarations . . . caused by or resulting from any Covered Cause of Loss.\u201d The \u201cCovered Cause of Loss\u201d is again defined in the \u201cCauses of Loss\u2014 Special Form\u201d as all \u201cRISKS OF DIRECT PHYSICAL LOSS\u201d unless otherwise excluded or limited. Thus, although the damage covered, loss of income, is not itself a physical loss, the loss of income must be <em>caused </em>by a physical loss resulting from a risk of physical loss described in the same terms as in the BPP form.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">The Electronic Equipment and Software Coverage form, which the parties agree was part of the policy, expressly modifies the BPP form. But the provision in the BPP form requiring a \u201cdirect physical loss of or damage to Covered Property . . . caused by or resulting from any Covered Loss\u201d is not modified. This form does amend the \u201cCauses of Loss\u2014Special Form,\u201d but only to narrow the exclusions. It does not modify or amend the basic requirement that the loss result from a \u201cRISK[] OF DIRECT PHYSICAL LOSS.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The coverage form called \u201cValuable Papers and Records Form\u201d provides coverage for \u201c \u2018loss\u2019 to Covered Property from any of the ... . [][] RISKS OF DIRECT PHYSICAL LOSS . . . except [as excluded].\u201d The word \u201closs\u201d in this coverage form is defined as \u201caccidental loss or damage.\u201d Thus, although the \u201closs\u201d covered by this form is not described as a \u201cphysical loss,\u201d the loss is not covered unless it results from a risk of direct physical loss, just like the BPP form.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Finally, the coverage form called \u201cElectronic Data Processing Coverage\u201d form provides coverage for \u201closs\u201d to \u201c[electronic data processing equipment,\u201d \u201c[d]ata processing \u2018data\u2019 and \u2018media,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cnecessary \u2018extra expense\u2019 [the insured] incur[s] in continuing the business after a \u2018loss to [the insured\u2019s] data processing operation,\u2019 \u201d from any \u201cCovered Causes of Loss.\u201d The \u201cCovered Causes of Loss\u201d are all \u201cRISKS OF DIRECT PHYSICAL \u2018LOSS\u2019 \u201d except as excluded.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Thus, under each of the potentially relevant coverage forms of the insurance policy, the losses claimed by plaintiff are not covered by the policy unless we interpret a \u201cphysical loss\u201d to include the loss of electronically stored data, without any loss or damage to the storage media or to any other property. As discussed below, we do not adopt this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>\n<em>Plaintiff\u2019s Loss Was Not a \u201cPhysical Loss\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Neither party submitted any evidence suggesting that the phrase \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d has some technical meaning or special meaning given by usage. Accordingly, we interpret these words in their ordinary and popular sense to determine whether they impart a clear and explicit meaning in the context of the losses claimed against the insurance policy. We conclude they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The word \u201cphysical\u201d is defined, inter alia, as \u201chaving material existence\u201d and \u201cperceptible esp. through the senses and subject to the laws of nature.\u201d (Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dict. (10th ed. 1993) p. 875.) \u201cMATERIAL implies formation out of tangible matter.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 715.) \u201cTangible\u201d means, inter alia, \u201ccapable of being perceived esp. by the sense of touch.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1200.) Thus, relying on the ordinary and popular sense of the words, we say with confidence that the loss of plaintiff\u2019s database does not qualify as a \u201cdirect physical loss,\u201d <em>unless </em>the database has a material existence, formed out of tangible matter, and is perceptible to the sense of touch.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">A \u201cdatabase\u201d is a \u201clarge collection of data organized esp. for rapid search and retrieval (as by a computer).\u201d (Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dict. (10th ed. 1993) p. 293.) \u201cData\u201d is defined, quite simply, as factual or numerical \u201cinformation.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Thus, the loss of a database is the loss of organized information, in this case, the loss of client names, addresses, policy renewal dates, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">We fail to see how <em>information, qua </em>information, can be said to have a material existence, be formed out of tangible matter, or be perceptible to the sense of touch. To be sure, information is stored in a physical medium, such as a magnetic disc or tape, or even as papers in three-ring binders or a file cabinet, but the information itself remains intangible. Here, the loss suffered by plaintiff was a loss of information, i.e., the <em>sequence </em>of ones and zeroes stored by aligning small domains of magnetic material on the computer\u2019s hard drive in a machine readable manner.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Plaintiff did not lose the tangible material of the storage medium. Rather, plaintiff lost the stored <em>information. </em>The sequence of ones and zeros can be altered, rearranged, or erased, without losing or damaging the tangible material of the storage medium.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">We conclude the loss of the database, with its consequent economic loss, but with no loss of or damage to tangible property, was not a \u201cdirect physical loss of or damage to\u201d covered property under the terms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>subject insurance policy, and, therefore, the loss is not covered. Although counsel have cited no California cases addressing this issue, nor have we found any, our conclusion is consistent with cases decided on closely related issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\n<em>Consistent Third Party Coverage Cases</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In <em>Seagate Technology, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co. </em>(N.D. Cal. 1998) 11 F.Supp.2d 1150 <em>(Seagate), </em>Seagate, a manufacturer of disk drives for personal computers and small business machines, was sued by Amstrad, one of its customers, a manufacturer of personal computers, who alleged the disk drives supplied by Seagate were failing. Seagate tendered the defense to its insurer who declined to provide a defense. The policy under which Seagate was insured provided liability coverage for \u201cphysical damage to tangible property of others.\u201d After deciding that applicable law would not provide insurance coverage for the defective disc drives, the <em>Seagate </em>court noted that Amstrad\u2019s complaint alleged \u201closs of customer\u2019s information,\u201d but \u201cabsent from the complaints is any suggestion that components of the host computer, other than the Seagate drives, suffered damage.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1155.) In other words, the <em>Seagate </em>court passed without comment the unstated conclusion that loss of data, by itself, is not \u201cphysical damage to tangible property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Similarly, in <em>America Online, Inc. v. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. </em>(E.D. Va. 2002) 207 F.Supp.2d 459, America Online found itself defending many lawsuits by customers alleging that version 5.0 of its Internet access software caused their computers to \u201c \u2018crash\u2019 rendering them inoperable.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 462.) America Online tendered the defense of these claims to St. Paul, the insurance carrier who issued their commercial general liability policy. As in <em>Seagate, </em>the policy covered liability for \u201c \u2018physical damage to tangible property of others.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Relevant to the issues here, the court held \u201ccomputer data, software and systems are not \u2018tangible\u2019 property in the common sense understanding of the word. The plain and ordinary meaning of the term \u2018tangible\u2019 is property that can be touched. Computer data, software and systems are incapable of perception by any of the senses and are therefore intangible.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cSimilar to the information written on a notepad, or the ideas recorded on a tape, or the design memorialized in a blueprint, computer data, software and systems are intangible items stored on a tangible vessel\u2014the computer or a disk.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 468.)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Although the <em>Seagate </em>and <em>America Online </em>decisions involve third party claims, the similarity of the coverage language in the policies makes these decisions closely analogous. And these cases do not stand alone in characterizing computer data or information, <em>qua </em>information, as intangible property. (See, e.g., <em>State Auto Property </em>v. <em>Midwest Computers &amp; More </em>(W.D.Okla. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>2001) 147 F.Supp.2d 1113 [no duty to defend against claims alleging negligent service work causing loss of computer data]; <em>cf. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine v. National Computer </em>(Minn.Ct.App. 1992) 490 N.W.2d 626, 631 [misappropriation of trade secret information stored in three-ring binders not damage to tangible property. \u201c[T]he information itself was not tangible\u201d].) We see no reason to attribute different meanings to \u201cdirect physical loss,\u201d as used in first party coverage provisions, and \u201cphysical damage to tangible property,\u201d as used in third party coverage provisions. At least with respect to the issue presented in the instant case, neither phrase describes lost information without a concomitant loss of a tangible storage medium.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\n<em>Cases Relied Upon by Plaintiff Are Unpersuasive</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The decisions relied upon by plaintiff are unpersuasive on the issue we decide.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For example, in <em>Hughes v. Potomac Ins. Co. </em>(1962) 199 Cal.App.2d 239 [18 Cal.Rptr. 650], heavy rains caused the backyard of plaintiff\u2019s insured dwelling to slide into a creek, but the structure of the building itself was not damaged. The court held the first party insurance policy covering physical loss and damage to the \u201cdwelling\u201d covered plaintiff\u2019s loss. This decision does <em>not </em>stand for the proposition that loss of or damage to intangible property can constitute a physical loss. Quite clearly, the loss of the backyard <em>was </em>a physical loss of tangible property. The essential question decided by the <em>Hughes </em>court was whether the insured \u201cdwelling\u201d included the ground under the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Similarly, in <em>Western Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>First Presbyterian Church </em>(1968) 165 Colo. 34 [437 P.2d 52], gasoline had accumulated in the soil around the insured building, infiltrating and saturating the foundation and making the structure uninhabitable. The court found the loss of use was covered by an insurance policy insuring against the consequential results of a direct physical loss. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 38-39.) Again, this case does <em>not </em>stand for the proposition that loss of intangible property can constitute a physical loss. A physical loss occurred when the foundations became saturated with gasoline. The essential question decided by the <em>First Presbyterian </em>court was whether the resultant loss of use could be recovered under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Likewise, in <em>Azalea, Ltd. v. American States Ins. Co. </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1995) 656 So.2d 600, a sewage treatment plant was vandalized by the dumping of an unknown chemical into the system. Inter alia, the chemical destroyed a bacteria colony, which was an integral part of the sewage treatment facility. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 602.) The court found the loss was covered by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>policy insuring against direct physical loss. Here again, the destruction of a bacteria colony cannot be considered damage to or loss of intangible property, and thus provides no support for recovery of plaintiff\u2019s losses in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Finally in <em>Retail Systems v. CNA Ins. Companies </em>(Minn.Ct.App. 1991) 469 N.W.2d 735, a third party liability policy covering \u201cphysical injury or destruction of tangible property\u201d was held to cover damages for the loss of a computer tape containing the results of a voter survey conducted by a political party. The computer tape, together with the data it contained, was found to be \u201ctangible property,\u201d and the measure of recoverable damages was enhanced by the value of the lost data stored on the tape. But the condition of coverage, the loss of tangible property, was plainly satisfied by the loss of the tape. Once again, the <em>Retail Systems </em>case does <em>not </em>stand for the proposition that the loss of intangible property by itself constitutes direct physical loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\n<em>Summary Judgment Was Proper</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">With the coverage issue decided against plaintiff, summary judgment was properly granted in favor of defendant. Since no coverage was provided by the policy, defendant\u2019s denial of coverage manifestly was a breach of neither the contract nor the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The judgment is affirmed. Defendants shall recover their costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Bedsworth, Acting P. J., and Aronson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 7, 2004, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied March 30, 2004. Kennard, J., and Moreno, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-8\"> The complaint names both The Employers Fire Insurance Company and One Beacon as the issuers of the subject insurance policy. Both defendants appeared and both defendants moved for summary adjudication. Defendants\u2019 motion for summary adjudication as to One Beacon was properly granted, and plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary adjudication as to One Beacon was properly denied, because One Beacon was not the issuer of the insurance policy. Plaintiff does not argue for reversal as to One Beacon. Accordingly, throughout the remainder of this opinion, The Employers Fire Insurance Company will be referred to in the singular as \u201cdefendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b498-9\"> The recitation of facts is taken from plaintiff\u2019s separate statement of undisputed facts submitted in support of plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary adjudication. Defendant did not dispute the material facts on which this opinion is based.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b498-10\"> A computer \u201ccrash\u201d is an imprecise term, and its use tends to mask the true facts. Most computer users recognize some \u201ccrashes\u201d are simply the result of an error or \u201cbug\u201d in the computer program by which the programmer failed to provide instructions in the program to handle an unexpected sequence of events, or by which the instructions in the program were actually erroneous. Other \u201ccrashes\u201d are the result of mechanical or electrical failure, such as the mechanical breakdown of a hard drive, or a power surge or failure. From all of the evidence submitted, and because plaintiff failed to provide evidence of any mechanical or electrical failure, we proceed on the assumption this \u201ccrash\u201d did not involve a mechanical or electrical failure. Plaintiff imprecisely described the \u201ccrash\u201d to have resulted from \u201chuman error.\u201d At oral argument, plaintiff further advised that an operator inadvertently pressed the \u201cdelete\u201d key on the keyboard. Thus, it appears the \u201ccrash\u201d involved in this case resulted either from operator error or from a software program not sufficiently robust to recover from anticipated operator error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b499-7\"> The record on appeal does not disclose the disposition of the negligence cause of action against the broker. The superior court docket reflects a \u201cpartial\u201d dismissal with prejudice shortly before entry of judgment. We presume this entry reflects a dismissal of the broker.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b503-8\"> All of the coverage forms contain certain exclusions, some of which would exclude coverage for all or part of plaintiff\u2019s claimed losses. Since we find plaintiff\u2019s claims are not covered under any of the coverage forms because a \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d was not suffered from a risk of \u201cdirect physical loss,\u201d we find it unnecessary to analyze the various exclusions and their application to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b504-10\"> Plaintiff\u2019s motion does not identify the type of storage medium. Our example assumes storage on a magnetic disc, but our conclusion applies to other storage media as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b506-9\"> We ignore two unpublished decisions cited by plaintiff\u2014one by a federal district court in Arizona, and the other by a federal district court in the Northern District of California. These cases may not be cited as authority. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 977(a).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b507-11\"> Plaintiff\u2019s cause of action for reformation of the policy was a nonissue. Plaintiff sought to reform the policy to include the Electronic Equipment and Software Coverage form. But defendant admitted this coverage form was, in fact, part of the policy, and our analysis assumes this form was a part of the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
