Code, \u00a7\u00a7 288.2, subd. (b), 664). He admitted that he had suffered six prior serious felony convictions within the meaning of Penal Code sections 667, subdivisions (b) to (i) and 1170.12. Defendant was committed to state prison to serve a determinate term of three years consecutive to an indeterminate term of 25 years to life. On appeal, he claims that the trial court prejudicially erred in (1) defining the \u201cintent or purpose of seducing\u201d element of the offenses, (2) defining the \u201charmful matter\u201d element of the offenses, (3) failing to instruct on the lesser offense of attempted misdemeanor distribution of harmful matter and (4) giving the 2000 version of CALJIC No. 2.50.01. He also claims that his sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.

Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The \u201cChild Exploitation Detail\u201d of the \u201cSexual Assault Investigative Unit\u201d of the San Jose police department is composed of several police officers who, among other things, \u201cgo into [Internet] chat rooms seeking out individuals who desire to sexualize with children.\u201d Officer Mark Clough is assigned to this detail, and Sergeant David Michael Hewitt is in charge of the detail. Clough had heard from \u201cother agencies\u201d that \u201cchild predators\u201d could be found in a chat room called \u201cBarelylegalM4oldrM,\u201d and he had previously arrested someone whom he had met in this chat room. Hewitt knew that \u201cgay men gathered\u201d in this chat room and often engaged in conversations that were \u201csexual in nature.\u201d Such conversations often involved discussions of \u201cpenis sizes,\u201d \u201csexual acts\u201d and \u201cthreesomes,\u201d and the trading of photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Clough created an America Online (AOL) profile identifying himself as a fictitious 13-year-old boy named \u201cScotty\u201d living in Campbell with a birthdate of May 12, 1985. His screen name was \u201cscotty0585.\u201d \u201cScotty\u201d stated in his profile that his occupation was \u201castronaut.\u201d On December 23, 1998, Clough entered the \u201cBarelylegalM4oldrM\u201d chat room using \u201cScotty\u2019s\u201d screen name. \u201cScotty\u2019s\u201d profile w.as available to the other occupants of the chat room.

Defendant believed that both \u201cRyan\u201d and \u201cScotty\u201d were \u201c14 or 15\u201d years old. He admitted that he had talked to both of them about \u201cwhat he\u2019d like to do with them sexually\u201d and sent them pornography. Defendant said, \u201c[h]e would tell them sexual things to do to themselves and his goal was to get them to masturbate to the point of ejaculation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Defendant told Clough that he had many people he thought were minors on his \u201cbuddy list.\u201d Defendant said he had not met any of these people. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Defendant admitted that he was \u201csexually attracted to males between the ages of 15 and 28,\u201d but he said he had not had sexual contact with any minors since 1988. Clough asked defendant if he would \u201cengage in sexual activity\u201d with \u201cScotty\u201d or \u201cRyan\u201d if they lived in an apartment adjacent to defendant. Defendant said, \u201cthere was a good possibility that he would, but he certainly would hope he would not.\u201d Defendant told Clough that he never met \u201cRyan\u201d or \u201cScotty\u201d because \u201che was afraid of the police and if he was caught, that it would ruin his life and hurt his family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Defendant was charged by information with 10 counts of attempted distribution or exhibition of harmful matter to a minor over the Internet (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 288.2, subd. (b), 664) and one count of possession of child pornography (Pen. Code, \u00a7 311.11, subd. (a)). It was further alleged that he had suffered six prior serious felony convictions within the meaning of Penal Code sections 667, subdivisions (b) to (i) and 1170.12. The prior conviction allegations were bifurcated at defendant\u2019s request, and he subsequently admitted those allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The defense objected in limine under Evidence Code section 352 to the admission of evidence of defendant\u2019s prior sex offenses under Evidence Code section 1108. Defendant\u2019s trial counsel argued that CALJIC No. 2.50.01 was inadequate to protect defendant from the damaging impact of evidence of his prior offenses. The trial court found that evidence of defendant\u2019s 1981, 1982, and 1983 offenses would be \u201cunduly prejudicial because of the number of victims and also the nature of the sexual activity,\u201d but it concluded that evidence of defendant\u2019s 1988 offenses was \u201cmore probative than prejudicial in the context of an 1108\u201d and therefore was admissible.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">D.C., the victim of defendant\u2019s 1988 offenses, testified at trial in the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief. D.C. recounted how he had become \u201cfriends\u201d with defendant after meeting defendant at the store where defendant worked next door to D.C.\u2019s home. At the time, D.C. was 12 years old. On about ten occasions, defendant touched D.C. \u201cin a sexual manner.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Defendant never threatened D.C. in any way or told him not to tell anyone, and he never talked to D.C. in a sexually suggestive manner. During cross-examination, D.C. mentioned at one point that defendant \u201chad been to prison.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Defendant presented an expert witness at trial who testified that gay chat rooms and heterosexual chat rooms were \u201cnot that different\u201d and \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>behavior is remarkably similar . . . .\u201d \u201c[I]n these chat rooms, people are having electronic sex in minutes. . . . [f] Likewise, things you would not think of doing in real life, you do in entertainment [in chat rooms].\u201d This expert opined that people generally went to chatrooms \u201cfor entertainment purposes only.\u201d In gay chat rooms, there is \u201cvery much sexual, seductive type of talk. Lots of talk about very much explicit conversation.\u201d \u201c[Y]ou often see a lot of talk about masturbation in those chat rooms and there\u2019s also a lot of talk about what-I\u2019d-like-to-do-to-you type of things, I\u2019d like to lick you here, touch you there.\u201d He also said that there was a lot of talk about penis size.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The prosecutor opened his argument to the jury by calling defendant a \u201cchild molester\u201d and \u201csexual predator.\u201d \u201c[Defendant wants to have sex with boys, has had sex with boys. That\u2019s his predisposition.\u201d The jury deliberated for one full day before returning guilty verdicts on nine of the 10 attempted distribution counts. It acquitted defendant of the initial attempted distribution count based on the December 23, 1998 conversation and of the possession of child pornography count. The court struck the prior conviction findings as to eight of the nine counts, imposed a 25-years-to-life sentence on the remaining count and imposed consecutive mitigated terms for the remaining counts. Thus, the court committed defendant to state prison to serve a determinate term of three years and an indeterminate term of 25 years to life. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">A. Instruction on Definition of \u201cIntent or Purpose of Seducing\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">Defendant asserts that the trial court\u2019s definition of the \u201cintent or purpose of seducing\u201d element of the charged offenses was prejudicially erroneous because it permitted the jury to base a conviction on defendant\u2019s intent to persuade \u201cScotty\u201d and \u201cRyan\u201d to masturbate alone rather than requiring an intent to persuade them to participate in sexual activity <em>in partnership with defendant. </em>The Attorney General concedes that the statute may \u201cplausibl[y]\u201d be construed to require more than merely \u201cencouraging the minor to engage in auto-gratification in the physical absence of the accused.\u201d Nevertheless, he insists that the trial court\u2019s instructions were not erroneous because the jury was not reasonably likely to construe the instruction as defendant asserts. The Attorney General\u2019s alternative argument is that the instruction was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">1. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">The distribution counts charged that defendant had acted \u201cwith the intent and for the purpose of seducing the minor.\u201d The court initially incorrectly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>instructed the jury on the intent elements of these crimes. It stated that the required intent was \u201cA, the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust, passions or sexual desires of that person or of the minor; <em>or </em>[f] B, with the intent or for the purpose of seducing the minor.\u201d (Italics added.) At the request of the defense, the jury was instructed that \u201cthe word \u2018seduce\u2019 means persuading one into sexual intercourse or other sexual activity, not mere discourse.\u201d The court did <em>not </em>give another defense-requested instruction that would have stated: \u201cDEFINITION OF SEDUCE: [j[] <em>\u2018Persuading into partnership in sexual intercourse. \u2019 People </em>v. <em>Hsu </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 976 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 184].\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In instructing on the possession of child pornography count, shortly after giving the instruction on the meaning of \u201cseduce,\u201d the court told the jury that \u201c \u2018[sjexual conduct\u2019 means any of the following. Whether actual or simulated: Sexual intercourse . . . <em>masturbation . . . </em>sexual lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic or rectal area for the purpose of sexual stimulation of the viewer . . . whether or not any of the above conduct is <em>performed alone </em>or by members of the same or opposite sex.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In his opening argument to the jury, the prosecutor told the jury that the two intent elements of the crime of distribution were <em>disjunctive. </em>At the completion of the prosecutor\u2019s opening argument, the court realized that it had made a mistake in its instructions on these intent elements, and the prosecutor conceded as much. The prosecutor then briefly argued that both intents had been proven. \u201cIntent to arouse, justify the lust passion and seduce. And that\u2019s been everything you\u2019ve heard as well. He talks about F-ing the victims, talks about having sex with them, talks about meeting them to have sex, those things, rather than \u2018or.\u2019 And the instruction was incorrect. And that\u2019s all that. [][] So again, the evidence is well within as it relates to and/or because you will see exactly what he says about what his intent is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The court then provided the jury with a corrected copy of the instruction and read the corrected instruction to the jury. The corrected instruction described the two intent elements as, \u201cwith the intent of arousing, appealing to or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires of that person or of the minor, <em>and </em>with the intent, or for the purpose of seducing a minor.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Defendant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s closing argument was primarily based on his contention that defendant had lacked the intent to seduce. He maintained that defendant\u2019s conversations with \u201cRyan\u201d and \u201cScotty\u201d were \u201cfor entertainment and nothing else.\u201d He argued that defendant \u201cwas involved in fantasy, entertainment.\u201d He asserted that there \u201cwas no indication whatsoever that he ever intended to meet these boys.\u201d Defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not claim that masturbation could not be a goal of a seduction, but he claimed that it had not been achieved. \u201cWell, folks, there is no way for them to prove that masturbation ever occurred. Remember, on the Internet, you can\u2019t prove activity. All you\u2019ve got is words. Words.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The prosecutor argued that it was not necessary that a meeting be intended. \u201cIt\u2019s to seduce for other sexual acts. It doesn\u2019t say you have to do that, doesn\u2019t say there has to be a meeting, doesn\u2019t say there has to be physical contact. What is your intent? Intent to seduce or get this other person to submit to a sexual act, <em>masturbation, </em>oral copulation, anal sex, repeatedly asking about those things, [ft] On the chats, it\u2019s very clear, and he talks about sex all the time in all the chats.\u201d (Italics added.) \u201c[A]gain, I don\u2019t have to prove the contacts <em>or the intent to </em>contact. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">After several hours of deliberations, the jury submitted the following question: \u201cRegarding \u2018special instruction #33\u2019, there seems to be some kind of confusion regarding the word \u2018into\u2019. Our question is simply; does there need to be a cause and effect, or can we define \u2018into\u2019 as meaning leading to?\u201d Special instruction No. 33 was the instruction that stated, \u201cthe word \u2018seduce\u2019 means persuading one into sexual intercourse or other sexual activity, not mere discourse.\u201d The trial judge responded in writing: \u201cWe do not understand your question could you clarify it or ask it in a different way.\u201d The jury responded: \u201cRe: Special Instruction # 33 [ft] Can the court give us a working definition for the phrase \u2018persuading one into\u2019? If something is asked to be done, does the mere asking of something to be done satisfy or does the act need to be completed? I hope this makes sense.\u201d After consulting with counsel, the court responded in writing: \u201cAre you asking whether there needs to be a completed sex act?\u201d The jury responded: \u201cYes. Do we need to see confirmation (in text) on \u2018Scotty\u2019 or \u2018Ryan\u2019s\u2019 part that \u2018they\u2019 were persuaded \u2018into\u2019 a sex act? We mean that \u2018Scotty or Ryan\u2019 told the defendant they did the act.\u201d The court responded: \u201cNo. For intent, you should read instruction number 33 in conjunction with instruction number 31, page 2, number 4.\u201d The trial court\u2019s reference was to the portion of the instruction on the elements of the offense that stated, \u201cThe exhibition of the harmful matter was done with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires of that person or of a minor, and with the intent or for the purpose of seducing a minor.\u201d The jury reached its verdicts shortly after receiving the trial court\u2019s response.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>2. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u201cIn deciding whether an instruction is erroneous, we ascertain at the threshold what the relevant law provides. We next determine what meaning the charge conveys in this regard. Here the question is, how would a reasonable juror understand the instruction. In addressing this question, we consider the specific language under challenge and, if necessary, the charge in its entirety. Finally, we determine whether the instruction, so understood, states the applicable law correctly.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Warren </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 471, 487 [247 Cal.Rptr. 172, 754 P.2d 218]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 495, 525-526 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 677, 822 P.2d 385].)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u201cEvery person who, with knowledge that a person is a minor, . . . knowingly distributes, sends, causes to be sent, exhibits, or offers to distribute or exhibit by electronic mail, the Internet... or a commercial online service, any harmful matter, as defined in Section 313, to a minor with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires of that person or of a minor, and <em>with the intent, or for the purpose of seducing a minor, </em>is guilty of a public offense and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison or in a county jail.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288.2, subd. (b), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The Attorney General agrees with defendant that the statutory element of \u201cthe intent, or for the purpose of seducing a minor\u201d requires an intent by the perpetrator to <em>engage in a sexual act with the minor. </em>The only case that has considered the meaning of this element is <em>People </em>v. <em>Hsu </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 976 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 184]. <em>Hsu\u2019s </em>appeal challenged this intent element as unconstitutionally vague on the ground that \u201cseducing\u201d was not defined. <em>(Hsu, </em>at p. 992.) The court very briefly rejected his challenge. \u201cAlthough \u2018seduce,\u2019 as <em>Hsu </em>notes, can mean simply \u2018to lead astray,\u2019 it is also defined as \u2018persuading into partnership in sexual intercourse.\u2019 (Webster\u2019s 3d New Intemat. Dict. (1981) p. 2054.) In the context of section 288.2, subdivision (b), with its references to gratifying lust, passion, and sexual desire, people of ordinary intelligence [citation] would readily understand \u2018seducing\u2019 as used here to mean the latter definition.\u201d <em>(Hsu, </em>at p. 992.)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">We agree with <em>Hsu </em>that, as used in Penal Code section 288.2, subdivision (b), the word \u201cseducing\u201d was not intended to have the vague meaning of \u201clead[ing] astray\u201d (Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dict. (10th ed. 1999) p. 1057) but to have the precise meaning of \u201ccarry[ing] out the physical seduction of: entic[ing] to sexual intercourse.\u201d (Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dict. (10th ed. 1999) p. 1057.) And, in this context, \u201csexual intercourse\u201d clearly refers to \u201cintercourse involving genital contact between individuals\u201d rather than \u201cheterosexual intercourse involving penetration of the vagina by the penis.\u201d (Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dict. (10th ed. 1999) p. 1074.) Thus, the \u201cseducing\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>intent element of the offense requires that the perpetrator intend to entice the minor to engage in a sexual act involving physical contact between the perpetrator and the minor. Intending to entice a male minor to masturbate himself does not satisfy this \u201cseducing\u201d intent element of Penal Code section 288.2, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The next question is whether the trial court\u2019s instructions, taken as a whole, properly informed the jury of the scope of Penal Code section 288.2, subdivision (b)\u2019s \u201cseducing\u201d intent element. The Attorney General insists that the instructions were not reasonably likely to lead a reasonable juror to believe that the \u201cseducing\u201d intent element could be satisfied by evidence that defendant intended to entice \u201cScotty\u201d and \u201cRyan\u201d to masturbate. The Attorney General\u2019s position is difficult to reconcile with the instructions as a whole, particularly in light of the prosecutor\u2019s argument to the jury. The jury was told that \u201cthe word \u2018seduce\u2019 means persuading one into sexual intercourse <em>or other sexual activity, not mere discoursed </em>(Italics added.) While \u201csexual activity\u201d was not defined, the jury <em>was given </em>a definition of \u201csexual conduct\u2019 that explicitly included \u201cmasturbation\u201d that was \u201cperformed alone.\u201d The prosecutor also explicitly argued to the jury, \u201cI don\u2019t have to prove the contacts <em>or the intent to </em>contact.\u201d (Italics added.) Instead, the prosecutor told the jury that the \u201cseducing\u201d intent could be proven by evidence of defendant\u2019s intent to \u201cget this other person to submit to a sexual act, <em>masturbation, </em>oral copulation, anal sex . .. .\u201d (Italics added.) In addition, the jury\u2019s inquiries suggested that the jurors did understand the instructions to permit the \u201cseducing\u201d intent element to be based on an intent to entice \u201cScotty\u201d and \u201cRyan\u201d to masturbate alone. The jury\u2019s question as to whether it needed to \u201csee confirmation (in text) on \u2018Scotty\u2019 or \u2018Ryan\u2019s\u2019 part that \u2018they\u2019 were persuaded \u2018into\u2019 a sex act\u201d or that \u201c \u2018Scotty or Ryan\u2019 told the defendant they did the act\u201d could only have referred to masturbation since that was the only \u201cact\u201d that \u201cScotty\u201d or \u201cRyan\u201d ever mentioned having performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The Attorney General argues that no reasonable juror would have understood the instructions to permit the \u201cseducing\u201d intent element to be based on an intent to entice a minor to masturbate because such an intent \u201cwould be subsumed\u201d by the other intent element of the offense. Not so. The other intent element of the offense may be satisfied by proof that the perpetrator acted \u201cwith the intent of arousing, appealing to or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires of that person or of the minor.\u201d The perpetrator may act with this intent even if the perpetrator does not intend to entice the minor to perform any sexual act, even masturbation. The perpetrator may simply intend to arouse the minor without enticing the minor to perform any act or the perpetrator may be solely concerned with the perpetrator\u2019s arousal. We do not believe that reasonable jurors would believe that the \u201cseducing\u201d intent element was \u201csubsumed\u201d by the \u201carousing\u201d intent element if they believed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>that the \u201cseducing\u201d intent element could be satisfied by proof that the perpetrator intended to entice the minor to masturbate alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Our consideration of the trial court\u2019s instructions as a whole leads us to the conclusion that it is reasonably likely that the jury understood the court\u2019s instruction on the \u201cseducing\u201d intent element to permit it to base the \u201cseducing\u201d intent element on proof that defendant intended to entice \u201cScotty\u201d and \u201cRyan\u201d to masturbate alone. Since such proof cannot properly support the \u201cseducing\u201d intent element, the instruction on the \u201cseducing\u201d intent element was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The only remaining question is whether the erroneous instruction was prejudicial. We are unconvinced by the Attorney General\u2019s assertion that any error was harmless. The Attorney General contends that this error should be reviewed under the standard set forth in <em>People v. Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818 [299 P.2d 243] rather than the standard set forth in <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824], We disagree. An \u201cinstructional error that improperly describes or omits an element of an offense . . . falls within the broad category of trial error subject to <em>Chapman </em>review.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flood </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 470, 502-503 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 180, 957 P.2d 869].) The trial court\u2019s instructional error here \u201cimproperly describefd]\u201d the \u201cseducing\u201d intent element of the offense. Hence it was subject to <em>Chapman </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The trial court\u2019s error cannot survive <em>Chapman </em>review as the record does not demonstrate \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 407, 424 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 200, 886 P.2d 1193].) Defendant admitted that he had intended to entice \u201cScotty\u201d and \u201cRyan\u201d <em>to masturbate. </em>However, it was hotly contested at trial whether he ever intended to meet with them and have physical contact. He repeatedly deferred or rejected \u201cScotty\u2019s\u201d suggestions that they meet. His entire defense at trial was that his conversations with \u201cScotty\u201d and \u201cRyan\u201d were \u201cfantasy\u201d and \u201centertainment\u201d rather than preludes to physical contact. While the prosecution presented a strong case, we are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial court\u2019s instructional error did not contribute to the jury\u2019s verdict. Consequently, reversal is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">B. Other Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Although we must reverse defendant\u2019s convictions due to the prejudicial instructional error on the \u201cseducing\u201d intent element, we consider defendant\u2019s other claims of instructional error for the guidance of the trial court on retrial. Because we reverse the judgment and remand for a possible retrial, it would be premature for us to address defendant\u2019s claim that the sentence imposed by the trial court was cruel and unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>1. Instruction Defining \u201cHarmful Matter\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Defendant asserts that the trial court\u2019s instruction defining \u201charmful matter\u201d was erroneous. Penal Code section 288.2, subdivision (b) prohibits the distribution of \u201cany harmful matter, as defined in Section 313, to a minor\u201d with the requisite intents. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288.2, subd. (b).) Penal Code section 313, subdivision (a) contains a definition of \u201charmful matter.\u201d \u201c \u2018Harmful matter\u2019 means matter, taken as a whole, which to the average person, applying contemporary statewide standards, appeals to the prurient interest, and is matter which, taken as a whole, depicts or describes in a patently offensive way sexual conduct and which, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\u201d Penal Code section 313, subdivision (a)(1) provides that, \u201c[w]hen it appears from the nature of the matter or the circumstances of its dissemination, distribution or exhibition that it is designed for clearly defined deviant sexual groups, the appeal of the matter shall be judged with reference to its intended recipient group.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The jury was instructed with the general definition of \u201charmful matter\u201d in Penal Code section 313, subdivision (a). The jury was not informed of the special definition in Penal Code section 313, subdivision (a)(1). Defendant claims that the trial court should have instructed the jury with the special definition in Penal Code section 313, subdivision (a)(1) because \u201cthe nature of the matter or the circumstances of its dissemination, distribution or exhibition\u201d in this case demonstrated that the \u201cmatter\u201d was \u201cdesigned for clearly defined deviant sexual groups.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">This contention lacks substantial support in the record. Defendant sent pornography to and engaged in explicit sexual discussions with persons who he believed were young boys. The circumstances of his distribution of this \u201cmaterial\u201d did not indicate that these fictitious young boys were part of any \u201cclearly defined deviant sexual groups.\u201d All defendant knew about the recipients of this material was that they were young gay boys who had made at least one visit to a gay male chat room. Defendant urges that his distribution of this material was to a \u201cdeviant sexual group\u201d because it arose from contacts made in a gay male chat room on the Internet. This ignores the fact that none of the charged acts were based on communications <em>within a chat room </em>but instead on personal messages sent to recipients who had already identified themselves as young gay boys. Since even young gay boys who occasionally visit gay male chat rooms are not part of a \u201cclearly defined deviant sexual group,\u201d the trial court was not required to give the special definition of \u201charmful matter\u201d in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>2. Failure to Instruct on Lesser Offense</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Defendant contends that the trial court should have instructed on the lesser \u2022 offense of attempted misdemeanor distribution of harmful matter in violation of Penal Code section 313.1, subdivision (a) (hereafter the misdemeanor). He claims that this lesser offense is a necessarily included offense of attempted distribution of harmful matter in violation of Penal Code section 288.2, subdivision (b) (hereafter the wobbler). The Attorney General claims that the misdemeanor is not necessarily included within the wobbler.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u201c[A] lesser offense is necessarily included in a greater offense if either the statutory elements of the greater offense, or the facts actually alleged in the accusatory pleading, include all the elements of the lesser offense, such that the greater cannot be committed without also committing the lesser.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Birks </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 108, 117 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 848, 960 P.2d 1073].) \u201c[T]he trial court must instruct on a lesser offense necessarily included in the charged offense if there is substantial evidence the defendant is guilty only of the lesser.\u201d <em>(Birks, </em>at p. 118.)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">We first examine the statutory elements of the wobbler and the misdemeanor to determine whether the wobbler may be committed without necessarily committing the misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">\u201cEvery person who, with knowledge that a person is a minor, knowingly distributes, sends, causes to be sent, exhibits, or offers to distribute or exhibit by electronic mail, the Internet ... or a commercial online service, any harmful matter, as defined in Section 313, to a minor with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires of that person or of a minor, and with the intent, or for the purpose of seducing a minor, is guilty of a public offense and shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison or in a county jail.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288.2, subd. (b).) The five elements of the wobbler are (1) distribution by electronic mail, the Internet or a commercial online service, (2) of \u201cany harmful matter,\u201d (3) to a minor, (4) with knowledge that the person is a minor, and (5) with both of the requisite specific intents.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">We must compare the five elements of the wobbler to the elements of the misdemeanor. \u201cEvery person who, with knowledge that a person is a minor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>or who fails to exercise reasonable care in ascertaining the true age of a minor, knowingly sells, rents, distributes, sends, causes to be sent, exhibits, or offers to distribute or exhibit by any means, including, but not limited to, live or recorded telephone messages, any harmful matter to the minor shall be punished as specified in Section 313.4.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 313.1, subd. (a).) The four elements of the misdemeanor are (1) distribution \u201cby any means,\u201d (2) of \u201cany harmful matter,\u201d (3) to a minor and (4) with knowledge that the person is a minor or with a lack of reasonable care in ascertaining the minor\u2019s true age.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The wobbler necessarily requires that the perpetrator distributed harmful matter to a minor with knowledge of the person\u2019s minority. The Attorney General nevertheless claims that the misdemeanor is not necessarily committed when the wobbler is committed because distribution over the Internet is <em>not </em>distribution \u201cby any means.\u201d We cannot credit this argument. Penal Code section 288.2 currently contains two subdivisions that separately outlaw distribution of harmful matter <em>over the Internet </em>and distribution of harmful matter <em>by any means, </em>but this differentiation must be considered in context. When Penal Code section 288.2 was enacted in 1989, it outlawed distribution \u201cby any means\u201d with the requisite intents. At that time, Penal Code section 313.1 similarly outlawed distribution \u201cby any means\u201d but did not require specific intent. In 1997, the Legislature amended Penal Code section 288.2 to add a separate subdivision outlawing Internet distribution with the requisite intents. The offense was otherwise identical to the offense that had originally been outlawed by Penal Code section 288.2. The Legislature did not amend Penal Code section 313.1. We do not understand this amendment to have changed the meaning of Penal Code section 313.1 so as to preclude that statute from applying to Internet distribution of harmful matter without specific intent. The plain language of the statute, \u201cby any means,\u201d clearly includes distribution by means of the Internet.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">It necessarily follows that the misdemeanor offense described in Penal Code section 313.1 is a lesser included offense of the wobbler offense described in Penal Code section 288.2, subdivision (b), and the trial court was obligated to instruct on the misdemeanor offense if there was substantial evidence that defendant was guilty only of the misdemeanor. The evidence presented at trial raised a substantial question as to whether defendant actually harbored the specific intent to seduce \u201cRyan\u201d or \u201cScotty.\u201d Defendant essentially admitted all of the other elements of the offenses. Reasonable jurors could have concluded that defendant distributed harmful matter to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>\u201cRyan\u201d and \u201cScotty\u201d believing that they were minors and harbored the intent to arouse himself or them but lacked the intent to have any physical contact with them. Such a conclusion is consistent with guilt of only the misdemeanor rather than the wobbler offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The Attorney General contends that instructions on the misdemeanor offense were not required sua sponte because the misdemeanor offense was time-barred.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Even if we assume that the misdemeanor offense would have been time-barred, defendant could still obtain instructions on the necessarily included misdemeanor offense by requesting such instructions and waiving the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>(Cowan v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 367, 373 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 458, 926 P.2d 438].) At any retrial, the trial court should consider whether misdemeanor charges would be time-barred as to any of the nine counts, and it <em>must </em>instruct on the misdemeanor as to any counts where the misdemeanor would not be time-barred. Defendant may obtain instructions on the misdemeanor as to any counts that the trial court determines would be time-barred by waiving the statute of limitations as to those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">3. CALJIC No. 2.50.01</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Defendant claims that the 2000 version of CALJIC No. 2.50.01 violated his right to due process. In <em>People v. Reliford </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1007 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 254, 62 P.3d 601], the California Supreme Court upheld the 1999 version of CALJIC No. 2.50.01 but recommended that juries be instructed with the 2002 version of CALJIC No. 2.50.01. <em>(Reliford, </em>at p. 1016.) On retrial, the trial court should accept this recommendation and instruct with the 2002 version of CALJIC No. 2.50.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>III.

They talked about masturbation and other topics. Defendant again asked Clough for a photo and suggested phone sex. Clough put him off. On April 21, 1999, Clough sent defendant an e-mail. Defendant did not respond until May 4, 1999 when he sent Clough an instant message. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>spoke of masturbation and defendant again sought a photo of \u201cScotty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">On May 13, defendant again sent Clough an instant message. Clough told defendant that he had turned 14 the day before. Clough again said that his mom was going to leave him alone. Defendant replied, \u201cmaybe I should come see you on one of those days when your alone,\u201d but then he said, \u201cIt would be so cool if you lived a little closer.\u201d At the end of the conversation, defendant said, \u201cTake care and Happy Late Birthday I wish I could come there and give you the present that you want.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">On May 18, defendant again initiated contact by sending an instant message. He told Clough that he had not \u201cbeen with anyone\u201d during his two-year relationship with his boyfriend. Then he said, \u201cyeah until I fuck your brains out :)\u201d On June 22, 1999, defendant initiated, another contact. He asked Clough, \u201cwhen are we going to have sex :)\u201d They talked of masturbation, and defendant again sought a photo. Defendant also again said, \u201cI wish you were closer to me.\u201d When Clough asked, \u201cwhen u comin to here?\u201d defendant responded, \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The next contact was initiated by defendant on August 31, 1999. Clough asked, \u201cdid u ever come to san j\u00f3se this summer.\u201d Defendant said \u201c[n]o.\u201d Defendant said he \u201creally love[d]\u201d his boyfriend who was \u201ca great guy, but you could always move in and we could take care of you.\u201d Clough said, \u201cboth of u?\u201d Defendant responded, \u201cyeah we could have a threesome.\u201d But then he indicated that he and his boyfriend had been \u201ctoo shy\u201d to have a threesome with one of their friends. Defendant said, \u201cIf you lived closer I would have met you a long time ago believe me.\u201d Clough responded \u201cLIAR.\u201d He said, \u201cif u wanted to u wud have come here.\u201d Defendant said, \u201chow would I explain being gone all day to Kevin.\u201d Defendant mentioned that he had a jeep, and he offered Clough a ride in it and asked Clough, \u201cwould you let me get you naked in it.\u201d Clough responded affirmatively. Defendant said, \u201cI could make love to you outside in Tahoe that would be cool.\u201d He asked Clough, \u201cdo you think your mom would let you go.\u201d Clough indicated that he could manage, but said \u201cwe pretend to much marty.\u201d Defendant replied, \u201cwell we kinda have to since we are so far apart.\u201d Clough said, \u201cwhen u comin here.\u201d Again, defendant said \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He said, \u201cI wish I could say I would, be right over.\u201d \u201cI could say it easy enough, but I don\u2019t want to lie to you.\u201d He asked Clough if he would \u201chave sex\u201d with both defendant and defendant\u2019s boyfriend. They talked about masturbation. Defendant again asked for a photo, and he provided Clough with his work address so Clough could mail him a photo.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">Defendant initiated another contact on September 7, 1999. They briefly spoke of masturbation. He initiated another contact on September 29, 1999. Clough complained about having to take care of his mom, and defendant said, \u201cwell I wish I could come take you away.\u201d Clough responded, \u201cLIAR LIAR.\u201d Defendant said, \u201cwell I would like to, but I would probably get arrested and sent to prison\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t think I would like that.\u201d Clough responded \u201cwhatever.\u201d Defendant said, \u201cdo you think that I would like getting arrested.\u201d Clough responded, \u201cHOW wud u get arrested marty.\u201d Defendant said, \u201cyour mom might have something to say to that.\u201d Clough told defendant that another man he had met online wanted to meet him. Defendant warned him to \u201cbe very careful if you decide to meet him.\u201d He again suggested that Clough \u201cdo a threesome\u201d with him and his boyfriend. Defendant also again asked for a photo and suggested phone sex. Clough lamented that defendant was \u201cso far away.\u201d Defendant asked if he should take Clough off his \u201cbuddy list.\u201d He also asked Clough, \u201cif you could come would you leave right now and live with me.\u201d Defendant said, \u201cif there was no chance of me getting arrested I would drive down and get you.\u201d Clough became indignant. Defendant said, \u201cmaybe we could arrange something then\u201d but \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would tell Kevin.\u201d He asked Clough, \u201cwould you like to have a movie of you and I.\u201d Defendant said he \u201cwould love to be able to have you on tape nude and our bodies together.\u201d They talked about their penises for a while and then exchanged declarations of love.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">On October 12, Clough initiated contact with defendant. He claimed he had been in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Sacramento that weekend. Defendant suggested that Clough move to Sacramento, but Clough said his \u201cmom\u201d would not do so. They did not engage in any sexual discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b180-10\"> \u201cLOL\u201d is used on the Internet as an acronym for \u201claughing out loud.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b182-9\"> Clough was using the screen name \u201cDaSpunkyboy\u201d for this conversation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b182-10\"> Clough found pictures that he believed were child pornography on defendant\u2019s computer. These pictures were apparently either found in the \u201crecycle bin\u201d or were deleted flies that were retrieved using specialized software. This was the basis for the possession of child pornography count of which defendant was acquitted. No other sexually explicit items relating to children were found in defendant\u2019s home.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b183-9\"> On the other hand, the court ruled that all of the prior convictions would be admissible to impeach defendant if he testified. Defendant did not testify at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b183-10\"> No further details of the sexual contact were described except that D.C. had not touched defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b183-11\"> Actually, defendant had never served a prison term. He had twice served jail terms as a condition of probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b185-7\"> At the instruction conference, the court stated, \u201cI did include your other one in a modified form we all agreed to.\u201d Defendant\u2019s trial counsel then interjected, \u201cFor the record, I would object it\u2019s not being included.\u201d The court said, \u201cAre you talking about number 2? I was about to move on to that. I w\u00e1s going to state where I did include that in the report.\u201d Defendant\u2019s trial counsel responded, \u201cYou did.\u201d The court then said, \u201c[i]n a form somewhat modified everyone agreed to.\u201d Defendant\u2019s trial counsel began to respond, \u201cYes, Your Honor. Form number 2 encompasses\u2014\u201d but the court cut him off. There was no further discussion of the instruction on the definition of \u201cseduce.\u201d The reference to \u201cflorin number 2\u201d was to the defense-requested instruction on the seduction element that was <em>not </em>given.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b193-8\"> A prosecution for a misdemeanor offense \u201cshall be commenced within one year after commission of the offense.\u201d (Pen.

Only two of the nine counts of which defendant was convicted occurred prior to February 8, 1999.
