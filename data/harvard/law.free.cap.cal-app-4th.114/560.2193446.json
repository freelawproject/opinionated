Code, \u00a7\u00a7 211, 212.5)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and two counts of impersonating a public officer (\u00a7 146a, subd. (b)).

Defendant was sentenced to an aggregate prison term of seven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">On appeal, defendant contends there was insufficient evidence to support his two convictions of impersonating a public officer and one of his robbery convictions. Defendant also contends the trial court gave erroneous instructions as to the offense of impersonating a public officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">We will affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AzY\">A. <em>Counts 1 and 3</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">Shortly after midnight on February 16, 1997, Melvin Oldeen and his wife were driving home from seeing a movie. He noticed a pickup truck on the side of the road. The truck had hit a light pole and the driver was attempting to dislodge it. Oldeen parked his car and approached the pickup truck, intending to render assistance. He recommended that the driver get out of the vehicle. Meanwhile, Oldeen\u2019s wife went to a nearby house to call 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">A few minutes later, a light blue van drove upon the scene. Two men got out of the van: defendant (the driver) and a second person (the passenger). Both men approached, and one of them said, \u201cMay we see some ID, sir.\u201d Oldeen initially testified that defendant spoke these words, but he later changed his mind and stated, \u201cIt was the passenger.\u201d Oldeen \u201cwas astounded\u201d at how politely the man asked for identification, and he \u201cassumed\u201d the two men were off-duty police officers. The man asked for identification three times before the pickup truck driver complied. While waiting for compliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>with the request, defendant spoke to his passenger, saying \u201csomething to the effect\u201d of \u201cGet ready, man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">When the pickup truck driver took out his wallet to get his identification, the passenger grabbed the wallet. The passenger struck the pickup driver, sending him to the ground. The passenger also struck Oldeen.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">At some point, police arrived. Oldeen described the perpetrators. A few days later, Oldeen viewed a photographic lineup. He selected defendant\u2019s photograph. Oldeen also identified defendant at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">B. <em>Counts 2 and 4</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">About 10:00 p.m. on February 24, 1997, Sandeep Kalkat was attempting to tow his car, which had broken down. His friend Gagan Singh was helping him. They were performing the towing operation at night because they believed it was not legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">A black Nissan sports car approached and two men got out: defendant and a second person. The men claimed to be \u201cundercover cop[s]\u201d and told Kalkat that what he was doing was illegal. Kalkat was \u201cscared\u201d at the time. He believed the men were police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">Defendant patsearched Kalkat and told him, \u201cLet me see your ID.\u201d Defendant also asked for Kalkat\u2019s wallet. Kalkat complied. Defendant looked through the wallet and then gave it back. When defendant asked for the wallet, Kalkat began to suspect that defendant was not a police officer. Kalkat thought about asking defendant for a badge, but opted not to because he was \u201cscared\u201d that defendant could physically harm him; he also feared defendant could have a gun. After defendant and the other man left, Kalkat checked his wallet and discovered two credit cards were missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">Meanwhile, the second man spoke with Singh, asking to see his identification and wallet. Singh gave the man his wallet. Singh suspected that the two men were not police officers, but he was afraid of them \u201cbecause of their size\u201d and because he feared they might be armed. The man took Singh\u2019s wallet back to the sports car, but later returned it.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">Kalkat and Singh described the men to the police. Singh told the police the license plate number of the black Nissan. The registered owner was Alfredo Gonzales\u2014defendant\u2019s father, who allowed defendant to drive his car. On the night of the incident, the police located the black Nissan at the residence of Alicia Gonzales\u2014defendant\u2019s sister, who allowed defendant to stay with her sometimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>The police subsequently showed Kalkat a photographic lineup. Kalkat selected defendant\u2019s photograph. Kalkat also identified defendant at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">C. <em>Charges and Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Defendant was charged, by amended information, with two counts of second degree robbery (counts 1 &amp; 2; \u00a7\u00a7 211, 212.5) and two counts of impersonating a public officer (counts 3 &amp; 4; \u00a7 146a, subd. (b)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The information alleged that defendant had served three prior prison terms (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">At trial, the defense called Dr. Robert Shomer, a forensic psychologist, as an expert in \u201cthe psychological factors that can affect perception, memory, and eyewitness identification.\u201d Dr. Shomer testified the accuracy of an eyewitness identification would be affected by: a highly emotional situation, a situation in which the witness was not forewarned about the need to recall a person\u2019s features, a cross-racial identification, lighting, distance, and duration of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Defendant testified at trial. He asserted that in February of 1997, he was living in Seattle, Washington. He admitted having five prior felony convictions, including two 1985 convictions of second degree burglary, 1987 and 1989 convictions of petty theft, and a 1990 conviction of \u201chit and run.\u201d Defendant did not find out that the police were looking for him until about eight months prior to trial, which was held in July of 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">The jury found defendant guilty of all four counts. In a bifurcated proceeding, the jury found true all three prior prison term allegations. Defendant was sentenced to an aggregate prison term of seven years: the three-year middle term for count 1, a consecutive one-year term for count 2, and three consecutive one-year terms for each of the prior prison term allegations. The terms for counts 3 and 4 were stayed pursuant to section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AUO\">A. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">Defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his two convictions of impersonating a public officer (counts 3 &amp; 4) and one of his robbery convictions (count 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>In determining whether the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction, we apply the standard established in <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 307, 318-319 [61 L.Ed.2d 560, 99 S.Ct. 2781], and <em>People v. Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 578 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738]. \u201c[T]he relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Jackson v. Virginia, supra, </em>443 U.S. at p. 319.) Under this standard, \u201can appellate court in a criminal case . . . does not ask itself whether it believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Woodby v. Immigration Service </em>(1966) 385 U.S. 276, 282 [17 L.Ed.2d 362, 87 S.Ct. 483].) Rather, we \u201cdetermine whether [the record] discloses substantial evidence\u2014that is, evidence which is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\u2014such that a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d at p. 578.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">1. State Public Officer</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Defendant contends there is insufficient evidence that he impersonated a <em>state </em>public officer. The People contend that they were not required to prove that defendant impersonated a <em>state </em>public officer in order to obtain a conviction under section 146a, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Section 146a, subdivision (b) provides: \u201cAny person who falsely represents himself or herself to be <em>a public officer, investigator, or inspector in any state department </em>and who, in that assumed character, does any of the following shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, by a fine not exceeding two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), or by both that fine and imprisonment, or by imprisonment in the state prison: [][] (1) Arrests, detains, or threatens to arrest or detain any person, [f] (2) Otherwise intimidates any person. [][] (3) Searches any person, building, or other property of any person, [f] (4) Obtains money, property, or other thing of value.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Defendant claims that the phrase \u201c in any state department\u201d modifies each of the three preceding terms in section 146a, subdivision (b): \u201cpublic officer, investigator, or inspector.\u201d The People claim that the phrase \u201cin any state department\u201d only modifies the last term, \u201cinspector.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">In construing section 146a, we apply settled rules of statutory construction. \u201c \u2018The goal of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. [Citation.] Ordinarily, the words of the statute provide the most reliable indication of legislative intent. [Citation.] When the statutory language is ambiguous, the court may examine the context in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>language appears, adopting the construction that best harmonizes the statute internally and with related statutes. [Citations.]\u2019 \u2018 \u201cWhen the language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation . . . , we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jefferson </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 86, 94 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 893, 980 P.2d 441].)</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Both defendant and the People assert that the plain language of the statute supports their respective positions. On its face, section 146a, subdivision (b) is susceptible of either interpretation. The phrase \u201cin any state department\u201d could be read as modifying each of the three preceding words (\u201cpublic officer, investigator, or inspector\u201d), or it could be read as modifying only the last word (\u201cinspector\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Defendant contends his interpretation of section 146a, subdivision (b) would harmonize the statute internally, pointing out that subdivision (a) of section 146a prohibits a person from \u201cfalsely representing] himself or herself to be <em>a deputy or clerk in any state department. . . </em>.\u201d (Italics added.) Defendant argues that in subdivision (a), the phrase \u201cin any state department\u201d apparently modifies both of the preceding terms, \u201cdeputy\u201d and \u201cclerk.\u201d He contends that subdivision (b) should be interpreted similarly.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Defendant\u2019s construction of section 146a, subdivision (b) would conflict with the use of the term \u201cpublic officer\u201d in related statutes. For instance, section 148, subdivision (a) applies to \u201c[e]very person who willfully resists, delays, or obstructs any public officer, peace officer, or an emergency medical technician, ... in the discharge or attempt to discharge any duty of his or her office or employment.\u201d Section 145 states that it is a misdemeanor for \u201c[e]very public officer\u201d who has arrested someone to willfully delay taking that person before a magistrate. Section 146 provides that it is a misdemeanor for \u201c[e]very public officer\u201d to arrest a person or seize property without \u201ca regular process or other lawful authority.\u201d Section 149 applies to \u201c[e]very public officer who, under color of authority, without lawful necessity, assaults or beats any person.\u201d In these related statutes, the term \u201cpublic officer\u201d is not modified by the phrase \u201cin a state department.\u201d Thus, to interpret section 146a, subdivision (b) to apply to <em>any </em>\u201cpublic officer\u201d would harmonize it with related statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Both defendant and the People refer to a \u201clongstanding rule of statutory construction\u2014the \u2018last antecedent rule,\u2019 \u201d which provides that \u201c \u2018qualifying words, phrases and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrases immediately preceding and are not to be construed as extending to or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>including others more remote.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(White </em>v. <em>County of Sacramento </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 676, 680 [183 Cal.Rptr. 520, 646 P.2d 191].) Under this rule, the phrase \u201cin any state department\u201d would not modify the term \u201cpublic officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">In <em>White, </em>the court applied this rule to Government Code section 3303, which defines \u201cpunitive action\u201d as \u201cany action which may lead to dismissal, demotion, suspension, reduction in salary, written reprimand, or transfer for purposes of punishment.\u201d The court concluded that the phrase \u201cfor purposes of punishment\u201d applied only to the term \u201ctransfer.\u201d <em>(White v. County of Sacramento, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at pp. 681-682.)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Defendant argues that we should apply an exception to the last antecedent rule: \u201cthat \u2018 \u201c[w]hen several words are followed by a clause which is applicable as much to the first and other words as to the last, the natural construction of the language demands that the clause be read as applicable to all.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(White v. County of Sacramento, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at pp. 680-681.) We disagree that the natural construction of the statutory language mandates the result defendant proposes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">We turn to the legislative history of section 146a. As originally enacted in 1929, section 146a provided: \u201cAny person who falsely represents himself to be a public officer and in such assumed character arrests or detains any person or searches the person, building, or other property of any person, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .\u201d (Stats. 1929, ch. 211, \u00a7 1, p. 377.) Thus, as originally enacted, section 146a applied to <em>any </em>\u201cpublic officer,\u201d not to a \u201cpublic officer ... in any state department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Two years later, in 1931, section 146a was amended to provide as follows: \u201cAny person who falsely represents himself to be a public officer, or investigator, inspector, deputy or clerk in any state department and in such assumed character arrests or detains or threatens to arrest or detain, or otherwise intimidates any person or searches the person, building, or other property of any person, or obtains money, or property, or other thing of value, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .\u201d (Stats. 1931, ch. 680, \u00a7 1, p. 1420.) By adding a comma after the term \u201cpublic officer\u201d and then adding the disjunctive phrase \u201cor investigator, inspector, deputy or clerk in any state department,\u201d the Legislature evinced an intent \u201cto designate alternative or separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>categories. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(White v. County of Sacramento, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 680.) In other words, the Legislature intended the phrase \u201cin any state department\u201d to modify the terms \u201cinvestigator, inspector, deputy or clerk,\u201d but <em>not </em>the term \u201cpublic officer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The Legislature\u2019s most recent amendment to section 146a was in 1993. At that time, it divided section 146a into two separate crimes. (Stats. 1993, ch. 823, \u00a7 1, pp. 4457-4458) The Legislature placed the offense of falsely impersonating a \u201cdeputy or clerk in any state department\u201d in subdivision (a), making that offense punishable as a misdemeanor only. The Legislature placed the offense of falsely impersonating a \u201cpublic officer, investigator, or inspector in any state department\u201d in subdivision (b), making that offense a \u201cwobbler\u201d punishable as either a misdemeanor or a felony. Nothing in the legislative history of the 1993 amendment indicates that the Legislature intended that, by this amendment, the statute would now apply only to impersonation of a <em>state </em>public officer. The legislative history indicates that the Legislature\u2019s intent was to \u201craise[] the penalty for impersonating a public officer.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Pub. Saf., Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1664 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.).) The Legislature was concerned about the \u201cnumerous cases where serious offenses have been perpetrated on the unsuspecting public by individuals impersonating a peace officer.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>To construe the amendment as <em>limiting </em>the term \u201cpublic officer\u201d to a \u201cpublic officer ... in any state department\u201d would defeat the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Thus, it appears that the Legislature committed a drafting oversight when it amended section 146a in 1993, by failing to insert a comma and the word \u201cor\u201d after the term \u201cpublic officer.\u201d Because it is clear that the Legislature intended to preserve the former construction of the statute, we conclude that the term \u201cpublic officer\u201d as used in section 146a, subdivision (b) is not modified by the phrase \u201cof any state department.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, the prosecution was not required to prove that defendant falsely impersonated a <em>state </em>public officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">2. False Representation</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Defendant contends there was insufficient evidence to show that he falsely represented himself to be a public officer during the February 16, 1997 incident.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant claims that neither he nor his passenger did or said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>anything to indicate they were claiming to be public officers. Defendant contrasts the February 16 incident with the incident on February'24, when he explicitly told the victims that he was an undercover cop.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">On February 16, 1997, defendant and his passenger drove up in a van and approached the victim, who had just driven his pickup truck into a light pole. Either defendant or his passenger said, \u201cMay we see some ID, sir.\u201d Because of how politely the man asked for identification, a witness (Melvin Oldeen) \u201cassumed\u201d the two men were off-duty police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">This evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. Based on the circumstances reviewed above, the jury could find that defendant and his passenger behaved and spoke to the victim in a manner intended to falsely convey the impression that they were undercover officers. Moreover, the jury was entitled to consider the fact that one week later, defendant committed a similar offense under similar circumstances. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 1101, subd. (b); <em>People v. Ewoldt </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 380, 393-394 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 646, 867 P.2d 757].)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">3. Robbery</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Defendant contends there was insufficient evidence to show that he committed robbery on February 24, 1997.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specifically, defendant claims he did not take personal property by \u201cforce or fear.\u201d (\u00a7 211; see \u00a7 212 [fear must be of \u201cunlawful injury\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">On February 24, 1997, defendant and another man approached Kalkat and Singh, who were towing a vehicle late at night. Defendant and his cohort claimed to be \u201cundercover cop[s]\u201d and told Kalkat that what he was doing was illegal. Kalkat was \u201cscared\u201d at the time. Defendant patsearched Kalkat and asked for his ID and wallet. Kalkat began to suspect that defendant was not a police officer and considered asking defendant for a badge, but opted not to because he was \u201cscared\u201d that defendant could physically harm him; he also feared defendant could have a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">As the prosecution argued at trial, the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that defendant took Kalkat\u2019s property by means of fear of unlawful injury. Kalkat specifically testified that defendant\u2019s actions and words placed him in fear of physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>B. <em>Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cThe defendant is accused in Counts 3 and 4 of having committed the crime of impersonating an officer, violation of [section] 146[a, subdivision (b)] of the Penal Code. [\u00b6] Every person who falsely represents himself to be a public officer and who in that assumed character does any of the following, is guilty of a felony: Arrests, detains, or threatens to arrest or detain any person, or otherwise intimidates any person or obtains money, property, or other thing of value. [][] In order to prove this crime, each of the following elements must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt: Number one, a person falsely represented himself as a public officer with the specific intent of inducing another person to believe that he was a public officer; number two, in that assumed character, the person did any of the following: Arrested, detained, or threatened to arrest or detain a person, or otherwise intimidated any person, or obtained money, property, or any other thing of value with the specific intent of permanently depriving any person of his property permanently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The trial court also provided the following instruction: \u201cThe term peace officer or public officer includes any chief of police employed in that capacity of a city, or any police officer employed in that capacity and appointed by the chief of police or the chief executive of the agency or of the city.\u201d (CALJIC No. 1.26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Defendant contends these instructions were erroneous because the prosecution was required to prove that he falsely impersonated a \u201cpublic officer ... in any state department.\u201d (\u00a7 146a, subd. (b).) However, as we have explained, the phrase \u201cin any state department\u201d does not modify the term \u201cpublic officer.\u201d There was no instructional error in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">III. DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">Wunderlich, 1, and Mihara, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied March 17, 2004.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-14\"> Unspecified section references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b513-12\"> Counts 1 and 3 pertained to the incident on February 16,1997.
