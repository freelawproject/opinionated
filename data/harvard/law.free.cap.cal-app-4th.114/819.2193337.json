Based upon the legislative intent behind section 1950.8, we hold it is not unlawful for a landlord to merely make a demand for \u201ckey money.\u201d Rather, in order for liability to attach under the statute, a plaintiff must allege that the landlord (1) made a demand for \u201ckey money\u201d as a condition of initiating, continuing or renewing a lease or rental agreement, and (2) failed to state the amount of the demanded payment in the resulting written lease or rental agreement between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">Yeng Pil Ji and Kyong Ji own Edamerica, Inc., through which they operate a Korean restaurant in Los Angeles. The Jis operate their restaurant on commercial property under a 1995 written lease with Kwang Jin Jung and Min Ja Jung, the owners of the property. In their second amended complaint against the Jungs and the Jungs\u2019 agent, the Jis alleged that on several occasions between December 2001 and March 2002, they asked the Jungs to issue a new lease or extend the existing lease to allow them to sell their business. Each time, the Jungs responded they would not grant a new lease or extend the existing lease unless the Jis first paid $1 million. The Jungs allegedly were aware the Jis had invested over $300,000 in tenant improvements and would be unable to sell their business without a renewed or extended lease because of the limited term remaining on the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>The Jis further alleged that in March 2002, they received an offer to purchase their business, but the offer was contingent upon the new buyer receiving an assignment of a new lease or an extension of the existing lease. The Jungs allegedly refused to issue a new lease or extension unless they were paid $980,000. The Jis alleged each of the Jungs\u2019 demands for \u201ckey money\u201d was unlawful under section 1950.8, and they lost the offer to purchase their business, and sustained other losses, as a result of the Jungs\u2019 violation of this statute. They sought a civil penalty of $3.3 million, representing three times the amount they would have received from their buyer had they received an extended or renewed lease without a \u201ckey money\u201d demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The Jungs demurred, arguing that section 1950.8 is violated only when a demand for \u201ckey money\u201d is not memorialized in the negotiated lease. In other words, the phrase \u201cunless the amount of payment is stated in the written lease or rental agreement\u201d refers to a future lease the parties have yet to enter into. Because they never entered into the new lease or agreement the Jis desired, the Jungs asserted that they could not be held liable solely for making a demand for \u201ckey money.\u201d In contrast, the Jis argued a demand for \u201ckey money\u201d was sufficient to violate the statute if the amount of the payment was not stated in the existing lease, or in a future lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend. The court agreed with the Jungs because \u201cthere is no liability under Civil Code Section 1950.8 when a landlord merely demands in advance of a lease renewal an increase in the amount of rent or a lump sum payment. What is prohibited by the statute is [] the failure to include any such payment in the new written lease. Because no new lease was entered into, no violation could occur as a result of the demand.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">The Jis challenged the ruling by filing a petition for a writ of mandate in this court. Generally, writ review is not employed for rulings on pleadings. (See <em>Babb v. Superior Court </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 841, 850 [92 Cal.Rptr. 179, 479 P.2d 379].) Nonetheless, we issued an alternative writ because section 1950.8 is a newly enacted statute that has not yet been interpreted or applied by any appellate court. (See ibid.; <em>Omaha Indemnity Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 1266, 1269-1270 [258 Cal.Rptr. 66].)</p>\n<p id=\"b772-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">1. <em>Standard of Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">When a demurrer is sustained without leave to amend, we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and whether there is a reasonable possibility any defect can be cured by amendment. <em>(Blank </em>v. <em>Kirwan </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 [216 Cal.Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58].)</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">We interpret the challenged statute de novo as a matter of law. <em>(California Teachers Assn. v. San Diego Community College Dist. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 692, 699 [170 Cal.Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856].) \u201cOur fundamental task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute. [Citation.] We begin by examining the statutory language, giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning. [Citation.] If there is no ambiguity, then we presume the lawmakers meant what they said, and the plain meaning of the language governs. [Citations.] If, however, the statutory terms are ambiguous, then we may resort to extrinsic sources, including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history. [Citation.] In such circumstances, we \u2018 \u201cselect the construction that comports, most closely with the apparent intent of the Legislature, with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute, and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Day v. City of Fontana </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 268, 272 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 457, 19 P.3d 1196].)</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">2. <em>Statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">Section 1950.8, which became law in January 2002, expressly applies \u201conly to commercial leases and nonresidential tenancies of real property.\u201d (\u00a7 1950.8, subd. (a).) Subdivision (b) provides, \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to require, demand, or cause to make payable any payment of money, including, but not limited to, \u2018key money,\u2019 however denominated, or the lessor\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees reasonably incurred in preparing the lease or rental agreement, as a condition of initiating, continuing, or renewing a lease or rental agreement, unless the amount of payment is stated in the written lease or rental agreement.\u201d According to subdivision (b), \u201ckey money\u201d includes any amount of money a landlord demands or requires in order to initiate, continue, or renew a lease, including money denominated as \u201crent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">A violation of this subdivision subjects a person to a \u201ccivil penalty of three times the amount of actual damages proximately suffered by the person seeking to obtain the lease or rental of real property,\u201d as well as an award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>costs, including reason ableattomey\u2019s fees, incurred in connection with obtaining the civil penalty. (\u00a7 1950.8, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The statute does not \u201cprohibit the advance payment of rent, if the amount and character of the payment are clearly stated in a written lease or rental agreement.\u201d (\u00a7 1950.8, subd. (d).) The statute also does not \u201cprohibit any person from charging a reasonle amount for the purpose of conducting reasonable business activity in connection with initiating, continuing, or renewing a lease or rental agreement for nonresidential real property, including, but not limited to, verifying creditworthiness or qualifications of any person seeking to initiate, continue, or renew a lease or rental agreement for any use other than residential use, or cleaning fees, reasonably incurred in connection with the hiring of the real property.\u201d (\u00a7 1950.8, subd. (e).) Additionally, the statute does not \u201cprohibit a person from increasing a tenant\u2019s rent for nonresidential real property in order to recover building operating costs incurred on behalf of the tenant, if the right to the rent, the method of calculating the increase, and the period of time covered by the increase is stated in the lease or rental agreement.\u201d (\u00a7 1950.8, subd. (f).)</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">3. <em>Section 1950.8 Requires Statement of Key Money Demands in Prospective Lease.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The words of section 1950.8, subdivision (b), which are far from clear, indicate a landlord is subject to liability if that person demands, requires, or causes to make payable a \u201ckey money\u201d payment as a condition of initiating, continuing, or renewing a lease or rental agreement. But the statute then provides that the landlord is not liable if \u201cthe amount of payment is stated in the written lease or rental agreement.\u201d Thus, no violation of section 1950.8 occurs where a prospective or existing tenant agrees to pay the demanded \u201ckey money\u201d and the amount of the payment is stated in the parties\u2019 new lease or agreement. Whether the lease or agreement initiates a new lease or renews or extends an existing one, no liability results if \u201cthe amount of payment is stated in the written lease or rental agreement.\u201d Under this scenario, the parties\u2019 new lease or agreement would become \u201cthe written lease or rental agreement\u201d described in the last portion of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">But what if, as in this case, the tenant rejects the landlord\u2019s demand, the parties fail to prepare and execute the desired lease or agreement, and no payment is made? Does the landlord become liable simply because he or she demanded \u201ckey money\u201d as part of the parties\u2019 negotiation of the desired lease? Furthermore, what if, as in this case, the parties have an existing lease that does not state the amount of any \u201ckey money\u201d payment? Does the landlord become liable if, at some point before the end of the lease term, he or she requires a \u201ckey money\u201d money payment as a condition of a renewed lease?</p>\n<p id=\"b774-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>This inquiry focuses on the meaning of the words \u201cunless the amount of the payment is stated in the written lease or rental agreement.\u201d As they did before the trial court, the Jungs contend the words refer to \u201cthe written lease or rental agreement\u201d that results from the parties\u2019 negotiation for a new, continued, or renewed lease or agreement. If the parties are unable to agree and no new agreement and payment results, no liability can attach for simply mating the demand for \u201ckey money.\u201d In short, the Jungs argue that the prohibition is the failure to include the amount of the payment in the new lease or agreement. Essentially, this was the trial court\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">In contrast, the Jis argue that \u201cthe written lease or agreement\u201d refers to an existing or future lease. They contend that if a landlord demands \u201ckey money\u201d in order to continue or renew an existing lease that omits the amount of the \u201ckey money\u201d payment, as with their lease, the landlord is liable for making the demand even if there is no new agreement continuing or renewing the lease and no \u201ckey money\u201d is paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Because section 1950.8 allows a demand for payment of \u201ckey money\u201d as long as \u201cthe amount of payment is stated in the written lease or rental agreement,\u201d the Legislature apparently did not intend to discourage the practice of demanding or collecting \u201ckey money\u201d as a condition of a new or renewed lease. Indeed, based upon the statutory language, any other conclusion would lead to absurd consequences, which are to be avoided. <em>(Day v. City of Fontana, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 272.) For example, assume a landlord negotiates with two prospective tenants who desire the same property and the landlord makes \u201ckey money\u201d demands on both. The tenant who secures the lease that includes a provision memorializing the payment of the \u201c key money\u201d would have no claim against the landlord because the demand is \u201cstated in the written lease\u201d and, hence, complies with the statute. In contrast, the unsuccessful prospective tenant would be able to assert a claim against the landlord simply because he or she rejected the demand. We do not believe the Legislature intended such an anomalous result. We must conclude, therefore, the statute was not meant simply to prohibit the practice of demanding or collecting \u201ckey money.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The Jis argue the Jungs were not allowed to demand \u201ckey money\u201d because \u201ckey money\u201d was not mentioned in their existing lease. We disagree. Because the landlord may lawfully demand and collect \u201ckey money,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>the object of the statute must be to prohibit landlords from failing to state the amount of the payment \u201cin the written lease or rental agreement\u201d that is the product of the demand. We believe \u201cthe written lease or rental agreement\u201d in the last portion of section 1950.8, subdivision (b) refers back to the \u201clease or rental agreement\u201d concerning which the landlord demands \u201ckey money\u201d \u201cas condition of initiating, continuing, or renewing.\u201d In other words, \u201cthe written lease or rental agreement\u201d refers to the lease or agreement for the new period to which the demand applies. Therefore, once a demand for \u201ckey money\u201d is made, the landlord becomes obligated to include the amount of the payment in the desired future agreement, whether that agreement initiates a new tenancy or renews an existing one.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Nonetheless, because the ultimate purpose of section 1950.8 is unclear, we must test our interpretation against its legislative history. (See <em>Lundquist </em>v. <em>Reusser </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1193, 1205 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 776, 875 P.2d 1279] [courts may turn to legislative history when the words of the statute do not provide a ready answer of the Legislature\u2019s intent]; <em>Day </em>v. <em>City of Fontana, supra, </em>25 Cal.4th at p. 274 [a court may, out of an undance of caution, test its statutory interpretation against its legislative history].)</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">4. <em>Legislative History.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">According to an August 21, 2001 Senate Judiciary Committee report, Assembly Bill No. 533 was intended to \u201cprohibit landlords of commercial property from charging or collecting any \u2018keying fee\u2019 or other fee unless that fee amount is \u2018ascertainable\u2019 in the commercial lease agreement. . . . [f] This bill is intended to address the problem of some landlords in the tight Los Angeles commercial or industrial lease market demanding, mostly under-the-table, a \u2018keying fee\u2019 as a condition of beginning or renewing a commercial lease. This bill would not prohibit the practice, but would only allow its collection if its charge is \u2018ascertainable\u2019 in the lease agreement.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, com. on Assem. Bill No. 533 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 25, 2001, p. 1.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">The report further states, \u201cThe author [of the bill] states that \u2018key money\u2019 is a practice used by unscrupulous landlords who verbally demand tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars, usually in cash, as a condition of initiating or renewing a commercial lease. The practice is practically prevalent in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>downtown Los Angeles fashion district, where it has been an underground practice for over 30 years. [][]. . . The fierce competition for space in the fashion district has resulted in garment wholesalers having to pay for soaring rental rates, in addition to costs, such as \u2018keying fees,\u2019 not formally included on a standard lease form. . . . [][] Partially because of the lack of legal sophistication, and partially because of the lack of options in a take-it or leave-it situation, prospective and current tenants in the fashion district do not challenge the underground practice of paying key money in cash. Proponents assert that Assembly Bill No. 533 will put an end to the extortion and intimidation, and provide better consumer protection against this predatory behavior. However, it should be noted that Assembly Bill No. 533 would not bar the practice of demanding and collecting \u2018key money,\u2019 but would condition the validity of its collection on the fee being \u2018ascertainable\u2019 from the terms of the lease agreement.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, com. on Assem. Bill No. 533, supra, at pp. 2-3.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">The legislative history indicates the intended purpose of section 1950.8 was not to eliminate demands or collection of \u201ckey money.\u201d Rather, the purpose was to eliminate the prevalent \u201cunderground\u201d or \u201cunder-the-table\u201d pressure tactic used by some landlords of requiring cash payments of \u201ckey money\u201d that are not reflected in the formal written lease. In short, the aim of the statute appears to be the prospective documentation of the demanded \u201ckey money\u201d payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The legislative history confirms our view that \u201cthe written lease or rental agreement\u201d refers to the lease or agreement for the new period to which the demand applies. If the demand for \u201ckey money\u201d is made \u201cas a condition of initiating ... a lease or rental agreement,\u201d the new written lease or agreement must state the amount of the payment. Likewise, if the demand for \u201ckey money\u201d is made \u201cas a condition of. . . renewing a lease or rental agreement,\u201d the renewed written lease or agreement must state the amount of the payment. Failure to state the amount of the payment in the new lease or agreement subjects the landlord to liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">5. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Based upon our construction of section 1950.8 and its legislative history, we conclude that in order to state a cause of action under section 1950.8, subdivision (b), a plaintiff must allege that the landlord (1) made a demand on the plaintiff for \u201ckey money\u201d as a condition of initiating, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>continuing or renewing a lease or rental agreement, and (2) failed to state the amount of the demanded payment in the resulting written lease or rental agreement between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">In their second amended complaint, the Jis alleged the Jungs demanded \u201ckey money\u201d as condition of renewing or extending their current long-term lease. However, they did not allege a failure to state the amount of the demanded payment in the resulting written lease or rental agreement between the parties. Indeed, they affirmatively alleged they lost the opportunity to sell their business because the Jungs would not renew or extend the lease without a payment of \u201ckey money.\u201d Because the Jis did not and cannot allege the Jungs failed to state the amount of the demanded payment in a new written lease or agreement, we conclude the trial court did not err in sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">The petition is denied. The Jungs are to recover their costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Cooper, P. J., and Rubin, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">Petitioners\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied March 24, 2004.
