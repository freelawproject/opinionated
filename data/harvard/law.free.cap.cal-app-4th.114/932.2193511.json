We hold that neither payment may offset the defendant\u2019s restitution obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">Respondent Eric Duane Hamilton (Hamilton) shot and seriously injured Donald Hill (Hill) while Hill performed work for Hamilton and Hamilton\u2019s mother, Lena Hamilton (Ms. Hamilton). Pursuant to a plea agreement, Hamilton pleaded no contest to assault with a firearm in violation of section 245, subdivision (a)(2). On November 4, 1996, the trial court sentenced Hamilton to eight years in prison, but suspended the sentence and placed him on probation for five years. The trial court imposed as a condition of Hamilton\u2019s probation the payment of $15,000 in victim restitution. The trial court revoked and reinstated Hamilton\u2019s probation on numerous occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">Sometime in early 1998, Hill sued Hamilton and Ms. Hamilton in a civil action for Hill\u2019s injuries. Ms. Hamilton\u2019s insurer paid Hill between $25,000 and $30,000<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to settle the claim on her behalf and obtained Hill\u2019s release of claims and dismissal with prejudice of the lawsuit against Ms. Hamilton and Hamilton. Hill died sometime after the settlement. Hamilton has made no restitution payments to Hill or to Hill\u2019s successor, his mother, Tina Wright (Ms. Wright).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">In March 2003, the People sought to revoke Hamilton\u2019s probation for failure to pay his victim restitution obligation. At the April 10, 2003 probation revocation hearing, Ms. Wright testified concerning the cost of Hill\u2019s medical care and the settlement with Ms. Hamilton\u2019s insurer. Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>Wright said that although her health insurance<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the settlement with Ms. Hamilton\u2019s insurer covered some of Hill\u2019s medical expenses, Ms. Wright incurred expenses that were not reimbursed. Ms. Wright also testified that she could not reconstruct her expenses with certainty because she had lost much of the necessary documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">The trial court\u2019s inquiry at the April 10, 2003 hearing focused on Ms. Wright\u2019s \u201cout of pocket\u201d expenses that had not been reimbursed either by her insurance or by the civil action settlement proceeds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: . . . My query to you, though, is in actual out of pocket expenses, what were the actual costs for bills and everything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-6\">\u201cMRS. WRIGHT: I had my bills, I lost them on the elevator, and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Just tell me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-8\">\u201cMRS. WRIGHT: Well, the insurance from the hospital and then from the cardiologies <em>(sic) </em>and from the psychiatrists, and other expense, and the lawyer expense, ran way over what the insurance paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: I know, but your\u2014are you talking about the deductibles? Because you know if you have health insurance or hospitalization, the insurance will pay and then there is usually a percentage that is not covered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-10\">\u201cMRS. WRIGHT: The insurance paid some of it and then I had to pay a lot of it myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: So I just want to know what was the total loss, money that you had to put out of your pocket?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b874-12\">The trial court then asked Ms. Wright to provide an accounting of her \u201cout of pocket\u201d expenses but noted that it appeared Hamilton\u2019s restitution obligation had been satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b874-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: This is what I would like you to do. If you can reconstruct your bills and give us a total of everything that you had to pay out of your pocket and then subtract that from the $30,000 that you received, minus attorney fees, minus your deductibles on the insurance, and then please forward that to this counsel and to the prosecutor. And if it looks like it\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>grossly out of whack here, the court\u2014this gentleman is still on probation, and we\u2019ll bring everybody back in and have a further conversation. [][] But right now, it appears to the court that there\u2019s been a restitution. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">The trial court concluded by advising Ms. Wright that if she did not provide an accounting of her \u201cout of pocket\u201d expenses, the court would consider Hamilton\u2019s restitution obligation satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right, thank you very much for coming in, and if you can reconstruct your bills, if they do go over 15,000 out of pocket expenses, ma\u2019am, please give a copy of your breakdown and forward it to counsel Hedding and to the People.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-7\">\u201cMRS. WRIGHT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right, and if we don\u2019t\u2014if counsel Hedding and the People don\u2019t hear from you, within the next two weeks, then we will assume that, you know, it\u2019s over and done with, all right? Okay, thank you ma\u2019am.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">After the foregoing exchange, the trial court reinstated Hamilton\u2019s probation, under the same terms and conditions existing before the April 10, 2003 hearing date. The trial court\u2019s minute order issued after the hearing states \u201cprobation reinstated on original terms and conditions.\u201d There is no indication in the record that Ms. Wright provided any further information to the court. The People appeal from the trial court\u2019s oral ruling concerning Hamilton\u2019s restitution obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">The People contend the trial court erred in offsetting any payments made by Ms. Wright\u2019s and Ms. Hamilton\u2019s insurers against Hamilton\u2019s restitution obligation. The People argue in the alternative that the amount of any permissible offset should have been limited to payments made by Ms. Hamilton\u2019s insurer to compensate Hill for losses expressly covered by former section 1202.4. Because these issues involve questions of statutory interpretation, we review them de novo. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Saephanh </em>(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 451, 457 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 910].)</p>\n<p id=\"b875-12\">A. <em>Appealability of the Trial Court\u2019s Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">The People contend that the trial court\u2019s oral ruling at the April 10, 2003 hearing offsetting Hamilton\u2019s victim restitution obligation against payments made by Ms. Hamilton\u2019s insurer and by Ms. Wright\u2019s insurer is appealable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>under subdivision (a)(5) and (a)(10) of section 1238. Hamilton maintains that the trial court\u2019s oral ruling is not an appealable \u201corder\u201d within the meaning of section 1238.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Section 1238 delineates the People\u2019s right to appeal in criminal cases. <em>(People v. Douglas </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 85 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 816, 972 P.2d 151].) Section 1238, subdivision (a)(5) accords the People the right to appeal from \u201can order made after judgment, affecting the substantial rights of the people.\u201d Section 1238, subdivision (a)(10) authorizes an appeal from \u201c[t]he imposition of an unlawful sentence\u201d and defines an \u201cunlawful sentence\u201d as \u201cthe imposition of a sentence not authorized by law or the imposition of a sentence based upon an unlawful order of the court which strikes or otherwise modifies the effect of an enhancement or prior conviction.\u201d (\u00a7 1238, subd. (a)(10).)</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The trial court\u2019s oral ruling at the April 10, 2003 hearing concerning Hamilton\u2019s victim restitution obligation is appealable under section 1238, subdivision (a)(5). The April 10, 2003 ruling was made after the imposition of sentence on November 4, 1996. Because the ruling effectively reduced Hamilton\u2019s restitution obligation, it affects a substantial right of the People. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Douglas, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at pp. 90-92 [order reducing felony count to misdemeanor after court suspended imposition of judgment and granted defendant probation appealable under \u00a7 1238, subd. (a)(5)]; <em>People v. Minjarez </em>(1980) 102 Cal.App.3d 309, 312 [162 Cal.Rptr. 292] [order granting defendant credit for 760 days spent in custody following court\u2019s imposition of judgment and sentence appealable under \u00a7 1238, subd. (a)(5)].) The People have a substantial interest in ensuring the enforcement of victim restitution obligations, mandated both by the California Constitution and by statute. An oral ruling in a criminal case, such as the one made here, may be appealed. <em>(Minjarez, </em>at p. 312 [trial court\u2019s oral ruling reducing defendant\u2019s sentence by crediting time in custody appealable].)</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Hamilton contends that the trial court\u2019s statements regarding victim restitution were equivocal and did not constitute a final order. Although the trial court did leave open the possibility for Ms. Wright to present a future accounting of her \u201cout of pocket\u201d expenses and offered to \u201cbring everyone back in and have a further conversation\u201d at that time, the court made clear that the focus of any future proceedings regarding restitution would be Ms. Wright\u2019s \u201cout of pocket\u201d expenses, i.e., those unreimbursed by her insurance or by the settlement with Ms. Hamilton. We conclude the trial court\u2019s oral ruling was sufficiently explicit to serve as the basis for an appeal. Because we hold that the trial court\u2019s ruling is appealable under section 1238, subdivision (a)(5), we need not address its appealability under section 1238, subdivision (a)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>B. <em>Victim Restitution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">The California Constitution and the Penal Code mandate Hamilton\u2019s victim restitution obligations. Article I, section 28, subdivision (b) of the California Constitution directs the legislature to adopt laws implementing the \u201cright\u201d of \u201call persons who suffer losses as a result of criminal activity\u201d to receive \u201crestitution from the persons convicted of the crimes,\u201d and ensuring that \u201crestitution shall be ordered\u201d from convicted criminals in every case in which a crime victim suffers a loss \u201cunless compelling and extraordinary reasons exist to the contrary.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (b).) The Legislature adopted implementing legislation and has amended it several times thereafter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Former section 1202.4 governs Hamilton\u2019s restitution obligation in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That provision stated: \u201c(f) In every case in which a victim has suffered economic loss as result of the defendant\u2019s conduct, the court shall require that the defendant make restitution to the victim or victims. Restitution payments made pursuant to this subdivision shall be made to the Restitution Fund to the extent that person has received assistance pursuant to Article 1 (commencing with Section 13959) of Chapter 5 of Part 4 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, [\u00b6] (g) Restitution ordered pursuant to subdivision (f) shall be imposed in the amount of the losses, as determined. The court shall order full restitution unless it finds clear and compelling reasons for not doing so, and states them on the record. <em>Determination of the amount of restitution ordered pursuant to this section shall not be affected by the indemnification or subrogation rights of third parties. Restitution shall, to the extent possible, be of a dollar amount that is sufficient to fully reimburse the victim or victims, for every determined economic loss incurred as the result of the defendant\u2019 criminal conduct. . . </em>.\u201d (Stats. 1995, ch. 313, \u00a7 5, italics added.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The statute defined \u201cvictim\u201d to include the immediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>surviving family of the actual victim, in this case, Ms. Wright<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Former \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (k).) The statute also provided that \u201ceconomic loss\u201d included the value of stolen or damaged property, medical expenses and lost wages or profits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Former \u00a7 1202.4, subd. (f)(1)-(4).)</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">1. <em>Payments Made by Ms. Wright\u2019s Insurance Carrier</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">The trial court\u2019s references to excluding \u201cdeductibles\u201d from Ms. Wright\u2019s damages indicates that it took into account payments made by Ms. Wright\u2019s insurer for Hill\u2019s medical payments. The trial court erred in offsetting against Hamilton\u2019s restitution obligation payments or reimbursements made by Ms. Wright\u2019s insurer for Hill\u2019s medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">In <em>People v. Hove </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 1266, 1272 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 128] <em>(Hove), </em>the court upheld the trial court\u2019s order requiring the defendant to pay full restitution for the victim\u2019s medical bills, even though Medicare and Medical paid all of the victim\u2019s medical expenses. The court said, \u201c[T]he fortuity that the victim here was over age 65, and thus covered by Medicare, should not shield the defendant from a restitution order which requires him to pay the full amount of the losses caused by his crime.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1272.) The court relied on the reasoning of the California Supreme Court in <em>Birkett, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">In <em>Birkett, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th 226, the Supreme Court considered the impact that reimbursement of losses by a victim\u2019s own insurance carrier may have on a defendant\u2019s restitution obligation under former section 1203.04. After an extensive review of the legislative history behind both the constitutional and statutory mandates for victim restitution <em>(Birkett, </em>at pp. 230-245), the court held that restitution awards cannot be split between the victim and the insurer that had partially reimbursed the victim. The court reasoned as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>follows: \u201c[T]he Legislature intended to require a probationary offender,[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] for rehabilitative and deterrent purposes, to make full restitution for all \u2018losses\u2019 his crime had caused, and that such reparation should go entirely to the individual or entity the offender had directly wronged, regardless of that victim\u2019s reimbursement from other sources. Only the Restitution Fund was eligible to receive any part of the full restitutionary amount otherwise due to the immediate victim, [f] Thus, except as against the Restitution Fund, the immediate victim was entitled to receive from the probationer the full amount of the loss caused by the crime, regardless of whether, in the exercise of prudence, the victim had purchased private insurance that covered some or all of the same losses. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 246, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Under these authorities, Hamilton should not have his restitution obligation reduced by payments to Ms. Wright by her insurer. (See also <em>In re Brittany L. </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 1381, 1389 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 376] [victims \u201centitled to a restitution order [under Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 730.6 for juveniles] in an amount sufficient to \u2018fully reimburse\u2019 them for losses incurred as a result of appellant\u2019s criminal conduct\u2014without regard to potential reimbursement from their homeowners\u2019 insurance carrier\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">2. <em>Payments Made by Ms. Hamilton\u2019s Insurance Carrier</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">In determining whether Ms. Wright incurred economic loss entitling her to restitution under former section 1202.4, the trial court reduced the amount of that loss by the amount paid by Ms. Hamilton\u2019s insurer to settle Hill\u2019s civil action against Ms. Hamilton and defendant. When instructing Ms. Wright to calculate her \u201cout of pocket\u201d expenses, the trial court told her to deduct the $30,000 settlement paid by Ms. Hamilton\u2019s insurer. Hamilton argues that the deduction was proper under <em>People </em>v. <em>Bernal </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 155 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 622] <em>(Bernal).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">In <em>Bernal, supra, </em>101 Cal.App. 4th 155, the court held that payments made by the defendant\u2019s insurer to settle the victim\u2019s civil action against the defendant must be offset against the defendant\u2019s victim restitution obligation for losses covered by the restitution order. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 165-168.) The court distinguished <em>Birkett </em>and <em>Hove </em>as involving sources of victim reimbursement that were \u201ccompletely distinct and independent from the defendants.\u201d The court noted that payments in <em>Birkett </em>were made by the victim\u2019s insurer and in <em>Hove </em>by Medi-Cal, and as such were simply \u201cfortuitous events from which the defendants should not benefit.\u201d <em>(Bernal, </em>at p. 166.) The <em>Bernal </em>court reasoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>that payments by a defendant\u2019s insurer were different from other sources of reimbursement because (1) unlike payments from other third party sources, payments to the victim by the defendant\u2019s insurance are not fortuitous, but bargained for because the defendant procured the insurance; (2) the defendant paid the policy premiums; (3) the defendant had a contractual right to have the payments made to the victim on his behalf; and (4) the insurance company has no right of indemnity or subrogation against the defendant. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\"><em>Bernal, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th 155, is distinguishable from the instant case. Payments here were made, not by Hamilton\u2019s insurer, but by a source completely distinct and independent from Hamilton\u2014namely, his mother\u2019s insurer. Unlike the situation in <em>Bernal, </em>Hamilton did not procure or maintain the insurance, had no contractual right to require payments to be made on his behalf, and was potentially subject to an indemnity claim by the insurer.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Ms. Wright\u2019s receipt of any payment is due to two fortuitous events: Ms. Hamilton\u2019s procuring insurance coverage and the insurance policy covering Hamilton\u2019s acts. Hamilton should not benefit from these circumstances. <em>(Birkett, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 246; <em>Hove, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1273-1274; <em>People v. Clifton </em>(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 1165, 1168 [219 Cal.Rptr. 904] <em>(Clifton).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Moreover, the conclusion in <em>Bernal, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th 155, is inconsistent with the following language in <em>Clifton, supra, </em>172 Cal.App.3d 1165: \u201cwhile restitution collected pursuant to [former] Penal Code section 1203.04<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is to be credited, by the terms of the statute, to any civil judgment obtained by the victim, the statute does not conversely authorize credit from a civil settlement to the amount payable pursuant to a restitution order in a criminal case. . . . Aside from compensating an individual for injuries suffered, restitution may also serve the salutary purposes of deterring future criminality and impressing upon a criminal offender that he must accept responsibility for his crime. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1168.)</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">The court in <em>Bernal, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at page 167, distinguished <em>Clifton, supra, </em>172 Cal.App.3d 1165, as dealing \u201cwith the question of whether the trial court had statutory <em>authority </em>to order restitution after the victim settled with and released the defendant\u2019s insurance company. . . . <em>Clifton </em>was not specifically concerned with whether any portion of the prior settlement would offset the subsequently entered restitution order. Although <em>Clifton </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>contains language suggesting that there should be no offset, that language was mere dictum.\u201d <em>(Bernal, supra, </em>101 Cal.App.4th at p. 167.) We need not resolve the question of whether a payment by a defendant\u2019s insurer can be an offset to a restitution order because here the payment was not by the defendant\u2019s insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Salas </em>(Colo.Ct.App. 2002) 42 P.3d 68 <em>(Salas), </em>overruled in part on another ground in <em>People v. Kennaugh </em>(Colo. 2003) 80 P.3d 315, a Colorado case, the facts are similar to those presented here. In <em>Salas, </em>the defendant pleaded guilty to assaulting the victim in a restaurant and was ordered to pay victim restitution as required by a statute. (Colo. Sess. Laws 1996, ch. 288, at 1778; Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 16-11-204.5.) The victim filed a civil action against both the defendant and the restaurant but subsequently dropped her claims against the defendant and settled with the restaurant for $60,000. The defendant sought to offset the settlement proceeds the victim received from the restaurant against the defendant\u2019s victim restitution obligation pursuant to a statutory requirement that the court offset against the restitution obligation funds recovered by the victim in a civil proceeding from or on behalf of the defendant. <em>(Salas, </em>at p. 69; Colo. Sess. Laws 1998, ch. 112, at 669; Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 16-11-101.5.) The court concluded that no portion of the victim\u2019s settlement with the restaurant was paid by or on behalf of the defendant and allowed no offset. <em>(Salas, </em>at pp. 69-70.)</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Here, as in <em>Salas, </em>there is no evidence that the settlement paid by Ms. Hamilton\u2019s insurer was made on Hamilton\u2019s behalf. The evidence is to the contrary. The settlement and release agreement signed by Hill expressly releases Ms. Hamilton; it does not mention Hamilton except in the caption in Hill\u2019s civil case against Hamilton and his mother. A letter from Ms. Hamilton\u2019s insurer dated March 27, 2002, transmitting to her a copy of the signed release, states: \u201cPursuant to your request, enclosed are copies of the signed release, dismissal and settlement check we issued to resolve the claim made against you by Donald Hill.\u201d Finally, a letter from Ms. Hamilton\u2019s attorney advising her of Hill\u2019s agreement to settle his action against her states: \u201cI am happy to advise that the Offer to Compromise in the amount of $30,000 has been accepted which will release and dismiss you from this lawsuit. We were also able to extricate your son, Eric, with respect to the civil action, obtaining a Request for Dismissal with Prejudice. However, it is not within our power or authority to have a Release made on Eric\u2019s behalf, given the prior restitution orders in the criminal matter . . .\u201d Because the settlement paid by Ms. Hamilton\u2019s insurer was made on her behalf, and not directly on behalf of Hamilton, it cannot be offset against Hamilton\u2019s victim restitution obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>3. <em>Amount of Restitution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">The People contend that because the trial court erroneously considered payments by Ms. Wright\u2019s insurer as an offset, it failed to inquire into the full extent of Ms. Wright\u2019s economic loss and should do so upon remand. Hamilton asserts that such reconsideration is unnecessary because the trial court already ascertained the amount of Ms. Wright\u2019s losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">The trial court gave Ms. Wright the opportunity to present evidence that her expenses exceeded $15,000 and that if she did not do so, the trial court would conclude that \u201cit\u2019s over and done with.\u201d The record does not show that Ms. Wright presented any further evidence. That the trial court offset insurance payments against $15,000 suggests it concluded that $15,000 was the proper amount of the restitution. There is no indication in the record to the contrary. Moreover, the $15,000 amount appears to have been part of a negotiated plea. There is no showing of any need for further consideration of the amount of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">4. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Although Ms. Wright may end up with more <em>money </em>than she expended, the result can be justified. The restitution order serves deterrent and punitive goals. In tort law, if an injured party receives compensation for injuries from a source independent of the tortfeasor, the amount of such compensation is not offset against the damage obligation of the tortfeasor (the collateral source doctrine). <em>(Helfend v. Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 1, 6 [84 Cal.Rptr. 173, 465 P.2d 61] (Tobriner, Acting C. J.). Although \u201c[t]he doctrine has been severely criticized by commentators ... it is firmly established as the California rule.\u201d (6 Witkin, Summary of California Law (9th ed. 1988) Torts, \u00a7 1388, p. 857.) There is no reason why that same principle of tort law should not apply to restitution for crime victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">The matter is reversed and remanded to the trial court to determine the effect of Hamilton\u2019s failure to pay restitution without considering any insurance payments as offsets to his restitution obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">Turner, P. J., and Armstrong, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">Respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied March 24, 2004.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b873-11\"> Further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b873-12\"> The record is unclear whether the amount of the settlement was $25,000 or $30,000. Although there is testimony indicating Hill\u2019s civil action was settled for $30,000, documentation provided by Ms. Hamilton\u2019s insurer shows a payment of only $25,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b874-14\"> It appears that Ms. Wright\u2019s insurer paid for some of Hill\u2019s medical expenses. It is not clear if the payments were made directly to the provider or to Ms. Wright. It is also unclear if the insurance was Ms. Wright\u2019s insurance that covered Hill or was Hill\u2019s insurance proceeds to which she succeeded. We refer to the insurer as Ms. Wright\u2019s insurer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b877-6\"> (Stats. 1996, ch. 629, \u00a7 3; Stats. 1997, ch. 527, \u00a7 4; Stats. 1998, ch. 201, \u00a7 1; Stats. 1998, ch. 587, \u00a7 6.5; Stats. 1999, ch. 121, \u00a7 1; Stats. 1999, ch. 584, \u00a7 4; Stats. 2000, ch. 198, \u00a7 4; Stats. 2000, ch. 1016, \u00a7 9.5.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b877-7\"> The restitution law in effect on the date of the crime, March 25, 1996, applies in this case. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Birkett </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 226, 247, fn. 21 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 205, 980 P.2d 912] <em>(Birkett).)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b877-8\"> The statute now reads in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-9\">\u201c(f) In every case in which a victim has suffered economic loss as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct, the court shall require that the defendant make restitution to the victim or victims in an amount established by court order, based on the amount of loss claimed by the victim or victims or any other showing to the court. If the amount of loss cannot be ascertained at the time of sentencing, the restitution order shall include a provision that the amount shall be determined at the direction of the court.
