Code, \u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 12022, subd. (b)(1); undesignated section references are to the Penal Code) and conspiracy to obstruct justice (count 3; \u00a7 182, subd. (a)(5)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sentenced to state prison, he raises numerous contentions, including a claim that the trial court \u201cErred in Denying [his] Motion that the Prosecution not be referred to as \u2018The People.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">In the published portion of the opinion, we conclude the prosecution was properly undertaken in the name of \u201cThe People of the State of California.\u201d In the unpublished portion of the opinion we find no prejudicial error. We shall therefore affirm the judgment. However, we shall remand the matter to the trial court to correct an error in the abstract of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND* *</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">I-IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">Defendant contends the trial court erred prejudicially by denying his pretrial motion to preclude the prosecution from being called, \u201cThe People\u201d or \u201cThe People of the State of California.\u201d According to defendant, this appellation violates criminal defendants\u2019 state and federal constitutional rights to fair trial by jury and to due process. We conclude that this contention, although raised increasingly often, lacks merit. California statutes mandate that prosecutions be conducted in the name of \u201cThe People of the State of California,\u201d and defendant has failed to show that the applicable statutes are unconstitutional on their face or as applied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">Section 684, originally enacted in 1872, provides; \u201cA criminal action is prosecuted in the name of the people of the State of California, as a party, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>against the person charged with the offense.\u201d Similarly, Government Code section 100, subdivision (b), provides: \u201cThe style of all process shall be \u2018The People of the State of California,\u2019 and all prosecutions shall be conducted in their name and by their authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Because statutory law mandates that prosecutions shall be conducted in the name of the \u201cThe People,\u201d defendant\u2019s challenge can succeed only if he can show that the statutes are unconstitutional on their face or as applied. In considering a facial constitutional challenge to a statute, a reviewing court must uphold the statute unless its unconstitutionality plainly and unmistakably appears; all presumptions favor its validity. <em>(Pryor </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 238, 253-255 [158 Cal.Rptr. 330, 599 P.2d 636].) The challenge can succeed only if the statute \u201c \u2018inevitably pose[s] a <em>present </em>total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional prohibitions.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gallegos </em>(1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 252, 262 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 666].)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Defendant asserts that calling the prosecution \u201cThe People\u201d violates the federal and state constitutional guarantees of a fair trial by jury and due process of law. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, &amp; 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 15 &amp; 16.) However, he fails to cite any authority so holding. He merely notes that most other states style the prosecution, \u201cThe State\u201d or \u201cthe Commonwealth\u201d and that the federal district courts style the prosecution \u201cThe United States,\u201d then concludes: \u201cSuch consensus indicates California\u2019s practice violates due process.\u201d On the contrary, even if California\u2019s practice were unique, that fact would not tend to prove a constitutional violation. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Martinez </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1502, 1515-1516 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 638].)</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">The substantive aspect of the federal due process clause protects individuals from being deprived of fundamental liberty interests, no matter what process is provided, unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to a compelling state interest. <em>(Reno v. Flores </em>(1993) 507 U.S. 292, 301-302 [123 L.Ed.2d 1, 113 S.Ct. 1439].) Assuming without deciding that defendant is asserting an interest which is entitled to protection by <em>substantive </em>due process, defendant has shown no unfairness. The signatories to this opinion have collectively served many decades on the trial and appellate benches and have participated in the adjudication of hundreds upon hundreds of criminal cases. (See <em>People v. Bush </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 1048, 1053 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 439].) We are not aware of a single instance in which the fact that a prosecution was brought in the name of \u201cThe People\u201d has had any influence whatsoever on the decision of a jury with respect to a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence. There is simply no unfairness. For that reason, defendant\u2019s facial challenge to this procedure, based on a lack of <em>procedural </em>due process fails as well.  Under the procedural aspect of the federal due process clause, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>the states are generally free to regulate the procedures of their courts in accordance with their own concepts of policy and fairness, unless a state procedure violates some fundamental principle of justice. <em>(Patterson v. New York </em>(1977) 432 U.S. 197, 201-202 [53 L.Ed.2d 281, 97 S.Ct. 2319].) No fundamental principle of justice is violated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Defendant purports to rely not only on the federal constitutional right to due process but also on California\u2019s parallel constitutional right. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 15, 16.) There is no state constitutional infirmity ip prosecuting criminal cases in the name of \u201cThe People of the State of California.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Finally, defendant makes no attempt to demonstrate by record citation how his own trial fell short of due process because the prosecution was called, \u201cThe People.\u201d Thus, assuming he intends an as-applied constitutional challenge to section 684 and Government Code section 100, subdivision (b), we reject it summarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">VI<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">The judgment is affirmed. The matter is remanded to the trial court with directions to correct the abstract of judgment as indicated in part VI of the Discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">Scotland, P. J., and Davis, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied March 30, 2004. Kennard, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-13\"> Count 2, charging conspiracy to commit murder (\u00a7 182, subd.
