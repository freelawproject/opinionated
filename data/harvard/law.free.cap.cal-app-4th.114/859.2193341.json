Sanctions shall not be imposed pursuant to this subdivision, except on notice contained in a party\u2019s papers, or on the court\u2019s own noticed motion, and after an opportunity to be heard.\u201d (Stats. 1994, ch. 493, \u00a7 1, pp. 2675-2676, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">With a minor change (\u201cshall not\u201d was changed to \u201cmay not\u201d), this language appears in current subdivision (j) of section 437c. (Stats. 2002, ch. 448, \u00a7 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The question in this case is whether this statutory language, which authorizes a court to award \u201creasonable expenses\u201d as a sanction, allows a court to award, as a sanction, attorney\u2019s fees incurred by the party to whom sanctions will be paid. For reasons that follow, we conclude it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">In this personal injury action by plaintiff William F. Collins,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defendant state Department of Transportation (Caltrans) appeals from a trial court order awarding sanctions for presenting a bad faith declaration in support of a summary judgment motion in violation of former subdivision (i) of section 437c. The sanctions award consisted entirely of attorney\u2019s fees incurred by plaintiff Collins. Caltrans argues it should not have been sanctioned as a matter of public policy, and that section 437c does not authorize an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Caltrans also argues there was no substantial evidence the declaration was presented in bad faith. Plaintiff requests sanctions on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">We shall conclude section 437c does not authorize an award of attorney\u2019s fees as a sanction. We shall reverse the order awarding sanctions and deny plaintiff\u2019s request for sanctions on appeal, but we shall remand to the trial court for redetermination of plaintiff\u2019s claim for sanctions based upon out-of-pocket expenses other than attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">Plaintiff brought this personal injury action against Caltrans and others, alleging he was injured when 15-year-old Joshua Daniels threw a chunk of broken concrete at plaintiff\u2019s semitractor trailer as it was traveling on Interstate Highway 5 (1-5) over the Smith\u2019s Canal crossing in Stockton, California on December 4, 1997. The concrete penetrated the front windshield of the truck and struck plaintiff in the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">As is pertinent here, the complaint alleged theories of premises liability and general negligence. Plaintiff alleged 1-5 at the Smith\u2019s Canal crossing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>in a dangerous condition because it provided pedestrians easy access to the traffic on 1-5 and access to objects that pedestrians could throw at passing motorists and escape without detection.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">Caltrans filed two summary judgment motions. The first motion argued, inter alia, that Caltrans had no actual or constructive notice of a dangerous condition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Caltrans submitted a declaration of a retired Caltrans engineer who attested, based upon his review of Caltrans\u2019s accident database (TASAS) and review of deposition testimony of a California Highway Patrol (CHP) officer who searched CHP\u2019s database, that there had been no reports to the CHP of anyone throwing rocks at motorists from Smith\u2019s Canal and no reports of accidents involving rocks at that location for a period of approximately nine years.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">In opposition to the first summary judgment motion, plaintiff adduced the deposition testimony of two CHP officers, who testified about prior reports of rock throwing in the general vicinity of the south side of Smith\u2019s Canal prior to the incident involving plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Plaintiff also objected to the admission of the TASAS report, on the ground it was irrelevant to prove notice because it was a traffic accident database, and rock throwing incidents are reported as arrests or investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Shortly after plaintiff filed his opposition to the summary judgment motions, Caltrans withdrew the motions. The reason Caltrans gave for the withdrawal was that the discovery referee had ruled in plaintiff\u2019s favor on his motions to compel discovery. Caltrans asserted it was withdrawing the motions due to the uncompleted discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">Plaintiff filed a motion for sanctions against Caltrans pursuant to former subdivision (i) of Code of Civil Procedure section 437c (subdivision (i)), the substance of which is now found in subdivision (j) of section 437c.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We have recounted the language of subdivision (i) at the outset of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">In support of his motion for sanctions, plaintiff argued, inter alia, that the declarations submitted by Caltrans were knowingly false because state employees (i.e., CHP Officers McClellan and Riisager) had given deposition testimony before the declarations were submitted, which proved the state had prior notice of rock throwing incidents. Plaintiff also argued Caltrans\u2019s declarations asserting no notice were knowingly misleading because its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>experts relied on the TASAS database, when it knew that database would never include rock throwing incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The court ordered a hearing on the summary judgment motions (despite their withdrawal by Caltrans), consolidated with a hearing on the sanctions motion. After the court heard argument on all three motions, it entered written rulings, first on the summary judgment motions, then on the sanctions motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The trial court found with respect to the first summary judgment motion that plaintiff had produced sufficient evidence to create an inference Caltrans had notice of prior similar incidents, and that Caltrans had failed to demonstrate that other factors weighed against a finding of duty. The trial court denied both motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">The trial court granted plaintiff\u2019s sanctions motion in part. The ruling stated: \u201cThe court finds that the affidavits supporting the first motion were filed in bad faith in violation of CCP \u00a7 437c(i). This finding is based in part on the fact that defendant was aware that there was evidence supporting plaintiffs\u2019 claim of notice, yet it represented to the court that there was no such evidence. In addition, it appears that defendant sought to mislead both the court and opposing counsel regarding the relevant database wherein information regarding prior similar incidents was to be found.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">The trial court awarded sanctions in the amount of $28,725. All of the sanctions awarded represented attorney\u2019s fees incurred by plaintiff Collins. Caltrans appeals from the sanctions order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">\n<em>Attorney\u2019s Fees Not Authorized.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">Caltrans argues the trial court erred in interpreting subdivision (i), which provides for payment of \u201creasonable expenses which the filing of the affidavits caused the other party to incur,\u201d to include attorney\u2019s fees. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">As a preliminary matter, we address plaintiff\u2019s claim Caltrans may not advance this argument for the first time on appeal. Ordinarily, an appellate court will not consider arguments not asserted below. <em>(Ochoa v. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 1480, 1488, fn. 3 [72 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 232].) However, this rule does not apply when only a question of law is presented. <em>(State of California ex rel. Public Works Bd. v. Bragg </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 1018, 1023-1024 [228 Cal.Rptr. 576].) Here, the issue presented is the interpretation of subdivision (i). The facts are undisputed. The interpretation and applicability of a statute on the undisputed facts in the record is a question of law, which we may address for the first time on appeal. (183 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1023-1024.)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">Caltrans relies on the American rule, codified at section 1021 as follows: \u201cExcept as attorney\u2019s fees are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties . . . .\u201d Caltrans argues that subdivision (i), which awards simply \u201creasonable expenses\u201d does not specifically include attorney\u2019s fees as required by section 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">\u201cThe goal of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. County of Stanislaus </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1143, 1152 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 329, 947 P.2d 291].) In determining the Legislature\u2019s intent we look first to the language of the statute, giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning. <em>(People v. Superior Court (Zamudio) </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 183, 192 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 463, 999 P.2d 686].) If there is no ambiguity, the plain meaning of the language governs, but if the language is ambiguous, we may examine the context of the language and construe the language so as to harmonize the statute internally and with related statutes, keeping in mind the object to be achieved or the evil to be prevented. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 192-193.)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The term \u201creasonable expenses\u201d does not necessarily include, nor does it necessarily preclude expenses incurred for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">However, the California Supreme Court in <em>Bauguess v. Paine </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 626 [150 Cal.Rptr. 461, 586 P.2d 942] <em>(Bauguess), </em>held that, absent express statutory authority, a court has no power to award attorney\u2019s fees as sanctions. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 637-639.) <em>Bauguess </em>reversed a trial court order for a plaintiff\u2019s attorney to pay attorney\u2019s fees to defense counsel after a mistrial in a personal injury action. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 640.) The Supreme Court, citing section 1021, said, \u201c[a]wards of attorney\u2019s fees by courts are the exception rather than the rule.\u201d (22 Cal.3d at p. 634.) <em>Bauguess </em>observed, \u201c[s]ome statutes do authorize the use of fee awards as sanctions for conduct which produces unnecessary or unwarranted litigation. [Citation.] . . . However, no statute provides for fee awards as sanctions following a <em>mistrial </em>either against a counsel or a party.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 635.)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\"><em>Bauguess, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 626, rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the court had inherent power to make such an award. The case did not fit within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>the limited class of recognized equitable exceptions to the general rule that each party shall pay its own attorney. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 636-637.) Although the court\u2019s supervisory power had been recognized by the Legislature in section 128, \u201cit exists apart from express statutory authority. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 635-636.) \u201cAlthough a few statutes permit fee awards as sanctions, the appellate courts of this state have generally disallowed such awards based on a theory of inherent supervisory power. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 637.) \u201cIt would be both unnecessary and unwise to permit trial courts to use fee awards as sanctions apart from those situations authorized by statute. If an attorney\u2019s conduct is disruptive of court processes or disrespectful of the court itself, there is ample power to punish the misconduct as contempt.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 637-638.)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\"><em>Bauguess, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 626, accordingly reversed the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (22 Cal.3d at p. 640.)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Attorney\u2019s fees are specifically mentioned in a myriad of sanctions statutes (some enacted before <em>Bauguess, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 626, others enacted after Bauguess). Some statutes include attorney\u2019s fees as reasonable expenses to be included in an award for sanctions against bad faith or improper conduct, while other statutes refer to attorney\u2019s fees and expenses in the conjunctive.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Thus, for example, section 128.7 authorizes sanctions for the filing of papers for an improper purpose, and the sanctions may include \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses\u201d incurred as a direct result of the violation (\u00a7 128.7, subd. (d)) and incurred in presenting or opposing the motion (\u00a7 128.7, subd. (c)(1)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>The sanctions allowable pursuant to sections 128.5 and 128.6 are \u201cany reasonable expenses, <em>including attorney\u2019s fees, </em>incurred by another party as a result of bad-faith actions or tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">A party who misuses the subpoena process by seeking to compel or to oppose the production of subpoenaed items in bad faith or without substantial justification may be liable for the other party\u2019s \u201creasonable expenses incurred in making or opposing the motion, <em>including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 1987.2, italics added.) Likewise, misuse of the discovery process may result in imposition of a monetary sanction in the amount of \u201creasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d (\u00a7 2023, subds. (a)(9), (b)(1).) Also, a party who fails to provide an admission in response to a request for admissions may be made to pay the requesting party \u201creasonable expenses incurred in making that proof, <em>including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d </em>where the failure to admit was without good reason. (\u00a7 2033, subd. (o), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">In a child custody proceeding, a court that declines to exercise jurisdiction may impose \u201creasonable expenses including . . . attorney\u2019s fees\u201d against a party who sought to invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction and \u201cengaged in unjustifiable conduct.\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 3428, subds. (a), (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The Public Safety Officers Procedural Bill of Rights Act provides the court may award sanctions against a party or attorney for filing a bad faith or frivolous action. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3309.5, subd. (c).) The sanctions awardable include \u201creasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3309.5, subd. (c)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">The Administrative Procedure Act provides for an award of \u201creasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by another party as a result of bad faith actions or tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11455.30, subd. (a).) A similar provision applies in workers\u2019 compensation proceedings. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5813, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">In contrast to the foregoing statutes, subdivision (i) does not expressly mention attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">A venerable canon of statutory interpretation provides: \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018Where a statute, with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject ... is significant to show that a different intention existed.\u2019 \u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Moncharsh v.

We note that the Legislature, which is presumed to know of case law <em>(Arthur Andersen v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1481, 1500 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 879]), amended section 437c many times after the 1978 <em>Bauguess </em>case <em>(Bauguess, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 626), without adding any reference to attorney\u2019s fees in the subdivision pertinent to this appeal. (Stats. 1980, ch. 57, \u00a7 1, pp. 151-153; Stats. 1982, ch. 1510, \u00a7 1, pp. 5855-5857; Stats. 1983, ch. 490, \u00a7 1, pp. 1990-1993; Stats. 1984, ch. 171, \u00a7 1, pp. 544-547; Stats. 1986, ch. 540, \u00a7 3, pp. 1927-1930; Stats. 1989, ch. 1416, \u00a7 16, pp. 6228-6231; Stats. 1990, ch. 1561, \u00a7 2, pp. 7330-7333; Stats. 1992, ch. 339, \u00a7 1, pp. 1307-1311; Stats. 1992, ch. 1348 \u00a7 1, pp. 6699-6703; Stats. 1993, ch. 276, \u00a7 1, pp. 1969-1974; Stats. 1994, ch. 493, \u00a7 1, pp. 2673-2677; Stats. 2002, ch. 448, \u00a7 5.) Indeed, the 2002 legislation amended the very subdivision at issue in this appeal, to change \u201cshall not\u201d to \u201cmay not\u201d in the sentence directing that sanctions not be imposed unless the party to be sanctioned is given notice and opportunity to be heard. (\u00a7 437c, subd. (j); Stats. 2002, ch. 448, \u00a7 5.) The absence of a statutory amendment adding reference to attorney\u2019s fees supports our conclusion that attorney\u2019s fees are not a component of sanctions under the summary judgment statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Plaintiff argues appellate courts regularly award attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to section 907<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and California Rules of Court, rule 27(e)(1),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> even though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>neither of these specifically provides for an award of attorney\u2019s fees. (See, e.g., <em>Harris v. Sandro </em>(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 1310, 1316 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 910]; <em>Town of Woodside </em>v. <em>Gava </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 488, 495 [261 Cal.Rptr. 730]; <em>Young v. Rosenthal </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 96, 134-135 [260 Cal.Rptr. 369].) However, sanctions on appeal are framed in terms of \u201cdamages,\u201d which plaintiff fails to show are coextensive with the term at issue in this appeal, i.e. \u201cexpenses.\u201d Moreover, <em>Bauguess, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 626 at page 635, footnote 4, cited section 907 as a statute authorizing the use of fee awards as sanctions. Additionally, <em>Young v. Redman </em>(1976) 55 Cal.App.3d 827 [128 Cal.Rptr. 86] stated: \u201cAlthough the California Legislature has enacted legislation empowering the appellate courts to impose such sanctions (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 907), it has not done so as to the trial courts, apparently codifying the American Rule in Code of Civil Procedure section 1021 . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 838.) Thus, plaintiff\u2019s argument about appellate courts is unavailing, because his sanctions were imposed by a trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">Plaintiff cites cases where attorney\u2019s fees were awarded as sanctions in summary judgment proceedings. However, in the cited cases, the sanctions were awarded under section 128.5, not section 437c <em>(Olson Partnership v. Gaylord Plating Lab., Inc. </em>(1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 235 [276 Cal.Rptr. 493]), and/or section 437c was cited in dictum without discussion <em>(Robertson </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 347, 361 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 464]). One case, <em>Winick Corp. v. County Sanitation Dist. No. 2 </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 1170 [230 Cal.Rptr. 289] <em>(Winick), </em>cited both section 128.5 and subdivision (i), as authorizing sanctions, including attorney\u2019s fees. <em>(Winick, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.3d at p. 1176.) <em>Winick </em>said, \u201cstatutory changes have broadened the power of trial courts to award sanctions, including attorney\u2019s fees for [bad faith tactics]. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 128.5.) More specifically, such sanctions can be applied in summary judgment proceedings where a party files an affidavit in bad faith. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (i).)\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, <em>Winick\u2019s </em>reference to section 437c was dictum, because section 437c addresses only bad faith affidavits, whereas the misconduct in <em>Winick </em>was the plaintiff\u2019s filing of a meritless action and failure to dismiss it voluntarily, thereby compelling the defendant to file an answer and summary judgment motion. <em>(Winick, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1175, 1177.) <em>Winick </em>said nothing about improper affidavits. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1180-1181.) An opinion is not authority for a proposition not therein considered. <em>(Santisas v. Goodin </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 599, 620 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 830, 951 P.2d 399].)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>Nothing in the cognizable legislative history of the summary judgment statute suggests that the Legislature intended to include attorney\u2019s fees as sanctions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">We are able to determine from the documents of which we have taken judicial notice, that the bill as originally introduced provided for the payment of \u201creasonable expenses.\u201d The language remained unchanged throughout the course of the legislative process to enactment. A committee report (apparently of the Senate Judiciary Committee) of the pertinent 1973 legislation (Sen. Bill No. 651) posed the question, \u201cDoes Reasonable Expenses Include Reasonable Attorney\u2019s Fees?\u201d with no express answer to this question provided in the legislative history. In light of <em>Bauguess, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 626, and in light of the other sanctions statutes expressly referring to attorney\u2019s fees, we conclude the evident answer to the question posed by the committee report is, \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The legislative history furnishes no basis to think that the Legislature intended attorney\u2019s fees to be awarded as sanctions and furnishes every basis simply to apply the venerable canon of statutory construction that where myriad sanctions statutes expressly refer to attorney\u2019s fees, the omission of any reference to attorney\u2019s fees in the summary judgment statute is significant to show a different legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">We conclude attorney\u2019s fees are not recoverable as \u201creasonable expenses\u201d under subdivision (i). Instead, the statute allows recovery of expenses such as expert fees and service fees. Plaintiff argues this will be an ineffective deterrent to misconduct, because the primary, if not sole, expense caused by dishonest affidavits is attorney\u2019s fees. That is an argument best directed to the Legislature. In any event, the argument does not appear well taken in this case, where plaintiff sought $22,368 in out-of-pocket expenses in addition to attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Here, the entire sanctions award was for attorney\u2019s fees. We therefore conclude the order must be reversed. As noted, plaintiff claimed out-of-pocket expenses other than attorney\u2019s fees as a basis for sanctions, and the trial court denied those expenses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>In light of our elimination of attorney\u2019s fees as a component of sanctions, it is likely the trial court would award non-attorney\u2019 s-fees expenses as sanctions. Otherwise, Caltrans would escape without sanctions for the bad faith conduct found by the trial court. We shall therefore remand to the trial court for reconsideration of sanctions other than attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">Caltrans argues the public policy favoring zealous representation renders sanctions inappropriate, and there is not substantial evidence supporting the finding of bad faith. However, having reviewed the record, we reject these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Plaintiff argues he should be awarded his attorney\u2019s fees on appeal under section 437c, subdivision (j),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and section 1021.5 (fees for successful party in action affecting public interest).  Since we have concluded plaintiff was not entitled to the award of attorney\u2019s fees by the trial court, plaintiff is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees on appeal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The April 22, 2002, order awarding sanctions is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the trial court for redetermination of sanctions in accordance with the views expressed in the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">Blease, Acting P. J., and Nicholson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 21, 2004, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied May 21, 2004.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b799-12\"> Undesignated section references are to the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b800-11\"> Plaintiffs wife, Barbara Y.

The second motion is not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b801-11\"> As we have mentioned, pursuant to a 2002 amendment (Stats. 2002, ch. 448, \u00a7 5), the current statute says \u201cmay not\u201d rather than \u201cshall not.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b802-12\"> The sanctions order is an appealable order under section 904.1, subdivision (a)(12), which allows an appeal to be taken from \u201can order directing payment of monetary sanctions by a party or an attorney for a party if the amount exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b804-7\"> In response to the holding in <em>Bauguess, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 626, the Legislature passed section 128.5 in 1981. <em>(People v. Cook </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 404, 407 [257 Cal.Rptr. 226].) Section 128.5 authorized trial courts to order a party and/or the party\u2019s attorney to pay \u201creasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by another party as a result of bad-faith actions or tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.\u201d The Legislature declared in an uncodified section of the legislation that \u201c[i]t is the intent of this legislation to broaden the powers of trial courts to manage their calendars and provide for the expeditious processing of civil actions by authorizing monetary sanctions now not presently authorized by the interpretation of the law in <em>Bauguess[, supra,] </em>22 Cal.3d 626 [150 Cal.Rptr. 461, 586 P.2d 942].\u201d (Stats. 1981, ch. 762, \u00a7 2, p. 2968; see <em>Trans-Action Commercial Investors, Ltd. v. Firmaterr, Inc. </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 352, 367-370 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 449] [discussing legislative action regarding sanctions statutes].)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Section 128.5 was unavailable to Collins in the present case because it applied only to cases in which the complaint was filed on or before December 31, 1994. Section 128.6, containing virtually identical provisions, did not become operative until January 1, 2003. Collins\u2019s sanctions motion was filed January 30, 2002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b804-9\"> Plaintiff acknowledges section 128.7 could not apply in this case, because it requires notice and opportunity for the offending party to avoid sanctions by withdrawing the papers it filed, and here Caltrans withdrew its summary judgment motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b806-6\"> Section 907 authorizes appellate courts to award, in addition to costs, \u201csuch damages as may be just,\u201d as sanctions for filing a frivolous appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b806-7\"> California Rules of Court, rule 27(e)(1) states the Court of Appeal \u201cmay impose sanctions, including the award or denial of costs, on a party or an attorney for [frivolous appeal, etc].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b808-8\"> We have declined to take judicial notice of some documents submitted by Caltrans. It is the intent of the Legislature we seek to determine in construing a statute. <em>(Metropolitan Water Dist. v. Imperial Irrigation Dist. </em>(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 1403, 1424-1426 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 314].) We generally do not consider materials showing the subjective intent of interested parties, or even the subjective intent of a single legislator. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1426.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b809-10\"> As indicated, the substance of former subdivision (i) is now found in subdivision (j)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b809-11\"> Collins also asks this court to punish Caltrans for submitting bad faith affidavits by reporting the conduct of their attorneys to the State Bar, publishing this opinion and ordering its distribution to all Caltrans senior executives, and referring the case for investigation and possible criminal prosecution. Subdivision (i) prescribes the penalty (\u201creasonable expenses\u201d) for bad faith affidavits. Collins cites no authority which would allow this court to take the requested actions for the reasons he asserts. Accordingly, we decline his offer to impose such punishment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
