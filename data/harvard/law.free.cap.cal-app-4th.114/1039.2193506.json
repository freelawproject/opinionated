That conclusion is not supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, the denial of defendants\u2019 suppression motion is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">Defendants Robert and Merideth Morton operate a commercial nursery in Santa Rosa and live on the property. During the week of September 24, 2001, an unidentified man called the Sonoma County Sheriff\u2019s Department and reported that his neighbors, the defendants, were cultivating marijuana at the nursery. On September 28, detectives Andrea Salas and Stephen Gossett, assigned to a marijuana suppression team, visited the nursery but saw no indication of marijuana cultivation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">On October 9, 2001, a person describing himself as a neighbor of the nursery left a message with the Sheriff\u2019s Department. The neighbor gave his first name and asked for \u201ca call back in regards to marijuana cultivation.\u201d Salas returned the call about 1:00 p.m. The neighbor expressed concern that the nursery was cultivating marijuana and that \u201csomething must have happened over the nighttime hours.\u201d The neighbor suspected that \u201csomebody [had] ripped [the nursery] off.\u201d The neighbor reported finding marijuana debris on the fence bordering defendants\u2019 property and a trail of marijuana debris leading from his driveway to a residential unit on his property occupied by his teenage daughter. Salas and Gossett decided to meet with the neighbor because they \u201chad really limited information, so it was kind of like somebody needed to go find out what he was trying to explain to us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">On their way to speak with the neighbor, the detectives drove past defendants\u2019 nursery which they recognized from their visit 10 days earlier. They arrived at the neighbor\u2019s property about 2:00 p.m. The neighbor showed the detectives two marijuana leaves hanging near the top and on the neighbor\u2019s side of the fence separating his property from defendants\u2019. He also showed them a small amount of marijuana debris in his driveway.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The detectives took photographs that show the fence was made of chain link with wooden slats running vertically through the links.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although Salas described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>the fence as \u201cpretty high\u201d and \u201ctaller than I am,\u201d no one established how tall she is and no further clarification was provided for the record. Salas did not look over or under the fence to determine if there was marijuana on defendants\u2019 property. As depicted in several of the photographs, the bottom of the fence appears to stand several inches above the dirt and gravel at ground level. One of the photographs shows a small depression in the dirt beneath the fence. Salas described the area as \u201cwhere someone had gone under the fence.\u201d It appears that gravel and leaves have been displaced in the area of the depression. Although the depth of the depression in the dirt appears quite slight in the photograph, it was not further described for the record. In terms of width, the depression appears to be about as wide as a man\u2019s boot or a small animal. As depicted in the photograph, the depression is not as wide as the hips or shoulders of even a small person.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Salas and Gossett asked the neighbor whether he had seen defendants that day. The neighbor said he had not and reported that normally the nursery occupants \u201cplay loud music,\u201d are \u201cout and about\u201d and \u201ctending to the nursery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">Based on her observations of the fence and driveway, Salas testified, \u201c[I]ri my mind I was starting to think that there had actually been some sort of trespassing or there had been some other incident. I mean, typically what we would call a marijuana rip off.\u201d Salas testified that she and Gossett agreed that \u201cobviously something happened during the nighttime hours\u201d and that they \u201cneeded to go next door and find out what exactly happened, and to try to contact the people that live there.\u201d Salas and Gossett decided to go to the nursery to determine \u201cif anyone was home, if everything was okay, and then, you know, whatever investigation we had to do after that point, we would determine that at that point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">Salas never testified that she believed defendants might need assistance. Although she had investigated two earlier \u201cmarijuana rip offs\u201d involving violence, she and Gossett were still uncertain that a similar theft had taken place at the nursery. The detectives wanted to talk with the occupants of the nursery because their neighbor had not seen them. Nothing in the record suggests that any violence had occurred. The neighbor did not indicate anything that aroused concern for defendants\u2019 safety, such as gunshots, yelling, loud noises or any other signs of commotion coming from the nursery during the previous night. Likewise, he did not report hearing anyone on his own property.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">Salas radioed the dispatcher before they went onto defendants\u2019 property. In her search warrant affidavit Salas said that she advised the dispatcher she would be conducting a \u201cknock and talk\u201d at the nursery for \u201cunknown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>marijuana-related activity.\u201d On cross-examination she admitted telling the dispatcher she and Gossett would be conducting a \u201cknock and talk\u201d regarding \u201can 11358,\u201d referring to Health and Safety Code section 11358, concerning cultivation of marijuana. Salas never reported that she and Gossett were doing a welfare check on the occupants of the nursery.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Nor did she convey to the dispatcher any concern regarding the well-being of the occupants.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">When they arrived at the driveway of the nursery, the detectives encountered a \u201ccattle gate\u201d with a sign announcing the nursery was closed on Monday and Tuesday. October 9, 2001, was a Tuesday. The gate was closed with a chain around it. Salas could not recall if it was locked. The detectives climbed over the gate.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">The detectives walked directly to the house and knocked several times.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> From the porch Salas and Gossett could hear people moving inside. Salas did not testify that she heard any sounds of a disturbance from the porch. She did not relate seeing anything on the property that indicated marijuana cultivation or a theft. Indeed, she did not describe seeing or hearing anything out of the ordinary either before or after she scaled the gate. Although defendant Robert Morton peeked through the curtains of the door, he did not immediately open it. Salas announced, \u201c[Sjheriff\u2019s Department, . . . can we talk to you for a second? Is everybody okay? Who\u2019s home? ... [C]an you come out and talk to us?\u201d The detectives displayed their identification because Morton did not appear to believe they were sheriff\u2019s deputies. Salas said, \u201cHey, we\u2019re just hear to talk to you, make sure everybody is okay, . . . can you come outside and talk to us?\u201d The prosecutor elicited no further testimony from Salas. Salas did not describe Morton as appearing to have been injured or in any distress. Defense counsel did not question Salas regarding her contact with defendant at the door nor did he ask any questions about the detectives\u2019 later entry into the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">Robert Morton eventually came onto the porch after repeated requests by the detectives. Salas ultimately applied for a warrant to search the property. Her sworn statement in support of the application<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> contains the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>description: \u201cWe knocked at the mostly glass front door several times. Shortly thereafter, a white male adult came to the front door. However, he refused to open the door after we had identified ourselves verbally as being with the Sheriff\u2019s Department and shown him our identification and badges. We eventually convinced the subject we were with the Sheriff\u2019s Department and were there to speak with him about the marijuana. The subject opened the door and a heavy odor of marijuana emanated from inside the residence. The subject immediately stepped outside and shut the door behind him. The subject appeared to be nervous and suspicious of our being at his residence. On the subjects [sz'c] clothing were pieces of marijuana leaves and debris.\u201d The detectives asked Morton who else was present and if there were weapons inside. They asked Morton to summon the three others he reported were in the house and he refused to do so. Gossett knocked and announced his presence several times but no one else would come to the door. Salas radioed a request that other officers come to the scene. After assistance arrived, the detectives knocked and announced their presence for another two to three minutes but no one responded. Gossett then opened the front door and stood at the threshold. He announced again and two females came to the door. From the threshold, Gossett could see marijuana being processed. Salas obtained the warrant based on the observations outlined above. Nowhere in the supporting affidavit did Salas mention that she feared for the safety of the occupants, or that she ever asked Morton about his welfare or the safety of the others in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Describing the matter as a \u201cdifficult case and a close case,\u201d the trial court denied the suppression motion. The court ruled that the detectives\u2019 warrant-less entry onto the property was justified under the community caretaker exception. The court stated: \u201cI found it of significance, in looking at a lot of the surrounding circumstances, the fact that the officers went out to this report without radios, without calling for back-up. In other words, they weren\u2019t going in as the SWAT team, set to storm the gates, but went out to investigate this report from a concerned citizen. And then certainly there was evidence that there may have been a marijuana rip off, and at that point had concerns for the folks next door, considering that there had been no activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Following the trial court\u2019s ruling, Robert Morton pled no contest to possession of marijuana for sale and admitted an arming enhancement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>Merideth Morton pled no contest to cultivation of marijuana. Both were placed on three years\u2019 probation and ordered to serve nine months and six months in jail respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">Except in extraordinary circumstances, the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution prohibits government agents from infringing upon a person\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy in the absence of permission or warrant. It is undisputed that the detectives here had neither when they climbed over a closed gate and entered defendants\u2019 property. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Ray </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 464 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 981 P.2d 928], a plurality of our Supreme Court articulated the \u201ccommunity caretaking exception\u201d to the general rule requiring a warrant. Under this exception, \u201ccircumstances short of a perceived emergency may justify a warrantless entry\u201d to preserve life or protect property. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 473.) In <em>Ray </em>Officers Tan and Cary were sent to a residence on Christmas Day after a neighbor reported that \u201cthe door has been open all day and it\u2019s all a shambles inside.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 468.) The officers found the front door standing open about two feet. The front room \u201cappeared to be ransacked as if someone went through it.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>There was no response to the officers\u2019 repeated knocking and loud announcement of their presence. Based on his experience, Cary concluded that there was a \u201c \u201895 percent\u2019 likelihood they had encountered a burglary or similar situation.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Concerned about the welfare of people and property inside, the officers entered and saw a large amount of drugs and money. They touched nothing and opened no doors or containers. Finding no one in the residence, they went outside and called a supervisor. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 468-469.) There was no indication that the officers had ever been to the location, knew who lived there, or suspected any criminal activity to be going on there.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">The <em>Ray </em>plurality drew a sharp distinction between the \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d exception to the warrant requirement and the community caretaking exception. Justice Brown explained that in the case of exigent circumstances, officers enter premises to search for evidence or criminal suspects that the officers have probable cause to believe will be found there. Conversely, the community caretaking exception may <em>only </em>be invoked when officers are not acting to solve a crime. \u201c \u2018[T]he defining characteristic of community caretaking functions is that they are totally unrelated to the criminal investigation duties of the police.\u2019 [Citations.] Upon entering a dwelling, officers view the occupant as a potential victim, not as a potential suspect.\u201d <em>(Ray, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 471.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>The plurality described the applicable standard \u201cunder the community caretaking exception [as] one of reasonableness: Given the known facts, would a prudent and reasonable officer have perceived a need to act in the proper discharge of his or her community caretaking functions?\u201d <em>(Ray, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at pp. 476-477.) Justice Brown went on to point out that, in evaluating whether the officer acted reasonably, weight cannot be given to unparticularized suspicions or \u201chunches\u201d but only to the \u201c \u2018reasonable inferences which [an officer] is entitled to draw from the facts in the light of his experience; in other words, he must be able to point to specific and articulable facts from which he concluded that his action was necessary.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 477.)</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">The lead opinion also notes that \u201ctwo aspects [are] critical to maintaining the essential constitutional balance. First, the authority granted law enforcement is narrowly delimited by the known facts viewed in light of the rationale for the exception.\u201d <em>(Ray, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th at p. 477.) Second, courts must be particularly careful to ensure that officers are not allowed to falsely rely on this exception when their true intention is to seek out criminals or evidence of their conduct. \u201cIn this regard, the trial courts play a vital gatekeeper role, judging not only the credibility of the officers\u2019 testimony but of their motivations. Any intention of engaging in crime-solving activities will defeat the community caretaking exception even in cases of mixed motives. [Citation]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">Thus, in evaluating an assertion of the community caretaking exception the trial court is called upon to make findings of fact and to draw conclusions of law. In terms of the facts, the court must determine what information was available to the officer and whether he believed the action he took was necessary. Here the trial court concluded: \u201c[T]here was evidence that there may have been a marijuana rip[-]off and at that point [the detectives] had concerns for the folks next door . . . .\u201d In extending the benefit of the community caretaking exception, the court inferentially found that the detectives\u2019 belief in the need to enter defendants\u2019 property was totally unrelated to any criminal investigation and that they were not motivated by the desire to engage in crime-solving activity.  In evaluating these factual findings by the trial court, we apply a deferential standard. The power to evaluate witnesses, resolve testimonial conflicts, weigh evidence and draw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>factual inferences reposes with the trial court alone. On appeal, presumptions favor the trial court\u2019s proper exercise of its authority. <em>(People v. Arango </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 450, 452-453 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 629].) Long-standing precedent decrees that we are not empowered to reweigh the evidence, no matter how unpersuasive it may appear on a cold record. (See <em>People v. Ochoa </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1199, 1206 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 23, 864 P.2d 103]; <em>Overton v. Vita-Food Corp. </em>(1949) 94 Cal.App.2d 367, 370 [210 P.2d 757].) Naturally, we abide by that precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">Although our review of factual determinations is deferential, it is not without limit. Factual determinations must be supported by substantial evidence. The court in <em>People v. Marshall </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 1, 31 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 84, 931 P.2d 262], described substantial evidence as that which is \u201creasonable, credible, and of solid value.\u201d Even assuming the detective\u2019s testimony was credible, the evidence supporting the application of the community caretaking exception was neither reasonable nor of solid value.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">The conclusion that \u201cthere was evidence of a marijuana rip off\u2019 was the justification for the detectives\u2019 asserted concern about the safety of defendants\u2019 persons and property. The detectives\u2019 analysis evolved as follows: Two marijuana leaves were found on the neighbor\u2019s side of the fence and a small amount of debris was found on his driveway. The neighbor reported that the marijuana was not his. From these facts, the detectives concluded that the marijuana must have belonged to defendants <em>and </em>that defendants must have been cultivating the drug. Based on a small depression under the fence, the detectives further concluded this marijuana crop must have been stolen during the night. Because drug thefts may involve violence, the detectives concluded that a warrantless entry was required to protect defendants\u2019 life or property. These conclusions fall under the weight of their own faulty reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">The detectives were entitled to rely on the neighbor\u2019s representation that the marijuana found on his property did not belong to him. The further conclusion that the contraband must, perforce, belong to defendants is without support. The neighbor also said he \u201cbelieved\u201d defendants were cultivating marijuana. The record is bereft of a single articulable fact supporting that belief. Just as officers cannot rely on their own hunches or unparticularized suspicions, they cannot rely on those of lay witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">If there was no basis for concluding the marijuana belonged to defendants, much less that they were growing it, the conclusionary leap that there must have been a violent drug theft based upon a small depression below the fence covers too vast an expanse to be reasonable. The ultimate conclusion that a warrantless entry onto defendants\u2019 property was the only reasonable alternative is utterly without support when divorced from the conclusions that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>marijuana on the neighbor\u2019s property belonged to defendants; that, therefore, defendants must have been growing more of it; and that their crop had recently been stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">The detectives\u2019 observation of marijuana in defendant\u2019s house was the basis of the search warrant. Those observations occurred after they entered the nursery property. As the reviewing court we must excise all tainted information from the search warrant but uphold the warrant if the remaining information establishes probable cause. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Weiss </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1073, 1081 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 337, 978 P.2d 1257].)  Probable cause exists when, based on the totality of the circumstances, there is a \u201cfair probability\u201d that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found at a particular location. <em>(Illinois v. Gates </em>(1983) 462 U.S. 213, 236 [76 L.Ed.2d 527, 103 S.Ct. 2317].) Before entering defendants\u2019 property, the detectives saw two marijuana leaves on the neighbor\u2019s fence and marijuana debris in his driveway, and were aware of the neighbor\u2019s \u201cbelief\u2019 that defendants were cultivating the drug. For the reasons we have discussed, these facts do not establish probable cause. Unsupported by probable cause, the search warrant was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-9\">McGuiness, P. J., and Parrilli, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-10\">On January 7, 2004, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b980-9\"> Detective Salas was the People\u2019s only witness at the suppression hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b980-10\"> The court was not asked to accept Salas as an expert in marijuana recognition, nor was any foundation laid to support such a ruling. Her identification of the leaves and debris as marijuana was admitted without objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b980-11\"> We have reviewed the photographs admitted into evidence at the suppression hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b982-7\"> Salas was asked why she did not report that she and Gossett were doing a welfare check of the nursery occupants. Salas responded, \u201c[W]e don\u2019t talk to dispatch like that. I wouldn\u2019t give dispatch a long-winded\u2014we have certain abbreviations that we use to tell them, Hey, we\u2019re going to be out at a location doing an investigation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b982-8\"> Defendants objected to Salas\u2019s testimony regarding her conduct at the door of the residence, stating that it was irrelevant. Defendants maintained that the illegal entry was completed once the detectives climbed over the fence. The court overruled the objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b982-9\"> A certified copy of the search warrant and affidavit were <em>not </em>introduced into evidence at the suppression hearing even though defendants moved to quash the search warrant. Although both the People and defendants cite the search warrant affidavit in their factual summary, no one requested that the record be augmented to include these documents. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>indicated that it had reviewed the moving papers submitted below, which included the search warrant and affidavit attached as an exhibit. Moreover, we presume that the trial court, in ruling on a motion to quash, reviewed the search warrant lodged with the superior court. In view of these circumstances, and in order to expedite the disposition of this appeal, this court on its own motion has augmented the record with a certified copy of the search warrant and affidavit. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 12(a)(1)(A).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b984-7\"> The <em>Ray </em>plurality provided a clarification regarding an officer\u2019s investigatory and non-investigatory capacities: \u201c \u2018When in the context of a possible burglary or breaking and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>entering, the police enter a home or other structure in order to come to the aid of a possibly injured or threatened owner or to protect the property of that owner, they are, in one sense of the term, quite obviously investigating the possibility that a crime has occurred.
