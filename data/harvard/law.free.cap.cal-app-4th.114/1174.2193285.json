J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3cG\">Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company (PG&amp;E) contends the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB) erred when it awarded benefits to respondent Clifford Bryan for work-related psychiatric injury. In analyzing this claim, we must determine whether the circumstances cited by the WCAB constitute \u201cevents of employment\u201d under Labor Code section 3208.3, subdivision (b)(1)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>. We conclude that some of the factors relied on by the WCAB were inappropriate. Employee stress that results from fluctuations in the value of an employer\u2019s stock or from uncertainty about an employer\u2019s future in the face of a downturn in the employer\u2019s business is not a compensable event of employment under the Labor Code. Accordingly, we will annul the WCAB\u2019s decision and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">I. <em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">The tumultuous deregulation of California\u2019s utility industry and the related uncertainty about PG&amp;E\u2019s financial health provide the backdrop for this case. Respondent Bryan had worked for PG&amp;E for over 30 years. He started as a meter reader and eventually became a \u201ccollector.\u201d As a \u201ccollector\u201d he went to the homes of delinquent customers to either collect money or turn off the gas and electric service. In the course of 13 years in this \u201cthankless job\u201d Bryan was \u201cdog-bitten, cursed at, chased out, [had] rocks thrown at [him], guns shoved in [his] chest, [and] called everything you can imagine.\u201d Nonetheless, Bryan said he \u201cloved that job\u201d because he \u201ccould walk away from it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-7\">In 1998, Bryan\u2019s job was eliminated, and he \u201cwas told [PG&amp;E] would find a job for him in the office.\u201d Bryan and another \u201cdownsized\u201d collector bid on two available customer service jobs, one working at a front counter in a local PG&amp;E office, and the other in a back office doing paperwork. The other employee with greater seniority took the back office job; Bryan took the job at the front counter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-8\">Bryan\u2019s new job was also stressful. He worked in a small room serving customers who \u201cdid not like the company.\u201d He was \u201cout there every day listening to abusive comments.\u201d The \u201csmell was atrocious.\u201d Some customers would even threaten violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-9\">The stress level in Bryan\u2019s work environment worsened in 2000, \u201cwhen the company started to downsize.\u201d The \u201cstate was going through a period of brownouts and blackouts and the company was going into serious debt. There was an increase in customers and in customer complaints. The general public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>[Bryan] dealt with thought that it was a big scam and that PG&amp;E manipulated the rates and the product market.\u201d In 2000, Bryan started having chest pains, for which he sought medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">The pressure on Bryan increased yet again when PG&amp;E \u201cfiled Chapter 11 bankruptcy April 6, 2001. [Bryan] was concerned, as were all PG&amp;E employees, when the bankruptcy was filed. He had savings in stock in the company. He had all his stock in PG&amp;E from the day he was eligible to buy PG&amp;E stock. In April 2001 ... he had approximately $200,000 in PG&amp;E stock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">The pressure on Bryan became so great that he was forced to leave work on October 5, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-8\">PG&amp;E sent Bryan to Dr. Brian Jacks for a psychiatric evaluation. Dr. Jacks said Bryan was experiencing a \u201ctransient situational disturbance.\u201d He said there was \u201cvery little significant history ... of work stress\u201d and that the stress that did exist \u201cmight be considered a routine personnel matter.\u201d Dr. Jacks attributed Bryan\u2019s problems to \u201cpersonal non-industrial stressors\u201d including the fact that Bryan had a hernia, that he was a recovering alcoholic, that his father had died recently, and that his daughter had medical problems. Dr. Jacks estimated that 35 to 40 percent of Bryan\u2019s emotional difficulties were caused by his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-9\">The applicant\u2019s physician who evaluated Bryan, Dr. Allen Enelow, disagreed with Dr. Jacks in virtually every respect. He said Bryan was suffering from \u201cmajor depressive disorder\u201d and that he was \u201ctemporarily totally disabled.\u201d Dr. Enelow believed the condition was \u201centirely industrial\u201d and said he could find \u201cno evidence for apportionment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-10\">These differing conclusions were weighed by a workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) who ruled Bryan was not entitled to benefits because work stress was not the predominant cause of his psychiatric injury within the meaning of section 3208.3, subdivision (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-11\">Bryan filed a petition for reconsideration. The WCAB granted the petition and ruled Bryan was entitled to benefits. According to the Board \u201cthe downsizing of [Bryan\u2019s] employer . . . [Bryan\u2019s] daily interactions with irate PG&amp;E customers, the loss of the value of [Bryan\u2019s] PG&amp;E stock, and [Bryan\u2019s] concern about the future of PG&amp;E and his retirement funds, were all actual events of employment that were predominant as to all causes of [Bryan\u2019s] psychiatric injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-12\">A dissenting board member disagreed. He thought Dr. Jacks\u2019s evaluation was more persuasive and that \u201c[t]he record simply [did] not reflect that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>[Bryan\u2019s] employment was the <em>predominant </em>cause of his psychic distress.\u201d The dissenting board member also said the fact that Bryan sustained a loss because he owned stock in a company that happened to be his employer was not an \u201cactual event\u201d of Bryan\u2019s employment that could support an award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">PG&amp;E\u2019s petition for writ of review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">PG&amp;E contends the WCAB interpreted section 3208.3, subdivision (b)(1) incorrectly when it awarded Bryan benefits for psychiatric injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-7\">The principles which guide our analysis are well settled. \u201cAlthough the WCAB\u2019s findings on questions of fact are conclusive (\u00a7 5953), the construction of a statute and its applicability to a given situation are matters of law that are reviewable by the courts.\u201d <em>(Rex Club v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1465, 1470-1471 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 393].) \u201cThe [WCAB\u2019s] administrative construction of statutes that it is charged to enforce and interpret is entitled to great weight unless it is clearly erroneous. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ralphs Grocery Co. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 820, 828 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 197].) \u201cAn erroneous interpretation or application of law by the WCAB is a ground for annulment of [its] decision. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Rex Club v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>53 Cal.App.4th at p. 1471; see also <em>Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 1237, 1241 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 865].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-8\">A reviewing court\u2019s \u201cfirst task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. In determining such intent, a court must look first to the words of the statute themselves, giving to the language its usual, ordinary import and according significance ... to every word, phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1386-1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323].) \u201cWhere uncertainty exists consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1387.) \u201cBoth the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1118-9\">\u201c[S]ection 3208.3 was enacted as part of the Margolin-Greene Workers\u2019 Compensation Reform Act of 1989. It is part of the Legislature\u2019s response to increased public concern about the high cost of workers\u2019 compensation coverage, limited benefits for injured workers, suspected fraud and widespread abuses in the system, and particularly the proliferation of workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>compensation cases with claims for psychiatric injuries.\u201d <em>(Hansen v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Bd. </em>(1993) 18 Cal.App.4th 1179, 1183-1184 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 30], fn. omitted.) As originally enacted, subdivision (b) of the statute provided, \u201cIn order to establish that a psychiatric injury is compensable, an employee shall demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that actual events of employment were responsible for at least 10 percent of the total causation from all sources contributing to the psychiatric injury.\u201d (Stats. 1989, ch. 892, \u00a7 25, p. 3003.) However, in 1993 the Legislature amended section 3208.3, subdivision (b)(1) to impose a significantly higher quantum of proof to establish that a psychiatric injury is compensable. The section now states, \u201cIn order to establish that a psychiatric injury is compensable, an employee shall demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that actual events of employment were predominant as to all causes combined of the psychiatric injury.\u201d This language has been interpreted to mean that benefits under section 3208.3, subdivision (b)(1) may be awarded only when industrial factors account for more than 50 percent of a psychiatric disability. <em>(Department of Corrections v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 810, 816 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 716].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-6\">Section 3208.3, subdivision (c) underscores the Legislature\u2019s intent that claims seeking benefits based on psychiatric injuries be evaluated strictly. It states, \u201cIt is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this section to establish a new and higher threshold of compensability for psychiatric injury under this division.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-7\">The question we must decide in this case is whether the factors cited by the WCAB are properly characterized as \u201cevents of employment\u201d within the meaning of section 3208.3, subdivision (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-8\">The statutory language indicates that two conditions must be satisfied before a particular factor can support an award of benefits under section 3208.3, subdivision (b)(1). First, the factor must be an \u201cevent\u201d; i.e., it must be \u201csomething that takes place\u201d (American Heritage Dict. (4th ed. 2000) p. 616) in the employment relationship. Second, the event must be \u201cof employment\u201d; i.e., it must arise out of an employee\u2019s working relationship with his or her employer. As we will explain, potential stress factors that arise from broad societal events or trends do not satisfy this requirement of section 3208.3 subdivision (b)(1) because they cannot reasonably be said to be events which arise out of the employment relationship.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>Third, the language and legislative history of section 3208.3 instruct that the Legislature\u2019s public policy goals should be considered when determining whether an award of benefits is warranted. The Legislature made quite clear that it intended to <em>limit </em>claims for psychiatric benefits due to their proliferation and their potential for fraud and abuse. Therefore, any interpretation of the section that would lead to more or broader claims should be examined closely to avoid violating express legislative intent. <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1387.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the four specific factors cited by the WCAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\">First the WCAB ruled Bryan was entitled to benefits because PG&amp;E was \u201cdownsizing.\u201d Generalized anxiety over one\u2019s future in a company struggling to survive during difficult economic times does not fall within the language of section 3208.3, subdivision (b)(1) because it is not a discrete \u201cevent\u201d that takes place in the employment relationship. Similarly, fear of job loss due to management strategies to achieve increased profitabilty, such as \u201coutsourcing\u201d of jobs to an overseas workforce, cannot support a compensable claim under section 3208.3. More fundamentally, we conclude corporate downsizing, without more, cannot reasonably support an award of benefits because it is so broad; arguably, all employees who work for a troubled company experience stress. Allowing employees to recover benefits for psychiatric injuries caused by this type of stress would subject employers to virtually unlimited liability. We decline to adopt an interpretation of the section that would so clearly contravene the Legislature\u2019s express public policy goal of reducing the cost to the workers\u2019 compensation system by reducing the amount of compensable psychiatric injuries. (See \u00a7 3208.3, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-6\">The second factor, the fact that Bryan\u2019s new assignment required him to interact with irate customers on a daily basis, resulted from the elimination of his prior position by the corporate downsizing. Despite the apparent contradiction, we conclude, nonetheless, the WCAB could validly rely on this factor. According to the record, because PG&amp;E was downsizing, Bryan was forced to look for another job with the company. The job he selected, working at the front counter of a local PG&amp;E office, turned out to be an extraordinarily stressful position. While still working, Bryan first sought medical care for his chest pain in 2000, when customer-counter work started to change with an increase in customer complaints. As the state experienced power brownouts and blackouts in the summer of 2001, the \u201cpublic [Bryan] dealt with thought that it was a big scam and that PG&amp;E manipulated the rates . . .\u201d Bryan left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>PG&amp;E permanently in October 2001. The WCAB could reasonably conclude that Bryan\u2019s confrontations with angry, threatening or deceitful customers packed in large numbers in a confining small office caused him specific and identifiable work-related stress. Unlike corporate \u201cdownsizing,\u201d these stresses were a direct consequence of Bryan\u2019s new work assignment, an event of his particular employment, and a compensable cause of his psychic injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">We reach a different conclusion with respect to the third factor: Bryan\u2019s stock losses. According to the record, Bryan <em>voluntarily </em>invested his retirement funds in PG&amp;E stock, believing it was in his best interests to do so. There is no evidence that Bryan was <em>obligated </em>under the terms of his employment to invest his retirement funds that way; nor is there evidence of an employer incentive to invest in PG&amp;E stock. His investment loss was no different from that experienced by the general investing public. We conclude Bryan\u2019s personal decision to invest in PG&amp;E stock, and the fact that the stock later lost value, were not \u201cevents of employment\u201d that could validly support an award of benefits for psychiatric injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-7\">The fourth factor, Bryan\u2019s concern over \u201cthe future of PG&amp;E\u201d and his \u201cretirement funds,\u201d describes related circumstances, neither of which was a proper factor under section 3208.3 subdivision (b)(1). The former\u2014anxiety over \u201cthe future of PG&amp;E\u201d\u2014implies a feared loss of job security. This factor cannot validly support an award of benefits because it was not a circumstance peculiar to Bryan\u2019s work experience, but would have been common to all PG&amp;E employees. The latter\u2014concern over retirement fund stability and value\u2014could not validly support an award because, as we have said, Bryan\u2019s personal decision to invest his retirement funds in PG&amp;E stock was not an employment event. Moreover, reliance on these circumstances undermines the legislative goal of restricting compensable psychiatric claims by inviting claims from any employee who suffers or fears a lay-off in economically uncertain times, or from any employee who has incurred a real or paper loss in an investment in employer-issued stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-8\">Having concluded the WCAB improperly relied on certain factors when making its decision, we turn to the issue of prejudice. The question is whether it is reasonably probable PG&amp;E would have obtained a more favorable result absent the error identified. (Cf. <em>Redner </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 83, 93, fn. 11 [95 Cal.Rptr. 447, 485 P.2d 799]; <em>Beverly Hills Multispecialty Group, Inc. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 789, 806 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 293].) We conclude that the answer is yes. Benefits under section 3208.3, subdivision (b)(1) may be awarded only when industrial factors account for more than 50 percent of a psychiatric disability. <em>(Department of Corrections v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th at p. 816.) The Legislature has made quite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>clear that claims for benefits of this type must be evaluated under strict and exacting standards. (See \u00a7 3208.3, subd. (c).) Here, three of the four factors upon which the WCAB relied were invalid. Those factors appear to have been central to the board\u2019s decision.  Under these circumstances, we conclude it is reasonably probable the WCAB would have reached a different result absent the error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">III. DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">The ruling of the WCAB is annulled.
