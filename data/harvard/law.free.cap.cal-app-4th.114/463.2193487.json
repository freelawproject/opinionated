He was charged with two counts of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated (Pen. Code, \u00a7 191.5, subd. (a)) and one count of causing injury while driving under the influence of drugs (Veh. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Code, \u00a7 23153, subd. (a)). Multiple-victim enhancements (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23558) and great bodily injury enhancements (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a)) were alleged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Proceedings were suspended and defendant was found not competent to stand trial. (\u00a7 1368.) Following evaluations and a hearing, he was placed at Porterville Developmental Center (Porterville) for 180 days pursuant to sections 1600 and 1601, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">On appeal, defendant contends (1) the statutory scheme for the developmentally disabled does not require a 180-day period of treatment in a locked facility such as Porterville, and (2) if the scheme does require confinement, it is constitutionally unreasonable pursuant to <em>Jackson v. Indiana </em>(1972) 406 U.S. 715 [32 L.Ed.2d 435, 92 S.Ct. 1845] <em>(Jackson). </em>We shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">In the fatal collision on April 15, 2001, defendant suffered two broken legs, two crushed feet, five broken ribs, a collapsed lung, and a severe head injury. He was flown to a trauma hospital while unconscious and underwent surgery to repair damage to his face. Defendant tested positive for marijuana and methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">A first amended complaint was filed in June 2001. Criminal proceedings were suspended and a psychologist was appointed to evaluate defendant\u2019s competency. (\u00a7 1368.) Because of his developmental disability, defendant requested an evaluation by the director of Alta California Regional Center (ACRC), where he was a client. (\u00a7 1369.) The appointment of the psychologist was rescinded and ACRC was appointed to evaluate defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">Eugene P. Roeder, Ph.D., performed the evaluation and concluded that defendant \u201cis not competent to stand trial at the present time, and it is not likely that he has the capacity to become trial competent.\u201d Dr. Roeder noted that defendant has had \u201ca developmental disability from birth,\u201d and the automobile accident \u201cfurther impaired his cognitive capacity and ability to function independently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">In January 2002 defendant waived a jury trial on the issue of competency and the matter was submitted for a court trial based on Dr. Roeder\u2019s report. Criminal proceedings were suspended and defendant was referred to ACRC for a placement report. (\u00a7 1370, subd. (a)(2).) In February 2002 ACRC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>recommended that defendant be placed at his mother\u2019s home for competency training, support, and care. (\u00a7 1370.1, subd. (a)(1)(B)(i).)</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">The prosecutor petitioned for a hearing on defendant\u2019s placement, arguing his \u201ccriminal history\u201d raised an issue whether he presents \u201ca danger to the health or safety of others.\u201d The trial court granted this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">In March 2002 ACRC reported that defendant\u2019s \u201ccriminal history\u201d predated the automobile accident. The accident greatly diminished his intellectual functioning and effectively precluded him from engaging in further \u201cdangerous behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The prosecution requested a second expert opinion on this issue from Sidney Nelson, Ph.D. In November 2002 Dr. Nelson found that before the automobile accident, defendant was mildly retarded; the accident reduced his intellectual abilities to the moderate range of mental retardation. Dr. Nelson agreed that defendant could appropriately be maintained at his mother\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">In December 2002 the prosecution filed points and authorities arguing that before defendant could be placed in an outpatient setting with his mother, he had to be placed in a state hospital for 180 days. (\u00a7\u00a7 1600, 1601.) In January 2003 defendant filed points and authorities claiming the 180-day requirement did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">At the January 24, 2003, placement hearing, the defense submitted on the basis of ACRC\u2019s reports from February 2002 and March 2002. However, after the trial court noted that the most recent report was almost a year old, the defense called Laurie Casella, the reports\u2019 author, to provide more current information.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">Casella testified that when a request for a placement recommendation is received, an ACRC team consisting of a psychologist, a physician, a nurse, a supervisor, and a service coordinator considers a client\u2019s psychiatric history, current medical needs, and information from retained experts to determine an appropriate placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">In this case, all the professionals agreed that defendant would benefit from outpatient treatment and was not a danger to the health and safety of others. The team determined that defendant\u2019s intellectual functioning had diminished considerably since the accident due to \u201cextensive injuries, including brain trauma.\u201d The team decided the \u201cbest and safest place\u201d for defendant was with his mother, because his \u201cneeds had drastically changed,\u201d in that he \u201crequired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>more care from his mother than he had in the past,\u201d and there was \u201cno danger from him being out in the community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Casella explained that defendant\u2019s needs were not such that he would require a group home or other facility. She classified defendant\u2019s placement in his mother\u2019s home to be \u201coutpatient\u201d rather than \u201cinpatient\u201d because the home is not a licensed facility. However, ACRC recognizes the mother\u2019s home as a \u201cresidential facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Since the March 2002 report, ACRC had continued to treat defendant. The treatment included random alcohol and drug testing at least once a month; all tests were negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The ACRC team considered the report by the prosecution expert, Dr. Nelson. Dr. Nelson recommended that defendant continue treatment with ACRC, and that he remain placed with his mother. Dr. Nelson agreed that defendant was not a danger to the health and safety of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Regarding Dr. Nelson\u2019s notation in his report that defendant had consumed two beers sometime between April 2001 and November 2002, Casella testified she later advised defendant\u2019s mother that he cannot consume any alcohol and that she cannot have alcohol in the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Regarding Dr. Nelson\u2019s notation that defendant had ridden a bicycle for short distances, Casella explained that his riding is limited because of pain. Casella did not believe defendant could or would drive a car, so long as he was properly supervised. The ACRC team favored placement with defendant\u2019s mother, rather than a group home, because he \u201chas the best chances of responding appropriately with somebody he trusts and knows.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">At the conclusion of the placement hearing, the trial court ordered defendant confined for 180 days, but the court stayed the order until February 7, 2003, and allowed defendant to remain on bail. ACRC was directed to make a recommendation as to an appropriate locked facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">On February 7, 2003, the trial court received another ACRC report, recommending against a 180-day placement in a locked facility and in favor of placement in the mother\u2019s home. However, since locked placement had been ordered, ACRC recommended placement at Porterville. At a hearing that day, the court again stayed its locked facility placement order.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">In late February, the trial court received another ACRC report and a Delta Regional Project report that concurred with the ACRC recommendations. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>February 28, 2003, the court ordered defendant placed at Porterville for 180 days but allowed him to remain on bail until a bed became available.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">We first consider defendant\u2019s contention that the statutory scheme for the developmentally disabled does not require a minimum period of treatment in a locked facility. The contention has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Section 1370.1 provides that if the defendant is developmentally disabled and found mentally incompetent, \u201cthe trial or judgment shall be suspended until the defendant becomes mentally competent.\u201d (\u00a7 1370.1, subd. (a)(1)(B).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this case, several experts found defendant to be moderately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>mentally retarded with an IQ of about 52. The experts also found him incompetent to stand trial. Thus, criminal proceedings were properly suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Section 1370.1, subdivision (a)(1)(E) provides: \u201cA defendant charged with a violent felony may not be placed in a facility or delivered to a state hospital, developmental center, or residential facility pursuant to this subdivision unless the facility, state hospital, developmental center, or residential facility has a secured perimeter or a locked and controlled treatment facility, and the judge determines that the public safety will be protected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Section. 1370.1 defines a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as an offense listed in section 667.5, subdivision (c). (\u00a7 1370.1, subd. (a)(1)(F).) Among the listed offenses is \u201c[a]ny felony in which the defendant inflicts great bodily injury on any person other than an accomplice . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (c)(8).)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Defendant\u2019s offenses were violent felonies because the operative complaint alleged that he inflicted great bodily injury upon all three victims. Thus, defendant could not be <em>placed </em>in a residential facility (i.e., as an inpatient) unless it had a secured perimeter or a locked and controlled treatment facility, which his mother\u2019s residence does not have.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Although defendant could not be placed as an inpatient at his mother\u2019s residence, he could reside there as an outpatient once certain conditions were satisfied. Section 1370.1, subdivision (a)(1)(G) provides: \u201cA defendant charged with a violent felony may be placed on outpatient status, <em>as specified in Section 1370.4 or 1600, </em>only if the court finds that the placement will not pose a danger to the health or safety of others.\u201d (Italics added.) Having found that \u201cthere has been a year and a half of no indication he\u2019s been a danger or done anything dangerous or injurious to anyone,\u201d the trial court was authorized to consider placing defendant on outpatient status at his mother\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Section 1370.4 establishes the conditions in which a trial court may order outpatient treatment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The statute provides in relevant part: \u201cAll of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>provisions of Title 15 (commencing with Section 1600) of Part 2 shall apply-where a defendant is placed on outpatient status under this section . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Section 1601, subdivision (a) states in relevant part: \u201cIn the case of any person charged with and found incompetent on a charge of . . . any felony involving death [or] great bodily injury, . . . outpatient status under this title shall not be available until that person has actually been confined in a state hospital or other facility for 180 days or more after having been committed under the provisions of law specified in Section 1600.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The trial court correctly noted that Penal Code section 1601, subdivision (a) uses the word \u201cshall,\u201d a mandatory term. Contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, the mandatory nature of this command is not lessened by the statute\u2019s reference to commitments under \u201cthe provisions of law specified in [Penal Code] Section 1600.\u201d Those \u201cprovisions\u201d are the statutory schemes for pleas of not guilty by reason of insanity (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1026), inquiry into competence to stand trial (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1367), and mentally disordered sex offenders (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6316, 6321). None of those provisions creates an exception to the statutory requirement of confinement for 180 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Section 1600 provides that \u201ca developmentally disabled person may be placed on outpatient status from that commitment under the provisions of this title as modified by Section 1370.4.\u201d Section 1370.4, in turn, makes the following modifications: \u201cthe regional center director shall be substituted for the community program director, the Director of Developmental Services for the Director of Mental Health, and a residential facility for a treatment facility for the purposes of this section.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Thus, sections 1370.4 and 1601 together provide that \u201coutpatient status . . . shall not be available\u201d for \u201ca developmentally disabled person\u201d \u201ccharged with and found incompetent on a charge of\u2019 a \u201cfelony involving death\u201d until the person \u201chas actually been confined in\u201d a \u201cresidential facility\u201d for \u201c180 days.\u201d Because defendant was charged with a violent felony, that confinement must be in a residential facility with a \u201csecured perimeter or a locked andcontrolled treatment facility.\u201d (\u00a7 1370.1, subd. (a)(1)(E).) Defendant has not yet satisfied this prerequisite to outpatient status because he has not been confined in a residential facility with a secured perimeter or a locked and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>controlled treatment facility. Although ACRC considers defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s home to be a \u201cresidential facility\u201d for its own purposes, it is not the sort of facility in which defendant must be confined for 180 days <em>prior to </em>placement on \u201coutpatient status.\u201d The trial court properly determined that the statutory scheme requires a minimum period of confinement at a residential facility with a secured perimeter or a locked and controlled treatment facility. However, for reasons we next explain, that period may be less than 180 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Defendant contends the statutorily mandated period of confinement is not constitutional where, as here, the defendant is not dangerous and his competency cannot be restored during the confinement period. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Defendant\u2019s constitutional contention is based on <em>Jackson, supra, </em>406 U.S. 715, in which the United States Supreme Court \u201cadopted the so-called \u2018rule of reasonableness\u2019 of the lower federal courts [citations], and declared: \u2018We hold, consequently, that a person charged by a State with a criminal offense who is committed solely on account of his incapacity to proceed to trial cannot be held more than <em>the reasonable period of time necessary to determine </em>whether there is a substantial probability that he will attain that capacity in the foreseeable future. If it is determined that this is not the case, then the State must either institute the customary civil commitment proceeding that would be required to commit indefinitely any other citizen, or release the defendant. [Fn. omitted.] Furthermore, even if it is determined that the defendant probably soon will be able to stand trial, his continued commitment must be justified by progress toward that goal. In light of differing state facilities and procedures and a lack of evidence in this record, we do not think it appropriate for us to attempt to prescribe arbitrary time limits.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Davis </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 798, 804 [106 Cal.Rptr. 178, 505 P.2d 1018] <em>(Davis), </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">In <em>Davis, </em>the California Supreme Court adopted <em>Jackson\u2019s </em>\u201crule of reasonableness,\u201d \u201cin order to comply with the constitutional principles which controlled that case.\u201d <em>(Davis, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at p. 805.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">To bring the incompetency commitment procedure into conformity with the <em>Jackson-Davis </em>guidelines, the Legislature amended the relevant provisions of the Penal Code and the Welfare and Institutions Code. <em>(Hale v. Superior Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 221, 225-226 [124 Cal.Rptr. 57, 539 P.2d 817]; <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number><em>Polk </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1230, 1236-1237 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d <em>389](Polk).) </em>Two of these provisions are especially relevant here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Within 90 days of a commitment, the facility director or a designee must make a written report to the committing court and the regional center concerning the defendant\u2019s progress toward becoming mentally competent. (\u00a7 1370.1, subd. (b)(1); cf. \u00a7 1370, subd. (b)(1).) If the report discloses <em>no </em>\u201csubstantial likelihood the defendant will become mentally competent within the next 90 days,\u201d and \u201cindicates that there is no substantial likelihood that the defendant has become mentally competent,\u201d then the committing court must order the defendant returned to court for civil commitment proceedings. (\u00a7 1370.1, subds. (b)(1), (c)(2); cf. \u00a7 1370, subds. (b)(1), (c)(2); see <em>Polk, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th at p. 1237.)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Defendant contends he \u201ccannot be restored to competency based upon his mental retardation,\u201d which was made more severe by the automobile accident that \u201cdecreased his I.Q. from the high 60s to the low 50s.\u201d If defendant is correct, the 90-day report will indicate that he has not become competent and is not likely to become competent within the next 90 days. That would trigger a referral for civil commitment proceedings prior to the expiration of the 180-day confinement period that is prerequisite to outpatient treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Defendant effectively contends that even a 90-day commitment is too long because various experts have already evaluated his mental condition and all have reached the same conclusion. However, the Legislature, in its considered judgment, has determined that persons accused of violent felonies must undergo an initial period of evaluation in a residential facility with a secured perimeter or a locked and controlled treatment facility. (\u00a7 1370.1, subd. (a)(1)(E).) Although the experts have forecast that defendant\u2019s condition will not improve, the Legislature could rationally favor experience over prognostication and require a short period of actual confinement in the controlled environment of a secure facility. Nothing in <em>Jackson </em>suggests the Legislature\u2019s determination is constitutionally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Davis, Acting P.
