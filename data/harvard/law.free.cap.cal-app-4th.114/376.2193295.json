J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1c\">Kathleen Hernandez, the family of Ashlee Hernandez and Rochelle Ramos filed a lawsuit<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) after Ramos and Kathleen Hernandez were injured and Ashlee Hernandez was killed in an automobile accident at the Lower Azusa Road off-ramp on the Interstate 605 freeway. They contend the lack of a guardrail at the accident location constituted a dangerous condition of public property. The trial court granted Caltrans\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding the action was barred by statutory design immunity as a matter of law. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">According to the undisputed facts presented in connection with Caltrans\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the accident at issue in this case occurred on September 10, 1999. Plaintiffs were passengers in a Toyota Camry driven by Melinda Martinez. The Camry was pursued by a Kia driven by Ramos\u2019s former boyfriend Raul Contreras, Jr. The Kia chased the Camry from surface <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>streets in West Covina to the Interstate 10 freeway and then to the northbound Interstate 605 freeway. The cars were traveling at a high speed when Contreras intentionally rammed the Camry. Frightened, Martinez attempted to exit the freeway at the Lower Azusa Road off-ramp, with Contreras still in pur suit. The Camry, which was then traveling at 75 to 80 miles per hour, struck a Dodge Caravan and skidded off the roadway and down an embankment. Ashlee Hernandez was killed; Kathleen Hernandez was rendered paraplegic; and Ramos allegedly suffered brain injuries.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hernandez sued Caltrans, alleging the lack of a guardrail at the site of the accident constituted a dangerous condition of public property pursuant to Government Code section 835.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Caltrans moved for summary judgment (the motion) on four grounds: (1) It could not be liable because it had no duty to protect Hernandez against the unforeseeable criminal acts of Contreras; (2) Hernandez could not establish \u201cdangerous condition\u201d liability as a matter of law because the off-ramp was not being used with due care and in a reasonably foreseeable manner when the accident occurred; (3) Hernandez could not prove Caltrans had either actual or constructive notice of any dangerous condition at the accident site; and (4) Caltrans had an absolute defense to the action based on the design immunity provisions of Government Code section 830.6.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Hernandez opposed the motion, arguing (1) although Caltrans owed no duty to protect her from the unforeseeable criminal acts of third parties, it owed a duty to prevent dangerous conditions of public property such as that allegedly existing at the accident site; (2) the existence of a dangerous condition at the off-ramp is a question of fact that, based on the conflicting evidence presented by the parties, cannot be resolved on summary judgment; (3) Caltrans had evidence of three previous \u201crun-off-the-road\u201d accidents near the accident site within the 18 months preceding the accident; and (4) triable issues of fact existed as to the applicability of the design immunity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">With respect to the discretionary approval element of Caltrans\u2019s design immunity affirmative defense, with its summary judgment motion Caltrans presented evidence that the off-ramp at issue was part of a construction project designed in the late 1960\u2019s and completed in May 1971. The off-ramp was built as designed without guardrails at the location where the Martinez car left the roadway. The design plan shows the existence of the embankment, its approximate height and slope and the locations where guardrails were to be placed\u2014a total of 875 feet of guardrail along the 1575-foot ramp, 600 feet of railing at the top of the ramp and 275 feet at the bottom. Caltrans also produced the certified \u201cas-built\u201d plans signed by officials with authority to approve them. Caltrans\u2019s expert testified to the normal approval process utilized by Caltrans when the project was designed and opined that the signatures on the as-built plans indicate that the individuals who signed had approved the design contained in the plans prior to construction of the off-ramp.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">In opposition Hernandez presented evidence that the off-ramp as designed violated Caltrans\u2019s then applicable guardrail-installation guidelines, which, according to Hernandez\u2019s expert, required installation of an embankment guardrail along the entirety of the ramp under the analysis prescribed by the state\u2019s \u201cguardrail need determination curve.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Any deviation from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>applicable guidelines required the designer to obtain formal approval, which would be recorded in a \u201cproject approval document.\u201d Hernandez noted (and Caltrans did not dispute) that no \u201cproject approval document\u201d for the off-ramp could be located. At his deposition Caltrans\u2019s expert acknowledged that he did not know whether any of the three engineers who signed the as-built plans actually considered the guardrail installation guidelines and approved the purported deviation from the guidelines\u2019 requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">At a hearing on December 4, 2001, the trial court found triable issues of fact existed as to the presence of a dangerous condition at the site of the accident. In a memorandum of decision dated January 26, 2002, however, the trial court granted Caltrans\u2019s motion on the ground of design immunity. It ruled that, in order to establish design immunity on summary judgment, Caltrans was required to show substantial evidence of (a) discretionary approval of the design for the off-ramp and (b) reasonableness of the design. It found Caltrans had met that burden, concluding that, \u201c[wjhile the inference made from the absence of guardrails is not strong enough to amount to \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 that someone must have evaluated the situation and exercised discretion with respect to the need for guardrails, the presence of guardrails on the plans [at the top and bottom of the off-ramp, but not at the location of the accident,] is \u2018substantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d The court rejected Hernandez\u2019s argument that the design violated the state\u2019s guardrail guidelines and the required approval for such a deviation had not been proved, finding from the evidence presented \u201cthat the plans cannot be said to not conform to state standards for guardrails . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court also found there was insufficient evidence, as a matter of law, of changed circumstances that would cause the design immunity to be lost. Judgment was entered in favor of Caltrans.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Hernandez contends the trial court erred in holding the discretionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>approval element of the design immunity defense is a question of law for the court and granting summary judgment based on substantial evidence of discretionary approval when that evidence was disputed by other evidence and inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The standard of review on appeal after an order granting summary judgment is well settled. \u201cA trial court properly grants summary judgment where no triable issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c).) We review the trial court\u2019s decision de novo, considering all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion (except that which the court properly excluded) and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports. <em>(Artiglio v. Coming Inc. </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 604, 612 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 479, 957 P.2d 1313].) In the trial court, once a moving defendant has \u2018shown that one or more elements of the cause of action, even if not separately pleaded, cannot be established,\u2019 the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show the existence of a triable issue; to meet that burden, the plaintiff \u2018may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings . . . but, instead, shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action . . . .\u2019 (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(2); see <em>Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 854-855 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 841, 24 P.3d 493].)\u201d <em>(Merrill </em>v. <em>Navegar, Inc. </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 465, 476-477 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 28 P.3d 116].)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">In reviewing the evidence, we strictly construe the moving party\u2019s evidence and liberally construe the opposing party\u2019s and accept as undisputed only those portions of the moving party\u2019s evidence that are uncontradicted. \u201cOnly when the inferences are indisputable may the court decide the issues as a matter of law. If the evidence is in conflict, the factual issues must be resolved by trial. \u2018Any doubts about the propriety of summary judgment. . . are generally resolved <em>against </em>granting the motion, because that allows the future development of the case and avoids errors.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Binder v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>(1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 832, 839 [89 Cal.Rptr.2d 540]; see also <em>Katz v. Chevron Corp. </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1352, 1365 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 681] [\u201cdoubts as to the propriety of granting the motion should be resolved in favor of the opposing party\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>2. <em>The Trial Court Erred in Granting Summary Judgment Based on Design Immunity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">\u201cThe State is not liable for a defect in the design plan for a public improvement if it can establish the three elements that constitute the design immunity affirmative defense. The State must show: (1) a causal relationship between the project design and the accident; (2) discretionary approval of the design prior to construction; and (3) substantial evidence supporting the reasonableness of the design. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Alvarez v. State of California </em>(1999) 79 Cal.App.4th 720, 727 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 719] <em>(Alvarez); Cornette v. Department of Transportation </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 63, 69 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 26 P.3d 332] <em>(Cornette); </em>see also Gov. Code, \u00a7 830.6.) The parties do not dispute the existence of the first and third elements for purposes of the motion. Relying on established rules governing summary judgment, Hernandez contends Caltrans failed to establish the absence of triable issues of material fact with respect to the second element. Caltrans, on the other hand, contends all elements of design immunity are legal issues for the court and its only burden was to show substantial evidence there was discretionary approval of the off-ramp plans prior to construction. The trial court agreed with Caltrans. We do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In its memorandum of decision the trial court extensively discussed two Court of Appeal decisions: <em>Alvarez, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th 720, in which the court affirmed a summary judgment based on the design immunity defense; and <em>Levin v. State of California </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 410 [194 Cal.Rptr. 223] <em>(Levin), </em>in which the court reversed such a summary judgment. Hernandez contends, and we agree, that the trial court erred in following <em>Alvarez </em>and failing to apply the rationale of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cornette, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th 63, which recognized that the second element of the design immunity defense is a question of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">a. <em>Alvarez </em>v. <em>State of California</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Both in the trial court and on appeal Caltrans has relied on <em>Alvarez, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th 720, in which the Fifth District affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the ground of design immunity, holding that \u201c[w]hether each element of design immunity exists is a question of law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 728.) In <em>Alvarez </em>the plaintiff contended the lack of a median barrier on State Route 99 constituted a dangerous condition. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 727.) The state moved for summary judgment based on design immunity. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In support of the second element of the design immunity defense, the state presented a copy of the \u201cas built plans\u201d for the project in question and \u201cthe declarations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>of former and current Caltrans employees [describing] the discretionary approval process for roadway designs in general and for the Project in particular . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 728.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The plaintiff contended the state\u2019s evidence was insufficient to meet its burden of establishing \u201cthat the dangerous feature of the design was approved by an \u2018employee exercising discretionary authority to give such approval.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Alvarez, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th at p. 728.) The court, however, held that the \u201c[as-built] plans themselves provide evidence that the Project design was given the requisite discretionary approval prior to construction.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 725.) The court rejected the contention that discretionary approval can be proved only by testimony from the person who signed the documents or someone who was present when they were signed. It held that expert testimony was admissible to prove the state\u2019s \u201cdiscretionary approval custom and practice.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 732 [\u201cAs an expert, Berner could competently testify to the State\u2019s custom and practice of discretionary design review and approval during the relevant time period. He could competently interpret and explain the Project plans, identify the officials involved the review and approval process at the district and state level, and explain their role in the discretionary approval process even though he was not personally involved in the Project\u2019s approval.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">In affirming the trial court\u2019s order granting summary judgment, the Court of Appeal concluded: \u201cIn summary, the Project plans indicate the design was approved prior to construction by at least four State officials whose stated capacities indicate they had the discretionary authority to approve the plans. The evidence, coupled with Telesco\u2019s and Berner\u2019s declarations explaining the custom and practice of design review and approval and identifying the signing parties, was substantial evidence of discretionary approval. ...[][] Discretionary approval simply means approval in advance of construction by the officer exercising discretionary authority. [Citation.] . . . [A] detailed plan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>drawn up by a registered professional civil engineer, and approved by four district and State officials in the exercise of their discretionary authority is sufficient to establish the prior approval element of design immunity.\u201d <em>(Alvarez, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th at p. 734.)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">As the trial court in the present case noted in its memorandum of decision, \u201cthe burden of proof applied in <em>Alvarez </em>seems to be the same as that stated in the third element, that of \u2018substantial evidence.\u2019 Therefore, [under Alvarez] the burden is on the state to show \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 of both the second and third elements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">b. <em>Levin v. State of California</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision acknowledged that a different result was reached in <em>Levin, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.3d 410, a wrongful death action alleging the lack of a median barrier and guardrails on a portion of State Highway 37 constituted a dangerous condition of public property. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 415.) In <em>Levin </em>the state moved for summary judgment on the ground of design immunity. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 413-414.) In order to establish discretionary approval the state presented evidence that the design changes at issue (the 1974 changes) were approved by J.A. Legarra, a deputy highway engineer who had approval authority. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 417.) The state also proffered the deposition testimony and reports of Victor Graf, a senior transportation engineer with the state who was a consultant on the relevant design project. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Graf testified he \u201cspecifically considered the placement of a median barrier and exterior guardrails, but concluded that neither was advisable on this particular stretch of Highway 37.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 418.)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">In opposition to the motion the plaintiffs presented evidence the highway was altered in 1974 and the new design was unsafe because \u201cthe south shoulder was deficient and substandard and should have been provided with guardrails [at the edge of a steep embankment].\u201d <em>(Levin, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.3d at p. 416.) Their expert opined that \u201c[t]he conditions described in the Division of Highways 1971 Traffic Manual, promulgating standards (warrants) for guardrails [fn. omitted] were present, and should have been followed.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The state did not challenge the existence and application of the guardrail standards cited by the plaintiffs, yet there \u201cwas no evidence that Legarra had discretionary authority to disregard the standards.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 418.) The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment, stating: \u201cAs our Supreme Court pointed out in <em>Cameron v. State of California </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 318, 326 [102 Cal.Rptr. 305, 497 P.2d 777], the rationale of the design immunity defense is to prevent a jury from simply reweighing the same factors considered by the governmental entity which approved the design. An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>actual informed exercise of discretion is required. The defense does not exist to immunize decisions that have not been made. Here, as in <em>Cameron, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d 318 the design plan contained no mention of the steep slope of the embankment. The state made no showing that Legarra, who alone had discretionary authority, decided to ignore the standards or considered the consequences of the elimination of the eight feet shoulder. It follows that the state also failed to establish the second element of the defense.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The trial court in the present case noted that what distinguishes <em>Levin </em>from <em>Alvarez </em>is that in <em>Levin </em>the state \u201cfailed to show that the official who exercised the discretionary authority to approve the design was aware the roadway did not conform to [the governing guardrail] standards.\u201d <em>(Alvarez, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th at p. 735.) Although Hernandez presented evidence that, as in <em>Levin, </em>the off-ramp design at issue in the instant case violated the applicable guardrail standards and, also as in <em>Levin, </em>Caltrans had no evidence that any deviations from the governing standards were knowingly approved, the trial court nonetheless concluded <em>Alvarez, </em>rather than <em>Levin, </em>was controlling based on its own determination, after weighing the evidence, that the off-ramp plans did conform to state standards for guardrails at the time built. In denying Hernandez\u2019s motion for a new trial, the trial court explained \u201call three of the issues necessary to establish design immunity are legal issues for the court to decide.\u201d In its view <em>Cornette, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th 63 did not abrogate this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">c. <em>Cornette </em>v. <em>State of California</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">In <em>Cornette, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th 63, the Supreme Court held where triable issues of material fact are presented, \u201ca plaintiff has the right to a jury trial as to the issues involved in loss of design immunity.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 67.) The court explained: \u201cThe rationale for design immunity is to prevent a jury from second-guessing the decision of a public entity by reviewing the identical questions of risk that had previously been considered by the government officers who adopted or approved the plan or design. [Citation.] \u2018 \u201c \u2018[T]o permit reexamination in tort litigation of particular discretionary decisions where reasonable men may differ as to how the discretion should be exercised would create too great a danger of impolitic interference with the freedom of decision-making by those public officials in whom the function of making such decisions has been vested.\u2019 \u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 69.) Thus, \u201cthe resolution of the third element of design immunity, the existence of substantial evidence supporting the reasonableness of the adoption of the plan or design, [is] a matter for the court, not the jury.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 72.) However, the Supreme Court disapproved, at least implicitly, \u201cseveral opinions of the Court of Appeal that state that <em>all </em>of the elements necessary to establish design <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>immunity are legal issues for the court to decide.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 74.) It noted \u201cthis view was expressed \u2018without critical comment or explanation and without reference to the text of [section 830.6]\u2019 \u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>and emphasized that the Supreme Court itself had never said \u201cor even suggested] that the first two elements of design immunity . . . were issues of law for the court to decide if it were not ruling on a motion for a directed verdict.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 75.) To the contrary, it explained that of the three elements of design immunity, only one\u2014the existence of substantial evidence supporting the reasonableness of the design\u2014was expressly reserved by the Legislature for the court. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 73.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Caltrans argues that <em>Cornette </em>is not controlling in this case because that decision dealt, not with the three elements necessary to establish design immunity in the first instance, but with \u201c[whether] plaintiff has a right to a jury trial as to the issues involved in loss of design immunity.\u201d <em>(Cornette, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 67; see <em>id. </em>at p. 73 [\u201cthe one element of design immunity the Legislature did expressly reserve for the court, the existence of substantial evidence supporting the reasonableness of the adoption of the plan or design, differs significantly from the three elements of loss of design immunity\u201d].) Although Caltrans is correct as to the precise holding of <em>Cornette, </em>we decline to limit the Supreme Court\u2019s explanation of the nature of the design immunity defense and the appropriate division of responsibilities between the court and jury as narrowly as Caltrans urges.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">In confirming that the third element of the design immunity defense was to be tried to the court, not a jury, the court in <em>Cornette </em>explained: \u201c \u2018[I]n enacting section 830.6, the Legislature was concerned lest juries be allowed to second-guess the discretionary determinations of public officials by reviewing the identical questions of risk that had previously been considered by the government officers who adopted or approved the plan.\u2019 [Citation.] The questions involved in loss of design immunity, e.g., whether the plan or design has become dangerous because of a change in physical conditions, are not the identical questions considered by the government officials who adopted or approved the plan. Therefore, the Legislature would arguably not have had the same rationale for taking such questions away from the jury.\u201d (Cornette, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 73.) Similarly, the question whether state officials did in fact exercise discretion in approving the plans at issue is not a question that was reviewed by government officials at the time of the adoption or approval of the plan. Rather, this question (as well as the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>element of causation) requires a case-specific factual determination that must be left to the jury when there is conflicting evidence. (See <em>Levin, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.3d at p. 418; see also <em>Wyckoff </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 45, 55-58 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 198] [affirming summary judgment for the state on the ground of design immunity but recognizing that summary judgment would have been improper if the plaintiff had raised a triable issue of fact whether project plans at issue deviated from the applicable general design guidelines for installation of median barriers].)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">d. <em>Triable Issues of Fact Exist as to the Second Element of the Design Immunity Defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Conflicting evidence was presented in the trial court as to whether the off-ramp design at issue in this case deviated from the applicable guardrail standards and, if so, whether that deviation was knowingly approved by the responsible Caltrans authorities. Under the rationale of <em>Cornette, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at pages 72 to 74, the trial court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Caltrans based on inferences drawn from conflicting evidence was error. (See <em>Zavala </em>v. <em>Arce </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 915, 926 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 571] [court\u2019s function on summary judgment is issue finding, not issue determination]; <em>Molko v. Holy Spirit Assn. </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1092, 1107 [252 Cal.Rptr. 122] [trial court may not decide the merits of the issues themselves]; <em>Mann v. Cracchiolo </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 18, 39 [210 Cal.Rptr. 762, 694 P.2d 1134] [trial court may not weigh credibility of the parties\u2019 evidence].) Indeed, even if we were to conclude that the second element of the design immunity defense is properly determined by the court, rather than a jury, this patently factual question\u2014were the design plans in fact approved by authorized Caltrans officials\u2014cannot properly be decided on summary judgment when conflicting evidence has been presented. <em>(Kerns v. CSE Ins.

Caltrans\u2019 failure to have installed guardrail on the portion of the offramp embankment where Plaintiffs\u2019 accident in this case occurred, in my opinion, was in violation of Caltrans own 1966 Traffic Manual\u2019s embankment guardrail guidelines, specifically \u00a7 8-604.2.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b329-12\"> The trial court acknowledged the existence of the guardrail installation guidelines, but concluded \u201cthe evidence convinces me that the off-ramp did not have a high \u2018run off the road probability\u2019 at the time it was built. Therefore, the plans cannot be said to not conform to state standards for guardrails at the time built. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b332-6\"> Anthony J. Telesco, the project engineer who prepared the plans, declared that he had submitted them to both his supervisor and the district engineer, who exercised their discretionary authority to approve the plans by permitting them to proceed to the next level for approval. Both of those engineers could have rejected the plans by refusing to sign them, which would have required the project engineer to redesign the project. <em>(Alvarez, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th at p. 729.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">The state also provided a declaration from Kenneth C. Berner, a former Caltrans employee, which described the approval process: \u201cBased on his lengthy employment with Caltrans, his design.work responsibilities and his familiarity with the design review and approval process, Berner described the State\u2019s custom and practice in providing discretionary approval of roadway designs during the late 1960\u2019s when the Project was designed and constructed. Berner stated he was \u2018personally familiar\u2019 with the four state officials who approved and signed the Project plans. Those officials had the discretionary authority to approve the Project plans. Their signatures showed they in fact exercised their discretionary authority and approved the plans.\u201d <em>(Alvarez, supra, </em>79 Cal.App.4th at pp. 729-730.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b335-6\"> The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Cornette </em>also makes it clear that, in reserving the third element of design immunity for the court\u2019s determination, Government Code section 830.6 does not make the question whether substantial evidence supports the reasonableness of the plan or design an \u201cissue of law\u201d in all instances, but simply a question to be decided by the court itself, rather than the jury. <em>(Cornette, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at pp. 72-74.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b336-6\"> Because Caltrans has not urged affirmance on any of the other grounds raised in its motion for summary judgment, we need not address those issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
