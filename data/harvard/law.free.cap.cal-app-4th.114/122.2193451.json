J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq0\">In this case we hold that defendant Joseph Michael Silva, who was sentenced to state prison following revocation of probation, is not entitled to presentence <em>conduct </em>credit for time he spent in home detention on a county electronic monitoring program. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1203.016, 4019; undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.) The trial court properly rejected an opinion of the Attorney General that had held to the contrary. (85 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 106, 114 (2002).)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">In July 1999, defendant pled guilty to false personation and second degree burglary. (\u00a7\u00a7 459, 460, subd. (b), 529, par. 3.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was sentenced to state prison for three years eight months. Execution of sentence was suspended and he was granted probation for five years on the condition, among others, that he serve 365 days in the Placer County jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">While serving his county jail sentence, defendant was allowed to participate in an electronic monitoring program authorized by section 1203.016 and administered by the Placer County Probation Department.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant wore an electronic bracelet, was removed from county jail, and was allowed to go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>to work, to report to the probation officer, and then to be at home the rest of the time. Defendant worked at two restaurants in the Auburn area. He spent 171 days on the electronic monitoring program.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">In April 2002, defendant admitted several violations of probation. Execution of the prison sentence was ordered. Defendant was awarded presentence custody credit (\u00a7 2900.5) for the 171 days he had spent on electronic monitoring.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court denied his request for presentence <em>conduct </em>credit (\u00a7 4019) for that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">On appeal, defendant, relying on the aforementioned opinion of the Attorney General, contends he was statutorily entitled to conduct credit for his time on the electronic monitoring program.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The People, represented in this court by the Placer County District Attorney, counter that the Attorney General\u2019s opinion was wrongly decided and that conduct credit was properly denied. We agree with the People and shall affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The facts of defendant\u2019s offenses are not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">Conduct credits for good time and work time are authorized by section 4019, which is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>In his opinion found at 85 Opinions of the Attorney General 106 (2002), the Attorney General concluded that defendants subject to home electronic monitoring programs, under section 1203.016, were entitled to conduct credits under section 4019 because they satisfied the two essential criteria for an award of conduct credits: (1) they were \u201ccommitted to a county jail,\u201d as required by section 4019, subdivisions (a), (b), and (c), and (2) they were \u201cin actual custody\u201d as required by section 4019, subdivision (f), and by the opinion of the Court of Appeal in <em>People v. Wills </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 1810, 1813 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 925].</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">For present purposes, we will assume for the sake of argument that defendant remained \u201ccommitted to\u201d county jail while he was on his home electronic monitoring program. However, we think that the Attorney General\u2019s analysis of section 4019 disregards the purpose of that statute and places a too-technical definition of what it means to be \u201cin actual custody\u201d as required by subdivision (f) of section 4019. For reasons that follow, we cannot conclude that defendant was in \u201cactual custody\u201d as required by subdivision (f) of section 4019 and by <em>People v. Wills, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th 1810, 1813.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u201cThe purpose of . . . section 4019 is to encourage good behavior by incarcerated defendants prior to sentencing. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Guzman </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 691, 695 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 53].) \u201cConduct credit is awarded to prisoners in penal institutions to encourage good behavior. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 783, 787 [277 Cal.Rptr. 82].)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Section 4019 encourages such good behavior by holding out incentives to defendants. These carrots are found in subdivisions (b) and (c) of section 4019 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">Subdivision (b) of section 4019 gives a defendant a deduction of one day from his sentence \u201cunless it appears by the record that the prisoner has refused to satisfactorily perform labor as assigned by the sheriff, chief of police, or superintendent of an industrial farm or road camp.\u201d The evident purpose of this provision is to encourage prisoners to satisfactorily perform labor as assigned by the sheriff, chief of police, or superintendent of an industrial farm or road camp. That purpose could not be conceivably served in this case because, even assuming that defendant\u2019s restaurant work qualified as \u201clabor,\u201d it was not assigned by a sheriff, chief of police, or superintendent of an industrial farm or road camp. Rather, it was assigned by a probation officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">Similarly, subdivision (c) provides for a day to be deducted from the defendant\u2019s period of confinement \u201cunless it appears by the record that the prisoner has not satisfactorily complied with the reasonable rules and regulations established by the sheriff, chief of police, or superintendent of an industrial farm or road camp.\u201d This paragraph assumes that there will be in place reasonable rules and regulations established by the sheriff, chief of police, or superintendent of an industrial farm or road camp. In defendant\u2019s case, there were no such rules while he was on home electronic detention. Rather, the rules for the home electronic detention program were established by the board of supervisors. (\u00a7 1203.016, subd. (b).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">These provisions of section 4019 make clear that conduct credits are designed to ensure the smooth running of a custodial facility by encouraging prisoners to do required work and to obey the rules and regulations of the facility. This statutory scheme has no application where, as here, a defendant is not in \u201cactual custody\u201d in a facility described in subdivision (a)(1) of section 4019. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Moore, supra, </em>226 Cal.App.3d 783 [no conduct credit for alcohol recovery program].) Here, defendant was not in \u201cactual custody\u201d in a county jail; rather, he was at home or at work wearing a bracelet.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">We therefore conclude that, reading section 4019 in its entirety, and particularly subdivisions (b), (c), and (f), that defendant was not \u201cin actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>custody\u201d within the meaning of section 4019 when he was on his electronic home monitoring program. He was therefore not entitled to conduct credits under section 4019. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wills, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th 1810, 1813.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Our conclusion finds further support in the legislative history of a related statute, section 2900.5. The courts in <em>People v. Lapaille </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1170 and <em>People v. Cook </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1467, 1470 observed that, when the Legislature authorized persons on home detention to receive custody credit (\u00a7 2900.5) in 1991, it did not also authorize such persons to receive conduct credit under section 4019.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court found this significant, as do we. \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018Where a statute, with reference to one subject contains a given provision, the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject... is significant to show that a different intention existed.\u2019 \u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Moncharsh v. Heily &amp; Blase </em>(1992) 3 Cal.4th 1, 26 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 183, 832 P.2d 899], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Drake </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 749, 755 [139 Cal.Rptr. 720, 566 P.2d 622]; see <em>Golfland Entertainment Centers, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 739, 747 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 828].)  Considering section 4019\u2019s language and purpose, and the Legislature\u2019s failure to amend it while amending a similar statute, we conclude the trial court properly denied conduct credit for the 171 days defendant spent in home detention on electronic monitoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The judgment is affirmed.
