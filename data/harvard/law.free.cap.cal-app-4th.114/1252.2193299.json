J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap8\">Santa Monica City Charter section 6.10 states, \u201cExcept for the purpose of inquiry, the City Council and its members shall deal with the administrative service under the City Manager solely through the City Manager and neither the City Council nor any member shall give orders to any subordinates of the City Manager, either publicly or privately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-9\">Here we conclude, among other things, that a city council member did not violate Santa Monica City Charter section 6.10 by speaking with city planning department employees on behalf of a constituent to inquire about a structure built on a neighbor\u2019s property. An injunction to prevent such communication violates the First Amendment. The First Amendment protects everyone, even politicians. (See <em>Beilenson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 944 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 357].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-10\">The City of Santa Monica (City) and council member Ken Genser (City) appeal an order denying their \u201cSLAPP\u201d (strategic lawsuit against public participation) motion to strike the lawsuit filed against them by David and Beth Levy (the Levys). (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.16.) We reverse because City\u2019s activity is protected under SLAPP and the Levys did not demonstrate a probability of prevailing on any of their causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-11\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-12\">The Levys spent $11,000 to build a large elevated backyard playhouse for their four-year-old son. City building inspector Mike Gruett advised the Levys that their neighbor Tunde Garai had complained about the playhouse. Gruett told them they had to remodel it to meet city building standards and \u201crelocate]] [it] so that it was at least five feet from the rear lot line.\u201d The Levys spent $2,000 to modify the structure to comply with the City\u2019s specifications. The completed structure was 13 feet high. It was located near a tree and supported by wooden posts which extended approximately seven feet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>from the ground. Robert Flowers, a city inspector, checked it and told the Levys that it \u201cwas in full compliance with . . . City regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">Garai complained to the City\u2019s building and safety department about the playhouse. She also complained to Genser who was both her city council representative and the mayor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">On March 15, 2000, Genser sent an e-mail on behalf of Garai to Suzanne Frick, the City\u2019s director of planning and community development, that said, \u201c[C]ould you look into this? Is this structure being built without permits? And could it be built with a permit? Please feel free to contact [Garai] directly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-6\">On April 2, 2000, Genser sent another e-mail to Frick to find out \u201cthe status of the complaint [he] forwarded\u201d to her. He said, \u201cI just did a \u2018quick\u2019 review of the code. I can\u2019t say that I am necessarily accurate . . . but: Mike\u2019s letter said a 5-ft. rear setback was required. I think the code requires the same rear setback as the rear yard\u2014generally 15 feet (?) [][]... [f] I wonder if the space under the first floor should be considered a story. (I haven\u2019t found a citation to support this\u2014yet.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-7\">Frick \u201cdid not consider these e-mails to be orders.\u201d She treated them as \u201ccitizen complaints\u201d and referred them to the zoning administrator. Genser simultaneously e-mailed copies to Susan McCarthy, the city manager, who did not consider the e-mails to be orders to City staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-8\">On August 4, 2000, Gruett sent the Levys a \u201cNotice of Violation\u201d which \u201cdirected [them] to remove\u201d or modify the playhouse because it was an \u201cunapproved structure!.]\u201d The notice said the playhouse was a two-story structure that had to be \u201c15 feet from the property line[.]\u201d This notice did not mention appeal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-9\">Prior to filing their lawsuit, the Levys\u2019 attorney, Christopher Harding, had a discussion with Marsha Moutrie, the city attorney, who told him \u201cthat City staff did not intend to take any enforcement action of any kind against the Levys prior to discussing their claim with the City Council. . ..\u201d She said, \u201cI would recommend to the City Council that the City forego enforcement based on the equities of the case, and that I anticipated the City Council would follow my recommendation.\u201d She said, \u201cit would not be necessary to file a lawsuit, that the City would carefully review the matter, and that the dispute could be informally resolved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-10\">The Levys did not wait for the city council meeting and filed a complaint for injunctive, declaratory relief and damages against the City and Genser. They included Garai as a \u201cReal Party in Interest.\u201d Later they filed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>amended complaint alleging that the City \u201cconfirmed in writing that the Levys may keep their son\u2019s playhouse but asserted that it constitutes a legal <em>non-conforming structure^' </em>(Italics added.) Their first cause of action sought a declaratory judgment that the playhouse was a \u201cconforming structure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">The second cause of action sought a permanent injunction and a declaratory judgment that the city council members \u201care precluded by Section 6.10 [of the City Charter] <em>from engaging in acts designed to influence </em>City administrative staff through direct communication with City staff (other than the City Manager), with respect to zoning enforcement matters such as the Levy playhouse matter.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-6\">The third cause of action sought damages under the federal civil rights statute (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983) for the violation of the Levys\u2019 \u201cdue process right to a hearing . . . before being required to modify or remove their son\u2019s playhouse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-7\">The City moved to strike the complaint under the SLAPP statute and contended the first and third causes of action were moot because the City rescinded the notice of violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-8\">The Levys opposed the motion with several declarations. A declaration by attorney Christopher Harding stated the City \u201ccontinues to maintain . . . that the Levy playhouse is a non-conforming structure[.]\u201d Another declaration by Gruett said the notice of violation should have advised the Levys about their appeal rights. But his supervisor Timothy McCormick, the City\u2019s chief building officer, told him the notices did not contain such advisements because \u201cthe City did not want to encourage appeals by giving people notice of their rights.\u201d Gruett said that the playhouse \u201cconformed to the Zoning Ordinance[.]\u201d He and McCormick determined it was \u201ca lawful one-story ancillary structure.\u201d But they were told by the chief City planners to \u201ctreat [it] as a two-story structure^]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-9\">Robert Sullivan, a real estate broker, said the City\u2019s classification of the playhouse as a \u201cnon-conforming\u201d structure has an \u201cadverse effect on the marketability of [the Levys\u2019] home.\u201d Former city council member Paul Rosenstein declared, \u201cI am concerned . . . that the Levy playhouse matter is not an isolated incident, but rather an example of what has become \u2018business as usual\u2019 for one or more members of the Santa Monica City Council.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-10\">The Court denied the motion. It ruled SLAPP was not applicable, but even if it were, the Levys met their burden to demonstrate a probability of success on all their causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-4\">I. <em>The Applicability of SLAPP</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">The City contends that the Levys\u2019 action arose from Censer\u2019s and Garai\u2019s \u201cconstitutionally-protected speech or petitioning activity.\u201d It argues the trial court erred by ruling that SLAPP did not apply. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-6\">A SLAPP suit is a lawsuit that chills \u201ca party\u2019s constitutional right of petition or free speech.\u201d <em>(State Farm General Insurance Company v. Majorino </em>(2002) 99 Cal.App.4th 974, 975 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 719].) The SLAPP statute permits the defendant to file a motion to strike a cause of action that interferes with those rights. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.16.) To prevail, the defendant must show \u201cthat the plaintiff\u2019s claims arise from an act of the defendant in furtherance of the defendant\u2019s right of petition or free speech.\u201d <em>(State Farm General Insurance Company, </em>at p. 977.) Such acts include any written or oral statement made before a legislative, executive or judicial body, or \u201cany other official proceeding authorized by law.\u201d <em>(Navellier </em>v. <em>Sletten </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 88 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 530, 52 P.3d 703]; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 425.16, subd. (e).) Courts must construe these provisions broadly. <em>(Navellier, </em>at p. 92.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-7\">If an action falls within SLAPP, the court \u201cmust then determine whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.\u201d <em>(Navellier </em>v. <em>Sletten, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 88.) To do this, he or she must show \u201c \u2018that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by . . . facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 88-89.) The trial court may not weigh the evidence in deciding whether the plaintiff meets the burden, and we review the record de novo. <em>(Matson v. Dvorak </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 539, 548 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 880]; <em>Lafayette Morehouse Inc. v. Chronicle Publishing Co. </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 855, 867 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 46].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-8\">Here the City met its burden to show that the Levys\u2019 action arose from Genser\u2019s and Garai\u2019s constitutionally protected speech. The complaint alleges that Garai complained to Genser about the playhouse that had been approved by City building officials. Genser contacted the City\u2019s planning staff on her behalf because of Garai\u2019s disagreement with the City\u2019s action. The Levys incorporated these allegations into each cause of action and sued Garai and Genser.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-9\">Garai\u2019s act of contacting her representative and Genser\u2019s act of contacting planning staff are petitions for grievances against the government protected by the First Amendment. <em>(Bradbury </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 49 Cal.App.4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>1108, 1116 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 207]; <em>American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 167, 178 [10 Cal.Rptr. 647, 359 P.2d 45]; <em>Nelson v. City of Selma </em>(9th Cir. 1989) 881 F.2d 836, 839.)  The court erred by ruling that SLAPP did not apply. The Levys did not meet their burden of demonstrating probable success on their causes of action. <em>(Navellier v. Sletten, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 88.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-6\">The first cause of action seeks a declaratory judgment that the playhouse \u201cconforms with the Zoning Ordinance[.]\u201d \u201c \u2018The fundamental basis of declaratory relief is the existence of an actual, present controversy over a proper subject.\u2019 \u201d <em>(City of Cotati v. Cashman </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 69, 79 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 519, 52 P.3d 695].) A plaintiff may seek declaratory relief to resolve a dispute about the impact of a zoning ordinance. <em>(Alameda Co. Land Use Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Hayward </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1716, 1723 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 752]; <em>Toso v. City of Santa Barbara </em>(1980) 101 Cal.App.3d 934, 948 [162 Cal.Rptr. 210].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-7\">The City contends the issue is moot and there is no actual controversy. We agree. The city attorney informed the Levys that \u201cthe City has rescinded the Notices of Violation for the playhouse .... The rescission is unequivocal. The City has no intention of reissuing notices.\u201d Because of this there is no \u201cactual, present controversy\u201d which requires resolution by the court. <em>(City of Cotati v. Cashman, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 79.) This element was necessary to prove a cause of action for declaratory relief. Moreover, real estate broker Sullivan\u2019s conclusory declaration on the home\u2019s marketability was inadequate to show damages. The Levys did not meet their burden to show a probability of success on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-8\">II. <em>The Federal Civil Rights Cause of Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1189-9\">The City contends the trial court erred because the Levys did not meet their burden to show a probability of prevailing on the federal civil rights cause of action (1983 claim). (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.) We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-10\">A plaintiff may state a 1983 claim by alleging \u201cfacts showing a deprivation of a right\u201d protected by federal law. <em>(Green </em>v. <em>Obledo </em>(1984) 161 Cal.App.3d 678, 682 [207 Cal.Rptr. 830].) Local governments may be sued under 42 United States Code section 1983 where their official policies or practices violate procedural due process rights. <em>(Carey v. Piphus </em>(1978) 435 U.S. 247, 266 [55 L.Ed.2d 252, 98 S.Ct. 1042].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-11\">The City argues that this cause of action is moot because it rescinded the notice of violation. As the City notes, it \u201crevamped its procedure for issuing orders and provided an extensive appeal and hearing process.\u201d The Levys did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>not show that the City has threatened to remove the playhouse in the future or that it would do so without proper notice. They did not produce sufficient evidence to show that they suffered damages. Real estate broker Sullivan\u2019s declaration fares no better in this cause of action. Nor did they show that the City had an official policy that deprived homeowners of due process notice. Even if Gruett and McCormick did not provide them proper notice of appeal rights, that by itself is insufficient to impose liability on the City. \u201cLocal governments have no liability under 42 United States Code section 1983 simply because their employees may have violated a plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights; the doctrine of respondent superior does not apply. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Choate v. County of Orange </em>(2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 312, 328 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 339].) The Levys are not entitled to \u201can abstract trial on the constitutionality\u201d of the past actions of some City employees that cause no damage. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 329-331.) The Levys did not meet their burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">III. <em>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief Against the City Council</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-6\">The City contends that the court erred by ruling that the Levys met their burden to show they would prevail on their second cause of action to enforce City Charter section 6.10 (Section 6.10) by declaratory and injunctive relief. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-7\">The Levys seek a permanent injunction and a declaratory judgment that \u201cthe City Council and its individual members are precluded by Section 6.10 <em>from engaging in acts designed to influence </em>City administrative staff through direct communication with City staff (other than the City Manager), with respect to zoning enforcement matters such as the Levy playhouse matter.\u201d (Italics added.) They also allege they \u201care entitled to issuance of a permanent injunction prohibiting members of the City Council [and their staffs] from violating Section [6.10.]\u201d They state the injunction is necessary \u201cto allow city administrative personnel to carry out their administrative duties <em>free from direct pressure or influence by\u201d </em>city council members. (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-8\">The Levys contend the purpose of Section 6.10 is to prevent city council members from interfering with administrative staff. They claim they should make complaints on behalf of constituents directly through the city manager. But Section 6.10 allows direct contact \u201cfor the purpose of inquiry.\u201d That is what Genser did. He made an inquiry on behalf of Garai.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-9\">The Levys contend Genser violated Section 6.10 by what he said to City staff. But this section prohibits \u201corders to any subordinates.\u201d The Levys did not show that Genser gave orders. Genser\u2019s declaration states he \u201cnever instructed or ordered\u201d any City staff \u201cto take any specific enforcement action[.]\u201d Frick said she did not consider the e-mails to be orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>The Levys contend Genser violated Section 6.10 by \u201cadvocating\u201d on behalf of Garai. \u201cGovernment officials are frequently called \u00fcpon to be ombudsmen for their constituents. In this capacity, they intercede, lobby, and generate publicity to advance their constituents\u2019 goals . . ..\u201d <em>(Manistee Town Center </em>v. <em>City of Glendale </em>(9th Cir. 2000) 227 F.3d 1090, 1093.) \u201cThis kind of petitioning may be nearly as vital to the functioning of a modem representative democracy as petitioning that originates with private citizens.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">Under the First Amendment, legislators are \u201cgiven the widest latitude to express their views\u201d and there are no \u201cstricter \u2018free speech\u2019 standards on [them] than on the general public.\u201d <em>(Eller Outdoor Advertising Co. v. Board of Supervisors </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 76, 80 [152 Cal.Rptr. 358].)  Laws that restrict that freedom must be narrowly construed. <em>(Ibid.) </em>City officials have First Amendment protection when they respond to inquiries from the public about the city\u2019s actions on constmction projects. <em>(Nizam-Aldine </em>v. <em>City of Oakland </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 364, 376-377 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 781].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">The Levys seek to enjoin council members from advocating their constituents\u2019 positions, applying \u201cdirect pressure\u201d or \u201cengaging in acts designed to influence\u201d City administrative staff. But that is an overly broad restraint on speech which would inhibit constitutionally protected activity. <em>(Bond v. Floyd </em>(1966) 385 U.S. 116, 136 [17 L.Ed.2d 235, 87 S.Ct. 339]; <em>Baggett </em>v. <em>Bullitt </em>(1964) 377 U.S. 360, 372 [12 L.Ed.2d 377, 84 S.Ct. 1316]; <em>American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California </em>v. <em>Board of Education, supra, </em>55 Cal.2d at pp. 179-180.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-7\">It is not easy to distinguish between inquiry and \u201cacts\u201d designed to influence decision. \u201cGeneral words create different and often particular impressions on different minds.\u201d <em>(Thomas </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1945) 323 U.S. 516, 534 [89 L.Ed. 430, 65 S.Ct. 315].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-8\">For example, in <em>Thomas, </em>a labor leader was held in contempt for violating a restraining order which prevented him from soliciting people to join a union. The Supreme Court mled that his conviction violated the First Amendment because the trial court\u2019s order \u201cchilled\u201d free speech. Under the order he could discuss the attributes of the union, but was prohibited from soliciting or inviting the audience to join it. The court noted it would be difficult for the speaker to distinguish between prohibited and protected speech. He would have to anticipate how the audience might interpret his remarks. There was no guarantee that \u201canything he might say upon the general subject would not be understood by some as an invitation. In short, the supposedly clear-cut distinction between discussion, laudation, general advocacy, and solicitation puts the speaker . . . wholly at the mercy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>varied understanding of his hearers . . . .\u201d <em>(Thomas v. Collins, supra, </em>323 U.S. at p. 535.) \u201cSuch a distinction offers no security for free discussion.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">That is the case here. For some, a council member\u2019s inquiry for a constituent is advocacy simply because it calls attention to the constituent\u2019s position. To the head of a city agency, a council member\u2019s act of faxing citizen complaints about the agency might be considered an \u201cact designed to influence\u201d or \u201cdirect pressure.\u201d For the Levys, an inquiry is advocacy where it could change the status quo or influence the result. Under their definition, virtually all inquiries would be suspect. Council members who may make inquiries under Section 6.10 might refrain from doing so because of fear of being sued or held in contempt. For example, council members could be inhibited from calling City agencies about matters crucial to the community such as securing help for families living in substandard housing. \u201cFree speech may not be so inhibited.\u201d <em>(Baggett </em>v. <em>Bullitt, supra, </em>377 U.S. at p. 372.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">The purpose of Section 6.10 is to define the lines of authority within City government, not to prohibit protected speech. Interpreting this section to prohibit \u201corders\u201d to City staff is a bright line consistent with the purpose of Section 6.10 and the First Amendment. Counsel members \u201care entitled to speak as they please on matters vital to them; errors in judgment. . . may be exposed, of course, but not through punishment for contempt for the expression.\u201d (W<em>ood v. Georgia </em>(1962) 370 U.S. 375, 389 [8 L.Ed.2d 569, 82 S.Ct. 1364].) \u201c[E]rroneous statements must be protected to give freedom of expression the breathing space it needs to survive.\u201d <em>(Bond </em>v. <em>Floyd, supra, </em>385 U.S. at p. 136.) There are <em>better </em>ways to discourage improper conduct. \u201cUnder our system of government, counterargument and education are the weapons available to expose these matters, not abridgment of the rights of free speech.\u201d <em>(Wood, </em>at p. 389.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-6\">Moreover, the Levys did not meet their evidentiary burden for injunctive and declaratory relief. Their complaint alleged an ongoing \u201cpattern of intervention\u201d by council members in \u201cCity staff\u2019s performance.\u201d But they made these general allegations on information and belief and did not produce admissible evidence to support them.
