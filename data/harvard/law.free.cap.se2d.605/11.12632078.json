At trial, the State's evidence tended to show the following: On the evening of 15 October 2002, Ms. Bridget Morrow (Ms. Morrow), and her friend Allison Cross (Allison), helped defendant get into Hector Alexander Sanchez Perez's (Mr. Perez's) house to steal his money. Mr. Perez was home alone when Ms. Morrow first arrived at his house to borrow gas money. The money was in fact to be used to purchase more drugs, which Ms. Morrow and friends had been using that day. She followed Mr. Perez to hisbedroom where he had a large sum of money in a drawer. There was $5,102.00 alleged to be in the drawer at the time, money which Mr. Perez had just withdrawn from the bank to use to pay a fee to have a friend brought to the United States from El Salvador. In addition to the cash, Mr. Perez had three checks, each for $292.86, payable to \"Hector Sanchez.\" After Mr. Perez gave Ms. Morrow $20.00 for gas, Ms. Morrow told him she would be back because she needed to stay at his place for the night. After leaving, she returned to where Allison and defendant had been waiting in a truck outside Mr. Perez's home. The three then used the money to purchase crack cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the desire to get more crack, the defendant came up with a plan to steal the rest of Mr. Perez's money. Approximately twenty minutes after Ms. Morrow had first left Mr. Perez's home, the three returned and parked the truck down the street. Ms. Morrow and Allison entered the house while defendant remained outside. While inside, Allison asked for a glass of water and Ms. Morrow asked to use the restroom towards the back of the home. While Mr. Perez was distracted, Ms. Morrow unlocked the backdoor of the home so that defendant could gain entry while Mr. Perez was still in the living room. After she finished using the restroom, Ms. Morrow returned to the living room where Mr. Perez and Allison were on the couch. Mr. Perez was on the telephone when he heard a loud noise and ran to his bedroom to discover his money was gone. At trial, Mr. Perez testified through an interpreter that he saw a man running out of the backdoor, but could not determine the race of the man. Ms.Morrow testified that she saw defendant running out the backdoor carrying the money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Perez immediately telephoned the police. Allison ran away, but Mr. Perez was able to detain Ms. Morrow until the police arrived. Deputy Knight with the Buncombe County Sheriff's Department arrived and completed an incident report. The case was assigned to Detective Baird from the same department, who questioned Ms. Morrow while Deputy Knight continued to speak with Mr. Perez. At first Ms. Morrow was evasive, but she began to answer questions directly to Detective Baird after he told her she may be held accountable for the burglary. Ms. Morrow identified Allison and defendant, and told Detective Baird that they had been driving around in a large black Ford truck. Ms. Morrow provided a description of her friends and that either might be driving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ms. Morrow then agreed to ride around with Detective Baird to try and locate the truck. Approximately 45 minutes after the alleged incident, Detective Baird and Ms. Morrow spotted a large black Ford F-150 approximately 3 miles from Mr. Perez's residence. The truck was occupied by a black male and was parked in a public housing project, an area known for its high concentration of drug-related crimes. Ms. Morrow told the Detective that she did not think this was the truck because it had an emblem on the back window that she did not recognize. After driving around some more, when Detective Baird again saw the same dark Ford F-150 driven by a black male, he decided to initiate a stop. Officer Calloway, a patrolman that had been put on alert, assisted in the stop. Upon the stop, defendant exited the truck. It was dark and began raining hard. With Detective Baird looking on, Officer Calloway frisked the defendant for safety. Detective Baird observed Officer Calloway hit defendant's pockets and heard him say, \"There's something in there.\" Officer Calloway removed what felt like a two inch bulge from defendant's front pocket. It was a bundle of dollar bills rolled up tightly with a check that was made out to \"Hector Sanchez\" in the amount of $292.86. At trial, defendant sought to suppress this evidence on the theory that the stop and frisk were unlawful. The court denied this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When the money and the check were found, and prior to a rights advisement, Detective Baird asked defendant where the money came from. Defendant stated that Allison and Ms. Morrow were the ones who set up the whole thing and that he remained in the truck while they went inside. During the trial, defendant sought to suppress the evidence of the statements made by defendant after the money was discovered. The trial court found that defendant was in custody from the time of the frisk, and therefore granted the motion. The jury was instructed to disregard any statements made by defendant to Detective Baird. Defendant did not request a mistrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the second phase of the trial, on the habitual felon indictment, the State offered evidence of each of defendant's three prior felony convictions. Defendant made no objections to the State's exhibits evidencing these felony convictions, but made a motion to dismiss the indictment because the habitual felonindictment had the wrong date of conviction for one of the underlying felonies. Instead of the conviction date, 25 July 2000, the habitual indictment had the date defendant's probation for that conviction was revoked, 31 October 2000. However, the date of the underlying offense was correctly reflected in the habitual indictment, 13 May 2000. Before the trial began, the State's motion to have the indictment corrected was granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant offered no evidence at either stage of the trial. For the underlying charges, the jury returned verdicts of guilty of first-degree burglary and misdemeanor larceny. For the habitual charge, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. Defendant was found to have eight criminal history points and was sentenced, in category III, within the presumptive sentence range to a term of imprisonment a minimum of 116 months and maximum 149 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant now raises five issues on appeal: (I) that it was error to admit the out-of-court statement of Mr. Perez, under the theory it was offered for corroboration of his testimony, which identified the assailant's race; (II) &amp; (III) that it was error to allow evidence discovered as a result of an illegal stop, and/or an illegal frisk; (IV) that it was error for the court to allow the State to correct its habitual felon indictment to reflect the proper date of one of defendant's prior convictions; and (V) that defense counsel was ineffective in failing to move for a mistrial after defendant's statements prior to his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warning were heard by the jury. We now address these issues in turn, finding the trial was free from reversible error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Out-of-Court Statement Offered to Corroborate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant contends that Mr. Perez's pretrial statement that he saw a \"black guy\" running out of his backdoor, is inconsistent with his in-court testimony that he could not identify the race of the individual he saw running out of his backdoor. Defendant argues this pretrial statement cannot be offered for the limited purpose of corroborating defendant's in-court statement and that it was prejudicial error in allowing the jury to hear it. The State concedes the court did err in allowing the pretrial statement, but submits that it was harmless. We agree with the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   It is well established that a witness's prior statements may be admitted to corroborate the witness's sworn trial testimony, but they may not be used as substantive evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, this same evidence was elicited in the direct testimony of Ms. Morrow, who stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A: ...And, first, I saw [defendant] run out the door, I guess, holding the money ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Q: From where you were, were you able to actually see the Defendant come out of [Mr. Perez's] room?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   ****\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Q: Were you able to tell exactly what he was holding or was he just-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A: Well, I could kind of tell what it was because there was dollars flying everywhere on the-on the ground.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant was sitting in front of the jury at the time this testimony was given, with his race clearly apparent. Evidence also shows that Ms. Morrow informed the police of the assailant's race on the night of the incident. In light of this direct, and uncontested evidence, we conclude that defendant has failed to show a reasonable possibility that, had the error not occurred, a different result would have been reached at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II. &amp; III.

Specifically, defendant claims that Detective Baird lacked reasonable articulable suspicion of criminal activity to temporarily stop the truck suspected to have fled the incident; and that Detective Baird lacked a reasonable articulable suspicion that defendant was armed and dangerous to justify a frisk. Because theguarantees of the Fourth Amendment were not implicated in this case, we do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Our review of a trial court's denial of a motion to suppress is strictly \"`limited to determining whether the trial judge's underlying findings of fact are supported by competent evidence, in which event they are conclusively binding on appeal, and whether those factual findings in turn support the judge's ultimate conclusions of law.'\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The stop at issue took place three miles from the burglary and in an area known for its high rate of drug crimes. At the time of the stop, Detective Baird was looking for a large Ford truck driven by a white female or a black male based on the description given by defendant's alleged co-conspirator, Ms. Morrow. Detective Baird knew that the driver of the truck had been using crack cocaine earlier that day, and had been planning on buying more later that night. Detective Baird first saw a truck matching the description of Ms. Morrow's, but when he asked her if she thought that was the truck, she said no because she did not recognize an emblem on the truck's rear window. Detective Baird checked with other officers in the area to see if they had seen another black Ford F-150 since the burglary, and they had not. Upon passing the truck for a second time, Detective Baird, in light of his eight years of experience, knowledge of thehousing project area, proximity to the crime scene, description of the vehicle and defendant as a black male, and that no other truck had been reported in the area by the other patrolling officers, decided to conduct a stop.

It is the officer's subjective intention when frisking a person, not what the frisk produces, which determines the legality of the frisk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In the case at bar, we believe the trial court's findings and the underlying evidence of the totality of the circumstances support a reasonable articulable suspicion that defendant was armed and dangerous to justify a frisk. Defendant was stopped during the evening or nighttime hours, in heavy rain, and in an area with a high concentration of drug crimes. Defendant was alleged to havebeen using crack cocaine earlier that day, to have burglarized a house from which he took approximately $5,000 for the purchase of more drugs, and to have fled the scene of the crime.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., Harris,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8523035\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/95/691/#p696\">\n    95 N.C.

Upon the lawful stop, Officer Calloway, having constructive knowledge of the circumstances from Detective Baird's communications, had reasonable suspicion that defendant may be armed and dangerous and he should conduct a frisk. Furthermore, Detective Baird witnessed Officer Calloway feel the two-inch bulge in the defendant's pants, and state, \"there is something in his pocket.\" Detective Baird testified that he saw the two-inch bulge and that it could have been a threat to officer safety. He testified that, \"[t]here was a possibility, we thought, because of in a sense we didn't know what we had, if we had a robbery.... And so for officer safety, that was the initial thing.\" The object in defendant's pants could not be immediately disregarded as something harmless, and was removed to neutralize the potential threat. Based on these reasonable and articulable facts, we believe the frisk was lawful, as was the removal of a potential threat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Therefore, we hold both the stop and the subsequent frisk of defendant were not conducted in violation of defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. Applying the principles of\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   as adopted by the North Carolina courts, we believe the trial court had before it sufficient evidence to correctly deny defendant's motion to suppress the evidence reaped from the stop and frisk of defendant.

Additionally, we note that we believe defense counsel was sufficient when making a timely objection to the illegally elicited evidence, seeking a\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   hearing on the issue of custody, having the statement stricken, and receiving a favorable jury instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   This assignment of error is overruled.
