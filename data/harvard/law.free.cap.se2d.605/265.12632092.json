She appeals from the trial court's denial of her motion to dismiss, arguing that there is insufficient evidence in the record to show that she actually possessed cocaine. Based upon our review of the evidence, we hold that the trial court did not err.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the evening of 10 April 2002, Officer Jerry Husketh of the Durham Police Department went to defendant's house in response to a complaint about ongoing activities at the residence. Upon arriving at the residence, Officer Husketh saw defendant standingin front of her house talking to someone inside of a Volvo. The conversation lasted approximately three minutes. Because this interaction fit one of the established profiles for a drug transaction, Officer Husketh decided to surveil defendant's residence. He stood about 150 feet from defendant's house and had a clear view of the street in front of the house, the front lawn, and the porch of the house, all of which were well lit. Officer Husketh also used binoculars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Four minutes after beginning his surveillance, Officer Husketh observed a black Honda arrive at the intersection near defendant's house. A man emerged from the car and walked to defendant's front door. Defendant answered the door, stepped out onto the porch, and talked to the man for a few minutes before she went back inside. Less than thirty seconds later, defendant came back outside, received what appeared to be money from the man, and then placed a small item in the man's hand. The man returned to the Honda and got into the passenger side of the car. The entire transaction took less than three minutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Officer Husketh radioed Officers Jonathan Craig and Charles Barkley, who were stationed nearby, and gave them a description of the Honda and its occupants. There were no other black Hondas in the area at that time. Officers Craig and Barkley saw the Honda less than a minute later and stopped it. A search of the Honda revealed two rocks of crack cocaine on the floor in front of the passenger seat. One of the crack cocaine rocks was in packaging made from a plastic baggie corner, while the other rock wasunwrapped. The passenger, Gregory Holloway, admitted possession of the crack cocaine. In addition, a search of Mr. Holloway uncovered a torn baggie corner and a crack pipe in his pocket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While the other officers were conducting the stop of the Honda, Officer Husketh continued his surveillance of defendant's house for another 30 minutes. During that time, he saw eight cars and three pedestrians approach defendant's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The following day, Officer Husketh obtained and executed two search warrants for defendant's home. The officers found sandwich baggies with missing corners, separated baggie corners, a knot from a drug baggie, a razor blade, and $3,750.00 in cash. Officer Husketh testified that such items are routinely found at locations where drug activity is ongoing because these materials are associated with the packaging and sale of drugs. Additionally, the officers found a brown cigar with \"green vegetable matter,\" later identified as marijuana, and a spoon containing cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant was subsequently arrested and taken to the magistrate's office. While at the magistrate's office, defendant stated: \"I told you that I ain't sold no drugs today. I'm going to call my lawyer . . . and I'll be out doing my thing again. You ain't caught me with shit or nothing. You ain't catch me with no drugs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant was indicted on 3 March 2003 for (1) possession of cocaine with intent to sell and deliver, (2) sale of cocaine, and (3) delivery of cocaine. The jury found defendant guilty of all three charges. The trial judge imposed a sentence of 14 to 17months on the charge of sale of cocaine and supervised probation for 36 months with a suspended sentence of eight to ten months for possession with intent to sell and deliver cocaine. The judge arrested judgment on the charge of delivery of cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On appeal, defendant assigns error only to the trial court's denial of her motion to dismiss made at the conclusion of the State's evidence. When considering a motion to dismiss, a court must determine if the State has presented substantial evidence of each essential element of the offense and that defendant is the perpetrator of the offense.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Chavis,\n   </em>\n   the Court held that possession of marijuana was not proven when the State's evidence showed only that the defendant was observed wearing a gray felt hat, he later was seen without the hat, defendant claimed the hat was borrowed and hereturned it, and the hat - containing marijuana - was found approximately 30 minutes later in knee-deep grass.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 310,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20S.E.2d%20340\">\n    154 S.E.2d at 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Less than one minute after Mr. Holloway left the house in a black Honda, officers stopped the Honda and discovered that Mr. Holloway had possession of two rocks of crack cocaine. One of the rocks appeared newly unwrapped from its baggie corner. Additionally, Officer Husketh observed defendant engaging in activity consistent with drug dealing, and a search of defendant's house uncovered a significant amount of drug packaging materials (of the same type used with Mr. Holloway's crack cocaine), drug paraphernalia, and a large amount of cash.\n   <em>\n    See State v.
