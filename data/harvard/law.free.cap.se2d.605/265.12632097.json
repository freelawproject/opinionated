As Fort waited for her to return to the car, the assailant approached the vehicle and forced Fort out of the vehicle after firing a shot into the vehicle. Fort testified at trial that the assailant then pushed him up against a wall and went through his pockets. The assailant then took Fort'swallet and cell phone and let him retrieve the rest of his things and leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Long testified at trial that when Fort dropped her off, she asked him to wait because she wanted him to take her somewhere else. She stated that from inside the apartment she heard a sound like a gunshot. She ran to the front door and saw the man she knew as \"Sal,\" who is the defendant, and Fort. Long testified that the men entered her apartment and that she witnessed the robbery there inside. She stated that they argued loudly, and that the defendant demanded she pay him money she owed him or he would shoot Fort. Long did not remember Fort saying anything. She ran outside for help. She was outside talking to a neighbor when she saw Fort exit the apartment, go to his car, and leave. Long testified that she returned to her apartment to look for defendant, and found him outside in a back alley, crouched behind a staircase with Fort's wallet and cell phone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Fort turned over a copy of his cell phone bill to Detective Eric Lauffer. During the time after he had been robbed, calls were made on Fort's cell phone to Tonya Jackson and to the house where defendant's mother worked. Jackson testified that defendant had called her on that same day. Defendant's mother told Detective Lauffer that she had not received a call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant's mother testified at trial that he had slept on thecouch at her house the night of the robbery. She testified that she heard the defendant talking to his sister at about 2:00 a.m. and that he was asleep on the couch when she left for work the next morning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After one mistrial, at the beginning of his second trial, defendant requested a new attorney. The trial court determined that counsel was prepared to represent defendant and to bring the case to trial, and denied the request. Defendant stated that he was so sure that counsel would be insufficient that he would rather represent himself. His counsel was relieved of her duties but appointed as standby counsel to advise the defendant. The State requested that defendant be advised of the possible penalties for the felonies with which he was charged, and the trial court advised defendant that he faced a possible sentence of 425 months on all charges. Defendant proceeded\n   <em>\n    pro se,\n   </em>\n   and was found guilty by a jury of robbery with a dangerous weapon, second-degree kidnapping, and discharging a weapon into occupied property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant first assigns error to the trial court's decision to allow defendant to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se,\n   </em>\n   arguing the trial court did not properly establish the validity of his waiver of counsel as required by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1242 and the Federal and State Constitutions. Where the defendant proceeds on a waiver of counsel, N.C. Gen.

When a defendant indicates his desire to proceed to trialwithout counsel, the trial judge must conduct an inquiry to ascertain that the defendant's waiver is given with full understanding of his rights. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1242 (2003).

After the trial court cautioned defendant about the hazards of representing himself, the trial court took a recess to allow defendant to consult with his appointed counsel. After the recess, defendant's counsel informed the trial court defendant was adamant about wanting to represent himself. When the trial court asked defendant if he wanted to represent himself, defendant responded, \"Yes, I do.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=529%20S.E.2d%20229\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The trial court then previously appointed defendant's appointed counsel as defendant's standby counsel, and, without further inquiry, brought defendant's case to trial.

He was told only upon the urging of the prosecutor, and after he requested to the trial court that he proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se,\n   </em>\n   and the trialcourt had already allowed him to do so. There was nothing in the first trial transcript to suggest that, even though the defendant had already been through a mistrial once, he was aware of how much time he was facing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Nevertheless, defendant still had the option of changing his mind, and proceeding with counsel before the jury re-entered the courtroom. He had not yet begun his own representation, and had been advised in time of the sentence he faced. In an ideal inquiry, the trial court would apprise the defendant of his possible sentence before he is asked to waive his right to counsel. However, because the defendant was advised of his possible sentence while he still had time to change his mind, the waiver was effective, and the defendant was not deprived of his rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We hold that the trial court did not err.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant next assigns error to the trial court's decision to allow two witnesses to testify to prior bad acts of the defendant, arguing that their testimony was minimally relevant and highly prejudicial, thereby violating the North Carolina Rules of Evidence and denying defendant's constitutional rights. Neither piece of testimony was stricken from the record and there was no curative instruction to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Rule of Evidence 404(b) states: (b) Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith.
