Defendant stipulated to a factual basis for the plea and the State offered a factual summary. The court found that a factual basis existed for entry of the plea and accepted defendant's guilty plea. The court then sentenced defendant, who had a prior record level of IV, to a mitigated range sentence of 171 to 215 months imprisonment. Defendant's counsel states that \"[a]fter repeated and close examination of the record and review of relevant law, counsel is unable to identify an issue with sufficient merit to support a meaningful argument for relief on appeal\" and asks this Court toreview the record for possible prejudicial error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Counsel has shown to the satisfaction of this Court that he has complied with the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Anders v.

Stat. \u00a7 15A-1444(a1) (2001);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   2.

The only issue defendant argues to this Court that we have jurisdiction to consider is whether he was sentenced at the proper prior record level. The other two issues are not properly before this Court.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant's judgment and commitment indicates he was sentenced at level IV from the mitigated range. There is nothing in the record suggesting that defendant was sentenced at the wrong level. Further, because sentencing at level V is moresevere than that at level IV, even if defendant is correct that he was sentenced at the wrong prior record level, he cannot have been prejudiced thereby. We find that defendant's arguments are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In accordance with\n   <em>\n    Anders,\n   </em>\n   we must fully examine the record to determine whether any issues of arguable merit appear therefrom or whether the appeal is wholly frivolous. We conclude the appeal is wholly frivolous. In reaching this conclusion, we have conducted our own examination of the record for possible prejudicial error and have found none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   NO ERROR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Judges HUNTER and ELMORE concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Report per Rule 30(e).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
