T.D.C. was adjudicated a neglected child in an order entered 8 February 2002 in which the trial court made the following findings of fact:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2. That [respondent] has not had consistent housing over the past several months and has relied upon the kindness of friends, relatives and agencies to provide for she [sic] and [T.D.C.]. . . .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   3. That [T.D.C.] has, on occasion, been improperly bathed and clothed by [respondent] and has been placed in diapers that were three times too largefor her. That on two separate occasions [T.D.C.] came into the custody of [petitioner] from [respondent's] home suffering from an infestation of head lice. That [T.D.C] was left with the babysitter with a bottle full of clabbered milk, with a nipple that was unclean.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   4. That [respondent] has failed to provide proper care or supervision of [T.D.C.], often not responding to [T.D.C.'s] cries in the night.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In a subsequent disposition order, the trial court ordered respondent to complete parenting classes and a money management class. In a review order entered 15 April 2002, respondent was ordered to follow all recommendations from a psychological evaluation as well as comply with all activities listed in a family services case plan. The family services case plan required that respondent maintain housing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Respondent, with HUD assistance, obtained housing but was evicted on 31 May 2002. Respondent was evicted because she allowed P.R., T.D.C.'s purported father, to live in the home after his release from prison. Respondent then applied for public housing in Scotland County but did not find a place to live within the permitted amount of time. At the time of the termination hearing, respondent was living with her father and stepmother. Pursuant to a home study conducted in January 2002, petitioner had rejected the home of respondent's father and stepmother as appropriate for placement of T.D.C. In addition, respondent was the victim of an earlier substantiated instance of physical abuse inflicted by her father. Dr. Jerry Sloan (Dr. Sloan), a psychologist, evaluated respondent on 23 May 2002. In his evaluation, entered into evidence at trial, Dr. Sloan diagnosed respondent with borderline personality disorder, learning disability in reading and written language, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood. Dr. Sloan's report contained the following observations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [Respondent] has a short attention span and is easily distracted, and she has difficulty focusing and maintaining concentration if her child or others are present. . . .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   . . . .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Casework staff is impressed with her lack of knowledge of child development and her confusion when given simple, basic instructions, repeated several times. . . .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   . . . .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [I]t appears that [respondent's] knowledge of basic child development principles and children's needs is very poor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   . . . .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [Respondent] has a history of a neglectful and inappropriate family background, with family members who have used drugs in her presence and have allowed her to use drugs while she was pregnant. . . . [Respondent] appears unwilling and unable to accept the responsibility for her own behavior. . . . Her own personality is so poorly developed and her basic level of immaturity is so severe that it appears unlikely that she will be able to assume full responsibility for the care of her child in the foreseeable future.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Dr. Sloan recommended that respondent undergo a trial of psychotropic medication to address her psychiatric symptoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Petitioner filed a petition dated 21 November 2002 to terminate the parental rights of respondent and P.R. The trialcourt found that respondent had violated court orders by failing to complete parenting and money management classes, by not complying with the recommendations of her psychological evaluation, and by not maintaining housing. Based upon these findings of fact, the trial court concluded in an order entered 23 April 2003,\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   27 August 2003, that \"grounds exist pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 7B-1111 (a)(1),(a)(3), (a)(5) and (a)(7) to terminate\" respondent's and P.R.'s parental rights. In a disposition order entered 23 April 2003,\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   27 August 2003, the trial court determined that it was in the best interest of T.D.C. that respondent's and P.R.'s parental rights be terminated.

Viewing the neglect in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   in light of the history of neglect, a lack of changed conditions, and the probability of repetition of neglect, we held that clear, cogent, and convincing evidence supported termination of the respondents' parental rights.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=448%20S.E.2d%20303\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=448%20S.E.2d%20303\">\n    at 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=448%20S.E.2d%20303\">\n    448 S.E.2d at 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Davis,\n   </em>\n   we find that T.D.C. was neglected at the time of the termination hearing. Respondent failed to comply with numerouscourt orders that sought to address the conditions that led to previous findings that T.D.C. was neglected. Respondent admitted at the termination hearing that she failed to complete the money management program and failed to follow the recommendations of her psychological evaluation. In our present case, respondent, as in\n   <em>\n    Davis,\n   </em>\n   did not attend parenting classes until after reunification efforts were terminated and the trial court had ordered that petitioner should pursue termination of parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, respondent did not maintain housing. She was evicted from public housing and was residing with her father, against whom she had a substantiated instance of physical abuse, and whose home was previously rejected for placement of T.D.C. Since respondent failed to correct the conditions that led to the previous finding that T.D.C. was neglected, we hold that T.D.C. was neglected by respondent at the time of the termination hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We next consider respondent's argument that there was no evidence of a probability of repetition of neglect. In support of her argument, respondent points to her testimony that she was adequately caring for her seven-week old infant, L.C., at the time of the termination hearing. However, the evidence showed that respondent had failed to address the conditions that led to T.D.C.'s removal in the first place. In addition, respondent was living in a home in which it was inappropriate for T.D.C. to live. Therefore, despite respondent's ability to adequately care for L.C., we find that there was a probability of a repetition of neglect of T.D.C. Considering T.D.C.'s neglected status in the light of the history of neglect, the lack of changed circumstances, and the probability of a repetition of neglect, we find that there was clear, cogent, and convincing evidence supporting the trial court's finding of fact and conclusion of law that respondent neglected T.D.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Since we have determined that the trial court's findings support a conclusion that grounds for termination existed under N.C. Gen.

When the trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law are read as a whole, it is clear which ground for termination was applicable to each parent.

Respondent again points to her testimony that she was adequately caring for L.C. at the time of the termination hearing. We do not find that this testimony showssufficient changed circumstances such that it would be in T.D.C.'s best interests not to terminate respondent's parental rights. Although respondent's testimony tends to show that she had not encountered any problems in caring for L.C., her seven-week old infant, the testimony does not indicate that the circumstances leading to T.D.C.'s removal from respondent's home had changed at all. Therefore, we do not find that the trial court abused its discretion in terminating respondent's parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Chief Judge MARTIN and Judge WYNN concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Report per Rule 30(e).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
