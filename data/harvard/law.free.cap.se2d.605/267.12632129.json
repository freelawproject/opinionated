We hold that any error at trial was non-prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The State presented evidence to show that in October 1994, Ballard and Maxine Satterfield (collectively, \"the victims\") were retired and resided on New Hope Road in Raleigh, North Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Around 4:30 p.m. on 29 October 1994, Bill Satterfield (\"Satterfield\"), the victims' adult son, visited his parents' house after his father failed to meet him for a scheduled golf game. Satterfield let himself in the back door of his parents' home with a key, walked upstairs, and observed some purses strewn across the bed and some papers on the floor. Satterfield discovered his father's body in the bedroom, covered by a bedspread and with a wound in his temple. Satterfield immediately called 911 and waited in the front yard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Law enforcement officers responded to the scene and found Mrs. Satterfield lying face down with her hands under her chest in the foyer inside the front door. She was grasping a small red booklet, described as a \"personal Bible,\" in her right hand. City-County Crime Bureau Crime Scene Investigator Herman Colvin (\"Investigator Colvin\") observed no sign of forced entry. The front door and storm door were closed, but unlocked. The house was neat and orderly, with the exception of one bedroom where a number of pocketbooks and papers were strewn on the bed. The pocketbooks were empty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Investigator Colvin recovered a .22 caliber shell casing near Mrs. Satterfield's right elbow and a second shell casing from the floor in the bedroom where Mr. Satterfield's body was located. Autopsies showed that the victims both died instantaneously from a single gunshot wound to the head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Three days later on 1 November 1994, Investigator Colvin found seven small red Bibles, similar to the one found in Mrs. Satterfield's hands, in a drainage ditch near the victims' and defendant's homes. Other similar Bibles were recovered fromseveral neighbors who had turned them into the police department after reading about the murders in the newspaper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Investigators found fingerprints belonging to J.M. on the door and on a wall in the victims' home. J.M. was fifteen-years-old and lived with his mother and brother, Germaine Miles, directly across the street from the victims' house. The victims had previously complained to their son about the kids across the street playing loud music. Germaine was also identified as a suspect because at one time, his friend Vance Boose, had possessed approximately thirteen of the red Bibles similar to the one found in Mrs. Satterfield's hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At trial, J.M. testified that he had pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of armed robbery as a result of his involvement in the victims' murders. J.M. and defendant were \"best friends.\" J.M. testified that around 10:00 a.m. on 29 October 1994, defendant visited J.M.'s house and displayed a small, black gun. Defendant stated, \"Get up, and let's go, to [the pool hall] or whatever.\" J.M. got out of his bed and walked outside with defendant. Defendant proceeded to put gloves on his hands as he walked across the street towards the victims' house. Defendant stated, \"I need to get something from these people.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant and J.M. walked up the victims' driveway, and defendant rang the doorbell. J.M. stood about four or five feet behind defendant. When Mrs. Satterfield answered the door, defendant handed her a little red Bible he had obtained from J.M.'shouse. After Mrs. Satterfield took the little red Bible, defendant brandished a gun to her head, entered the victims' home, and asked for her husband. J.M. followed defendant into the house and remained about three or four steps inside the victims' home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   J.M. overheard defendant scream \"real loud\" from upstairs and say, \"Wake up, old man.\" J.M. then heard one gunshot. Defendant ran back downstairs, asked Mrs. Satterfield for the keys, and shot her once in the head. Defendant asked J.M. if he \"[saw] anything [he] wanted.\" J.M. responded, \"No,\" and accompanied defendant up the stairs inside the house. Defendant and J.M. looked through some pocketbooks upstairs. J.M. found approximately twenty dollars, which he kept. Upon defendant's request, J.M. went into the other bedroom to \"see if the old man [was] dead.\" Defendant and J.M. also obtained some money from Mr. Satterfield's wallet, which was located in the room where his body was found. After defendant and J.M. exited the residence, defendant gave J.M. around forty-five to fifty dollars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Raleigh Police Department Detective Charlie Branch (\"Detective Branch\") testified regarding his investigation of the victims' murders. During his investigation, he met with J.M. because of fingerprints that matched J.M. were found in the victims' home. While at the police station, Detective Branch escorted J.M. to the restroom. Once inside, J.M. \"started crying . . . [and] mentioned that he would tell me who the person was that shot the Satterfields.\" J.M. wrote the name \"Ang\" on a sheet of paper and would not say the name aloud as he was \"afraid . . . of theconsequences.\" J.M. further stated he was afraid because he thought the \"Suicidal Town Gang\" would harm him or his family. J.M. \"[h]ung out with some of the guys in the gang,\" and stated that defendant was a member of that gang. Detective Branch testified that, according to J.M., \"to become a gang member, it was nothing to take a life. That was part of their initiation, to take a life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Other evidence was presented, including testimony by Investigator Colvin that he found six cartridges to a gun in defendant's bedroom. Investigator Colvin also took possession of a loaded . 22 long rifle semi-automatic pistol that defendant's brother had owned in October 1994. Defendant's brother remembered cleaning the gun near the day of the murders and he noticed two bullets were missing. At least two cartridges found in the weapon discovered by Investigator Colvin were identical to those found in defendant's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant presented evidence that none of the latent fingerprints collected from the victims' home belonged to him. The jury convicted defendant on all counts. The trial court sentenced defendant to two consecutive life sentences without parole for the first-degree murder convictions and also sentenced him for sixty-nine to ninety-two months for each armed robbery, to be served concurrently with the two life sentences. After this Court granted defendant's motion for\n   <em>\n    writ of certiorari,\n   </em>\n   defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The issues on appeal are whether the trial court erred by: (1) giving an additional instruction on acting in concert after the jury had been instructed and retired to deliberate; (2) admitting photographs depicting young Asian men displaying weapons in a gangster-type style that was seized from defendant's bedroom; and (3) allowing Detective Branch to testify to J.M.'s statement that initiation to the \"Suicidal Town Gang\" required taking a life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Jury Instructions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Acting In Concert\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The State did not request and the trial court did not give an instruction on acting in concert as a possible theory of guilt. However, after the jury charge, the State asked why the trial court did not instruct on acting in concert as part of the felony murder charge. Defendant objected and stated, \"I would have objected to the acting in concert instruction had it been offered to be presented to the jury.\" The trial court responded that no such instruction had been given because the State failed to timely request it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   During jury deliberations, the jury presented a question to the court that stated, \"If Ange [sic] was found not guilty, what if any changes could be made in [J.M.]'s plea bargain transcript?\" After the jury had asked the question but prior to bringing the jury back into the courtroom, the trial court stated to counsel that it would instruct on acting in concert. Although defendant had objected when the State originally requested the instruction after the trial court had instructed the jury, defendant did notrenew or preserve his objection. After bringing the jury back into the courtroom, the trial court responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Members of the jury, this is not a question that's before you. We're here trying to find facts to make a determination as to whether or not the defendant is guilty or not guilty of that which he has been charged with. I am unable to answer your question because I do not engage in plea bargaining; this is a matter between the defendant and the State. So I have no answer for you to that charge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   However, in lieu of that question . . . , I'd like to give an additional charge which was requested as soon as we had left the Court earlier, and perhaps this will shed some light and help you in your decision process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The charge is acting in concert. For a person to be guilty of a crime, it is not necessary that he himself to [sic] do all of the acts necessary to constitute the crime. If two or more persons act together with a common purpose to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon and are actually or actively or constructively present at the time the crimes are committed, each of them is responsible for the acts of the other done in the commission of robbery with a dangerous weapon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   So I charge that if you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that on or about the alleged date, Ang Xanonh, acting either by himself or acting together with [J.M.], had in his possession a firearm and took and carried away property from the person and the presence of the person without his voluntary consent by endangering or threatening the life with the use or threatened use of a firearm, the defendant, knowing that he was not entitled to take the property and intending to deprive that person of its use permanently, it would be your duty to return a verdict of guilty of robbery with a firearm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Following this instruction and while the jury was still deliberating, the trial court acknowledged that defendant had notconsented to the instruction and that it \"want[ed] the record to reflect that [the trial judge] did it on [his] own motion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant does not argue the instruction on acting in concert was unsupported by the evidence. Defendant argues that by framing the instruction on acting in concert as a direct response to the jury's question about what would happen to J.M. if defendant were acquitted, the trial court directly signaled to the jury that it should convict defendant of the charges against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Expression of Opinion by Trial Judge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A trial judge is prohibited from expressing an opinion in the presence of the jury regarding any question of fact to be decided by the jury. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1222 (2003). \"In evaluating whether a judge's comments cross into the realm of impermissible opinion, a totality of the circumstances test is utilized.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The objectionable language must be viewed in light of all the facts and circumstances, \"and unless it is apparent that such infraction of the rules might reasonably have had a prejudicial effect on the result of the trial, the error will be considered harmless.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

The photographs, which were not included in the record on appeal, were described by the prosecutor outside the presence of the jury as depicting young men, mostly Asian or Laotian, displaying weapons in \"a very gangster-type style.\" The trial court admitted the photographs, over defendant's objection, because they had been \"authenticated as matters that were found in [defendant's] room, and [the] purpose for allowing it is they were found in the room - in the same room the weapon was in, and that he occupied that room. . . .

Excluding Detective Branch's testimony that initiation into the \"Suicidal Town Gang\" required \"taking a life,\" the State presented other overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt.

Defendant failed to renew his objection to the acting in concert instruction. The trial court did not err byadmitting the photographs found in defendant's bedroom. The trial court erred in admitting hearsay statements during Detective Branch's testimony. J.M. testified and was cross-examined by defendant's counsel. The trial court's error does not constitute plain error and does not warrant a new trial.
