Smith (\"petitioner\"). For the reasons discussed herein, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The facts and procedural history pertinent to the instant appeal are as follows: On 14 October 1999, petitioner filed a contested case petition with the Office of Administrative Hearings, alleging that respondent denied petitioner a promotion based upon discriminatory and impermissible selection factors. In the spring of 2002, petitioner's case was heard before an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"). Petitioner, a forty-three-year-old African-American female, argued that respondent denied her a promotion in favor ofBert Basabe (\"Basabe\"), a thirty-eight-year-old Hispanic male. Petitioner alleged that respondent based its decision to select Basabe on petitioner's race, color, sex, and age. After hearing testimony and receiving evidence from both parties, the ALJ concluded that petitioner had failed to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case on any of the alleged grounds of discrimination. The ALJ also concluded that petitioner had failed to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of retaliation, and had failed to demonstrate a disparate impact in the hiring processes of respondent. In an order filed 14 July 2000, the ALJ recommended that the State Personnel Commission (\"SPC\") affirm respondent's decision not to promote petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After considering the ALJ's recommended decision, the SPC concluded that petitioner had failed to meet her burden of proving that respondent had discriminated against her on the basis of race, color, sex, or age. In an order filed 12 January 2001, the SPC adopted the ALJ's findings of fact and conclusions of law, thereby affirming respondent's decision not to promote petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Petitioner appealed the SPC's decision to the superior court. After considering oral and written arguments from the parties, the trial court concluded that the SPC had failed to apply the proper legal standard to petitioner's claim. Specifically, the trial court concluded that the SPC had failed to consider applicable case law in reaching its decision, most notably the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prod.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413371\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/133/\">\n    530 U.S. 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413371\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/133/\">\n    147 L. Ed. 2d 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). The trial court also examined the merits of petitioner's claim, and in an order entered 18 September 2002, the trial court reversed the SPC's decision and held that petitioner had sufficiently demonstrated claims of race, color, age, and sex discrimination. It is from this order that respondent appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The issues on appeal are whether the trial court erred by: (I) choosing to apply the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review; and (II) concluding that the SPC decision contained errors of law. We note initially that \"an appellate court's obligation to review a superior court order examining an agency decision `can be accomplished by addressing the dispositive issue(s) before the agency and the superior court without examining the scope of review utilized by the superior court.'\"\n   <em>\n    Shackleford-Moten v.

Petitioner has been certified as an histology technician, and she has experience embedding, sectioning, and staining human tissue for analysis. Based upon her testimony,petitioner appears to have a thorough understanding of the histology laboratory's functions and operations.

In his application for the position, Basabe twice listed his race as Hispanic, once on the form granting respondent authority to conduct a background check, and once on the applicant log kept by respondent's personnel department. Basabe testified at trial that he was born in Quito, Ecuador, and considered himself \"Spanish.\" He noted that petitioner had referred to him as \"Latino\" and that he had marked that he is Hispanic on his application, but that \"they are the same.\" In its recommended decision adopted by the SPC, the ALJ, who witnessed Basabe at the hearing, found that \"Mr. Bert Basabe is a Hispanic male with light brown-colored skin, who was thirty-nine years old on June 15, 1999.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Basabe was born in Quito,Ecuador.\" Our courts have previously recognized that Hispanic individuals are members of a protected group.\n   <em>\n    Alvarado,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1138436\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/928/118/#p121\">\n    928 F.2d at 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    EEOC v.

A review of the record indicates that respondent routinely promotes individuals over the age of forty, including two of the individuals involved in interviewing petitioner. Petitioner failed to produce any competent evidence tending to show that age was a factor in respondent's decision. Thus, petitioner failed to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of discrimination based upon age, and the trial court erred in concluding to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   With respect to petitioner's claim of discrimination based upon sex, because Basabe is male and petitioner is female, we conclude that petitioner did establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case.

In its memorandum decision, the trial court concluded that respondent's interview procedure runs counter to the General Provisions of the North Carolina Administrative Code. Specifically, the trial court determined that the interview process violated the requirements of 25 N.C.A.C. 1H. 0606, which requires that a promotion be \"based upon a relative consideration of [applicants'] qualifications for the position to be filed\" and that employers \"reasonably document hiring decisions to verify\" that \"advantage\" was \"given to applicants determined to be most qualified[.]\" The trial court further determined that respondent failed to consider properly the qualifications of the applicants.

In\n   <em>\n    Hodge,\n   </em>\n   we rejected an employer's explanation that it based its promotion decision on the scores achieved by applicants in an interview process similar to the oneused in the instant case. We first noted that \"[t]he committee's interview was the only part of the application process in which Hodge was rated less qualified than another candidate, and its rankings contradict Hodge's achievements on objective tests evaluating his knowledge of the same subjects tested in the interview.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 613,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=394%20S.E.2d%20285\">\n    394 S.E.2d at 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on these facts, we concluded that \"[t]he State's use of the interview as the sole criteria for not promoting Hodge contravened its own system of promotion, in which the State used the interview as one item that carried more weight than all of the other items of evaluation combined.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=394%20S.E.2d%20285\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We conclude that\n   <em>\n    Hodge\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Unlike\n   <em>\n    Hodge,\n   </em>\n   in the instant case, respondent had consistently utilized the interview process since 1991, and therefore its decision to implement the process did not contravene its own system of promotion. Furthermore, the interview process was not the only part of the promotion decision in which Basabe was rated more qualified. Although the evidence presented tends to show that petitioner had twenty-three years of histology and related experience while Basabe had sixteen years of histology and related experience, the evidence also tends to show that the interviewers were more impressed with the nature of Basabe's experience. Prior to being interviewed, both Basabe and petitioner submitted applications for the position, which were reviewed by the interviewers prior to interviewing the applicants. At the ALJ hearing, Dr. Mary Iacocca (\"Iacocca\"), the medical director forhistology and one of the individuals who interviewed the candidates, testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   THE COURT: And then, I have that you - could you tell me - or qualify your testimony about what their qualifications were, your opinion of the three applicants' qualifications as far as their histology experience?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   THE WITNESS: Based on my experience or based on what I read off their applications?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   THE COURT: Applications. Before the interview.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   THE WITNESS: I remember making a note that [Basabe] had trained at the [Armed Forces Institute of Pathology], which, in pathology, has a very good reputation, and that he also worked in a private lab. . . . And I was aware of [petitioner's] recent history of employment, in that she had been in electron microscopy . . . and then had been in histology for the last several years at UNC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   THE COURT: Had you at that point had any opinion whether they were qualified, not making any final decision, but how their qualifications ranked before the interview?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   . . . .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   THE WITNESS: If I had to give my personal feeling about qualifications simply on histology experience, I would say the length of time actually in the histology lab was very important to me. And so I would have ranked [Basabe] highly on that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In support of its explanation, respondent offered the \"interview guides\" of Howard Parker (\"Parker\"), the supervisor of the pathology laboratory, Michael McDade (\"McDade\"), the financial and compliance officer for the laboratory, and Beverly Jones (\"Jones\"), a cytotechnologist in the cytology laboratory. The interview guides contained the interviewer's notations of the applicant's answers, including the scaled ratings relied upon in reaching a decision. The interviewers testified at the hearing and explained the interview process thoroughly. The interview process was structured to allow each candidate to interview with a panel of three to four interviewers, and its aim was to select the most qualified candidate. The interviewers asked each candidate questions set forth in the interview guide and then rated the candidate's answers on a scale of one to five. Basabe averaged a score of four on his answers to the interview questions, while petitioner averaged a score of three on her answers. Thus, in light of the record in the instant case, we conclude that the explanation and evidence offered by respondent satisfied its burden. Accordingly, we now consider whether respondent's explanation was a mere pretext for sex discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As discussed above, after the employer articulates a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its hiring decision, the burden shifts to the claimant, who, in order to maintain a claim of discrimination, must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer's explanation is actually a pretext for discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Gibson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4707236\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/308/131/#p137\">\n    308 N.C. at 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=301%20S.E.2d%2078\">\n    301 S.E.2d at 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

She testified that Parker did not take women \"seriously,\" and that she did not believe Parker \"treated the women in the lab the same way [he] treat[ed] the men that are under his supervision.\" Petitioner asserts that Parker did not offer interview training to her or other females, or ask them if they wanted to be included on the computer implementation team. However, we note that petitioner's evidence is largely subjective, and, when considered in light of the evidence to the contrary, cannot reasonably be said to demonstrate that respondent's proffered explanation was a pretext for sex discrimination. Many of petitioner's fellow female co-workers were promoted, and one, Mary Parker (\"Mary Parker\"), was offered the Med Tech III position before it was ever posted. The laboratory had previously been supervised by women, and four of the six interviewers were women. In sum, petitioner's evidence is insufficient to establish that respondent intentionally discriminated against her based upon her sex. Thus, in light ofthe record in the instant case, we conclude that petitioner has failed to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that respondent's explanation for hiring Basabe was a pretext for sex discrimination. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court erred by determining that petitioner was discriminated against based upon her sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In light of the foregoing conclusions, we hold that petitioner has failed to establish a claim of discrimination and that the trial court erred in concluding that the SPC's decision was effected by errors of law.
