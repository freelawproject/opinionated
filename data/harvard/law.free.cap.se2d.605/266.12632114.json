We hold that defendant received a fair trial free from error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 31 July 2001, shortly after midnight, defendant and three of his friends, Hasan Echols (\"Echols\"), Brandon Morton (\"Morton\"), and Edwin Pickett (\"Pickett\") decided to \"go and rob someone for their marijuana or money or whatever we could get from them.\" Pickett testified that upon arriving at a parking lot, he hadreservations because the neighborhood was located in a low-income housing development called Brandywood Apartments. He \"didn't figure they had too much money . . . so [he] was kind of second guessing it.\" Pickett also testified that defendant \"told us they had piles of marijuana in the house\" and \"convinced us\" to continue with the plan. Defendant and Pickett possessed . 22 caliber pistols, and Morton was armed with a twelve gauge shotgun. Defendant, Echols, and Morton entered the apartment, while Pickett remained outside of the apartment to urinate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Phillip Styles (\"Styles\") testified he lived in Brandywood and was talking on the telephone to his girlfriend on the sidewalk outside of his apartment. Defendant approached Styles and asked where he could find Livingston Mitchell (\"Mitchell\"), who was Styles's brother. Styles informed defendant that Mitchell was \"in the house,\" and asked, \"what's your name?\" Defendant responded, \"Tae.\" Styles \"put two and two together, put his face and name together,\" and knew \"that's Donte.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As defendant and Styles approached the apartment, Styles felt something on the back of his head and heard defendant say, \"give it up.\" Styles turned around and saw defendant brandishing a gun with a white handle, as well as another man with a shotgun. A \"bigger dude\" approached Styles and took his watch, cordless telephone, cellular phone, and pager. Styles only remembered seeing three people. Defendant ordered Styles to enter the apartment. Styles entered his apartment, went immediately back to his mother's room and closed the door. Styles told his mother, \"[C]all the cops, I think somebody is in the house to rob us.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mitchell, who was present in the living room with Howell, testified that he observed defendant and two other people enter his house. Mitchell grabbed his glasses, \"balled up his fist[,] and put it up.\" One of the men struck him in the side of his face with the butt of the shotgun. Mitchell fell onto the floor beside the couch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After hearing some glass break, Styles looked outside the door to his mother's room, observed his brother Mitchell drop to the floor, and closed the door. Styles called some friends for assistance and then called the police. Defendant kicked in the door to Styles's mother's room and pointed the gun towards Styles and his mother. Defendant asked Styles if he was calling the police, and Styles hung up the telephone. Styles moved in front of his mother, and defendant exited the room. Styles followed defendant out of the room and towards the front door. Styles testified, \"[B]efore [defendant] was leaving out the door, he turned around and shot Fred [Howell] in the chest, [and] just walked out of the house.\" Styles observed Howell slide out of the seat \"real slow\" and fall to the floor. Police arrived at Styles's apartment shortly thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Pickett testified that after he finished urinating, he entered the apartment. Echols and Morton were standing in the living room near the door. After closing the door, Pickett observed a bodylying on the floor and saw another person's legs. The couch blocked Pickett's view of the rest of the body. After defendant walked towards the back of the apartment and kicked open a door, Pickett heard a woman scream. When defendant began talking to Styles inside the house, Pickett \"realized [it was] time for me to leave.\" He opened the door and ran towards the vehicle. Echols and Morton followed Pickett back to the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On their way back to the vehicle, Pickett heard a single shot. Defendant emerged from the apartment and informed Pickett that he shot \"Fred, the guy that was on the couch.\" The men then \"took the guns . . . to a friend's house and hid them . . . .\" This house was identified as the residence of Jermaine Gillard (\"Gillard\") and Lavar Drummond (\"Drummond\"). Gillard overheard one of the men tell defendant that \"you should have never shot him.\" Defendant responded, \"he shouldn't have had a beef.\" Gillard testified that \"beef\" meant a \"problem.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Drummond later turned one revolver over to the Jacksonville Police Department. Jacksonville Police Officer Clifton McQueen (\"Officer McQueen\") later recovered another weapon. Officer McQueen also testified that while serving as a School Resource Officer at Jacksonville High School, he observed Howell and defendant during \"an altercation\" where they were verbally insulting one another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   An autopsy of Howell revealed a chest wound caused by a .22 caliber bullet, which was recovered from the body. Medicalexaminer Dr. Charles Garrett testified Howell bled to death from the gunshot wound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The jury convicted defendant of first-degree murder on the basis of malice, premeditation, and deliberation and on the basis that the murder occurred during the perpetration of a felony. The jury also convicted defendant of second-degree kidnapping, conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon, first-degree burglary, and assault by pointing a gun. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The issues on appeal are whether the trial court erred by: (1) denying defendant's request to instruct the jury on second-degree murder; (2) denying defendant's motion to dismiss the charges of felony murder and second-degree kidnapping; (3) entering judgment and imposing consecutive sentences for both second-degree kidnapping and first-degree burglary because these offenses were used to establish the offense of felony murder; (4) allowing testimony that Gillard overheard an unknown man tell defendant, \"you should have never shot him;\" (5) denying defendant's request to instruct the jury regarding the testimony of a witness who testifies pursuant to a plea agreement with the State; (6) allowing testimony that defendant and Howell had engaged in an altercation at Jacksonville High School; and (7) denying defendant's motion to dismiss because the short-form indictment insufficiently informed him of the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Second-Degree Murder\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant argues the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of second-degree murder. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   First-degree murder is \"the intentional and unlawful killing of a human being with malice and with premeditation and deliberation;\" and second-degree murder is defined as \"the unlawful killing of a human being with malice, but without premeditation and deliberation.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Our Supreme Court has interpreted the phrase \"removal from one place to another\" to require a removal separate and apart from that which is an inherent, inevitable part of the commission of another felony. To permit separate and additional punishment where there has been only a technical asportation, inherent in the other offense perpetrated, would violate a defendant's constitutional protection against double jeopardy. In an armed robbery, for example, punishment for two offenses would be sanctioned if the victim was forced to walk a short distance towards the cash register or to move away from it to allow defendant access. Under such circumstances the victim is not exposed to greater danger than that inherent in the armed robbery itself, nor is he subjected to the kind of danger and abuse the kidnapping statute was designed to prevent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

We disagree. Defendant's prior altercation with the man he later shot could be indicative of his motive and ill-will, which is admissible evidence under Rule 404(b). Defendant does not argue the evidence was irrelevant. We are not persuaded the trial court abused its discretion inbalancing the probative value with the prejudicial effect. The trial court did not err in admitting evidence of a prior altercation between defendant and the victim. This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    IX.

Defendant has not identified any evidence that negates the elements of premeditation and deliberation. The trial court also did not err by: (1) denying defendant's motion to dismiss the charge of second-degree kidnapping and felony murder; (2) entering judgment and imposing sentences for both second-degree kidnapping and first-degree burglary, as defendant was also found to be guilty of murder in the first-degree on the basis of malice, premeditation, and deliberation; (3) admitting testimony by an unknown declarant that was an adoptive admission by defendant; (4) failing to instruct the jury regarding a witness who testified pursuant to a plea agreementwith the State; and (5) admitting testimony regarding a prior altercation between defendant and Howell, the decedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The short-form indictment sufficiently sets forth the charge for first-degree murder. We conclude defendant received a fair trial, free from the errors he assigned and argued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   No Error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Judges BRYANT and LEVINSON concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Report per Rule 30(e).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
