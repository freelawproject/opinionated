The trial court sentenced defendant to a mitigated sentence of 8-10 months imprisonment. This sentence was suspended, and defendant was placed on probation for 36 months. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Counsel appointed to represent defendant has been unable to identify any issue with sufficient merit to support a meaningful argument for relief on appeal, and asks that this Court conduct its own review of the record for possible prejudicial error. Counsel has also shown to the satisfaction of this Court that she has complied with the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Anders v.
