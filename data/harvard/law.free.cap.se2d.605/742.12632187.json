This appeal arises out of a dispute between Ms. Smith's underinsured motorist carrier, plaintiff North Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company (\"Farm Bureau\"), and Mr. Murrell's insurance carrier, Progressive Insurance Company (\"Progressive\"). Farm Bureau advanced payment of Mr. Murrell's policy limits to Ms. Smith and, in this action, sought reimbursement from Progressive. Farm Bureau appeals from the trial court's judgment, following a bench trial on stipulated facts, concluding that Farm Bureau's claim was barred by the statute of limitations. Farm Bureau seeks reversal on the grounds that the facts establish (1) an enforceable settlement agreement between the carriers, and (2) the defense of equitable estoppel. Because the stipulated facts support the trial court's conclusion that Farm Bureau did not accept Progressive's settlement offer in a reasonable time and that Farm Bureau did not prove the elements of equitable estoppel, we affirm the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties stipulated to the following facts. Mr. Murrell, who was at fault in the underlying automobile accident, was insured under a Progressive policy that had liability limits for bodily injury of $25,000.00 per person and $50,000.00 per accident. Ms. Smith was insured under a Farm Bureau policy that provided underinsured motorist (\"UIM\") coverage in an amount exceeding the liability limits of the Progressive policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the accident, Ms. Smith asserted a claim for damages against Mr. Murrell, as well as a claim under the Farm Bureau policy for UIM benefits. In February 2000, Progressive tendered its policy limits of $25,000.00 to Ms. Smith as a proposed compromise settlement. Farm Bureau, as the UIM carrier, was provided with written notice of Progressive's tender of liability limits. On 18 February 2000, Farm Bureau advanced the $25,000.00 liability limits to Ms. Smith, thereby preserving its subrogation rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2020-279.21\">\n    N.C.

In consideration of that payment, Ms. Smith executed a release of Farm Bureau.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 19 June 2000, John S. Gray, a claims representative for Farm Bureau, sent a letter to Gloria Solomon, a claims representative for Progressive, notifying Progressive of the settlement with Ms. Smith and requesting that Progressive reimburse Farm Bureau for the advanced payment by Farm Bureau to Ms. Smith. When Progressive failed to respond, Mr. Gray sent a second letter to the same effect on 27 July 2000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On 29 August 2000, Albert A. Arredondo, a claims representative for Progressive, responded to Mr. Gray's correspondence, offering to pay $24,845.50 - the $25,000.00 liability limit less $154.50 advanced by Progressive - to Farm Bureau in exchange for (1) the signing by Farm Bureau of an enclosed release and (2) proof of payment of the $25,000.00 to Ms. Smith. Mr. Gray responded to Mr. Arredondo's correspondence in a6 September 2000 letter, stating that Farm Bureau was unwilling to sign the release provided by Mr. Arredondo with its current wording and insisting on reimbursement for the full $25,000.00. Mr. Gray suggested that his prior correspondence substitute for a release. In a letter dated 28 September 2000, Mr. Arredondo replied, \"I have reviewed your September 6, 2000 letter with management and we agree with you up to a point.\" Progressive stated that it would not require Farm Bureau to sign a full release, but it would require Ms. Smith to do so. Mr. Arredondo enclosed another release for Ms. Smith's signature, and repeated that Progressive would pay \"the remainder of [Progressive's] policy limits\" to Farm Bureau\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   upon the return of the release signed and dated by Ms. Smith. Progressive received no response to Mr. Arredondo's 28 September 2000 letter, and Farm Bureau did not return the release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The three-year statute of limitations on Ms. Smith's claims ran on 15 November 2000. Progressive heard nothing further from Farm Bureau until April 2001, when Mr. Gray contacted Mr. Arredondo and requested that Progressive make payment of $25,000.00 to Farm Bureau. On 18 April 2001, Mr. Arredondo notified Farm Bureau that no payment would be made without proof that the statute of limitations had been tolled. Finally, on 25 May 2001, Farm Bureau provided to Progressive a copy of a \"Full Release Of All Claims With Indemnity\" signed by Ms. Smith. The release did not state when Ms. Smith actually signed it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On 28 August 2001, plaintiffs filed this action, alleging motor vehicle negligence and breach of contract and seeking adeclaratory judgment. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment that the trial court denied. The case was tried to the Honorable Ernest B. Fullwood in a bench trial on stipulated facts. Judge Fullwood entered judgment in favor of defendants on 11 June 2003. Plaintiffs filed timely notice of appeal to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, the standard of review from a judgment entered after a non-jury trial is \"whether there is competent evidence to support the trial court's findings of fact and whether the findings support the conclusions of law and ensuing judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Sessler v.

This Court has held that when an insured's action is time-barred, the UIM carrier's action is time-barred as well because, in a subrogation action, the insurer succeeds only to the rights of the insured and no new cause of action is created.\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Mut.

Thus, to theextent that Ms. Smith's claims against Mr. Murrell are barred by the statute of limitations, Farm Bureau's subrogation claims are also barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   It is undisputed that the statute of limitations on Ms. Smith's claims expired on 15 November 2000. Since Farm Bureau did not file suit until 28 August 2001, its subrogation claim would ordinarily be barred. Farm Bureau argues, however, that the statute of limitations does not bar Farm Bureau's subrogation claim because (1) it entered into an enforceable settlement agreement with Progressive, or, alternatively, (2) if no agreement exists, Progressive is equitably estopped from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Existence of a Settlement Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   With respect to the existence of a settlement agreement between the carriers, the trial court concluded that \"there was never any meeting of the minds of the parties with regard to the terms of any alleged contract to settle Farm Bureau's subrogation claims.\" Accordingly, the trial court ruled that \"[t]here is no existing contract between Progressive and Farm Bureau pursuant to which Farm Bureau is entitled to recovery of any damages from defendants Progressive or Mr. Murrell as a result of the November 15, 1997 accident between plaintiff Ms. Smith, and Mr. Murrell.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"It is axiomatic that a valid contract between two parties can only exist when the parties 'assent to the same thing in the same sense, and their minds meet as to all terms.'\"\n   <em>\n    Normile v.

Farm Bureau contends that a contract was formed in September 2000 through the series of letters between the carriers from June to September 2000. The findings of fact, however, establish that Farm Bureau did not accept Progressive's offer during the summer of 2000. In its 6 September 2000 letter, Farm Bureau rejected Progressive's offer to pay $24,845.50 in exchange for a release from Farm Bureau when it refused to sign the requested release and insisted on payment of the full $25,000.00. Progressive then made a second offer on 28 September 2000, proposing to pay \"the remainder of [Progressive's] policy limits\" in exchange for a full release from Ms. Smith in the form enclosed. Progressive stressed: \"Note that we will only pay out the remainder of our policy limits of $25,000.00 to Farm Bureau upon [the release's] return, signed and dated by your insured Katie Smith.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At this point, there was an outstanding offer in the form of Progressive's 28 September 2000 letter that Farm Bureau had not yet accepted. Farm Bureau could have accepted the offer by returning the signed release, but it did not do so until May 2001.\n   <em>\n    See Koppers Co. v. Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem.

O. Pangle\" was held to be an acceptance of an offer to purchase real property. The Court stated that \"[w]here an offer is squarely accepted in positive terms, the addition of a statement relating to the ultimate performance of the contract does not make the acceptance conditional and prevent the formation of the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 540,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20S.E.2d%20888\">\n    85 S.E.2d at 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With respect to the telegram, the Court observed, \"[t]he defendant's acceptance of the offer was positive.

Farm Bureau had flatly refused to sign a release on its own behalf, as requested in Progressive's first offer, and then did not communicate any agreement to having Ms. Smith sign the second proposed release. The question of the release did not relate \"merely to the working out of the details of performance,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=85%20S.E.2d%20888\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   but instead went to the heart of the contract. The wording of the release was at the core of the negotiations and was an issue on which the parties disagreed. Moreover, there was also a dispute as to the amount to be paid by Progressive. Progressive offered to pay $24,845.50, while Farm Bureau insisted on $25,000.00. Even though the difference is the modest amount of$154.50, we cannot say that the lack of agreement as to the amount to be paid involved an immaterial term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Here, the material terms of the settlement were the amount to be paid by Progressive and the release to be provided by Farm Bureau. Since neither of these terms was finally agreed upon in the series of letters in the summer of 2000, the trial court properly concluded there was no settlement agreement between the carriers as of September 2000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Farm Bureau alternatively contends that, even if there was no contract formed in September 2000, it accepted Progressive's 28 September 2000 offer by returning the release in May 2001. The trial court, however, concluded that Farm Bureau did not accept the 28 September 2000 counteroffer within a reasonable time. We agree with the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"`As a general rule, where no time is fixed for the termination of a contract it will continue for a reasonable time,\n   <em>\n    taking into account the purposes that the parties intended to accomplish\n   </em>\n   . . . .'\"\n   <em>\n    City of Gastonia v.

Here, Farm Bureau did not send Progressive a copy of the release signed by Ms. Smith until 25 May 2001. By that time, the statute of limitations period had run, and the condition included in Progressive's offer - the release - was no longer meaningful.

The factual findings indicate a course of conduct by Stainback, through his attorney, which misled Duke. The actions and statements of Stainback's attorney caused Duke to reasonably believe that it would receive its payment for services rendered once the case between Stainback and Investors was concluded, and such belief reasonably caused Duke to foregoing pursuing its legal remedy against Stainback. The actions and statements of Stainback lulled Duke into a false sense of security.

In this case, by contrast, Farm Bureau does not point to any representations or actions of Progressive that were of such a nature as would reasonably lull Farm Bureau into forgoing its legal remedy. Indeed, Mr. Arredondo stated in his 28 September 2000 letter that \"[Progressive] will\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   pay out the remainder of our policy limits of $25,000.00 to Farm Bureau upon [the release's] return, signed and dated by your insured Katie Smith.\" (Emphasis added.)
