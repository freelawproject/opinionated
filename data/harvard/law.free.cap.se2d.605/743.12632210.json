For the reasons discussed herein, we find he received a fair trial free from prejudicial error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Tywan DeAngelo Parks (Parks), the victim, testified that on 7 November 2002, he arrived at the Playground nightclub at approximately 10:30 p.m. After sitting for \"a while,\" he went to the bathroom, where he saw four or five guys standing by the entrance. Parks bumped into one of the men, who was wearing a tan jacket. The man reached into Parks' pocket. As Parks removed the man's hand from his pocket, the man threw a punch. A second member of the group then threw a punch at Parks. After being hit two orthree times, Parks tried to leave the bathroom. Defendant, clad in a blue hat and jacket, pulled a gun on Parks and told him that \"it was [] a hold up[.]\" Afraid of the gun, Parks stopped, whereupon he was struck in the head and lost consciousness. Although he thought defendant delivered this blow with the gun, he was not certain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When Parks came to, he was bleeding from the nose and from a gash on his head and was missing $327.00 in cash, his identification card, gold necklace, wristwatch, and cell phone, which was wrapped with a piece of black electrical tape. When Parks finally left the bathroom, he walked out of the nightclub and into the parking lot. \"[S]tanding [at] the corner of the building\" were the men who had robbed him, including defendant. Parks approached a police officer and pointed toward his assailants. As the officer approached the men in his patrol car, \"they ran around the side of the building.\" The officer later returned with Parks' cell phone and identification card, which the State introduced into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Goldsboro Police Officer Bryan Belden testified that Parks approached his patrol car in the Playground parking lot and claimed \"that he was robbed at gunpoint in the bathroom and beaten[.]\" Parks was \"as upset as he could be[,]\" his face was bloody, and he was holding a rag or shirt to his head to stop the bleeding. When Parks pointed out the group of four or five men as the robbers, Officer Belden pulled his car toward the corner of the building and radioed for backup. Officer Belden proceeded down Williams Streetto Hooks River Road where he saw defendant walking towards Victor Place. Defendant was wearing a dark colored jacket. Exiting his car, Officer Belden ordered defendant to stop and took him into custody. Upon a search of defendant's person, the officer found Parks' cell phone and identification card, $70.00 in cash, and a second cell phone. Arnold Thorton, Jr. and Anthony Barnes were apprehended by other officers. A fourth suspect eluded capture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Officer Belden placed defendant in the back seat of his patrol car and drove back to the Playground parking lot, where Parks instantly identified defendant as \"the guy that hit me with the gun[.]\" Parks further identified his cell phone, noting the tape around the antenna.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Officer Belden read to the jury the written statement he prepared on the night of the incident, which recorded Parks' report \"that he was robbed and beaten in the men's room inside the Playground at gunpoint\" and Parks' subsequent identification of defendant, his cell phone, and identification card. Officer Belden's report further noted Parks' identification of Thorton as \"one of the men that beat and robbed him at gunpoint[,]\" and Thorton's possession of $322.00 in cash at the time of his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant testified on his own behalf and gave his account of the events that occurred on the night of 7 November 2002. Defendant testified that he went to the Playground nightclub with Roderick Ayers. He sat at the bar with Ayers and drank three or four beers. Defendant denied robbing or assaulting Parks in the bathroom and also denied having a gun. Defendant stated that heentered the club with $95.00, and left with $70.00 after spending $25.00 over the course of the evening. He said he found Parks' identification card on top of the bar and decided to keep the card for his personal use, because his own driver's license had been suspended. Defendant further testified that after leaving Ayers at the bar, he walked outside and saw a fight in the parking lot. He asserted that towards the end of the fight, Parks and Barnes exchanged blows before Barnes took off running. He also claimed that as the police were chasing the participants, he spotted two cell phones on the ground and picked them up. When the police told everyone to leave, defendant walked away from the nightclub and was stopped by an officer on Herman Street. Defendant insisted he did not take part in the fight, did not know or speak to any of the people involved, and would not even have thought about fighting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In rebuttal, the State re-called Officer Belden, who testified that he arrived in the Playground parking lot just as Parks was walking out of the front door, and that defendant was already outside on the sidewalk of the building. Officer Belden saw no one fighting in the parking lot. Upon speaking with Parks, Officer Belden immediately proceeded towards defendant in his patrol car. Defendant was apprehended within two minutes of Parks' report of the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In defendant's fourth assignment of error he contends the trial court committed error, or plain error, in failing to instruct the jury on common law robbery as a lesser included offense of robbery with a dangerous weapon. Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo,\n   </em>\n   that defendantproperly preserved this issue for our review, we find it to have no merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The trial court must instruct the jury on any lesser included offense which is supported by the evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Parks described a robbery in the club's bathroom, during which defendant prevented his escape by brandishing a handgun. Although Parks was uncertain whether the gun was used to deliver the blow which knocked him unconscious, he expressed no uncertainty as to defendant's possession of a gun. Parks' testimony was corroborated by his statement to Officer Belden immediately following the incident that he was robbed at gunpoint in the bathroom, and by his identification of defendant at the scene as \"the guy that hit me with the gun[.]\" Absent any evidence to the contrary that the object drawn by defendant in the club's bathroom was a gun, \"there is a mandatory presumption that the weapon was as it appeared to the victim to be[,]\" a gun.\n   <em>\n    State v.
