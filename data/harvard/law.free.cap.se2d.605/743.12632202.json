At approximately 1:00 p.m. on that date, Eastwood's vehicle collided with the vehicle being driven by plaintiff Sana O'Beid. On 16 October 2001, O'Beid filed a complaint against Eastwood and Lightning Bolt Services alleging negligence and seeking damages for personal injuries alleged to consist of a mild head injury and resulting post traumatic stress disorder. Following a trial, the matter was submitted to a jury at 3:37 p.m.on 17 September 2003. The jury returned a verdict in defendants' favor at 4:04 p.m. on the same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff made a motion for a new trial pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1A-1, Rule 59(a)(1), (2), (5), and (9). The trial court denied this motion by an order entered 5 January 2004 and entered a final judgment in defendants' favor on 29 January 2004. Plaintiff appeals from the 5 January 2004 order denying her motion for a new trial. She has not given notice of appeal from the final judgment entered 29 January 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In her first argument on appeal, plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in denying her motion for a new trial where, during the trial, the trial court made some \"unintentional remarks\" to the jury about an impending hurricane. According to plaintiff, these remarks caused the jury to spend too little time deliberating and prevented a fair and impartial verdict. Though the transcript is devoid of any such remarks made by the trial judge in the presence of the jury, plaintiff offers her husband's affidavit as evidence that the trial court made the challenged comments and insists that such remarks were inadvertently omitted by the court reporter. We are unpersuaded that the trial court erred in denying plaintiff's motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 59(a) (2003) provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   [a] new trial may be granted to all or any of the parties . . . for any of the following causes or grounds:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (1) Any irregularity by which any party was prevented from having a fair trial;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (2) Misconduct of the jury or prevailing party;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   . . . .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (5) Manifest disregard by the jury of the instructions of the court;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   . . . .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (9) Any other reason heretofore recognized as grounds for new trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Our Supreme Court has described the standard of review of a trial court's denial of a motion for a new trial as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Appellate review is strictly limited to the determination of whether the record affirmatively demonstrates a manifest abuse of discretion by the judge. The trial court's discretion is practically unlimited. A discretionary order pursuant to N.C.G.S. 1A-1, Rule 59 for or against a new trial upon any ground may be reversed on appeal only in those exceptional cases where an abuse of discretion is clearly shown. A manifest abuse of discretion must be made to appear from the record as a whole with the party alleging the existence of an abuse bearing that heavy burden of proof. An appellate court should not disturb a discretionary Rule 59 order unless it is reasonably convinced by the cold record that the trial judge's ruling probably amounted to a substantial miscarriage of justice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Campbell v. Pitt County Memorial Hosp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2569131\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/321/260/#p264\">\n    321 N.C. 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 264-65,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=362%20S.E.2d%20273\">\n    362 S.E.2d 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 275-76 (1987) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). In the criminal context, our Supreme Court has stated that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   shortness of time in deliberating a verdict . . . in and of itself, simply does not constitute grounds for setting aside a verdict. The brevity of deliberation should only be questioned if there is evidence of some misconduct on the part of the jury or the trial judge believes that the jury acted witha contemptuous or flagrant disregard of its duties in considering the matters submitted to it for decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In her second argument on appeal, plaintiff contends that the trial court erred by cautioning her attorney not to refer to O'Beid's psychiatrist, Dr. Yongue, as an expert accepted by the court. As we must, we treat this contention as an argument that the trial court erred by failing to grant a new trial due to the challenged admonition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, plaintiff did not assert the trial court's cautionary comment as a basis for a new trial in the motion she filed with the trial court. It is elementary that \"[a] contention not raised in the trial court may not be raised for the first time on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Town of Chapel Hill v.
