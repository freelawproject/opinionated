(\"DLI\") liable for breach of express warranty, breach of the implied warranty of workmanlike construction, and fraud in connection with the construction of a house for plaintiffs Timothy D. Shafman and Mary C. Donlon. Defendants appeal from the judgment and the order denying their post-trial motions, arguing primarilythat the record contains insufficient evidence of fraud and, with respect to the warranty claims, that the trial court erred in admitting evidence regarding another house constructed by defendants. Based on our review of the record, we hold (1) that the trial court properly denied defendants' directed verdict and post-trial motions with respect to fraud and (2) that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the probative value of the evidence of the other house to prove defendants' intent, knowledge, and plan outweighed the evidence's prejudicial effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs cross-appealed from the trial court's entry of a directed verdict on their unfair and deceptive trade practices claim and refusal, following trial, to treble the fraud damages awarded by the jury.

Shafman and Mary C. Donlon, who are married, entered into a contract to buy a house tobe built by DLI in Durham, North Carolina. Defendant Donald Larson is president of DLI and, at that time, held a limited residential general contractor's license. In 1999,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2087-10\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 87-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (1999) provided that \"the holder of a limited license shall be entitled to act as general contractor for any single project with a value of up to two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) . . . .\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The parties' contract specified that the price of the house was $425,000. Attached to the contract was a \"New Construction Addendum\" that provided: \"Seller represents and certifies that the name of the duly licensed general contractor who constructed the improvements on the property is Donald Larson.\" The addendum contained a one-year warranty:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Seller will make all necessary repairs and corrections to the House, either interior or exterior, structural or nonstructural, that shall become necessary by reason of faulty construction, labor or materials or non-conformity of construction to the Plans and Specifications.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Larson signed the addendum for DLI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On 22 June 1999, Mr. Larson, acting for DLI, submitted a building permit application to the Orange County Planning &amp; Inspections Department. Mr. Larson stated on the application that the \"total cost of construction,\" excluding the cost of land, was $220,000. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Larson, in seeking aconstruction loan from Central Carolina Bank, gave the bank an estimate of \"a total construction cost of $300,000.\" The bank ultimately loaned DLI $320,000 because the estimate had not included site costs. During construction, defendants obtained a second loan for $32,000. A loan officer at defendants' bank testified that the bank obtained an appraisal of the property in which the value of the house and lot upon completion was estimated at $425,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A certificate of occupancy was issued on 20 December 1999. At closing on the same date, plaintiffs paid $13,000 more than the purchase price of $425,000 because of overages. After closing, plaintiffs sent defendants an e-mail concerning uncompleted \"punch list\" items. Plaintiffs also began noticing signs of defects, including cracks in the walls, pooling of water in the driveway and elsewhere on the property, and overflowing gutters. In August 2000, eight months after plaintiffs moved into the house, Dr. Shafman called Mr. Larson to ask that the defects be repaired. Mr. Larson told him he was not going to repair the defects and hung up on him. Defendants did not make the requested repairs after that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At trial, various witnesses testified as to defects in the construction of the house and the paving. Engineer Thomas S. Gregory testified that the house had a major structural defect: the steel beams in the basement and garage were undersized and did not meet minimum design standards established by the North Carolina Building Code. Mr. Gregory testified that the presence of the beams in the house could result in a \"catastrophic collapse.\" In addition, a subcontractor who had installed gutters on the house testified that he had advised Mr. Larson that there needed to be more downspouts than the two Mr. Larson had ordered him to install. Other contractors testified as to other defects not pertinent to this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On 8 January 2001, plaintiffs filed suit against DLI and Mr. Larson (under a piercing the corporate veil theory), alleging breach of contract, breach of express warranty, breach of the implied warranty of habitability, negligent supervision, negligence, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and unfair and deceptive trade practices. At trial, the court allowed defendants' motion for a directed verdict on the claim for unfair and deceptive trade practices under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2075-1.1\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a775-1.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but denied the motion as to plaintiffs' fraud claim. The jury found defendants liable for breach of express and implied warranties and fraud. It awarded plaintiffs $95,295 on the warranty claims and $208,000 on the fraud claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs elected to accept the damages awarded for fraud and moved to amend the judgment to include treble damages, attorneys'fees, and costs. Defendants moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, a new trial or amendment of the judgment pursuant to N.C.R. Civ. P. 59. The trial court denied all the post-trial motions except for plaintiffs' motion to recover costs. Defendants filed a timely appeal from the judgment; plaintiffs cross-appealed from the rulings on their\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2075-1.1\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 75-1.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In October 2002, both defendants filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The automatic stays were lifted on 18 April 2003, allowing this appeal to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants contend that the trial court erred, under Rules 403 and 404(b) of the North Carolina Rules of Evidence, by admitting the testimony of Dr. James Efird and evidence that he filed a lawsuit against defendants. Dr. Efird testified that he purchased a home from DLI in 1997; his home is in a cluster of homes that includes plaintiffs' house. He testified that Mr. Larson did not tell him that he only had a limited license, that his house also contained major defects at closing, and that Mr. Larson had promised to repair the defects. Although defendants did repair some \"punch list\" items and other minor defects after closing, defendants refused to correct the major defects and Dr. Efird was forced to file suit. The trial court found that the evidence \"should be admitted under Rule 404(b) for the purpose of showing the intent of Mr. Larson or the plan of Mr. Larson in selling both houses, and the knowledge of Mr. Larson, knowing that the homeowners were dissatisfied. And it's alleged in both cases that he failed or refused to take care of the complaints.\" Rule 404(b) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake, entrapment or accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   It is well-established that Rule 404(b) is a rule of inclusion and not a rule of exclusion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The record shows that the trial court carefully considered the two transactions before finding that they were substantially similar and not so remote that the evidence was unfairly prejudicial to defendants. The trial court conducted the balancing test required by Rule 403, concluding that the probative value of the testimony was not outweighed by unfair prejudice to defendants.

On appeal, the parties have likewise limited their analysis to these two areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The contract addendum expressly \"represent[ed] and certifie[d]\" that Mr. Larson was a \"duly licensed general contractor,\" even though\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2087-10\">\n    N.C.

Ct. 920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974)). Plaintiffs presented circumstantial evidence that defendants' statements about Mr. Larson's license limitation were intended and reasonably calculated to deceive. Although defendants provided the bank with a \"total construction cost\" estimate of $300,000, defendants stated on the building permit application that the cost of construction would be $220,000. Orange County Building Inspector Don Knight testified that had defendants indicated on the application that the construction cost was more than $250,000, the county would not have issued the permit. In addition, while the New Construction Addendum provided a space for defendants to write their \"North Carolina contractor's license number and type,\" defendant left the space blank. Defendants suggest that the omission was an oversight, but a jury could reasonably view it as an intentional effort to avoid discovery of the license limitation, especially in light of other evidence presented by plaintiffs indicating that defendants, in violation of the law, had - six months earlier - failed to disclose a pending lawsuit in Mr. Larson's 1999 license renewal application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   With respect to the gutters, plaintiffs offered evidence that the subcontractor told defendants that two gutter downspouts were inadequate, but defendants refused to do anything because it would affect the already poured driveway. A jury could conclude from this evidence that defendants not only knew that the downspoutswere inadequate, but intentionally chose not to notify plaintiffs in order to cut costs. Defendants argue again that the downspouts represent a disagreement over a judgment call and the nondisclosure, therefore, cannot be viewed as calculated to deceive or intentional. Based on plaintiffs' evidence, however, the jury was entitled to reject this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Actual Deception/Reasonable Reliance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendants contend that the record \"is devoid\" of evidence of reasonable reliance with respect to Mr. Larson's license. Defendants do not dispute that plaintiffs were in fact unaware of the true state of Mr. Larson's license. They argue instead that plaintiffs unreasonably relied upon defendants' representations about Mr. Larson's license. The gist of their argument is that plaintiffs failed to make a reasonable inquiry about Mr. Larson's license status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Ordinarily, the question whether an actor is reasonable in relying on the representations of another is a matter for the finder of fact.\n   <em>\n    Olivetti Corp. v.

Ms. Donlon testified, however, that even if Mr. Larson's license number had been on the contract or plaintiffs had noticed it on the permit application, the number would have been meaningless to plaintiffs because they were unaware of the state's tiered licensing system and never suspected Mr. Larson was not licensed to perform the work for which he held himself out. This testimony was corroborated by Dr. Efird who explained that he likewise did not investigate Mr. Larson's license because he did not know anything about licensing when he bought his house.

In fact, when the court specifically asked during the charge conference whether the parties had additional instructions they wished to propose, defendants did not request that the instruction be added to the charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Because of defendants' failure to object, any error was not properly preserved for review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C.R.

Defendants contend that the awards should have been identical. Defendants have overlooked the fact that the trial court instructed the jurors to use a different measure for breach of warranty damages than for fraud damages. We note that defendants have not assigned error to the damages instructions apart from that discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The court instructed the jury that damages for breach of warranty should be calculated based on \"the reasonable market value of the house . . . at the time of the possession if it had been constructed so that it met the standard of workmanlike quality prevailing at the time and place of construction\" minus the reasonable market value of the house \"at the time and place of construction in its actual condition,\" plus any incidental or consequential damages. The trial court further instructed the jury, with respect to the breach of warranty claim, that it could alternatively choose to award the reasonable cost of the repairsnecessary to meet the standard of workmanlike quality at the time and place of construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On the other hand, with respect to the fraud claim, the court instructed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   [I]f you have found fraud on the part of the defendants, then the damages for which the plaintiff would be entitled to recover for the fraud would be the difference between the actual value of the home and the value of the home as represented by the defendants. . . .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   . . . .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In arriving at the difference in the value of the home as represented by the defendants and its actual value, you may consider in reaching your answer the reasonable cost of repairing the home so as to bring it to conformity with the defendant's representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In other words, with respect to the breach of warranty claim, the jury was to base damages on the market value of a house of \"workmanlike quality,\" while for fraud damages, the jury was to start with the value of the home as represented by defendants. Based on the evidence, the jury could reasonably have decided that defendants had promised a more valuable home than \"workmanlike.\" In addition, the jury was instructed that it could choose to calculate the breach of warranty award by the repair costs necessary to achieve \"workmanlike quality\" instead of by determining the difference in market value. The fraud instructionsuggested that repair costs to achieve the represented value were one aspect of the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendants argue: \"Considering that the jury returned a verdict under the issue of breach of warranty in the amount of $95,295.00, it is clear that the facts of the case showed repair costs and damages from the alleged breach of contract to be in the range of $95,000.\" Based on the jury instructions, the verdict means only that the repair costs and damages with respect to a house of \"workmanlike quality\" were approximately $95,000. The jury could - and apparently did - conclude that difference in value between what defendants promised and what they provided was considerably more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The jury's verdict is within the range supported by the evidence. Dr. Shafman testified that the house \"is probably worth $200,000,\" while plaintiffs paid $438,000 when they bought the house. Further, plaintiffs' canceled checks, estimates, and testimony suggested that the cost of repairs, relocation, and storage was over $210,000. On the one hand, the jury could have determined that the house was worth approximately $230,000 - just over the construction cost value placed on it by defendants in the building permit application. Or, the jury could have refused to award some small portion of the total repairs and expenses.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., Pelzer v.
