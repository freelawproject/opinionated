The records or files failed to show such a preliminary examination for said offense as the law provides, or a waiver thereof; and 2. It did not appear from such records or files that he had ever been charged with or arrested for said offense, except as he stands charged therewith in said information. In support of said motion respondent lK\"'ii')duced said records and files, consisting of the testimon/Haken by the examining magistrate, on the examination of respondent for the offense charged in the information and a commitment issued by said magistrate, in the usual form, in which he stated that it appeared to him that said offense had been committed (describing it), and that there was probable cause to believe respondent guilty of its commission, and fixing bail in the sum of five thousand dollars. The testimony taken on the examination failed to locate the town or county or State in which the alleged murder was committed or to give the Christian name of respondent, but the caption reads as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-8\"><em>\u201c State of Michigan, County of Schoolcraft, </em>ss.: The examination of Leroy M.

That the prosecuting attorney before filing said informtion, failing to find the complaint and warrant in the files, Wv.-t to Onota township, where such examination was had and said justice resided, but failed to find said justice, and learned that he had packed up all his books and papers and taken them away, and was unable to ascertain what had become of said complaint \u2018 and warrant. The certificate of the county clerk was read, showing his inability, after diligent search, to find said papers in his office. Respondent objected to this documentary testimony as incompetent, but the court received the same and denied the motion to quash, whereupon respondent refused to plead, and by order of the court a plea of not guilty was entered for him. When the case came on for trial, and before the jury was sworn, respondent interposed a challenge to the array, based upon the following statement of facts testified to by the clerk of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-6\">At the time for return of jury lists in the spring of 1884, Schoolcraft county contained eight organized townships. The township of Burt made no return for 1884, and the township of Munising failed to send in list until after jury was drawn for the July term of that year, which jury consisted of four jurors from each of the six remaining townships. At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>time the jury was drawn for the January term, 1885, at which respondent- was tried, the number of persons from whom to draw a jury was divided among the townshijas-as follows: Thompson 8, Manistique 36, Seney 5, Germfask 2, Onota 2, Munising 3. The list from Hiawatha had been exhausted at the former drawing. The panel was made up by drawing all of the remaining names from the townships of Onota, Germfask, Munising and Seney, and seven from eacli of the townships of Thompson and Manistique, making 26 in all. The two extra names were drawn, because the officers had knowledge of the removal of one of the persons previously drawn and the death of another: \u00a7 7567, Howell\u2019s Statutes, 4th sub-division. The court sustained the demurrer of the People to the challenge of respondent, trial was thereupon had and a verdict of manslaughter rendered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-4\"><em>W.

People, </em>33 Mich. 371.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b38-6\">If the evidence returned by the examining magistrate did not authorize the filing of the information, the constitutional rights of respondent were disregarded. From- the evidence the magistrate must determine as to the commission of the offense charged and the probable guilt of respondent: <em>Byrnes v. People, </em>37 Mich. 515; <em>People v. Bemis, </em>51 Mich. 425 ; and as it did not name the respondent or the deceased, or the county or State where the crime was committed, the magistrate could not make such determination: <em>Yaner v.

A mittimus shows no authority to file an information <em>: Turner v. People, </em>33 Mich. 368. Respondent was informed against and tried for murder, and the certificate of the justice fixing amount of bail, either shows that it was not connected with this case or that the magistrate had not found that the offense charged in information had been committed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b39-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number><em>J.

The certificate of the clerk of their absence from his office, was <em>prima faoie </em>proof of the loss of said papers: Howell\u2019s Statutes, \u00a7 7505 ; and parol proof of their contents was admissible: Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 509; and witnesses may state the substance thereof: <em>Com. v. </em>Roork, 8 Cush. 210; <em>Simpson v. Norton, </em>45 Me. 281; <em>Hall v. Manchester, </em>40 N. H. 410.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-5\">The certificate of the justice attached to the evidence returned with the commitment issued by him, sufficiently shows a finding by that officer that the offense charged had been committed and probable cause to believe the respondent guilty thereof: <em>Turner v. </em>People, 33 Mich. 367-8.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-6\">Upon a motion to quash the information, for want of jurisdiction, the court may try and determine the question summarily upon affidavits: <em>Haywood v. Johnson, </em>41 Mich. 605.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-7\">Howell\u2019s Statute \u00a7 7567 does not provide for returning names drawn on former jury to the township packages until all names returned are exhausted, nor is it ground for challenge to the array that a jury list was returned after date fixed by statute and no list returned from one township: <em>Thomas v. People, </em>39 Mich. 310-11.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-8\">Good character may always be shown by a person charged with crime, and the prosecution may rebut such affirmative proof: <em>Com. v.

People, </em>33 Mich. 364; <em>Weimeister v. Manville, </em>44 Mich. 410; <em>Ives v. Leonard, </em>50 Mich. 296 ; <em>Mich. State Ins. Co. v.

At the opening of the court at said term, the prosecuting attorney tiled an information against the respondent for the crime aforesaid, and on being arraigned, he appeared by -counsel, and moved the court to quash the information, on the <em>ground </em>\u2014 -first, that a proper preliminary examination is not shown by the files in the case; nor that such examination was waived ; <em>second, </em>that it does not appear from the files that the defendant has ever been arrested for, or charged with the crime for which he was arraigned, except as appears in and by the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">The objection was properly overruled. The record shows a sufficient complaint and warrant, and an examination had before the magistrate who issued the warrant, and that several witnesses were examined in behalf of the People, and the justice makes \u00bf commitment, in which he states that he finds the crime charged has been committed, and probable cause to believe the respondent guilty of the commission thereof. This shows a sufficient examination: <em>Turner v. </em>People, 33 Mich. 364; <em>Haywood v. </em>Johnson, 41 Mich. 605; <em>State v. </em>Nerbovig, 24 N. W. Rep. 321. The proof of loss of the papers showing a preliminary examination was sufficient, and it was entirely competent to make parol proof of their .contents : 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 509; <em>Com. v. Roork, </em>8 Cush. 210; <em>Simpson v. </em>Norton, 45 Me. 281; <em>Hall v. Manchester </em>40 N. H. 410. The information filed was fully authorized. The court must necessarily go outside of the regular files when the papers are destroyed, to ascertain whether the proper preliminary steps have been taken necessary to place the respondent on trial, and no evidence otherwise competent could be rejected for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number><em>We </em>find no error in overruling the respondent\u2019s challenge to the array of jurors. It was unimportant that no list of jurors was returned from the township of Burt, and also that there was neglect on the part of township officers in making the return of names, before the drawing of the first jury, from the township of Munising: How. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 7554, 7555, 7567, 7575; <em>Thomas v. </em>People, 39 Mich. 309. It will be noticed that section 7567 did not provide for the return of the names of jurors drawn, to the packages, until all the packages were exhausted, and the statute expressly provides that at the next succeeding drawing of jurors they shall commence to draw from the package next in numerical order to the one from which the last name was drawn at the last preceding drawing, and in the sixth subdivision of the section it says the same proceeding shall be had as often as may be necessary, until the whole number of jurors required shall have been drawn, and there is no provision for the returning of the names of the jurors to the packages until the list returned shall have been exhausted.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">We see no reason why respondent should complain that more evidence of the <em>res gestee </em>was not offered. The People had shown, by two witnesses who are unimpeached, that they were present and saw the respondent take his gun and shoot his wife dead, she being only five feet distant from him at the time; and the respondent does not deny that he killed he?-, but claims he was so drunk that he did not know what he was doing at the time. Certainly the People could not do less; but why the respondent should require more, or how he could have been benefited thereby, is not exactly apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The question put to witness Black, on rebuttal, was competent. While the answer was not strictly responsive, no motion was made to strike it out for that or any other reason, and no error was committed in overruling the respondent\u2019s objection to the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The other assignments of error relate mainly to the action of the circuit judge in charging the jui-y, and to his refusals to chai\u2019ge. We have examined them carefully, and have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>been unable to discover any error. The circuit court, we think, gave the case to the jury on the theory of the defense quite as strongly as the circumstances and testimony in the case will warrant, and the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b42-4\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
