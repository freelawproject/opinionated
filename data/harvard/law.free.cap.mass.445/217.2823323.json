King, appeals from his convictions of forcible rape of a child under sixteen years, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A, and indecent assault and battery of a child under fourteen years, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B. In part, the defendant argues that the trial judge improperly admitted the testimony of two \u201cfresh complaint\u201d witnesses. Under the fresh complaint doctrine in effect at the time of trial, the Commonwealth was permitted to introduce out-of-court statements seasonably made by the victim after the alleged sexual assault for the purpose of corroborating her own testimony concerning the alleged assault (so-called \u201cfresh complaint\u201d testimony). See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>439 Mass. 441, 445 (2003). There was no error in the judge\u2019s admission of the testimony. We affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-31\">We take this opportunity, however, to reconsider the scope of, and continued necessity for, our present fresh complaint doctrine. In light of changed circumstances we shall describe, we substantially revise the doctrine, which in the future shall be called the \u201cfirst complaint\u201d doctrine. Under the new doctrine, to be applied only in sexual assault cases tried after the issuance of the rescript in this opinion, the recipient of a complainant\u2019s first complaint of an alleged sexual assault may testify about the fact of the first complaint and the circumstances surround<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>ing the making of that first complaint. The witness may also testify about the details of the complaint. The complainant may likewise testify to the details of the first complaint (i.e., what she told the first complaint witness), as well as why the complaint was made at that particular time. Testimony from additional complaint witnesses is not admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"AOO\">First complaint testimony may be admitted for a limited purpose only, to assist the jury in determining whether to credit the complainant\u2019s testimony about the alleged sexual assault. The testimony may not be used to prove the truth of the allegations. The jury must be so instructed. The timing by the complainant in making a complaint will not disqualify the evidence, but is a factor the jury may consider in deciding whether the first complaint testimony supports the complainant\u2019s credibility or reliability. First complaint testimony is not relevant and therefore not admissible under the doctrine where neither the fact of the sexual assault nor the complainant\u2019s consent is at issue, as in cases where the identity of the assailant is the only contested issue.</p>\n<p id=\"AN4\"><em>Facts and procedural history. </em>On the evidence admitted, the jury could have found the following facts. At the time of the alleged assault, the victim, whom we shall call Alice, was four years old. Her mother and the defendant, who is Alice\u2019s biological father, were no longer in a relationship, but had a visitation arrangement concerning Alice: Alice lived and slept at the defendant\u2019s apartment on Mondays and Tuesdays. Alice\u2019s grandparents and the defendant\u2019s wife also lived in the same apartment. The defendant, his wife, and Alice shared a bedroom during her visits: the defendant and his wife slept in one bed, and Alice in another.</p>\n<p id=\"Alo\">One day in February, 2002, Alice walked in on the defendant in the bathroom and he asked her to \u201click or scratch\u201d his penis because it was \u201citchy.\u201d He was fully clothed until Alice replied \u201cokay.\u201d The defendant then removed his pants and underwear and laid down on his back on the bathroom floor or leaned against the tub. Alice knelt or sat beside him and did as she was told. She did not like the taste of the defendant\u2019s penis and so applied bubble-gum flavored toothpaste to it. When she finished licking the toothpaste off the defendant\u2019s penis, she put the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>toothpaste back and left the bathroom. Alice did not recall any conversation with the defendant during the incident, but remembers that her grandparents were nearby in the living room watching television when she came out of the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Later that same day, the defendant drove Alice to her day care center and her mother picked her up there. Alice told her mother about the alleged assault the day after the incident or perhaps one week later, when she was preparing to return to her father\u2019s house for another visit. This was the first time Alice disclosed the alleged assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">According to Alice\u2019s mother, on February 18, 2002, at 8:45 a.m., while in the living room of her studio apartment, Alice told her that the defendant had asked her to lick his penis. On hearing Alice\u2019s story, Alice\u2019s mother telephoned her own mother for advice and then telephoned the police. The following day, Alice and her mother went to the district attorney\u2019s office where they spoke with Brockton Detective Erin Kerr about the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The grand jury\u2019s indictments allege that the offenses occurred between June, 2000, and February 12, 2002, the period during which Alice was periodically visiting the defendant at his home.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A Superior Court judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion in limine seeking a determination of Alice\u2019s competency. The judge examined Alice, then six years old, and found her competent. A December 3, 2004, trial of the defendant\u2019s case ended in mistrial. Before the mistrial, the judge had ruled, over objection, that the Commonwealth could impeach the defendant (if he testified) with a prior conviction of armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">The following day, a second jury were empanelled. At this trial, three witnesses testified for the Commonwealth: Alice testified as the complainant, and her mother and Detective Kerr testified as \u201cfresh complaint\u201d witnesses. To minimize the potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>prejudicial impact of multiple iterations of Alice\u2019s complaint, the judge limited the mother\u2019s testimony to a few details of the complaint. The only evidence presented by the defendant was the testimony of his mother. The defendant did not testify, citing the judge\u2019s decision (made again at the retrial) to admit his prior conviction for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The judge instructed the jury at the time of Alice\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony about the \u201cfresh complaint\u201d doctrine: \u201cIf an alleged victim of a rape or sexual assault tells someone about the event reasonably promptly after the event,\u201d then evidence of the statement is admitted \u201conly to corroborate the alleged victim\u2019s in-court testimony and not to prove independently that the sexual assault occurred.\u201d The judge gave similar instructions before Detective Kerr\u2019s testimony, and again in his final instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the defendant moved unsuccessfully for a required finding on so much of the indictment that charged rape of a child by force, claiming insufficient evidence of penetration. He renewed this motion at the close of all of the evidence, and again before sentencing. The judge denied the motions, concluding that \u201c[bjecause licking constituted oral stimulation, and therefore fellatio, proof of penetration was satisfied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The defendant was found guilty of both offenses and appealed. We transferred this case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>The defendant challenges his convictions on five bases: (1) the rape indictment was \u201cvoid\u201d as there was no penetration; (2) there was insufficient evidence to support the rape conviction; (3) both the assault and battery and rape convictions were so closely related as to constitute one crime; (4) the judge erred in ruling that the defendant\u2019s prior conviction would have been admissible had he testified; and (5) the fresh complaint testimony of Alice\u2019s mother and Detective Kerr exceeded the bounds of the fresh complaint doctrine and violated the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">1. <em>\u201cVoid\u201d indictment. </em>The defendant claims that the indictment charging rape of a child by force was defective because it did not allege penetration. We disagree. While our case law has required the Commonwealth to prove some degree of penetration in order to support a conviction under the statute, see, e.g., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>433 Mass. 722, 726-727 (2001), an allegation of penetration is not required in an indictment for rape of a child by force where it is not expressly mentioned in the statute. The indictment expressly references the crime of rape of a child by force and properly tracks the statutory definition of the crime.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See also G. L. c. 277, \u00a7\u00a7 34,79; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baron, </em>356 Mass. 362, 364 (1969) (\u201cAn indictment conforming with the statutory form is sufficient\u201d). The defendant was given adequate notice of the nature of the charges against him and thus the indictment was sufficient.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farmer, </em>218 Mass. 507, 509 (1914) (\u201cThe Constitution of Massachusetts, article 12 of the Declaration of Rights, requires only such particularity of allegation as may be of service to a person charged with crime in enabling him to understand the charge and prepare his defense\u201d). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>387 Mass. 464, 467-468 (1982) (time of rape of child need not be precisely alleged).</p>\n<p id=\"A9X\">2. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>The defendant claims that the evidence at trial was similarly insufficient on the element of penetration, and that the judge should have granted his motion for a required finding of not guilty. This claim also fails. As a matter of law, evidence that a male forced a female to perform fellatio on him and made her \u201click\u201d his penis is sufficient to support a jury\u2019s finding of penetration and thus a conviction of forcible rape of a child.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">While some degree of penetration is required to sustain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>conviction under the statute, a jury may infer penetration on the basis of licking a penis. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donlan, </em>436 Mass. 329, 336 (2002) (\u201celement of penetration required for a rape conviction established by evidence that [the defendant] touched or came into contact with victim\u2019s vagina, vulva, or labia\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gichel, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 206, 213 (1999) (\u201cintrusion into the vagina is not required to prove penetration; just a touching of the vulva or labia is sufficient\u201d under child rape statute); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lender, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 164, 167 (1999); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moniz, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 913, 914 (1997); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edward, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 521, 523 (1993). This court has recognized that a perpetrator commits \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d with a child by forcing the child to perform fellatio, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>373 Mass. 577, 579, 584-585 (1977) (defendant penetrated victim\u2019s mouth with penis).</p>\n<p id=\"Akq\">In denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty, the judge properly concluded that the element of penetration required for a rape conviction may be established by licking a penis because \u201cthere is no difference between the licking of the female genitalia and the male genitalia. The bodily invasion is the same, regardless of the sex of the victim.\u201d Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, supra </em>at 583 (rape statute \u201cis neutral as to the gender of the victim . . . [and therefore] the penalties for \u2018sexual intercourse\u2019 and \u2018unnatural sexual intercourse\u2019 are the same without regard to the gender of the victim\u201d). Other courts have similarly concluded that forcing a victim to lick or kiss a penis may support a conviction of rape or sexual assault.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A8r\">The judge properly instructed the jury on the definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>forcible rape of a child under sixteen years, including the requirement that there be some degree of penetration.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), the evidence supported a finding of rape, including some amount of penetration. The victim\u2019s testimony that she licked the defendant\u2019s penis, did not like the taste, placed toothpaste on the penis and then licked the toothpaste off was sufficient evidence from which the jury could infer some degree of penetration. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moniz, supra </em>at 914 (jury could find penetration from seven year old victim\u2019s testimony that defendant \u201clicked her pee pee\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nylander, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 784, 785-787 (1989) (jury could infer penetration from evidence including testimony of young child that defendant touched her \u201cbum\u201d and \u201cprivate spot\u201d with his \u201cprivate spot\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 5 (1984) (jury entitled to infer penetration from six year old\u2019s testimony that defendant made her \u201cprivacy\u201d feel bad by lying on top of her); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mosby, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 17-18 (1980) (sufficient evidence of \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d where adult victim testified that defendant \u201cput his mouth to \u2014 to my vagina,\u201d and \u201cput his mouth down below\u201d). We do not eliminate the requirement of penetration, as defined in our cases, but recognize that when young children testify about sexual assault, their description of penetration need not be precise. \u201cWe do not require victims to describe with scientific accuracy parts of their anatomy or for children to possess vocabulary and habits of precision that many adults do not command.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moniz, supra </em>at 914.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Finally, on the issue of penetration, the defendant argues in essence that because the statute does not define the penetration</p>\n<p id=\"AlE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>element of rape of a child, the statute did not \u201cdefine the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited.\u201d We take this as a suggestion that the forcible rape of a child statute, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A, is unconstitutionally vague. We have previously rejected a similar argument, and reject the defendant\u2019s contention today. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, supra </em>at 590 (rejecting argument that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23, is unconstitutionally vague because \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d includes fellatio, reasoning \u201cdefendant had clear notice that compelling fellatio by a child was a criminal act\u201d). Our rape statute is not so vague in its prohibition of \u201cunnatural sexual intercourse\u201d that any adult would be unaware that the act of forcing a four year old child to perform fellatio is proscribed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"Apj\">3. <em>Duplicative charges. </em>The defendant also raises, apparently for the first time, the contention that his convictions were based on facts \u201cso closely related as to constitute the substance of but a single crime\u201d and thus barred by \u201cdouble jeopardy.\u201d In essence, he asserts that these convictions were duplicative. Because there was no objection at trial, we review the claim only to determine if there was error and, if so, then \u201cdetermine if a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice occurred.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>407 Mass. 412, 418 (1990), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>401 Mass. 109, 119 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"ATR\">\u201c[Ijndecent assault and battery [of a child] is a lesser included offense of forcible rape [of a child under sixteen years].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>405 Mass. 369, 381 (1989), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Egerton, </em>396 Mass. 499, 503 n.3 (1986). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>426 Mass. 301, 303 (1997). Thus, convictions for both offenses must rest on separate and distinct acts. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, supra. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra </em>at 120. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 13, 22 (2003). The acts that support the two convictians cannot be \u201cso closely related in fact as to constitute in substance but a single crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>St. Pierre, </em>377 Mass. 650, 662-663 (1979). Here, the Commonwealth argued two separate acts supported the convictions: the rape charge was based on the forced licking of the defendant\u2019s penis, and the assault and bat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>tery was based on the wholly separate act of the scratching of the defendant\u2019s penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The judge carefully and properly instructed the jury that the indictment for indecent assault and battery \u201crefers to the defendant allegedly causing [Alice] to scratch his penis, as opposed to the alleged licking of his penis.\u201d He further instructed: \u201cThis is charged as a separate and distinct offense [from the rape]. It\u2019s not part of the [rape] indictment that I explained to you. It requires proof of a separate act and it is alleged by the Commonwealth that that separate act is the scratching by [Alice] of the defendant\u2019s penis . . . .\u201d The defendant did not object to this instruction, and the jury were given separate verdict slips. In these circumstances, whether the scratching and licking \u201cwere separate and distinct acts or part of a single criminal episode was a question of fact for the jury to resolve.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>429 Mass. 502, 509 (1999) (judge properly instructed jury that assault and battery by means of dangerous weapon and murder convictions must rest on separate and distinct acts). We assume the jury followed the judge\u2019s proper instructions and based the two convictions on these separate acts. <em>Id. </em>at 510. See <em>Commonwealths. Mamay, supra </em>at 418-419 (defendant\u2019s inserting tongue into victim\u2019s mouth and tearing down pants distinct from anal and vaginal penetration); <em>Commonwealth s. Johnston, supra </em>at 22-23 (pulling victim\u2019s hair and raping her distinct acts); <em>Commonwealth s. Kopsala, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 387, 393 (2003) (evidence that defendant \u201cpulled up the victim\u2019s shirt, exposing her breasts, unbuttoned her jeans and pulled them off, and removed her panties,\u201d separate and distinct from penetration); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 1001, 1003 (1982) (\u201cAn indecent contact which is separate from and not incidental to the act of penetration does not merge with the crime of rape to constitute but a single offense any more than a second penetration of the same victim during the same criminal episode constitutes but one rape\u201d). Contrast <em>Commonwealth v. Sanchez, supra </em>at 381-382 (judge did not instruct jury that convictions must be based on separate acts). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">4. <em>Evidence of prior conviction. </em>Next, the defendant claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>that the judge erred in ruling that his prior conviction of armed robbery would be admissible for impeachment purposes if the defendant testified.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Trial judges have discretion to permit impeachment of defendants who testify on their own behalf with their prior convictions, pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eugene, </em>438 Mass. 343, 352 (2003); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>367 Mass. 169, 174 (1975); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Subilosky, </em>352 Mass. 153, 167 (1967). Here, the defendant was released from his State prison sentence on the armed robbery conviction within ten years of its admission at trial, see G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21, the Commonwealth offered a certified copy of the conviction, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>386 Mass. 593, 600 (1982), and the defendant was represented by counsel in the armed robbery case. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>435 Mass. 691, 695-696 (2002). Moreover, the armed robbery conviction, while relevant to the issue of the defendant\u2019s credibility, is sufficiently dissimilar from the sexual offenses at issue here. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weaver, </em>400 Mass. 612, 618-619 (1987) (prior convictions admissible in judge\u2019s discretion if sufficiently dissimilar from crime charged); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>372 Mass. 736, 750 (1977) (judge could properly exclude prior conviction where crime charged and prior crime are similar, and prior crime does not bear directly on disposition to tell truth). Thus, the risk of prejudice to the defendant by admitting the prior conviction would likely not have outweighed the probative value of the evidence for impeachment purposes. The judge properly exercised his discretion to permit impeachment of the defendant with the conviction in accordance with the requirements of the statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That the defendant chose not to testify due to the potential admission of this conviction is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>cause for reversal. See <em>id. </em>at 749-751 (rejecting similar argument).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">5. <em>Admission of \u201cfresh complaint\u201d testimony. </em>The defendant next asserts that the rape conviction was secured by the use of \u201cfresh complaint\u201d testimony (from Alice\u2019s mother and Detective Kerr) that went beyond the limits of the then applicable fresh complaint doctrine, and violated his confrontation rights. We begin with a brief overview of the origins of the fresh complaint doctrine and a summary of the doctrine as it is currently applied in Massachusetts courts. We next address each of the defendant\u2019s objections to the fresh complaint testimony admitted at trial, considering whether the testimony violated the doctrine as it existed at the time of trial. We then conclude that there was no error in the admission of the testimony under then-existing evidentiary standards or under our Federal and State confrontation clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">a. <em>Origins and scope of doctrine. </em>Under English common law, victims of violent crime were required to make \u201chue and cry\u201d (hutesium et clamor) as a prerequisite of prosecution. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>370 Mass. 388, 394 n.7 (1976); 2 F. Pollock &amp; F. Maitland, The History of English Law Before the Time of Edward I 578-579 (2d ed. 1899). By the 1700\u2019s, when courts had refined many evidentiary standards, the \u201chue and cry\u201d requirement was no longer a necessary part of a criminal prosecution, except in rape cases. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavalley, </em>410 Mass. 641, 646-647 n.7 (1991); Anderson, The Legacy of the Prompt Complaint Requirement, Corroboration Requirement, and Cautionary Instructions on Campus Sexual Assault, 84 B.U. L. Rev. 945, 955 (2004) (hereinafter Anderson, The Legacy of the Prompt Complaint Requirement). The rationale for the different treatment of rape cases was the then current belief that \u201cafter becoming a victim of [sexual] assault against her will . . . [the victim] should have spoken out. That she did not, that she went about as if nothing had happened, was in effect an assertion that noth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>ing violent had been done.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 978 &amp; n.198, quoting 4 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1135 (3d ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">American courts, in turn, endorsed the belief that the failure of a rape victim to make a prompt complaint of a sexual assault was akin to an inconsistent statement at odds with the complainant\u2019s court room testimony about the rape. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavalley, supra, </em>citing 4 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1135, at 298-300 (Chadboum rev. ed. 1972). Because of this belief, the prosecution was permitted to rebut any inference that the sexual assault charge was fabricated with evidence from \u201cfresh complaint\u201d witnesses to the effect that the complainant did in fact complain and the complaint was \u201cfresh\u201d or prompt.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Hence, \u201cfresh complaint\u201d evidence was admitted in sexual assault trials as an exception to the usual rule that a prior statement of a witness that is merely repetitive of the witness\u2019s trial testimony is not admissible except in limited circumstances, such as on redirect examination to rehabilitate the witness after impeachment on a claim of recent contrivance. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, supra </em>at 391-392 &amp; n.3. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>429 Mass. 22, 27 n.6 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">In more recent years, we have acknowledged the \u201csexist,\u201d \u201coutmoded\u201d and \u201cinvalid\u201d origins of the fresh complaint rule, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 658 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavalley, supra </em>at 646 n.7; but nevertheless continued to adhere to the fresh complaint doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">\u201c \u2018Whatever may have been the historical origin of the fresh complaint doctrine, it should now be seen in relation to the common observation . . . that juries tend toward considerable and perhaps inordinate skepticism in rape cases, above all where there is a suggestion of willingness or acquiescence on the part of the victim\u2019 .... We cannot ignore the societal tendency to disbelieve sexual assault victims and to presume that a rape victim will make a prompt complaint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-8\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number><em>Bailey, supra </em>at 394. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quincy Q., </em>434 Mass. 859, 868-869 (2001). Thus, at the foundation of our contemporary fresh complaint doctrine lie three concerns about potential juror bias: that jurors may still believe that a rape victim will promptly disclose a sexual assault to someone; that jurors may draw adverse inferences from the absence of evidence suggesting such a prompt complaint; and that jurors continue to be skeptical of allegations of rape. We have therefore permitted fresh complaint testimony for the limited purpose of corroborating the victim\u2019s testimony, but the testimony is \u201ccorroborative only if it shows that the victim seasonably complained of the attack.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, supra </em>at 657, 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The admission of fresh complaint evidence concerning sexual assaults on children stands on a somewhat different footing. \u201cThe cases involving child sexual abuse constitute a factually distinct branch of the fresh complaint doctrine that gives special consideration to the natural fear, ignorance, and susceptibility to intimidation that is unique to a young child\u2019s make-up.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fleury, </em>417 Mass. 810, 814 (1994), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>404 Mass. 221, 229 (1989). \u201c[Wjith regard to child victims, our fresh complaint jurisprudence has adopted the [theory that] a child\u2019s circumstances commonly make it difficult, if not impossible, for the child to make a prompt complaint of sexual assault and, contrary to the theoretical justification for the doctrine, a child\u2019s much later report of sexual assault is admitted as \u2018fresh complaint\u2019 whenever there is a reasonable explanation for the child\u2019s failure to make a prompt complaint.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>439 Mass. 441, 453-454 (2003) (Sosman, J., concurring), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fleury, supra </em>at 813-815, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Most recently, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, supra </em>at 445, we summarized the key provisions of our fresh complaint doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">\u201c[0]ur fresh complaint doctrine \u2018permits an out-of-court complaint seasonably made by the complainant in a sexual assault case to be admitted as part of the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v.

Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quincy Q., supra </em>at 874-875 (testimony that complainant \u201cclammed up\u201d when discussing alleged assault improper interpretation of complainant\u2019s words and inconsistent with corroborative purpose of fresh complaint testimony).

Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, </em>409 Mass. 500, 508-509 (1991) (four-year delay too long). Greater flexibility in determining freshness was permitted in cases of child sexual assault. The \u201cpreliminary decision whether a complaint [was] sufficiently fresh to be presented to the jury [lay] in the sound discretion of the trial judge and [was to] be made according to whether the complaint was \u2018reasonably prompt\u2019 in the particular circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherry, </em>386 Mass. 682, 691 (1982). As with all evidence, whether to believe or disbelieve the fresh complaint testimony, and what, if any, weight to give that evidence, rested with the jury. Thus, while the preliminary determination of \u201cfreshness\u201d was made by the judge, once the fresh complaint testimony was admitted in evidence, \u201cthe ultimate responsibility for determining the freshness of the complaint [lay] with the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, supra </em>at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-29\">b. <em>\u201cFreshness\u201d of the complaint. </em>The defendant first chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>lenges the admission of the fresh complaint testimony on the ground that the complaints were not promptly made. Alice testified that her first complaint (made to her mother on February 18, 2002) occurred between one day and one week after the alleged sexual assault. The complaint to Detective Kerr was made only one day later. Certainly a judge would have been correct in admitting testimony about a complaint made roughly one week after an alleged sexual assault. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. 618, 626 (1989) (complaint fresh where four-year old victim made first complaint \u201celeven days after he left the abusive setting\u201d). The indictment, however, alleges the assault took place between June, 2000, to February 12, 2002. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, supra </em>at 512, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>387 Mass. 464, 467 (1982) (\u201cThe time of the offense is not an element of [the crime of rape of a child] and need not be precisely alleged\u201d). Given the divers dates alleged in the indictment, the complaint by Alice to her mother could have been made anytime from six days to twenty months after the alleged assault. Even if the complaint arose twenty months after the alleged crime, in the circumstances of this case, the judge properly admitted it based on a preliminary determination that it was reasonably prompt. As indicated, our courts have been flexible with respect to the promptness requirement in cases of child sexual assault. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fleury, supra </em>at 813-815 (twenty-one month delay in child sexual assault case); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McKinnon, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 398, 400, 403 (1993) (thirty-four month delay in child sexual assault case). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kirouac, </em>405 Mass. 557, 564-565 (1989). In this case, the judge properly instructed the jury that for them to consider the testimony of Alice\u2019s mother and Detective Kerr as corroborative of Alice\u2019s testimony, they must also find that Alice\u2019s complaints to her mother and Detective Kerr were \u201creasonably prompt.\u201d Factors that could have supported the jury\u2019s finding of promptness include Alice\u2019s tender age, the fact that the defendant is her biological father, that the defendant was in a position of authority and trust with respect to Alice, and that the defendant played a supervisory role in Alice\u2019s life. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fleury, supra </em>at 814-815. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, supra </em>at 626 (listing some relevant fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>tors); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kruah, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 341, 346 (1999) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">c. <em>Enlarging scope of Alice\u2019s testimony. </em>The defendant also contends that the admission of the fresh complaint evidence violated his right to a fair trial because the mother\u2019s testimony improperly enlarged on Alice\u2019s testimony, providing substantive evidence of the alleged crime including the date of the offense. As a logical outgrowth of the rule that fresh complaint testimony is to be used for corroborative purposes only, such testimony may not include details of the alleged assault not included in the complainant\u2019s own testimony. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, supra </em>at 351; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scanlon, supra </em>at 670. To the extent that the fresh complaint testimony significantly enlarges the scope of the facts of the alleged assault as described in the complainant\u2019s testimony, it cannot be said either to support or to refute the complaining witness\u2019s own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-13\">In this case, we conclude that the fresh complaint testimony of Alice\u2019s mother did not impermissibly exceed the scope of Alice\u2019s own testimony. First, contrary to the defendant\u2019s arguments, the mother did not testify to the date of the sexual assault, but only to the date on which her daughter disclosed the abuse to her. The mother\u2019s testimony about the timing of Alice\u2019s complaint and Alice\u2019s visits with the defendant was permissible; it did not attempt to explain away Alice\u2019s delay in complaining, even if that evidence assisted the Commonwealth in establishing the dates of the alleged offense and the first complaint. Second, Alice\u2019s mother testified only briefly as to Alice\u2019s fresh complaint, providing few details of the complaint.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Testimony concerning further details of the fresh complaint was limited by the judge. Moreover, the judge properly instructed the jury that \u201cfresh complaint testimony may not be used to fill in any gaps in the alleged victim\u2019s testimony. So if the fresh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>complaint testimony adds any alleged facts to [the victim\u2019s] testimony, then you should disregard that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The defendant suggests that the fresh complaint testimony of both Alice\u2019s mother and Detective Kerr was so inconsistent with the victim\u2019s own testimony that the allegation of rape cannot be believed. Fresh complaint testimony need not replicate precisely the victim\u2019s own testimony, nor must it be sanitized to match the victim\u2019s testimony exactly. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scanlon, supra </em>at 670. Some inconsistency between a fresh complaint witness\u2019s testimony and a complainant\u2019s testimony is expected, and will often aid the jury in determining whether the fresh complaint testimony ultimately supports the complainant\u2019s story. To the extent that there were inconsistencies between the testimony of the two adults and the testimony of the child, they were insignificant. The weight and credibility of the witnesses\u2019 testimony are solely for the fact finder and are not proper subjects for appeal. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lydon, </em>413 Mass. 309, 311 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">d. <em>\u201cPiling on\u201d of fresh complaint witnesses. </em>Next, the defendant maintains that the admission of testimony from two fresh complaint witnesses constituted prejudicial repetition of the details of the assault. We disagree. While the Commonwealth called two fresh complaint witnesses to testify, the judge carefully limited the mother\u2019s testimony to avoid duplication concerning the details of the complaint. While attentive to the potential dangers of the prejudicial \u201cpiling on\u201d of fresh complaint testimony, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trowbridge, </em>419 Mass. 750, 761 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavalley, </em>410 Mass. 641, 646 (1991), our courts have permitted two or more fresh complaint witnesses to testify concerning the details of the complaint. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>423 Mass. 436, 444 (1996) (five fresh complaint witnesses); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 656 n.4, 660 (1992) (two fresh complaint witnesses); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavalley, supra </em>at 642 (five fresh complaint witnesses and videotape of victim\u2019s complaint to police not prejudicial); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brouillard, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 448, 457 n.15 (1996) (four witnesses in case involving two complainants and two defendants \u201cnot in itself impermissible\u201d). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Swain, </em>36 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Mass. App. Ct. 433, 442 (1994) (six witnesses prejudicial). There was no error in permitting two fresh complaint witnesses, especially where the testimony of the two was minimally cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">e. <em>Confrontation clause. </em>Finally, the defendant argues that the confrontation clauses of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights bar the fresh complaint testimony admitted in this case. In <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36 (2004), the United States Supreme Court held that where a witness testifies at trial and the defendant has the opportunity to cross-examine the witness, the confrontation clause is not violated by the admission of an out-of-court statement by that witness. See <em>id. </em>at 59 n.9 (\u201cwe reiterate that, when the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial statements. . . . The Clause does not bar admission of a statement so long as the declarant is present at trial to defend or explain it\u201d). See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Samuels, </em>273 Conn. 541, 568-569 (2005) (\u201cconstancy of accusation\u201d [Connecticut\u2019s term for fresh complaint evidence] testimony does not violate confrontation clause). Article 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights affords no greater protection than the Sixth Amendment in this context. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>444 Mass. 526 (2005). Here, the defendant had the opportunity to and did cross-examine Alice, inquiring about her complaint to her mother, her memory, and her failure to report the alleged incident to her grandparents or teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-26\">The defendant also contends that Alice was essentially unavailable for cross-examination because she was incompetent to testify. We disagree. First, Alice was judged competent after a hearing on the issue, and the defendant does not now challenge that determination. Second, we see nothing in Alice\u2019s testimony to support any claim that she was \u201cunavailable\u201d due to any inability or unwillingness to testify. Alice testified to the details of the assault, her report to her mother, and the relative timing of the assault. As noted above, she was cross-examined on issues relative to the alleged assault and her complaint, and responded to the best of her ability. To the extent her memory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>was hazy on certain details, this is something for the jury to consider when assessing her credibility. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>404 Mass. 221, 234-235 (1989) (no confrontation clause violation where child sexual assault complainant exhibited \u201clapse of memory\u201d on cross-examination). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kirouac, </em>405 Mass. 557, 560-563 (1989) (confrontation clause violation where child complainant only reluctantly testified on direct and exhibited \u201ctotal refusal to cooperate on cross-examination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">6. <em>Reexamination of the fresh complaint doctrine. </em>This case must be resolved on the basis of the \u201cfresh complaint\u201d doctrine as it existed at the time of trial. We are, however, provided with an opportunity to reconsider the scope and continued necessity for that doctrine.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We have considered the history of the doctrine, its development and application during the past years, as well as the continued relevance of the theories that have supported its vitality. We conclude that the doctrine requires modification. The \u201cfirst complaint\u201d rule we announce today, broader in some respects than the prior rule and narrower in others, reflects a contemporary understanding of information that will permit jurors to make a fair assessment of a sexual assault complainant\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">a. <em>Continued need for complaint witnesses. </em>We last reviewed the validity of our \u201cfresh complaint\u201d doctrine in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, supra </em>at 657-660. Since that time, further research has been conducted on the behavior of victims of sexual assault in the aftermath of the crime. That research suggests that, in part because the harm suffered by sexual assault victims often consists of the psychological harm caused by the defendants\u2019 violation of a victim\u2019s body, such victims respond in a variety of ways to the trauma of the crime,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and often do not promptly report or disclose the crime for a range of reasons, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>shame, fear, or concern they will not be believed.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>8 Cal. 4th 746, 759 (1994) (\u201cThe overwhelming body of current empirical studies, data, and other information establishes that it is not inherently \u2018natural\u2019 for the victim to confide in someone or to disclose, immediately following commission of the offense, that he or she was sexually assaulted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Also since 1992, residents in Massachusetts have been exposed to significant amounts of public information and media attention on the issue of sexual assaults and its impact on victims, especially children. See, e.g., <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Garabedian, </em>433 Mass. 360, 369-370 (2001) (Sosman, J., dissenting) (collecting sources, including after 1992). Though we have located little recent research on juror perceptions of rape complainants, the research and scholarship of which we are aware suggests that damaging stereotypes persist. Some jurors may continue to believe incorrectly that \u201creal\u201d victims will <em>promptly </em>disclose a sexual attack.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Some jurors may continue to harbor prejudicial misperceptions about the nature of rape and rape allegations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>including that complainants who wear revealing clothing, consume drugs or alcohol, or have unorthodox or promiscuous lifestyles cannot be \u201creal\u201d victims of rape; that forced sex by a spouse or a past partner does not constitute \u201creal\u201d rape; and that false accusations of sexual assault are more frequent than those of other violent crimes.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Juror biases may be particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>strong in child rape cases, as some may attribute allegations of sexual assault to the child\u2019s imagination or improper adult influence. And jurors may unfairly perceive child complainants as incredible. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, </em>405 Mass. 618, 630 (1989), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>294 Or. 427, 440 (1983) (Roberts, J., concurring) (\u201cthe routine indicia of witness reliability \u2014 consistency, willingness to aid the prosecution, straightforward rendition of the facts \u2014 may, for good reason, be lacking [in child victims of sexual assault]. As a result jurors may impose standards of normalcy on child victim/witnesses who consistently respond in distinctly abnormal fashion\u201d). Both adults and children may delay complaining about sexual assaults but then face claims of fabrication, and the reasons for the behavior of adult and child victims of sexual assault are still widely misunderstood. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>407 Mass. 412, 421-422 (1990) (rape trauma syndrome appropriate subject for expert testimony because beyond jury\u2019s common knowledge); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dockham, supra </em>at 629-630 (expert testimony on child victims permissible because symptoms beyond common knowledge of jurors).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-19\">While more than a decade has passed since we last observed that \u201cjuries tend toward considerable and perhaps inordinate skepticism in rape cases,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, supra </em>at 658, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>370 Mass. 388, 394 (1976), that observation has continued vitality. Although many jurors may no longer harbor stereotypical assumptions concerning the behavior of \u201creal\u201d rape victims, others may still harbor stereotypical assumptions to the effect that victims will immediately disclose a sexual assault and that the absence of a timely complaint suggests fabrication of the assault. There is a continued need in sexual assault cases to counterbalance or address inaccurate assumptions regarding stereotypes about delayed reporting of a sexual assault or about sexual assault victims in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-33\">We reject any contention that the existing rules of evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>provide an adequate remedy with which to combat these stereotypes. The spontaneous utterance exception, by way of example, would allow a complainant\u2019s statements to be admitted for substantive purposes,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> but only in the narrow instance where the statement was made in reaction to a startling event (the sexual assault), without any opportunity for reflective thought. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>437 Mass. 620, 623-625 (2002).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> And corroborative evidence is less likely to be necessary in cases where victims make such \u201cspontaneous\u201d complaints, as they are the victims who would meet the stereotypical expectation of an immediate complaint. Likewise, prior consistent statements by victims are admissible only to rebut claims of recent contrivance by a complainant, and only if the statements were made prior to any alleged motive to lie. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brookins, </em>416 Mass. 97, 102-103</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">Furthermore, delaying testimony about the existence of the prior complaint until after the defendant has damaged the victim\u2019s credibility with the \u201chumiliating intimation that . . . [she] agreed to the attack or dreamt it up\u201d can cause unwarranted prejudice to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, supra </em>at 397. It would wrest from a prosecutor the circumstances in which the evidence of the complaint is introduced. Other courts have similarly found these evidentiary doctrines to be inadequate substitutes for fresh complaint testimony. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>121 N.J. 150, 165 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-21\">b. <em>Changes to existing doctrine. </em>Our experience in reviewing the application of our \u201cfresh complaint\u201d doctrine in the thirteen years since the decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, supra, </em>has led to the conclusion that some elements of our \u201cfresh complaint\u201d doctrine do not adequately reflect current knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>about victims\u2019 reactions to sexual assault, and do little to vindicate the underlying purposes of the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">First, a requirement of \u201cpromptness\u201d or \u201cfreshness\u201d no longer withstands scrutiny as a cure to the problem of juror stereotyping in cases of sexual assault. To the contrary, it may exacerbate the very misunderstandings the rule aims to counteract \u2014 that those victims who report \u201cfreshly\u201d are inherently more credible than those who report at a later time \u2014 and contradicts our present understanding that victims often do not promptly report a sexual assault for a variety of reasons that have nothing to do with the validity of the claim of assault. See discussion <em>supra. </em>The \u201cpromptness\u201d rule thus benefits only those victims whose complaints are \u201cfresh,\u201d while reinforcing discredited notions that victims will \u201cnaturally\u201d promptly disclose the assault. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, supra </em>at 164. At a minimum, the promptness requirement places the imprimatur of the court on the misimpression that most \u201creal\u201d victims raise an immediate \u201chue and cry.\u201d At worst, the rule rewards perpetrators who are especially brutal or threatening during and after an assault, and thereby successfully procure their victims\u2019 prolonged silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Under the doctrine as we modify it today, ostensible \u201cdelay\u201d in disclosing a sexual assault is not a reason for excluding evidence of the initial complaint; the timing of a complaint is simply one factor the jury may consider in weighing the complainant\u2019s testimony. See, e.g., <em>Greenway </em>v. <em>State, </em>626 P.2d 1060, 1061 (Alaska 1980); <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>8 Cal. 4th 746, 750-751 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 298 (1996). Accordingly, we will no longer refer to this evidence as \u201cfresh complaint\u201d evidence, as \u201cfreshness\u201d has no bearing on its admission. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hyatt, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 488, 490, 492 (1991) (recognizing \u201cfresh complaint\u201d name discordant with disclosure after two years, although complaint testimony properly admitted). Rather, consistent with our focus on the evidence pertaining to the facts and circumstances surrounding the complainant\u2019s initial report of the alleged crime (discussed <em>infra), </em>we will henceforth refer to such evidence as \u201cfirst complaint\u201d evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Second, in the future, we will no longer permit in evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>testimony from multiple complaint witnesses, limiting the testimony to that of one witness \u2014 the first person told of the assault. The testimony of multiple complaint witnesses likely serves no additional corroborative purpose, and may unfairly enhance a complainant\u2019s credibility as well as prejudice the defendant by repeating for the jury the often horrific details of an alleged crime. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>439 Mass. 441, 458 (2003); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>412 Mass. 664, 671 n.5 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, supra </em>at 659-660. Evidence that a complainant repeatedly complained of a sexual assault to several different persons in most instances will likely do no more to refute an inference of fabrication than permitting one first complaint witness to testify. A victim who is not fabricating an assault may tell only one other person of the assault, while a liar may spread the tale widely. Permitting a single first complaint witness to testify will accomplish the primary goal of the doctrine, which is to refute any false inference that silence is evidence of a lack of credibility on the part of rape complainants.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Where feasible, that single complaint witness will be the first or initial complaint witness, i.e., the person who was first told of the assault, and may testify to the details of the alleged victim\u2019s first complaint of sexual assault and the circumstances surrounding that first complaint as part of the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief. See <em>infra. </em>It is the alleged victim\u2019s first complaint, the point at which the accusation first surfaced, that is the most pertinent to the jury\u2019s understanding of what motivated the victim to come forward and is the most useful in assessing the victim\u2019s credibility (including assessing any specific defense theories attacking that credibility). Law enforcement officials, as well as investigatory, medical, or social work professionals, may testify to the complaint only where they are in fact the first to have heard of the assault, and not where they have been told of the alleged crime after previous complaints or after an official report.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">In limited circumstances, a judge may permit the testimony of a complaint witness other than, and in lieu of, the very \u201cfirst\u201d complaint witness. For example, where the first person told of the alleged assault is unavailable, incompetent, or too young to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>testify meaningfully, the judge may exercise discretion in allowing one other complaint witness to testify. In such circumstances, the prosecution must justify the substitution before trial in a motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">We retain that aspect of our current doctrine that permits the first complaint witness to testify to the details of the complaint itself. By details, we mean that the witness \u201cmay testify to the complainant\u2019s statements of the facts of the assault.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quincy Q., </em>434 Mass. 859, 874 (2001). We are aware that most jurisdictions adhere to the rule that evidence of the complainant\u2019s report should be limited to the fact of the complaint only,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and that many hold the position that the details should be permitted only to rehabilitate the complainant after impeachment. In contrast, we continue to be persuaded that by allowing in evidence all of the details, the doctrine gives the fact finder \u201cthe maximum amount of information with which to assess the credibility of the . . . complaint evidence as well as the overall credibility of the victim.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, supra </em>at 659, quoting Graham, The Cry of Rape: The Prompt Complaint Doctrine and the Federal Rules of Evidence, 19 Willamette L. Rev. 489, 511 (1983). Moreover, the \u201cadmission of a partial statement [without the details] might tend to discredit the complainant\u2019s testimony at trial as a recent fabrication rather than to corroborate it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blow, </em>370 Mass. 401, 405 (1976). Conversely, admitting only the fact of the complaint might give an erroneous impression that it is completely consistent with the complainant\u2019s in-court testimony. Thus, being apprised of a first complaint without details is to ask \u201cthe jury to draw important inferences from imperfect materials, perfect materials being at hand and in the cognizance of the witness in the box. . . . \u2018[N]othing ought necessarily to be left to speculation or surmise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>370 Mass. 388, 395 (1976), quoting Hawkins, J., in <em>The Queen </em>v. <em>Lillyman, </em>[1896] 2 Q.B. 167, 177-178. Admitting details of the complaint \u201ctends more satisfactorily than the rival rule to meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>in proper cases the humiliating intimation that the victim agreed to the attack or dreamt it up.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, supra </em>at 397. To the extent that jurors today are more informed in their understanding of sexual assault than they were when we decided <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, supra, </em>it is beneficial to provide those jurors with more, not less, information concerning the initial complaint. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, supra </em>at 455 (Sosman, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Several aspects of our first complaint doctrine as now modified further protect defendants from the possibility of undue prejudice. First, as the Commonwealth will be limited to one complaint witness, our new rule takes into account any prejudicial \u201cpiling on\u201d of such witnesses. Second, a defendant will be free to cross-examine both the first complaint witness and the complainant about the details of the complaint, and draw to the jury\u2019s attention any discrepancies in the complainant\u2019s story that come to light only as a result of this additional information. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>412 Mass. 664, 670 (1992). Third, judges will retain their discretion to curtail direct or cross-examination to avoid any undue prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 671 n.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">In contrast to our prior rule enunciated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>429 Mass. 22, 30 (1999), the complainant may also testify to the details of the first complaint (i.e., what the complainant told the first complaint witness) and also why the complaint was made at that particular time.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> This information is particularly relevant against the backdrop of frequent defense claims that delays in reporting sexual assault suggest fabrication, and that allegations and reports are made in retaliation against them. Additionally, initial disclosures of sexual assault, often frightening and traumatic for victims, may portray only a limited or censored account of the assault itself, with little or no specific explanation of the reasons for coming forward with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>allegation.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thus, information from the complainant (often unknown to the first complaint witness) explaining the timing of the complaint, her or his motivation for disclosing the assault to the particular person told and in the particular circumstances, and the manner in which the complainant made the disclosure, may be essential to the jury\u2019s understanding and appreciation of the first complaint testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Also under our new rule, a first complaint witness may testify to the circumstances surrounding the initial complaint. By \u201ccircumstances,\u201d we mean that the witness may testify to his or her observations of the complainant during the complaint; the events or conversations that culminated in the complaint; the timing of the complaint; and other relevant conditions that might help a jury assess the veracity of the complainant\u2019s allegations or assess the specific defense theories as to why the complainant is making a false allegation. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>8 Cal. 4th 746, 762-763 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Woodard, </em>146 N.H. 221, 226 (2001). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quincy Q., </em>434 Mass. 859, 874-875 (2001) (\u201cfresh complaint\u201d testimony about complainant\u2019s demeanor viewed as witness\u2019s interpretation of complainant\u2019s word and inadmissible).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Like the details of the complaint and the information about the timing of the complaint provided by the complainant, these circumstances may be critical as the jury consider the validity of the complaint and may be helpful in assisting them in understanding the timing of and motivations underlying the complaint. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, supra </em>at 456-458 (Sosman, J., concurring). The goal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>of this new first complaint doctrine is to give the jury as complete a picture as possible of how the accusation of sexual assault first arose. That complete picture will allow them to make a fairer and more accurate assessment of the validity of that accusation, based on specific information about the people involved rather than on outdated stereotypes and generalities.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">First complaint testimony, including the details and circumstances of the complaint, will be considered presumptively relevant to a complainant\u2019s credibility in most sexual assault cases where the fact of the assault or the issue of consent is contested. However, where neither the occurrence of a sexual assault nor the complainant\u2019s consent is at issue, the evidence will serve no corroborative purpose and will not be admissible under the first complaint doctrine. For example, where the sole issue is the identity of the perpetrator, first complaint testimony will not be relevant or permissible under the doctrine. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 305 n.20 (1996). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>439 Mass. 441, 458 (2003) (Sosman, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Jury instructions must be modified to reflect the changes to our doctrine adopted in this opinion. A proper instruction to the jury will now read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">\u201cIn sexual assault cases we allow testimony by one person the complainant told of the alleged assault. We call this \u2018first complaint\u2019 evidence. The complainant may have reported the alleged sexual assault to more than one person. However, our rules normally permit testimony only as to the complainant\u2019s first report. The next witness will testify about the complainant\u2019s \u2018first complaint.\u2019 You may consider this evidence only for specific limited purposes: to establish the circumstances in which the complainant first reported the alleged offense, and then to determine whether that first complaint either supports or fails to support the complainant\u2019s own testimony about the crime. You may not consider this testimony as evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>that the assault in fact occurred. The purpose of this \u2018first complaint\u2019 evidence is to assist you in your assessment of the credibility and reliability of the complainant\u2019s testimony here in court. In assessing whether this \u2018first complaint\u2019 evidence supports or detracts from the complainant\u2019s credibility or reliability, you may consider all the circumstances in which the first complaint was made. The length of time between the alleged crime and the report of the complainant to this witness is one factor you may consider in evaluating the complainant\u2019s testimony, but you may also consider that sexual assault complainants may delay reporting the crime for a variety of reasons.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">As is the current practice, these instructions should be given to the jury contemporaneously with the first complaint testimony, and again during the final instructions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, supra </em>at 660.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Finally, because the modification of the out-dated \u201cfresh complaint\u201d doctrine that we announce today is an \u201cexercise of our power of superintendence \u2018to regulate the presentation of evidence in court proceedings\u2019 [and] not a new constitutional rule,\u201d we apply the changes prospectively to only those sexual assault cases tried after the issuance of the rescript in this opinion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dagley, </em>442 Mass. 713, 720-721 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambattista, </em>442 Mass. 423, 444-445 (2004). \u201cIn prior cases announcing new rules or requirements in the exercise of our superintendence power, we have declined to give the new rule or requirement retroactive effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dagley, supra </em>at 720-721, and cases cited. The defendant is not entitled to the benefit of the new first complaint doctrine. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, supra </em>at 305-306 (applying similar doctrine prospectively). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adjutant, </em>443 Mass. 649, 667 (2005) (applying new rule of evidence to case where defendant argued for rule on direct appeal but otherwise applying new rule prospectively).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth above, there was no er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>ror in the testimony admitted at trial under the \u201cfresh complaint\u201d doctrine. Nor was there any error in the indictment, the sufficiency of the evidence, the two convictions based on separate acts, or the judge\u2019s decision to admit the defendant\u2019s prior conviction. The defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty on the charge of forcible rape of a child under sixteen years was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-9\">Although Alice testified that the abuse occurred between one week and one day prior to her complaint to her mother, the Commonwealth\u2019s indictment spans a much longer period.

Apparently, the father\u2019s visitation schedule was such that the abuse could not have occurred on the day of the report or the day before. Thus, the prosecution\u2019s indictment spans a longer period of time in an apparent effort to ensure that it captured every possible date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b240-15\">The indictment reads, in part, that the defendant \u201cdid unlawfully have sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse with ... a child under sixteen years of age, and compelled said [child] to submit by force and against her will, or compelled said [child] to submit by threat of bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b240-20\">General Laws c. 265, \u00a7 22A, reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b240-21\">\u201cWhoever has sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse with a child under sixteen, and compels said child to submit by force and against his will or compels said child to submit by threat of bodily injury, shall be punished . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b240-25\">Because we find the defendant\u2019s indictment for rape sufficient, we need not consider his argument that all subsequent proceedings taken in reliance on the indictment are \u201cvoid.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b240-28\">The defendant points to a range of sources in search of a definition of rape conducive to his case, including Shakespeare and \u201cWebster\u2019s.\u201d We believe our existing case law provides sufficient guidance to resolve the case at hand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"AYU\">See, e.g., <em>Murray </em>v. <em>State, </em>770 P.2d 1131, 1139 (Alaska Ct.
