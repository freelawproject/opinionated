Swomley </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b896-9\">Joel Pentlarge appeals from the denial of his petition for relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, by a single justice of this court. We dismiss the appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">Pentlarge has been civilly committed as a sexually dangerous person pursuant to G. L. c. 123A. Shortly after his commitment, he filed a petition for examination and discharge under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 9. Despite much effort, however, he was unable to secure a trial date that was, in his view, consistent with his right to a \u201cspeedy hearing.\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 9, first par. He requested that the single justice order the Chief Justice for Administration and Management of the Trial Court to set a trial date within six months of the date of his G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 9, petition. The single justice denied relief, and this appeal followed. Subsequently, a judge in the Superior Court scheduled trial for January 11, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">The Commonwealth now moves to dismiss the appeal as moot. The only relief Pentlarge seeks on appeal is an order that a trial date be set forthwith. Because Pentlarge has received a trial date, the appeal is moot. See <em>Rosten </em>v. <em>Northeastern Univ., </em>432 Mass. 1003 (2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1168 (2001); <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>424 Mass. 1009 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-12\">Contrary to Pentlarge\u2019s argument, the matter is not \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d See <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Haufler, </em>377 Mass. 209, 211 (1979) (moot issue did not evade review where \u201c[ajppellate review . . . may be obtained in the normal course of some subsequent action without any substantial likelihood of mootness\u201d). If Pentlarge\u2019s (or any litigant\u2019s) right to a speedy hearing is in fact violated, that violation can be remedied on appeal from any adverse judgment. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>411 Mass. 503 (1992) (remedying, after convictions, delay in bringing defendant to trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-13\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
