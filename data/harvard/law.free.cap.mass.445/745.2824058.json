L. c. 66, \u00a7 10. We conclude that they are not public records subject to such disclosure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">The material facts are not in dispute. Harvard University is a private educational institution, and the HUPD provides campus security. Some officers of the HUPD have been appointed special State police officers pursuant to G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 63, and some HUPD officers are deputy sheriffs in Middlesex and Suffolk counties. On June 2, 2003, the Harvard Crimson, Inc. (Crimson), a daily student newspaper, requested certain documents from the Cambridge police department and the HUPD, pursuant to G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10. The Crimson subsequently made a request for documents from the Boston police department. It sought \u201call records, including but not limited to incident reports and correspondence, related to certain incidents listed on HUPD\u2019s weekly log of complaints.\u201d The HUPD denied the Crimson\u2019s request, asserting that it was not a public entity and, thus, was not required to comply with the mandates of \u00a7 10. Both the Cambridge and Boston police departments provided documents to the Crimson, including incident reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The Crimson brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against the President and Fellows of Harvard College, the HUPD, and the chief of police of the HUPD (collectively, Harvard), seeking disclosure of the requested documents in their custody. The complaint alleged that such documents were \u201cpublic records\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, and were subject to mandatory disclosure under G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">General Laws c. 66, \u00a7 10 (a), provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>\u201cEvery person having custody of any public record, as defined in [G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth], shall, at reasonable times and without unreasonable delay, permit it, or any segregable portion of a record which is an independent public record, to be inspected and examined by any person, under his supervision, and shall furnish one copy thereof upon payment of a reasonable fee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">General Laws c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, defines \u201cpublic records\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-6\">\u201c[A]ll books, papers, maps, photographs, recorded tapes, financial statements, statistical tabulations, or other documentary materials or data, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by any officer or employee of any agency, executive office, department, board, commission, bureau, division or authority of the commonwealth, or of any political subdivision thereof, or of any authority established by the general court to serve a public purpose, unless such materials or data fall within [certain specified] exemptions . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">Harvard filed a motion to dismiss the Crimson\u2019s complaint pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), on the ground that, as a private educational institution, Harvard was not one of the instrumentalities of State or local government whose records were \u201cpublic\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth. A judge in the Superior Court agreed and granted Harvard\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that the mere fact that HUPD officers were authorized to perform certain functions by State and local police departments did not make them officers or employees of a governmental entity such that any documents they made or received were public records subject to mandatory disclosure under G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10. Following the filing of the Crimson\u2019s notice of appeal, the case was transferred from the Appeals Court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">The Crimson now contends that the judge erred in concluding that documents held in the custody of the HUPD did not fall within the scope of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10. It points out that the statutory language manifests a clear legislative intent to give the public broad access to government documents, subject only to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>limited exemptions that are not pertinent here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Crimson argues that the appointment of some HUPD officers as special State police officers or deputy sheriffs vests them with broad police powers unique to public law enforcement agencies and, therefore, the HUPD is subject to the mandates of the public records law. Further, the Crimson asserts that it should be given the opportunity to develop a factual record to explore the scope of the authority exercised by HUPD officers and to demonstrate that such individuals are \u201cofficer[s] or employee[s]\u201d of public entities under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth. Because, as acknowledged by the Crimson, this case is one of statutory interpretation, the development of a factual record is unnecessary. We conclude that the judge did not err in determining that the documents sought by the Crimson from the HUPD were not \u201cpublic records\u201d subject to mandatory disclosure under G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Crimson\u2019s complaint was properly dismissed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The purpose of rule 12 (b) (6) is to permit prompt resolution of a case where the allegations in the complaint clearly demonstrate that the plaintiff\u2019s claim is legally insufficient. See <em>General Motors Acceptance Corp. </em>v. <em>Abington Cas. Ins. Co., </em>413 Mass. 583, 584 (1992); <em>Fabrizio </em>v. <em>Quincy, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 733, 734 (1980). In evaluating the allowance of a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>dismiss, we are guided by the familiar principle that a complaint is sufficient \u201cunless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of [its] claim which would entitle [it] to relief.\u201d <em>Nader </em>v. <em>Citron, </em>372 Mass. 96, 98 (1977), quoting <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957). The allegations set forth in the complaint, as well as such reasonable inferences as may be drawn therefrom in the plaintiffs favor, are to be taken as true. See <em>Eyal </em>v. <em>Helen Broadcasting Corp., </em>411 Mass. 426, 429 (1991), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">A fundamental principle of statutory interpretation \u201cis that a statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>435 Mass. 353, 360 (2001). Courts must ascertain the intent of a statute from all its parts and from the subject matter to which it relates, and must interpret the statute so as to render the legislation effective, consonant with sound reason and common sense. See <em>Champigny </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>422 Mass. 249, 251 (1996); <em>Pentucket Manor Chronic Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>394 Mass. 233, 240 (1985); <em>Tilton </em>v. <em>Haverhill, </em>311 Mass. 572, 577-578 (1942). A properly promulgated regulation is to be construed in the same manner as a statute. See <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>380 Mass. 762, 769 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The primary purpose of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, is to give the public broad access to government documents. See <em>Cape Cod Times </em>v. <em>Sheriff of Barnstable County, </em>443 Mass. 587, 592 (2005); <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>429 Mass. 798, 802 (1999); <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>388 Mass. 427, 436 (1983). To that end, disclosure is favored by a \u201cpresumption that the record sought is public.\u201d G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10 (c). See <em>Bougas </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Lexington, </em>371 Mass. 59, 61 (1976) (documents presumed to be public records when possessed by public entity). See also <em>Matter of a Subpoena Duces Tecum, ante </em>685, 687-688 (2006). Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>purpose, however, \u201cshould not be used as a means of disregarding the considered judgment of the Legislature that the public right of access should be restricted in certain circumstances.\u201d <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., supra. </em>See <em>Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette Corp. </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Worcester, </em>436 Mass. 378, 383 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">General Laws c. 66, \u00a7 10, expressly limits that statute\u2019s reach to every person having custody of a \u201cpublic record,\u201d as that term is defined in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That clause, in turn, provides that \u201c[pjublic records\u201d are those \u201cmade or received by any officer or employee of any agency, executive office, department, board, commission, bureau, division or authority of the commonwealth, or of any political subdivision thereof, or of any authority established by the general court to serve a public purpose.\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth. See <em>Hull Mun. Lighting Plant </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., </em>414 Mass. 609, 614 (1993). This court has construed strictly the scope of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, to preclude the public disclosure of documents held by entities other than those specifically delineated in the statute. See <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Executive Director of the Judicial Nominating Council, </em>425 Mass. 406, 409 (1997) (records of judicial nominating council not \u201cpublic records\u201d subject to disclosure where Governor is not \u201cagency, executive office, department, board, commission, bureau, division or authority\u201d of Commonwealth within explicit meaning of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth); <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. Retirement Bd., </em>416 Mass. 1007, 1007 (1993) (records of retirement board not subject to public disclosure under G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, where such entity not \u201cboard\u201d of Commonwealth under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth); <em>Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. </em>v. <em>Sergeant-at-Arms of the Gen. Court, </em>375 Mass. 179, 184 (1978) (telephone billing records of Legislature not \u201cpublic records\u201d subject to disclosure where Legislature not \u201cagency, executive office, department, board, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>commission, bureau, division or authority\u201d of Commonwealth within meaning of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The Legislature has delegated authority to implement the provisions of G. L. c. 66 to the supervisor of public records (supervisor), who has enacted comprehensive regulations regarding the scope and application of the public records law. See G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 1; 950 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 32.00 (2003). See also <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Beacon Hill Architectural Comm\u2019n, </em>421 Mass. 570, 583 (1996), and cases cited (\u201cAn administrative agency has jurisdiction to establish regulations that bear a rational relation to the statutory purpose\u201d). Such regulations are to \u201cbe construed to ensure the public prompt access to all public records in the custody of [Sjtate governmental entities and in the custody of governmental entities of political subdivisions of the Commonwealth.\" 950 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 32.02. The regulations define \u201c[pjublic records\u201d in the same manner as G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth. See 950 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 32.03. Further, a \u201c[gjovemmental [ejntity\u201d is defined as \u201cany authority established by the General Court to serve a public purpose, any department, office, commission, committee, council, board, division, bureau, or other agency within the Executive Branch of the Commonwealth, or within a political subdivision of the Commonwealth. It shall not include the legislature and the judiciary.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The public records law, and its implementing regulations, are applicable to documents held by public entities, not private ones. Simply put, Harvard University is a private institution, a fact not challenged by the Crimson. See, e.g., <em>Rice </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>663 F.2d 336, 337-338 (1st Cir. 1981), cert. denied, 456 U.S. 928 (1982) (Harvard not public institution and not sufficiently intertwined with Commonwealth to meet \u201c[Sjtate action\u201d requirement for 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim); <em>Krohn </em>v. <em>Harvard Law Sch., </em>552 F.2d 21, 23 (1st Cir. 1977) (same). It follows, therefore, that records in the custody of the HUPD, a department within Harvard University, are not \u201cpublic records\u201d that fall within the ambit of G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Contrary to the Crimson\u2019s argument, documents in the custody of the HUPD do not become \u201cpublic records\u201d simply because some of the HUPD officers have been appointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>\u201cspecial\u201d State police officers under G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 63. This statute provides that the colonel of the department of State police (colonel), at the request of an officer of an educational institution, may appoint employees of such institution as special State police officers. See G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 63. The powers conferred on employees who are so appointed are, by statute, far less extensive than the powers of regular police officers, see G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 98, and they are vested in individual officers, not on the security department of the educational institution as a whole. \u201cSuch special [Sjtate police officers shall serve for three years, subject to removal by the colonel, and they shall have the same power to make arrests as regular police officers for any criminal offense committed in or upon lands or structures owned, used or occupied\u201d by such institution. G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 63. Nothing in the language of \u00a7 63 suggests that individuals appointed as special State police officers are \u201cofficer[s] or employee[s]\u201d of the department of State police. To the contrary, the statute requires that such individuals be employees of the educational institution or other specified entity. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Regulations promulgated by the colonel pursuant to G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 69, similarly specify that, to be eligible for appointment as a special State police officer, a person must be \u201can employee of an agency described in [G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7\u00a7 56-68].\u201d 515 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.04(1) (1996). The regulations define \u201c[a]gency\u201d to include any college or university authorized by those statutory sections to request the appointment of \u201ccertain employees of such agency as special [Sjtate police officers.\u201d 515 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.03. When a special State police officer\u2019s employment with the educational institution ends, the officer\u2019s appointment under G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 63, also terminates. See 515 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.04(9). All police powers of that special State police officer are rescinded by the department of State police. See <em>id. </em>That individual does not assume the status of a State police officer and does not become an \u201cofficer or employee\u201d of the department of State police.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">This court has recognized generally that privately employed security guards engage in functions that are different from those performed by ordinary police officers. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leone, </em>386 Mass. 329, 335 (1982). \u201cGeneral Laws c. 22C, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>\u00a7 63, does not confer upon campus security staff all the powers of a State police officer appointed pursuant to c. 22C, \u00a7 10.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mullen, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 404, 407 (1996). Contrast G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 99; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callahan, </em>428 Mass. 335, 337 (1998) (G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 99, is broad statute permitting Massachusetts cities and towns to requisition special police officers from other States who \u201cshall have the authority of constables and police officers within the limits of such city or town, except as to the service of civil process\u201d). The law enforcement authority conferred by G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 63, on those individuals appointed thereunder, is statutorily limited to making arrests for criminal offenses committed on \u201clands or structures owned, used or occupied\u201d by the educational institution. Pursuant to G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 63, and its related regulations, a special State police officer simply is not treated as a member of the department of State police.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The Crimson\u2019s contention that documents in the custody of the HUPD have become \u201cpublic records\u201d because some HUPD officers have been appointed deputy sheriffs in Middlesex and Suffolk counties, thereby conferring on them the status of public employees, is equally unavailing. Pursuant to G. L. c. 37, \u00a7 3, a sheriff is vested with the discretion to appoint deputies who have general law enforcement powers and the right to serve process. See G. L. c. 37, \u00a7\u00a7 11, 12. See also <em>Tedeschi </em>v. <em>Reardon, </em>5 F. Supp. 2d 40, 42 n.3 (D. Mass. 1998); <em>Sheriff of Middle-sex County </em>v. <em>International Bhd. of Correctional Officers, Local R1-193, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 830, 831-832 (2005). A deputy sheriff has authority to take actions that a private person would not have in similar circumstances. A deputy sheriff may make warrantless arrests for misdemeanors, but only if the misdemeanor involves a breach of the peace, occurs in their presence or view, and continues at the time of arrest. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howe, </em>405 Mass. 332, 334 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grise, </em>398 Mass. 247, 251-252 (1986). The fact that some individual HUPD officers have been appointed deputy sheriffs, or special State police officers, does not transform the HUPD, itself, into an agency of the Commonwealth such that it becomes subject to the mandates of the public records law.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The Crimson\u2019s efforts to establish a correlation between a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>\u201cspecial [S]tate employee\u201d or \u201cspecial county employee\u201d for purposes of the Massachusetts conflict of interest statute, G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 1, and an HUPD officer who has been appointed as a \u201cspecial State police officer\u201d or a deputy sheriff, is unpersuasive. \u201cGeneral Laws c. 268A regulates the conduct of State, county, and municipal employees relating to the performance of their official duties.\u201d <em>Edgartown </em>v. <em>State Ethics Comm\u2019n, </em>391 Mass. 83, 84 (1984). It was \u201cenacted as part of \u2018comprehensive legislation . . . [to] strike at corruption in public office, inequality of treatment of citizens and the use of public office for private gain.\u2019 Report of the Special Commission on Code of Ethics, 1962 House Doc. No. 3650, [at] 18.\u201d <em>Everett Town Taxi, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aldermen of Everett, </em>366 Mass. 534, 536 (1974). The conduct of public officials and employees under G. L. c. 268A simply has no bearing on whether the HUPD is required to disclose documents in its custody to the public pursuant to G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">On a final note, we observe that many documents created and held by the HUPD are already available to the public. Pursuant to G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 98F, \u201ceach college or university to which officers have been appointed pursuant to the provisions of [G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 63,] shall make, keep and maintain a daily log, written in a form that can be easily understood, recording, in chronological order, all responses to valid complaints received, crimes reported, the names [and] addresses of persons arrested and the charges against such persons arrested. All entries in said daily logs shall, unless otherwise provided by law, be public records,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> except where such entries pertain to specified handicapped individuals.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In addition, regulations promulgated by the colonel pursuant to G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 69, specify that the person designated by a college or university to act as chief or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>director of the special State police officers of that institution (the qualified officer) shall report detailed information to the department of State police, on a monthly basis, about each search or arrest warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction in response to the institution\u2019s submission of affidavits or sworn statements. See 515 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.07(1)(c) (1996). The qualified officer also shall submit to the department of State police, on a monthly basis, a report setting forth all felonies that have occurred within the jurisdiction of the college or university during the previous month. See 515 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.07(2). Once in the custody of the department of State police, a department within the Executive Office of Public Safety, see G. L. c. 6A, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 18, those reports would be available for public inspection.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b764-7\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs filed in support of The Harvard Crimson by (1) the Student Press Law Center, the New England Press Association, the Society of Professional Journalists, the Associated Collegiate Press, The Heights, the Brown Daily Herald, and the National Police Accountability Project of the National Lawyers Guild; and (2) James K.

See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Kenco Optics, Inc., </em>369 Mass. 412, 418 (1976) (\u201cWhen an action for declaratory relief is properly brought and relief is denied on the merits, the action should not be dismissed,\u201d and rights of parties should be declared). However, dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), does not constitute a decision on the merits, and therefore, declaratory judgment should not enter. See <em>Wallerstein </em>v. <em>Bar Examiners, </em>414 Mass. 1008, 1009 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Although G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, requires disclosure by \u201c[e]very person having custody of any public record,\u201d the parties agree that this phrase does not encompass every private individual holding a document that is a public record, such as a birth certificate or a marriage license. The Crimson does assert, however, that the disclosure requirement should apply to the HUPD, an entity exercising broad police powers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b772-5\">In its complaint, the Crimson sets forth no information as to whether it has sought access to entries in the HUPD\u2019s daily logs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b772-6\">When G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 98F, was enacted in 1980, it only mandated that \u201c[e]ach police department\u201d make, keep, and maintain daily logs that would be available to the public. See St. 1980, c. 142. When the statute was amended in 1991, the Legislature expanded its purview to encompass \u201ceach college or university to which officers [had] been appointed pursuant to\u201d what is now G. L. c. 22C, \u00a7 63. See St. 1991, c. 125. This amendment suggests that a campus security department that had appointed individual employees as special State police officers was not considered to be a \u201cpolice department.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b773-6\">As properly noted by Harvard, some investigatory materials are not available for public review, notwithstanding the fact that they are in the possession of governmental agencies. Under G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth <em>(f), </em>public records do not include \u201cinvestigatory materials necessarily compiled out of the public view by law enforcement or other investigatory officials!,] the disclosure of which materials would probably so prejudice the possibility of effective law enforcement that such disclosure would not be in the public interest.\u201d These materials include \u201caccounts of police investigatory efforts including the police officer\u2019s own observations of the incident in question, statements taken from witnesses, additional information obtained from other sources, some confidential, and leads and tips to be pursued.\u201d <em>Bougas </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Lexington, </em>371 Mass. 59, 62 (1976). The exemption set forth in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth (f), applies to both open and closed investigations. See <em>id. </em>at 63.
