L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">Brown is a codefendant with Nathan Rivera in a pending homicide case. At Rivera\u2019s request, a judge in the Superior Court ordered that Brown submit to a buccal swab for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Brown unsuccessfully challenged that order in the county court. The case is now before us pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 2:21, as amended, 434 Mass. 1301 (2001). Brown claims that he cannot obtain adequate review on appeal because by then the seizure \u2014 the swabbing of his cheek \u2014 will already have occurred. We rejected the same argument in <em>White </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>439 Mass. 1017 (2003). See <em>Matter of a Grand Jury Investigation, </em>435 Mass. 1002, 1003 (2001) (rejecting same argument concerning blood sample). See also <em>Glawson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>436 Mass. 1007 (2002) (blood and hair samples); <em>Cummins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>433 Mass. 1005, 1006 (2001) (blood sample). Accordingly, Brown has failed to meet his burden under rule 2:21.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-16\">See <em>Jansen, petitioner, </em>444 Mass. 112, 113 n.2 (2005) (buccal swab involves rubbing swab on inside of cheek).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
