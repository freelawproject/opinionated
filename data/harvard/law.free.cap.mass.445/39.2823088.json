The lengthy procedural history of the appeal that explains the delay is as follows. On April 23,1987, a Superior Court jury convicted the defendant of murder in the first degree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Almost five years later, on January 31, 1992, the defendant, represented by new counsel, filed a motion for a new trial in this court that was remanded to the Superior Court for disposition. On June 29, 1993, without conducting an evidentiary hearing, the trial judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion on the basis that his trial counsel had furnished constitutionally ineffective assistance because counsel had failed to investigate fully the possibility that the defendant was suffering a mental impairment at the time of the killing. The Commonwealth appealed and, on June 1, 1995, this court vacated the judge\u2019s order granting a new trial, concluding that the record was insufficient to support the order, and directing the judge to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">\u201c(1) conduct a full evidentiary hearing on the motion for a new trial; (2) receive testimony from the defendant\u2019s trial counsel regarding the nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s instructions to him concerning trial strategy; and finally, (3) . . . enter a new order on the motion and, if the motion is granted, indicate whether, and in what respects, she relied on any special knowledge that she had garnered during the course of the trial about the effectiveness of defense counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-6\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Companonio, </em>420 Mass. 1003, 1003 (1995). The trial judge complied with these directives, and on September 18, 2000, entered a memorandum and order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The defendant appealed, and the defendant\u2019s then appellate counsel filed his appellate brief (to which the Commonwealth responded with its appellate brief). On December 31, 2001, the defendant filed a pro se motion asking that new counsel be appointed for him and that a new evidentiary hearing be held on his motion for a new trial. It was determined that new counsel should be appointed for the defendant. On July 25, 2002, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>defendant\u2019s present appellate counsel entered his appearance in this court. In the fall of 2002, present appellate counsel filed a motion and, soon thereafter, an amended motion for postconviction relief, which were remanded to the Superior Court. In the order of remand, this court directed that any resulting appeal \u201cbe consolidated with the appeal of the [defendant\u2019s] conviction.\u201d On May 28, 2003, the defendant moved for an evidentiary hearing on his amended motion for postconviction relief. In a written memorandum of decision and order dated September 22, 2003, a Superior Court judge (not the trial judge) denied the requested evidentiary hearing and the amended motion,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, thereafter denied a motion to reconsider her order denying an evidentiary hearing. The defendant\u2019s present appellate counsel then perfected an appeal from these orders, which was consolidated with the appeal from the defendant\u2019s conviction and the appeal from the denial of his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">The briefs filed by the defendant\u2019s former and present appellate counsel raise a variety of claims. The principal claims assert that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel provided the defendant with constitutionally ineffective assistance by not challenging the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial and by failing to investigate fully whether (and argue to the jury that) the defendant lacked the capacity to form a specific intent to kill or to deliberately premeditate. These arguments, as well as the defendant\u2019s other arguments (which need not be referred to here) will be evaluated as instructed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992), under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, with consideration given to \u201cwhether there was an error in the course of the trial (by defense counsel, the prosecutor, or the judge) and, if there was, whether that error was likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u201d We discern no basis to order a new trial under this standard. Further, after general consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>ation under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, of the record and the fairness of the verdict apart from the claims specifically argued, we find no basis to reduce the verdict or to order a new trial. We affirm the orders denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial and the amended motion for postconviction relief and evidentiary hearing thereon, and the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">To provide over-all background, we first summarize the facts as the jury could have found them in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. We shall then summarize the judge\u2019s facts and conclusions on the defendant\u2019s original motion for a new trial, and thereafter proceed to resolve the defendant\u2019s claims that his trial counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance with respect to the issues of competency and mental impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>In the early evening of May 19, 1986, the defendant and Santos Lopez arrived separately at the apartment of the victim, Gilberto Nohoya, in Brockton. The three men were friends, and were immigrants from Cuba. The defendant had been living with the victim for several months.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The victim had been drinking vodka prior to the arrival of the defendant and Lopez. Shortly after the defendant had arrived, the victim began to argue with him. The argument lasted ten to fifteen minutes. It started inside and then moved outside. The victim produced a knife. The entire argument remained verbal, and the victim threw the knife to the ground. The defendant picked it up, brought it back inside, and placed it in the kitchen cabinet above the sink.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">At some point, the victim disclosed that the following day was his birthday. In celebration, each of the men drank an entire bottle of champagne. In addition, the defendant and Lopez \u201csnorted\u201d cocaine three to four times. Later, the three men went for a ride in the defendant\u2019s automobile. The defendant took out a .22 caliber automatic pistol, and the three men took turns firing it into the air. When the men returned to the victim\u2019s apartment, the defendant put the pistol under a pillow in the bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">At approximately 11:30 p.m., the defendant\u2019s cousin, Celia Vasquez, stopped by. The three men were drinking when she arrived and appeared to be drunk. Lopez asked Vasquez to give the victim a kiss for his birthday and she did. Vasquez went into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>the bedroom with the victim and the defendant. The victim touched Vasquez, and the defendant got \u201ca little bit upset.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Vasquez departed after about thirty minutes. After she left, the defendant and the victim did not argue.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Later, Brenda Elaine Gunderway, another friend of the defendant, stopped by to drop off the defendant\u2019s laundry. She remained for about fifteen minutes, during which time she had some champagne.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">At approximately 2:20 a.m., now May 20, the defendant announced that he was going to go out and get \u201cthe pistol\u201d so they could \u201ctry out the .38.\u201d He left the apartment, returning five minutes later. Lopez was sitting in a chair and the victim was standing in front of him. When the defendant returned, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go for a ride,\u201d and then fired once at the victim and once at Lopez. The victim was hit in the chest, and Lopez was hit in the finger. Lopez tried to escape out the back door, but it was locked. The defendant fired at him a second time, but missed. The defendant left. The victim died within a minute of being shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Lopez ran outside where he saw the defendant get into his car and drive away. Lopez ran to a public telephone and telephoned the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">At about 3 a.m., the defendant went to Gunderway\u2019s nearby apartment, claiming to have lost his keys. Gunderway told him he could lay down on the couch. Vasquez arrived soon thereafter, and stayed until about 9 a.m. The defendant told Vasquez that he had shot the victim by accident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">Brockton police found the .22 caliber pistol under a pillow in the bedroom of the victim\u2019s apartment. Later, at approximately 10 a.m., a police officer found the defendant under a blanket at Gunderway\u2019s apartment and arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Police recovered two spent .38 caliber bullets in the victim\u2019s apartment, and one spent .38 caliber bullet from the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>body. The bullets all had the same general \u201crifling system.\u201d* **<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The murder weapon, which could not have been a .22 caliber automatic pistol, was never found.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Three days following the shooting, after the defendant had been arrested, he telephoned Lopez. The defendant told Lopez, in Spanish, to \u201cforget about [the victim]\u201d and then asked Lopez to \u201ctry to help him.\u201d One interpretation of the defendant\u2019s statement could have been, \u201cI am in trouble, I\u2019m accused of something I didn\u2019t do and only you can help me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The defendant did not testify. He called one witness, the head of security for the Brockton housing authority, who testified that, at approximately 12:16 a.m. on May 20, he observed the defendant, victim, and Lopez outside the victim\u2019s apartment arguing with another man, and soon thereafter observed a woman leave the victim\u2019s apartment and get into an automobile parked nearby, joined thereafter by two men, including the man who had been arguing with the defendant, the victim, and Lopez. In closing, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel argued that the defendant did not shoot the victim; the Commonwealth\u2019s principal witnesses were not credible; that the defendant had no reason to leave the apartment to get a .38 caliber gun because he had ready access to a fully loaded .22 pistol; that, if the jury found that the defendant had shot the victim, that they also find that he was impaired when doing so by his use of alcohol and drugs; and that, if the jury found that the defendant shot the victim, it was an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">2. <em>Motion for a new trial. </em>After expressly crediting the testimony of the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, the trial judge dealt with the defendant\u2019s original motion for a new trial as follows.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Prior to trial, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel had been aware of the possibility of a \u201cdiminished capacity\u201d defense based on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>mental disease or defect<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, for that reason, hired Dr. Robert F. Moore, a psychiatrist, to examine the defendant (for opinions concerning competency to stand trial and criminal responsibility). After reviewing Dr. Moore\u2019s report, trial counsel concluded that the \u201cclassic insanity defense\u201d did not appear to be a viable option. Although he knew that the defendant had been admitted to Bridgewater State Hospital (Bridgewater) before trial, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not have Dr. Moore reevaluate the defendant, and did not seek another expert to evaluate the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Notwithstanding Dr. Moore\u2019s report, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel repeatedly talked to the defendant, through an interpreter, about the possibility of pursuing a \u201cdiminished capacity\u201d defense based on a mental disease or defect. The defendant refused to allow such a defense, maintaining that he did not commit the crime and saying that \u201ccrazy people go to hell.\u201d Although trial counsel disagreed with the defendant\u2019s decision, on the defendant\u2019s insistence, the issue was not pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">In rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim that his trial counsel failed to investigate fully his mental impairment, the judge recognized that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel investigated the defendant\u2019s mental capacity by having a defense expert, Dr. Moore, evaluate the defendant. She took note of the \u201cgreater weakness\u201d in the defendant\u2019s argument, namely, that nothing in the record indicated that, at the time of the shooting, the defendant lacked capacity to premeditate or to form the mental state required for malice. The judge concluded, \u201c[gjiven the state of the record, specifically, the lack of evidence that [the defendant\u2019s] alleged mental defect may have prevented him from premeditating the crime or forming malice, as well as [the defendant\u2019s] persistent refusal to pursue such defense, it was not manifestly unreasonable for [the defendant\u2019s trial counsel] to fail to investigate further [the defendant\u2019s] mental defect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>The judge also concluded that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s decision not to pursue a \u201cdiminished capacity\u201d defense at trial based on mental disease or defect was not unreasonable considering the defendant\u2019s insistence that he was \u201cnot crazy\u201d and that he did not kill the victim. She found that the defendant was competent to assist his attorney in his own defense,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel attempted to convince him to pursue a \u201cdiminished capacity\u201d defense and communicated to him the potential impact of such a defense on the outcome of the case, and that the defendant voluntarily chose to forgo such a defense. The judge explained, \u201c[the defendant] may not now, in hindsight, request a new trial and contend that his [trial] counsel was ineffective for following his orders.\u201d We now turn to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">3. (a) <em>Competency. </em>The defendant argues that his first post-conviction counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to raise the issue of the defendant\u2019s competence in his original new trial motion. The defendant acknowledges that, in dealing with this claim, the trial judge addressed the competence issue, concluding that the record supported the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial. The defendant argues that this conclusion is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The defendant awaited trial in custody at the Plymouth County house of correction. Prior to trial, which commenced on April 15, 1987, and concluded on April 23, 1987, the defendant was evaluated three times, twice pursuant to a court order and once at the request of his trial counsel, to determine whether he was competent to stand trial, see G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 15 <em>(b), </em>and to determine whether he was fit to await trial in jail, see G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 18 <em>(a). </em>The first evaluation took place at Bridgewater on July 25, 1986, and was made by Dr. Jorge Veliz, the hospital\u2019s director of clinical services. Dr. Veliz examined the defendant pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 18 (a) and 15 (b), diagnosing him with a \u201c[s]chizo-affective [disorder\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>cocaine abuse and dependency, but concluding that he was competent to stand trial and did not require admission to the hospital pending trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The defendant was next evaluated on September 18, 1986, for competency by Dr. Moore, who had been retained by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel. Dr. Moore remarked that he did \u201cnot see substantial evidence of a [m]ajar [m]entai [disorder\u201d in the defendant, and diagnosed him as having a mixed personality disorder. Dr. Moore concluded that the defendant was competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">On December 26, 1986, a psychologist, Dr. Leonard Bard, the assistant medical director of Bridgewater, evaluated the defendant pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 18 (a). Dr. Bard diagnosed the defendant as having a \u201cmajor mental illness,\u201d namely, paranoid schizophrenia. Dr. Bard stated that the defendant\u2019s condition \u201cis somewhat controlled with psychotropic medications,\u201d and he concluded that the defendant should be returned to the house of correction to await trial. In connection with her finding that the defendant was able to waive a defense based on mental impairment, the trial judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">\u201c[The defendant\u2019s trial counsel] never argued that [the defendant] was not competent to stand trial. In fact, not only did [the defendant\u2019s trial counsel] believe that [the defendant] appeared to understand the nature of the proceedings but Dr. Veliz and Dr. Moore also found [the defendant] competent to stand trial. . . . Following his own judgment, which was wholly supported by the evaluation of his expert, Dr. Moore, [the defendant\u2019s trial counsel] never raised the issue of [the defendant\u2019s] competency to stand trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">To support his present contention that his trial counsel should have requested a competency determination at the time of trial, the defendant relies on \u201cevidence of incompetency,\u201d which can be characterized as follows: (1) records pertaining to the defendant\u2019s admission to Bridgewater on three occasions prior to trial; (2) the fact of the defendant\u2019s incarceration \u201cthe last month prior to trial\u201d (as distinguished from an admission to Bridgewater); (3) an opinion that the stress of the impending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>trial worsened the defendant\u2019s mental condition; (4) the \u201cobservations\u201d of the defendant\u2019s trial counsel; and (5) the defendant\u2019s postconviction admission to Bridgewater, in December, 1987, and finding of incompetence to serve his sentence in prison for a period of approximately twenty months. Relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>375 Mass. 50 (1978), the defendant maintains that the competency determinations made by Drs. Velez and Moore are undermined by the fact that their evaluations took place several months before trial and are further undermined by the defendant\u2019s postconviction commitment to Bridgewater. We reject the defendant\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\u201cIt has long been the law of this Commonwealth that the \u2018trial, conviction or sentencing of a person charged with a criminal offence while he is legally incompetent violates his constitutional rights of due process\u2019 (footnote omitted), whether under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States or under art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of this Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, supra </em>at 51-52, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vailes, </em>360 Mass. 522, 524 (1971). \u201c[T]he Commonwealth bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a defendant is competent to stand trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Serino, </em>436 Mass. 408, 414 (2002). The standard for determining competency \u201cis framed in terms of the defendant\u2019s functional abilities: \u2018whether [the defendant] has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodreau, </em>442 Mass. 341, 350 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Russin, </em>420 Mass. 309, 317 (1995). The inquiry \u201cis not why counsel failed to request a competency hearing or why the court failed to hold one on its own initiative, but whether, no less on hindsight than by foresight, there were elements of such indication in the situation as, if proper notice had been taken of them, could present a substantial question of possible doubt as to [the defendant\u2019s] competency to stand trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, supra </em>at 54, quoting <em>Rhay </em>v. <em>White, </em>385 F.2d 883, 886 (9th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">None of the defendant\u2019s so-called \u201cevidence of incompe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>tency\u201d creates a \u201csubstantial question of possible doubt\u201d on the issue of competency. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>431 Mass. 442, 448 (2000). In his report finding the defendant competent to stand trial, Dr. Veliz accurately refers to the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s first admission to Bridgewater. While Dr. Moore may not have examined the actual records pertaining to the defendant\u2019s first Bridgewater admission, he indicated that he had read and considered Dr. Veliz\u2019s report. Dr. Bard did not evaluate the defendant for competency to stand trial but, in his report, noted the circumstances of the defendant\u2019s second admission to Bridgewater, taking care to reference, correctly and specifically, relevant material in the initial admission note as well as a subsequent progress note.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The defendant\u2019s last pretrial admission to Bridgewater discloses nothing of significance. The purpose of the defendant\u2019s admission was to determine, pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 18 (a), whether he was fit to await trial in a penal setting, because he had been \u201cunmanageable in jail.\u201d The admission note consists of one-half of one page of text, and notes the following: \u201cMood not depressed. No delusions. Affect normal range. Denies hallucinations. States he wanted some air in his cell. States he \u2018put a fire in the hallway\u2019 and this incident resulted in his being sent here.\u201d The defendant was transferred back to the house of correction on March 2, 1987. None of the records from these three pretrial hospital admissions discloses any information that had not already been noted, and considered, by Drs. Veliz, Moore, and Bard, or which was not cumulative of their prior findings and diagnoses or altogether insignificant.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">While incarceration of a mentally ill person prior to trial may result in \u201cfurther problems\u201d for that person, speculation that it did so here is undermined by the fact that the defendant\u2019s return to the house of correction on March 2, 1987, conformed to the recommendations of the Bridgewater staff. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, supra </em>at 58. Speculation, such as the defendant\u2019s statement that \u201cit is likely that the stress of the impending trial caused [the defendant\u2019s] condition to worsen,\u201d is not relevant to a determination of competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The defendant concedes that his trial counsel\u2019s observations and ultimate awareness, or lack thereof, of a competency issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>is \u201cultimately irrelevant.\u201d He goes on, however, to contend that \u201c[w]here a defendant facing a first degree murder charge has been diagnosed with a major mental illness, and yet refuses to discuss an insanity defense, this fact alone establishes beyond any doubt that the defendant is not malingering and that there is a \u2018substantial question of possible doubt\u2019 as to his competence.\u201d We previously rejected such a contention, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Serino, supra </em>at 416. The contention also ignores the effect of any prescribed medications taken by a defendant to ameliorate his mental illness, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodreau, supra </em>at 351. In this case, the defendant had such medications (Dr. Bard, on December 26, 1986, indicated that the defendant\u2019s paranoid schizophrenia \u201cis somewhat controlled with psychotropic medications\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">The time frame for determining a defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial is \u201cthe condition of the defendant at the time of trial.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, supra </em>at 62. The defendant\u2019s postconviction admission and commitment to Bridgewater is essentially irrelevant. A competency evaluation made contemporaneously with trial would have been preferable, see <em>id. </em>at 58. In the final analysis, we note that (1) the facts are distinguishable in material respects from what occurred in the <em>Hill </em>case,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (2) the defendant has not submitted any expert testimony indicating that he was not competent to stand trial,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and (3) at the evidentiary hearing on his original motion for a new trial, the defendant testified and made no claim that he was unable to understand the nature of the proceedings against him or to consult adequately with his trial counsel. The defendant may have been diagnosed, prior to trial, with a psychiatric condition, but, despite that condition, he was competent to stand trial. <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Robbins, supra </em>at 448. The present record does not show a \u201csubstantial question of possible doubt\u201d about the defendant\u2019s competency. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">(b) <em>Mental impairment. </em>The defendant also contends that his trial counsel acted improperly by not presenting evidence that mental impairment deprived the defendant of the ability to form the specific intent to kill and to deliberately premeditate, and, that as a result of this failure, he was denied a substantial ground of defense. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">As has been pointed out, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel did, in fact, have the defendant evaluated prior to trial by a psychiatrist, Dr. Moore. This fact alone distinguishes this case from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberio, </em>428 Mass. 278, 279 (1998), in which that defendant\u2019s trial counsel \u201cmade his own assessment of the defendant\u2019s mental health,\u201d and purposefully did not ask the defendant to submit to a psychiatric evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The defendant essentially acknowledges that the judge correctly exposed the \u201cgreater weakness\u201d in the defendant\u2019s claim, namely, the failure to present any expert opinion testimony that, on the date of the shooting, the defendant lacked the mental capacity, by reason of mental illness or defect or the combined effects of mental illness and intoxication, to form the specific intent to kill. From this deficiency alone, we conclude that the judge correctly rejected the defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laguer, </em>410 Mass. 89, 93-94 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Further, as found by the judge, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s decision to forgo pursuit of a \u201cdiminished capacity\u201d defense based on mental disease or defect was not unreasonable in light of the fact that it was based on the defendant\u2019s personal choice against the advice of counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Federici, All </em>Mass. 740, 744-745 (1998). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tevlin, </em>433 Mass. 305, 316-317 (2001), and cases cited. While the judge did not advise the defendant of the consequences of his decision, the defendant, as previously discussed, was competent to stand trial and to assist in his own defense, and he discussed the matter with his trial counsel. See <em>id. </em>That a different set of facts could have been found by the judge is inconsequential. The judge expressly discredited the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>testimony at the evidentiary hearing. Further, the record does not support the defendant\u2019s contention that trial counsel\u2019s discussions with him were limited to an insanity defense or that the discussions occurred only on the day of trial and were not meaningful.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">For the first time, the defendant argues that his \u201cpost-conviction counsel\u201d should have procured expert testimony that, at the time of the shooting, the defendant lacked the mental capacity to deliberately premeditate. Asserting that because one expert (Dr. Daniel M. Weiss, who died before the evidentiary hearing on the motion for new trial) \u201chad already opined that [the defendant] lacked the mental capacity to form the specific intent to kill,\u201d the defendant reasons that \u201cit should have been obvious that counsel could find another mental health professional who would come to the same conclusion.\u201d We reject the argument. There are no affidavits from prior appellate counsel on the issue, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>441 Mass. 291, 304 (2004), and a close examination of Dr. Weiss\u2019s affidavit discloses, contrary to the defendant\u2019s representations, that Weiss\u2019s proposed trial testimony was conditioned on \u201cpending test[] results\u201d and pertained to the elements needed to satisfy an insanity defense under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, </em>352 Mass. 544, 546-547 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Finally, we discern no error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing on his amended motion for postconviction relief. Dr. Bard\u2019s new affidavit identifies no cause, or combination of causes, for the defendant\u2019s inability to form a specific intent to kill or to deliberately premeditate. No substantial issue was raised. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>383 Mass. 253, 257 (1981). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberio, </em>428 Mass. 278, 280-282 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beattie, </em>409 Mass. 458, 459 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">4. <em>Remaining claims. </em>The defendant\u2019s remaining claims lack merit, (a) The defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not furnish ineffective assistance by failing to request that the prospective jurors be individually examined to ascertain whether any of them harbored bias toward Cubans. The defendant, the victim, and most of the percipient witnesses in the case were Cuban immigrants. There is no suggestion in the record that ethnicity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>or immigration status had any particular significance or played any part in the killing. This case is not in the category of cases where individual juror voir dire would be required because of a reasonable possibility that a specific form of prejudice might influence the jury\u2019s verdict. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pina, </em>430 Mass. 66, 73-74 (1999), and cases cited. No other factor has been shown that might dictate prudence on the part of the defendant\u2019s trial counsel in requesting an individual voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">(b) The prosecutor\u2019s brief references in his closing argument on how intoxication might affect premeditation and malice create no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice in view of the judge\u2019s clear instructions on premeditation and the effect of intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">(c) There is nothing in the challenged jury instructions to require a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">(i) The judge\u2019s mention, at the start of the substantive instructions, that, under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1, murder in the first degree could be committed by reason of deliberate premeditation, by extreme atrocity or cruelty, or by felony murder, did not create the possibility that the jury may have convicted the defendant on one, or both, of the last two theories. The case was tried solely as a case involving deliberate premeditation. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>There was no evidence presented on either extreme atrocity or cruelty or on felony-murder. Neither of these theories was argued to the jury by the prosecutor or rebutted in closing by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel. After generally paraphrasing G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 1, the judge instructed the jury solely on the elements of premeditated murder in the first degree, and made it clear to the jury that the defendant was charged only with \u201chaving committed murder with deliberately premeditated malice aforethought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">(ii) The judge\u2019s detailed and accurate instructions on deliberate premeditation, together with the nature of the shooting, eliminate any likelihood of a miscarriage of justice with respect to the third prong malice instruction, which contained language often given by judges in 1987, but since removed from the instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>434 Mass. 570, 587 &amp; n.12 (2001), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>(iii) The judge\u2019s instructions on the elements of involuntary manslaughter and on accident contain no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">(iv) The judge\u2019s instructions on the effect of intoxication on the defendant\u2019s culpability were correct and suitable to the only theory of murder that was tried before, and decided by, the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">5. There is no basis to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to order the entry of a lesser degree of guilt or a new trial. Despite the defendant\u2019s mental problems and his consumption of alcohol on the night of the killing, there was evidence of animosity between the defendant and the victim, the defendant\u2019s deliberate choice to obtain a higher caliber handgun, and the defendant\u2019s purposeful firing of three shots, one of which killed the victim, the second of which struck Lopez, and the third of which missed both of them. The jury were justified in concluding that the defendant had committed murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">6. The orders denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, amended motion for postconviction relief, and for an evidentiary hearing on the latter motion are affirmed. The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-8\">The jury returned a general verdict of murder in the first degree, but they were only instructed on deliberate premeditation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-13\">While the defendant\u2019s present appellate counsel labeled the motion an \u201camended motion for postconviction relief,\u201d undoubtedly concerned about the waiver of issues not presented in the first motion for a new trial, see Mass. R. Crim. R 30 (c) (2), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), he admitted at the hearing on the motion that the filing was \u201cactually an amended motion for a new trial.\u201d The judge deciding this motion correctly looked beyond the motion\u2019s label and defense counsel\u2019s semantics.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b61-11\">Vasquez denied that the victim had touched her and that the defendant and the victim had exchanged words over it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b61-12\">Vasquez\u2019s trial testimony differed from her grand jury testimony. Before the grand jury, she stated that the defendant denied shooting the victim and had told her that he was not at the victim\u2019s apartment at the time of the shooting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b62-8\">The Commonwealth\u2019s expert on firearms identification explained that a \u201crifling system\u201d is \u201ca number of lands and grooves that are cut into the bore of the barrel and given either a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation that acts to stabilize the bullet as it is fired down into [and] through the barrel.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b62-12\">The defendant challenges several of the judge\u2019s factual findings and conclusions as clearly erroneous. It is unnecessary to address each particular challenge because the judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions are supported by the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\u201cThere is no \u2018diminished capacity\u2019 defense in this Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>426 Mass. 725, 729 n.5 (1998). In accordance with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>380 Mass. 672, 673 (1980), a defendant \u201cmay produce expert testimony on the issue whether or not the impairment of his mental processes precluded him from being able to deliberately premeditate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The judge noted that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel never argued that the defendant was not competent to stand trial. She pointed out that not only did the defendant\u2019s trial counsel believe that the defendant was competent to stand trial, but two other doctors, including Dr. Moore, had found the defendant competent to stand trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b68-5\">For instance, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>375 Mass. 50, 58 (1978), the defendant\u2019s incarceration prior to trial contravened the recommendations made by Bridgewater\u2019s medical staff.
