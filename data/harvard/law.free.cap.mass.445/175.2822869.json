One complaint charged six counts occurring against one child, and a separate complaint charged two counts allegedly occurring months earlier against a different child. On a consolidated appeal from the convictions and the denial of his motion for a new trial, the defendant contended that the trial judge erred by joining the two complaints for trial and by precluding him from introducing certain evidence. He also brought the claims of error he raised in his motion for a new trial. The Appeals Court reversed the judgments and set aside the verdicts. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pillai, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 603 (2004). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand the case for resentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-20\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the facts in their light most favorable to the Commonwealth, reserving other details for discussion when relevant to the issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-21\">The defendant\u2019s daughter, Anne, was friends with the complainants, who were both thirteen years old on the relevant dates.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> One day in July or August, 1999, Anne invited Rose to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>spend the night at her house, which Rose had done before. Rose testified that, while she was sleeping next to Anne in a basement family room, she awoke between 3 and 4 a.m. to find the defendant \u201chovering\u201d over her with his hands on her breasts squeezing her nipple. The defendant kept trying to lift her shirt, saying \u201cLet me see, let me see,\u201d while assuring her that he would not \u201ctake [her] virginity.\u201d Rose awakened Anne, who quickly fell back to sleep. The defendant remained in the room for more than ten minutes, sitting on a couch watching Rose. Rose eventually fell back to sleep and went home immediately when she awoke in the morning. The only person Rose told about the incident was Anne, who changed the subject when Rose brought it up one week later.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">On December 23, 1999, Anne invited another friend, Kathy, to spend the night at her house. Kathy testified that, while Anne was checking her email, the defendant pulled her close to him, with his hand on her waist, then \u201cgrabbed\u201d her breast, \u201cpulled\u201d her nipple toward him, and placed his hand on her buttocks. Later, while driving to a restaurant for dinner, the defendant repeatedly reached behind his seat to feel Kathy\u2019s legs. Back at the house, when Kathy went to Anne\u2019s room to retrieve a pillow, the defendant tried to pull Kathy into a bathroom by \u201ctugging\u201d on her arm. Later, when the girls were walking to the basement family room, the defendant succeeded in pulling Kathy into a bathroom. There, he told her he would not do anything to her unless she wanted him to, stating, \u201cI would never touch you here, here, or here,\u201d while in turn touching her upper breast, vaginal area, and buttocks for a few seconds each over her clothes. The defendant kissed Kathy and blocked the doorway, preventing her from leaving the bathroom, where they remained for some ten minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Later that night, after Kathy and Anne had gone to bed the defendant followed a pattern of conduct similar to that which he used during Rose\u2019s sleepover. At 2:30 a.m., Kathy woke to find him shaking her feet, asking her to be quiet and to go downstairs with him. Kathy replied, \u201cNo. No. I want to go to sleep. I\u2019m tired.\u201d She also called Anne\u2019s name \u201csort of loudly,\u201d but Anne did not wake up. The defendant pulled Kathy\u2019s arm and twisted it \u201clike he was trying to pull [it] out of [its] socket.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>defendant then \u201ccrawled on top of\u201d Kathy and put his arm around her. Over her bedclothes, the defendant touched Kathy\u2019s breast area three times and her vaginal area twice, with Kathy pushing his hand away each time. Kathy felt the defendant\u2019s penis pressing against her buttocks, and he tried to pull off her pajama bottoms. Kathy held the defendant\u2019s probing hand with one hand and covered her body with the other. The defendant remained with the girls for about thirty minutes before leaving the room, after which Kathy fell back to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The following day Kathy told her mother about the incident when they were driving away from the defendant\u2019s house; she described the other incidents to her mother in \u201cbits and pieces\u201d over the following week. Kathy and her mother reported the incidents to a guidance counsellor at her school. Anne told Rose about the accusations Kathy was making. Rose, who did not know Kathy, approached Kathy and told her that the defendant had also assaulted her during her earlier sleepover. Both girls reported the incidents to the district attorney\u2019s office, which issued two complaints of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years against the defendant. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B. One complaint charged two counts with respect to the incident with Rose, and the other charged six counts with respect to the incidents with Kathy. A judge in the District Court allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to join the complaints for trial, see Mass. R. Crim. R 9, 378 Mass. 859 (1979), and denied the defendant\u2019s motion to reconsider the joinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Following a trial in the District Court, the jury returned guilty verdicts on all eight counts. The judge sentenced the defendant to serve four years in a house of correction, with one additional year suspended for seven years conditioned on the defendant\u2019s compliance with terms of probation. She also required the defendant to register as a sex offender pursuant to G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178C-178R and imposed community parole supervision for life pursuant to G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 45, and G. L. c. 275, \u00a7 18. The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">In August, 2002, represented by new counsel, the defendant moved for a new trial asserting several errors, which we discuss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>below.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following an evidentiary hearing, the motion judge, who was also the trial judge, denied the defendant\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Appeals Court consolidated the defendant\u2019s appeal from the denial with his direct appeal and set aside the verdicts, concluding that the judge should have denied the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for joinder. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pillai, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 603 (2004). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>On direct appeal the defendant challenges the judge\u2019s joinder ruling. He also argues that she improperly precluded him from introducing evidence of the allegedly turbulent home lives of the complaining witnesses, in contravention of the defendant\u2019s rights to present a defense, to confront witnesses against him, and to due process. On his appeal from the denial of the motion for a new trial he argues ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failing to impeach the complainants, prejudice arising from variances between the bill of particulars provided by the Commonwealth and the evidence at trial, prosecutorial overreaching, prejudice arising from the judge\u2019s failure to issue a specific unanimity instruction sua sponte, and insufficiency of evidence to support a guilty verdict the second count of Rose\u2019s complaint. We discuss each claim in turn before addressing the judge\u2019s imposition of community supervised parole for life as a component of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">a. <em>Joinder. </em>The defendant argues that the underlying offenses were not \u201crelated offenses\u201d within the meaning of rule 9 (a) (1), or alternatively, that \u201cthe best interests of justice,\u201d rule 9 (a) (3), required separate trials. We conclude that the judge did not abuse her discretion by joining the complaints for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The basic principles governing joinder of offenses are well settled in our law. Among those most relevant to the facts in this case are the following. First, the decision whether to join offenses for trial is a matter left to the sound discretion of the judge, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>436 Mass. 799, 803 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>(2002), and will not be reversed unless there has been \u201ca clear abuse of discretion.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>442 Mass. 185, 199 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allison, </em>434 Mass. 670, 679 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Second, to prevail on a claim of misjoinder, the defendant \u201cbears the burden of demonstrating that the offenses were unrelated, and that prejudice from joinder was so compelling that it prevented him from obtaining a fair trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>443 Mass. 245, 260 (2005). For purposes of joinder, offenses are related \u201cif they are based on the same criminal conduct or episode or arise out of a course of criminal conduct or series of criminal episodes connected together or constituting parts of a single scheme or plan.\u201d Mass. R. Crim. P. 9 (a) (1). Factors a judge may consider in determining whether offenses are related include factual similarities, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferraro, </em>424 Mass. 87, 89-91 (1997), and closeness of time and space, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delaney, </em>425 Mass. 587, 594 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1058 (1998). Offenses are related if \u201cthe evidence in its totality shows a common scheme and pattern of operation that tends to prove\u201d each of the complaints<em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feijoo, </em>419 Mass. 486, 494-495 (1995). Where offenses are related, the judge \u201cshall join the charges for trial\u201d unless she \u201cdetermines that joinder is not in the best interests of justice.\u201d Mass. R. Crim. P. 9 (a) (3)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-17\">Finally, the propriety of joining offenses for a single trial often turns on whether evidence of the other offenses would be admissible in separate trials on each offense. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallison, </em>383 Mass. 659, 672 (1981). Of course, evidence of other criminal conduct may not be used to prove the propensity of the defendant to commit the charged offense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>see, e.g., <em>id., </em>but it may be admissible for other purposes, such as \u201cto show a common scheme or pattern of operation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaynor, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In reviewing the judge\u2019s exercise of discretion in a close case such as this, the test is not whether we would have made a different decision. Rather, we will uphold the judge\u2019s decision unless we are convinced that \u201cno conscientious judge, acting intelligently, could honestly have taken the view [she] expressed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ira </em>I., 439 Mass. 805, 809 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bys, </em>370 Mass. 350, 361 (1976). Viewing the judge\u2019s ruling under that deferential standard,I ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the facts here \u201cdemonstrate the defendant\u2019s participation in [two] criminal episodes that, despite slight factual variations, are sufficiently [related] to support the judge\u2019s decision to allow the Commonwealth\u2019s request for joinder.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, supra </em>at 200. The defendant\u2019s argument that the offenses were not related because his alleged conduct during the two offenses varied in what he asserts are substantial ways is unpersuasive. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferraro, supra </em>at 89; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, </em>407 Mass. 412, 417 (1990). Cf., e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zemtsov, </em>443 Mass. 36, 43-44 (2004) (offenses related even where they occurred on different dates and involved different victims and criminal conduct). The judge properly focused on the similarities between the two offenses in their totality, rather than the differences. We cannot say that she abused her discretion by concluding that they were related, as we shall explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The judge could have reasoned that the offenses were related because they showed a common pattern of operation. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feijoo, supra. </em>Both complainants were thirteen year old girls who were away from their homes and dependent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>on the defendant for parental protection.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant used the same method of access to the complainants and took advantage of their susceptibilities during each sleepover. In the middle of the night, at approximately the same hour, he awakened each girl when she likely was most vulnerable and least able to ward off any attack, and proceeded to touch her breasts, attempted to remove her bed clothes, and tried to persuade her to prolong the encounter. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaynor, supra </em>at 261; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It is immaterial that there were but two such episodes,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that some months passed between them. \u201cWhere, as here, there is such a similarity in the <em>method </em>by which the defendant committed the various offenses\u201d (emphasis in original), a four or five-month intervening time period does not make the offenses unrelated. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, supra </em>at 417 (concluding that offenses occurring within eight months were related).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Nor can the defendant meet his burden of proving that any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>prejudice from joinder was so compelling that it prevented him from obtaining a fair trial, because evidence of one offense likely would have been admitted at a separate trial of the other. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feijoo, supra </em>at 495. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallison, </em>383 Mass. 659, 672 (1981) (better chance for acquittal in separate trials insufficient to show prejudice from joinder). \u201cThe evidence here showed a common pattern or course of conduct toward the two children, and was sufficiently related in time and location to be logically probative.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. King, 387 Mass. 464, 472 (1982). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>418 Mass. 788, 794 (1994) (conduct toward child other than complainant admissible if \u201cclosely related in time, place, and form of acts to show a common course of conduct\u201d). Because of the similarities, the evidence of the other offense would likely be admissible not only to show a common pattern of conduct, but also \u201cto corroborate!] the victim\u2019s testimony\u201d and \u201crender!] it not improbable that the acts charged might have occurred.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>If the complaints were properly joined, the defendant argues, the judge should have given a limiting instruction sua sponte to minimize the chance that the jury would draw the forbidden inference that, if they found the defendant guilty of one offense, he must have a propensity to assault adolescent girls sexually, and therefore must be guilty of the other offense. The better practice is to give an appropriate instruction in these circumstances. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaynor, supra </em>at 263; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mamay, supra </em>at 417-418. We cannot say, however, that the absence of an unrequested instruction in this case created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice because the absence of the instruction was not \u201csufficiently significant in the context of the trial to make plausible an inference that the [jury\u2019s] result might have been otherwise\u201d had the instruction been given. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 13 (1999), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 10, 21 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-20\">b. <em>Excluded evidence. </em>The defendant next argues on direct appeal that the judge abused her discretion by precluding him from introducing evidence of the complaining witnesses\u2019 allegedly turbulent home lives. The defendant asserts that he sought to introduce evidence to establish that the accusations were motivated in part by the complainants\u2019 resentment of Anne and the defendant for the contrasting \u201ctranquility\u201d in the Pillai home. He contends that the judge\u2019s ruling deprived him of his constitutional right to confront witnesses about biases or motives to fabricate their accusations or their testimony at trial. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 Mass. 222, 229 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"APU\">The record does not establish that the judge precluded <em>all </em>evidence concerning the complainants\u2019 home lives.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Trial counsel never sought to elicit testimony from the witnesses at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>trial concerning the tranquility of Anne\u2019s home life, the relative turbulence of Rose and Kathy\u2019s home lives, or any resulting resentment Rose or Kathy held toward Anne. Accordingly, the judge had no occasion to make the broad ruling asserted by the defendant, and there is no record support for the notion that she would have disallowed any such evidence. Furthermore, as discussed below, trial counsel did not provide ineffective assistance by failing to pursue this line of defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">c. <em>Denial of motion for a new trial. </em>\u201cThe decision to allow a motion for a new trial lies within the sound discretion of the judge and will not be reversed unless it is manifestly unjust or unless the trial was infected with prejudicial constitutional error\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nieves, </em>429 Mass. 763, 770 (1999). \u201cWe afford special deference to the factual findings\u201d of a judge who ruled on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial \u201cwhere, as here, the motion judge also presided at the defendant\u2019s trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zagrodny, </em>443 Mass. 93, 103 (2004). With these standards in mind, we consider in turn each of the five claims of error raised by the defendant and rejected by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">i. <em>Ineffective assistance of trial counsel. </em>The defendant argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to impeach the complaining witnesses, specifically that counsel failed to present evidence that both complainants had reasons to fabricate their accusations.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Specifically, the defendant claims that Rose was angry with him because he had banned her from his house after she and Anne disobeyed him in the spring of 1999. The defendant also contends that trial counsel failed to establish that Anne was out of the Commonwealth during July and August of 1999,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>undercutting Rose\u2019s assertion that the offense took place on a sleepover during one of those months. The defendant contends that he, through Anne, had accused Kathy of stealing $40 during the sleepover, which gave Kathy a motive to lie.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendant also faults trial counsel for failing to present evidence that Kathy admitted that she fabricated her accusations \u201cto get [Anne] back for accusing her of stealing money.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AZi\">In addition, appellate counsel, in an affidavit filed with the motion for a new trial, avers \u201c[u]pan information and belief\u201d that trial counsel was aware prior to trial that the complainants disliked the defendant because the complainants \u201cfelt he was too strict\u201d and that they \u201cmay have been motivated to make false accusations against [him] because they both resented [Anne] in connection with soccer, shared interests in certain boyfriends, and [Anne]\u2019s stable family life.\u201d Appellate counsel averred that trial counsel informed him that it was \u201ca tactical decision\u201d not to introduce any evidence concerning the complaining witnesses\u2019 various motives to fabricate. \u201cAs to claimed errors in trial counsel\u2019s strategy, none is established unless we are persuaded that counsel\u2019s tactics were \u2018 \u201cmanifestly unreasonable\u201d when undertaken.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Sielicki, 391 Mass. 377, 379 (1984), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Levia, </em>385 Mass. 345, 353-354 (1982). . . . Only \u2018strategy and tactics which lawyers of ordinary training and skill in the criminal law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>would not consider competent\u2019 are manifestly unreasonable. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Levia, supra </em>at 353, quoting <em>Beasley </em>v. <em>United States, </em>491 F.2d 687, 696 (6th Cir. 1974). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Degro, </em>432 Mass. 319, 333 (2000) (\u2018It is far too easy to examine a transcript and point to ways to \u201cdo it better\u201d \u2019); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinton, </em>432 Mass. 180, 186 (2000).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zagrodny, supra </em>at 98.</p>\n<p id=\"A8l\">Here, the judge found that \u201c[bjoth victims presented as likeable young teenage girls. [Kathy] was poised and self-confident; [Rose] was more reserved and somewhat embarrassed. ... It is entirely possible that trial counsel demurred from calling school friends of the victims and the defendant\u2019s daughter because rather than impeaching the credibility of the victims, such testimony could trigger sympathy for the victims on the part of the jury.\u201d In the circumstances, it was not manifestly unreasonable for trial counsel to conclude that the jury would react unfavorably to any suggestion that the \u201clikeable\u201d teenage girls fabricated their very serious allegations against their friend\u2019s father for seemingly petty reasons.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AgY\">We afford strong deference to, and agree with, the judge\u2019s conclusion that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to establish that the incident involving Rose could not have occurred in July or August, as Rose testified. The judge\u2019s conclusion was compelled by her specific finding that the evidence suggesting that Anne was out of State at the time, see note 13, <em>supra, </em>\u201cwas never provided to\u201d trial counsel. Moreover, Anne and her mother both unhesitatingly testified at trial that Rose had slept over in August.</p>\n<p id=\"A-Ff\">ii. <em>Bill of particulars. </em>The defendant contends that he was prejudiced by the discrepancy between the Commonwealth\u2019s response to his motion for a bill of particulars,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> which alleged that the defendant had assaulted Rose \u201c[o]n the night of August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>18, 1999,\u201d and the Commonwealth\u2019s case at trial, during which Rose testified that she was assaulted \u201csometime in July or August,\u201d but could not remember the specific date.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The function of a bill of particulars \u201cis to give a defendant reasonable knowledge of the nature and character of the crime charged.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>429 Mass. 60, 69 (1999), quoting <em>Rogan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>415 Mass. 376, 378 (1993). A request for a bill of particulars does not entitle a defendant \u201cto secure a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the [Commonwealth\u2019s] evidence,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>404 Mass. 221, 233 (1989), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>311 Mass. 21, 25 (1942), or to require specific evidence as to facts that do not relate to an element of the crime charged. See <em>Rogan </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 379. Accordingly, the standard for showing prejudice from a variance between the bill of particulars and trial testimony is high. Even when the bill of particulars and the evidence at trial contrast as to an element or theory of the crime charged, relief is warranted only on a showing that the bill of particulars failed to provide the defendant with \u201cnotice to prepare his defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, supra </em>at 234. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 157, cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1137 (1982) (no prejudice by variance between theory of murder in the first degree in bill of particulars and in Commonwealth\u2019s case at trial because defendant had effective notice by autopsy report of extreme atrocity or cruelty theory).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Here, any variance between the bill of particulars and the Commonwealth\u2019s case related entirely to a collateral matter. As the judge properly ruled, the date on which the assault on Rose occurred was not material either as an element of the crime or as a component of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>has not cited any case in which a discrepancy on such a matter, between the bill of particulars and the evidence at trial, has resulted in relief. The facts here do not demonstrate that this case should be an exception, or that the defendant suffered meaningfully as a result of the discrepancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">The defendant contends that he was prepared to impeach Rose, had she testified to the August 18-19 date, with evidence that the defendant\u2019s wife was not working her normal night shift on those dates, contradicting Rose\u2019s testimony that the wife was at work on the night of the assault. This contention fails to establish the defendant was prejudiced, as the impeachment value of the inconsistency would have been slight and could have been ameliorated on redirect examination.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Nor are we convinced that the defendant was prejudiced by his inability, on account of the lack of a less specific bill of particulars, to prepare a defense that would have sought to prove that Anne had been out of the Commonwealth for all of July and August, as discussed above. Any such defense would have been equally material, of course, to refuting a claim by Rose that she had been assaulted on August 18-19. And we note again that such a defense would have undermined the credibility of Anne and her mother, who testified that Rose slept over in July and August.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-25\">iii. <em>Prosecutorial overreaching. </em>The defendant contends that inappropriate conduct by the prosecutor at trial prejudiced the jury against him. Although we do not condone certain of the prosecutor\u2019s actions, they were not so prejudicial, alone or in combination, as to have deprived the defendant of a fair trial. We discuss the challenged actions in the order they occurred at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-32\">The defendant first argues that the prosecutor injected his personal convictions and impermissibly vouched for the credibility of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses during his opening argument when he said, \u201cI\u2019m telling you right now that I will prove that to you beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The statement, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>which the defendant did not object, was no more than the prosecutor\u2019s contention that the Commonwealth expected to meet the requisite standard of proof, and could not have created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The defendant next contends that the prosecutor prejudiced the jury by calling Kathy as a rebuttal witness to impeach Anne\u2019s credibility. Anne had testified that she loved her father, and that Kathy never told her during the sleepover that she was uncomfortable with the defendant. Kathy testified in rebuttal that during the sleepover, Anne told her that \u201cshe hated her father, and because of him, her friends don\u2019t want to come over any more.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The judge summoned counsel to sidebar, explained that she was \u201cnot going to allow [the Commonwealth] to impeach the credibility of a 15-year-old that makes a statement that she loves her father,\u201d and instructed the jury that Kathy\u2019s rebuttal testimony was \u201cstruck for all purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The defendant moved for a mistrial, which the judge denied. Although the testimony was prejudicial in that it suggested prior bad acts by the defendant toward Anne\u2019s friends, the judge issued an immediate, forceful curative instruction that excluded the testimony from the jury\u2019s consideration. We presume that the jury followed the judge\u2019s instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Last, the defendant asserts that the prosecutor made three prejudicial remarks in his closing argument; the defendant did not object to two of the three. After reviewing the remarks, particularly the context in which they were made, we agree with the judge that her instructions adequately addressed any prejudice that may have arisen.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 516-519 (1987). See also, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>Grandison, </em>433 Mass. 135, 143 (2001) (passing comment unlikely to have made difference to jury); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pontes, </em>402 Mass. 311, 316 (1988) (allegedly improper remarks reviewed in context of entire argument, evidence at trial, and any instructions from judge).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">iv. <em>Unanimity instructions. </em>The defendant next argues in his motion for a new trial that the judge committed reversible error by failing to instruct the jury sua sponte on specific unanimity regarding the alleged touchings of each complainant. More specifically, he contends that she should have instructed the jury that they had to agree unanimously as to which eight individual touchings corresponded to each of the eight counts in the complaints. The defendant asserts that this omission created a substantial risk that different jurors voted to convict him based on different discrete acts for each specific count. This risk is magnified in Kathy\u2019s complaint, which charged six counts even though she testified that the defendant touched her inappropriately \u201cmore than twenty\u201d times. Because, as we discuss below, the evidence was sufficient to support a guilty verdict on only a single count of Rose\u2019s complaint, we focus on Kathy\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Although Kathy testified that the defendant touched her inappropriately more than twenty times, her testimony detailed just ten different touchings. Kathy\u2019s testimony, which the jury\u2019s verdict indicates they believed, would have supported a guilty verdict beyond a reasonable doubt as to each of the touchings she detailed.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The judge clearly instructed the jury that they were obligated to consider separately and render a unanimous verdict on each separate count.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The failure of the judge to give the instruction the defendant now seeks did not give rise to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice in the circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comtois, </em>399 Mass. 668, 675-677 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Black, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 477, 478 (2000) (no substantial risk of miscarriage of justice where acts occur within close proximity as part of same criminal episode and defendant did not request specific unanimity instruction).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">v. <em>Sufficiency of evidence. </em>Although the defendant did not move for a required verdict on this basis at trial, he contends in his motion for a new trial that the evidence supported only one count of indecent assault and battery on Rose. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">As discussed above, the judge properly instructed the jury that the two counts charging indecent assault and battery on-Rose constituted separate crimes, each requiring a separate and unanimous finding that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, in determining whether there was evidence sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s convictions, we consider \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979), quoting <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-319 (1979). In evaluating the evidence at trial, we may consider the inferences a jury permissibly could have made from trial testimony. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, supra. </em>But here, given Rose\u2019s testimony and permissible inferences therefrom, no rational jury could have found two separate crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Rose testified<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> that she woke to find the defendant touching her breasts and squeezing her nipple \u2014 evidence sufficient to support one count of indecent assault and battery. The Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>monwealth does not claim that the defendant\u2019s subsequent attempts to lift Rose\u2019s shirt supported a second conviction of indecent assault and battery. Nor does the Commonwealth claim that there was evidence at trial sufficient to support a conviction on another ground outlined in the bill of particulars, see <em>supra, </em>that alleged the defendant also had touched Rose\u2019s thigh on the night of the assault. The Commonwealth\u2019s claim, rather, is that Rose\u2019s testimony describing a simultaneous touching of her breast and nipple supports two convictions. With no evidence that the touching of the breast and nipple were in any way separate events, we cannot conclude that the evidence supported a conviction of two separate crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>401 Mass. 109, 120 (1987), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>St. Pierre, </em>377 Mass. 650, 662-663 (1979) (two acts may be \u201cso closely related in fact as to constitute in substance but a single crime\u201d). We therefore reverse as duplicative the conviction on the second count of Rose\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">d. <em>Sentence. </em>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pagan, ante </em>161, 172-173 (2005), we held unconstitutional those portions of G. L. c. 275, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u00a7 18, that permit a judge to impose a term of community parole supervision for life on a first-time sexual offender convicted of certain crimes, including indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s sentence, which includes community parole supervision for life, cannot stand. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Renderos, </em>440 Mass. 422, 435 (2003) (vacating entire sentence and remanding for resentencing where sentence improperly included lifetime community parole).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> As discussed above, we also reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction on one count of Rose\u2019s complaint. We affirm the remaining convictions and the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, vacate the sentence, and remand the case to the District Court for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-24\">We acknowledge the amicus brief filed by the Committee for Public Counsel Services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b194-26\">As is our custom, we use pseudonyms as assigned by the Appeals Court for the minors involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b197-8\">The delay in filing the motion for a new trial was attributable in part to problems with the tape recordings of the proceedings, which delayed preparation of the trial transcript and assembly of the consolidated record for appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b197-9\">The judge also denied the defendant\u2019s motion to stay execution of his sentence pending appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b198-23\">Although, in reviewing whether the offenses were properly joined, we have the advantage of the record of the trial and how the evidence was presented to the jury, the motion judge necessarily made her decision based primarily on facts alleged in the Commonwealth\u2019s memorandum supporting its motion to join the offenses for trial. Nevertheless, we review claims of misjoinder using the deferential abuse of discretion standard for the reason explicated by Justice Kaplan in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Jacobs, 52 Mass. App. Ct. 38, 41 (2001): the imprecise language of Mass. R. Crim. P. 9, 378 Mass. 859 (1979), gives a judge \u201cresidual discretion\u201d in its interpretation and application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b199-9\">The Appeals Court did not address the standard of review on appeal on a challenge to a joinder ruling. It also did not have the benefit of three recent decisions in cases in which we rejected claims of misjoinder of offenses. We decided two cases after the Appeals Court decision in this case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>443 Mass. 245, 259-263 (2005); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zemtsov, </em>443 Mass. 36, 42-45 (2004). We decided a third case, to which the Appeals Court decision contains no citation, shortly before the Appeals Court decision. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>442 Mass. 185, 199-201 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The defendant argues that the incidents \u201cbore no trace of the kind of planning, scheming, or design,\u201d that he argues \u201chave featured prominently\u201d in our decisions affirming joinder. Rather, he continues, the sexual assaults here \u201cwere the result of impulsive acts.\u201d Although a review of our decisions provides some basis for the distinction, rule 9 does not condition joinder on the presence of situations deliberately structured by the defendant. Adults exercise enormous power over a child, especially where, as here, the adult is in a supervisory position (parent in locus). In such instances, any distinction between abuse resulting from situations that are \u201cplotted or set up\u201d and from \u201cimpulsive acts\u201d is a distinction without a difference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b200-12\">The judge necessarily based her allowance of the motion to join on the Commonwealth\u2019s assertions of the relatedness of the offenses. See note 5, <em>supra. </em>The Commonwealth\u2019s supporting memorandum asserted another similarity \u2014 that the defendant tried to climb on top of each complainant after awakening her. The assertion, however, was not supported by the evidence at</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b200-17\">Rule 9 (a) (2) expressly permits joinder of \u201ctwo or more related offenses.\u201d The Commonwealth should not be denied joinder simply because it charged the defendant before he could carry out a third offense using the same pattern of conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b200-21\">Although rule 9 is modeled after Fed. R. Crim. P. 8, see Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Crim. P. 9, Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Criminal Procedure 34-35 (LexisNexis 2005), the two rules are not coextensive. One distinction particularly relevant to this case is that the Federal rule permits joinder of offenses if they \u201care of the same or similar character.\u201d Fed. R. Crim. P. 8 (a). In contrast, our rule 9 does not permit joinder of offenses solely because they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>of the same or similar character, and nothing in this opinion should be construed to the contrary. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>436 Mass. 799, 805 n.5 (2002) (\u201cmere similarity is not sufficient by itself to show relatedness\u201d but \u201cis a factor that may be considered\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferraro, </em>424 Mass. 87, 89-90 (1997) (similarities that may establish pattern of conduct or modus operand! make offenses related). Unlike the Appeals Court, our focus is not on the similarity of the <em>form </em>of sexual abuse inflicted by the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pillai, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 603, 608 (2004) (acts comprising sexual abuse of which defendant stands convicted are \u201ccommon to most indecent assault and battery cases\u201d). Rather, it was the defendant\u2019s common method of operation \u2014 attacking his victims in a similar place and in similar circumstances where they were most vulnerable \u2014 on which the trial judge appropriately focused. She reasonably could have concluded that the offenses here were related because the similarities suggested that they \u201carose \u2018out of a course of criminal conduct or series of criminal episodes connected together.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>388 Mass. 749, 755 (1983), quoting Mass. R. Crirn. P. 9 (a) (1). As the judge noted in a memorandum of decision, \u201c[t]he occasion of a young teenage girl\u2019s sleep-over was arguably the vehicle for the defendant to commit the alleged crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b201-6\">As each separate trial progressed, the judge may have had additional, non-propensity bases for admitting evidence of the other offense. For example, in the trial on Rose\u2019s complaint, if the defense were to suggest that her delay in disclosure implied that she fabricated the accusation, evidence of the offense involving Kathy would be admissible to explain the timing and manner of Rose\u2019s disclosures, including Rose\u2019s state of mind when she disclosed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>abuse to Kathy. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>423 Mass. 180, 187-188 (1996); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Errington, </em>390 Mass. 875, 880-882 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b202-35\">The judge stated in her ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial that, \u201cafter extensive argument by trial counsel in pretrial motion hearing and at sidebar conferences prior to the commencement of trial, [she] ruled that evidence of the respective homelives of the victims was not relevant in this trial.\u201d Appellate counsel reads this statement too broadly. The statement ends a paragraph in which the judge discusses trial counsel\u2019s attempts to obtain, through discovery motions, \u201ccounseling records, records from the Department of Social Services or school records of both victims to determine, among <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>other things, whether the events of their respective domestic lives gave either a motive for bias against [Anne] due to jealousy over [Anne\u2019s] more tranquil homelife.\u201d She noted that \u201csome documents were in fact provided to the defendant but were ultimately ruled irrelevant to this case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b203-9\">The information, which accompanied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, included affidavits from friends and neighbors of the defendant attesting that they did not see Anne in the State during July or August, or that they saw her out of State at certain times, credit card receipts suggesting that the defendant\u2019s credit card had been used to make Amtrak purchases on several dates during the summer, and a copy of a foreign language newspaper contain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>ing photographs allegedly depicting Anne and her mother at an out-of-State cultural festival in late August. Also included were affidavits from Anne and her mother that contradicted the testimony they gave at trial, where they stated that Rose had, in fact, slept over in August.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b204-24\">Kathy testified that the defendant handed her \u201csome money and told [her] to count it\u201d in the computer room, and that he \u201csecretly\u201d passed her a $20 bill when they were parked at the restaurant. However, both Kathy and her mother testified that Kathy made accusations against the defendant as they drove away from the defendant\u2019s house later that morning, before Anne allegedly communicated the defendant\u2019s accusation to Kathy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b204-30\">The defendant filed the affidavit of one of Anne\u2019s friends, attesting to the admission, with his motion for a new trial. The affiant did not appear at the evidentiary hearing in part because her mother did not want her to do so, and appellate counsel did not consult with the affiant\u2019s parents before obtaining the affidavit. The judge found that the affidavit \u201cstrains credulity suggesting as it does that while [the affiant and Kathy] were not good friends, on a chance phone call several months after the incident on December 23, 1999, [Kathy] confided that she was fabricating these serious charges.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"AzI\">Trial counsel did not abandon entirely the defense of fabrication. Trial counsel sought to create reasonable doubt as to whether the incidents occurred by establishing that the complaining witnesses neither put an immediate end to the sleepovers nor immediately telephoned their parents once the alleged abuse started, did not immediately report the abuse to the defendant\u2019s wife, and delayed disclosing the full details of the abuse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"AiJ\">The judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion with respect to the date, time, and place that each of the offenses in Rose\u2019s complaint were alleged to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>occurred, but denied the motion with respect to \u201c[t]he exact acts of indecent assault and battery which the Commonwealth allege[s] as the basis for each charge.\u201d Nevertheless, the Commonwealth\u2019s response set forth details of the charges with respect to both Rose and Kathy, including the description of specific acts of indecent assault and battery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b206-8\">The defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty on Rose\u2019s complaint at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and at the end of rebuttal testimony, asserting that the Commonwealth failed to prove the offense took place on the date specified in the complaint and the bill of particulars. The judge denied the motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b207-37\">The prosecutor could have elicited testimony from Rose that she remembered the specifics of the assault but perhaps not the exact date on which it occurred.
