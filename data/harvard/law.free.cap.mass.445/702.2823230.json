L. c. 272, \u00a7 6; and keeping a house of ill fame, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 24. The Appeals Court reversed the defendant\u2019s convictions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mullane, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 317 (2005). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review. The defendant raised eight issues on appeal, including improper denial of his motions to suppress, various errors at trial, ineffective assistance of counsel, and improper denial of his motions for required findings of not guilty. Because we find no ground to reverse, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-12\"><em>Facts. </em>We recite the facts, reserving certain details for our discussion of the issues. In 1973 and 1982, the defendant purchased two adjacent buildings at 238 Broadway and 163 Harvard Street in Cambridge (238 Broadway) that were later connected by internal bridges at the top three levels. Several of the defendant\u2019s businesses were located at 238 Broadway, including the Oasis Group, consisting of chiropractic care and massage therapy; the Broadway Institute of Massage Therapy (school); and, at one point, the Broadway Health Club.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-13\">The first investigation of 238 Broadway was in January of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>1998, when the Cambridge police department\u2019s vice-narcotics unit investigated the Broadway Health Club for prostitution. The Broadway Health Club was shut down immediately after the January, 1998, investigation and execution of a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">On February 9, 1999, the defendant transferred ownership of the school to his son, Patrick, and his daughter, Katherine. The defendant, as owner of 238 Broadway, then executed a written lease with Katherine permitting her use of the premises for the school. The only registered business at 238 Broadway was the school; however, Oasis Group also was being operated out of the same location, separated from the school by a door. Some students attending the school also worked in the Oasis Group.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">In August of 1999, the Cambridge police department commenced another investigation of prostitution at 238 Broadway. On August 27, 1999, based on their observations and an informant\u2019s tip, the police obtained and executed a search warrant for the school and the Oasis Group.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Detective Thomas Ahem, who participated in the August, 1999, raid, testified that he entered 238 Broadway shortly after noon. He carried a pager that was to sound about fifteen to twenty minutes after he entered the building to alert him that a team of approximately fifteen police officers was commencing the execution of the warrant. The detective approached the front desk, asked for a half-hour massage, paid, and was then immediately led by a woman named \u201cAdrianne,\u201d who was later identified as Lisa Ulwick, to a room containing a massage table.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">Once the detective had disrobed and lay face down on the massage table, he and Adrianne engaged in casual conversation. Adrianne asked the detective if he had ever had a massage. The detective said that he had. Adrianne then asked the detective if he was a police officer, to which he replied no. The detective then asked what he \u201ccould get.\u201d Adrianne stated that he could get \u201canything\u201d he wanted. After some discussion about price, Ahem then told Adrianne that he had seventy dollars, to which Adrianne said \u201cthat would be fine,\u201d and told him he could roll over on his back any time he wanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">The detective became apprehensive at this point, because only about five minutes had passed since he had entered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>building. He rolled over, and Adrianne, then completely nude, began manually to stimulate Ahern\u2019s genitals. He said he needed to use the bathroom, where he stalled for time. Later, when he returned to the massage room, Adrianne asked him if he wanted her to finish. At that point, the beeper sounded, and the officer leading the team executing the warrant knocked on the exterior door of the building and announced the police team\u2019s entry into the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Based on their statements and the evidence seized in the raid, Katherine and Patrick Mullane were sentenced to probation for keeping a house of ill fame. They denied that their father had any involvement in the businesses. However, on June 29, 2000, a grand jury returned indictments charging the defendant, inter alla, with the crimes of which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Motions to suppress. </em>In two separate motions, the defendant moved to suppress the evidence seized at the time of the execution of the search warrant, first, on the ground that the warrant was not issued on sufficient probable cause; and second, on the ground that the warrant was improperly executed. The defendant argues that the denial of his motions was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">a. <em>Probable cause. A </em>valid search warrant must be based on a finding of probable cause. G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 1. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 368 (1985). In this case, a judge issued the search warrant based on the affidavit of Detective Louis F. Cherubino, Jr., of the Cambridge police department. The affidavit included details from the sworn notarized statement of Linda Mullins, a former student-employee at the school and the Oasis Group, to the Department of Education; and various facts gleaned from the detective\u2019s interview with Mullins. The defendant does not challenge the basis of knowledge prong of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test; however, he argues that the veracity prong was not satisfied by the affidavit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>U.S. 108 (1964). <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410 (1969). We disagree. \u201cAlthough police knowledge of the informant\u2019s \u2018identity\u2019 and \u2018whereabouts\u2019 would not be adequate standing alone to confirm the informant\u2019s reliability, it is a factor that weighs in favor of reliability.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alfonso </em>A., 438 Mass. 372, 376 (2003). Based on the level of detail given both in Mullins\u2019s sworn statement and at the subsequent meeting between her and Detectives Cherubino and Michael Maffei, we conclude that the informant was rehable, and therefore, her statements were sufficient to establish probable cause. See <em>id. </em>at 375 n.3 (where probable cause grounded in statements of named informant, strict requirements that govern analysis of anonymous informant\u2019s trustworthiness somewhat relaxed).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Mullins described at length and in detail the illicit sexual activity occurring at the massage school, which we need not recount here. Suffice it to say that Muhins claimed that she was expected to give various sexual favors to customers, including the \u201chand release,\u201d the manual manipulation of a man\u2019s penis to ejaculation, which was the technique Lisa Ulwick performed on Detective Ahem. Mullins also stated that it was common knowledge and openly discussed among the staff that the school was set up to provide a front for the illicit sexual activity occurring at the Oasis Group. The therapists from the Oasis Group, several of whom Mullins was able to describe in great detail, carried condoms on their person and discussed in front of each member of the Mullane family the sexual acts they performed and the lucrative payments they received for those acts. The defendant advised employees to be vigilant of whether the customer was an undercover police officer, in which case, the therapist was to give a \u201cstraight massage.\u201d As to her personal involvement in the enterprise, she stated that in a two-month period she had only received about fifteen minutes of actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>instruction at the school; she had been called out of class on multiple occasions to service clients at the Oasis Group.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Finally, Mullins gave specific information regarding the internal operation of the premises. She noted that the defendant, who she described as a white male in his early sixties with gray hair, was usually present from 10 a.m. until noon or 1 p.m., and that he had an office adjacent to the front desk in the Oasis Group, where the therapists\u2019 schedules were kept. She also described the videotape surveillance system and the women\u2019s locker room. Based on this evidence, there was probable cause to issue the search warrant. The defendant\u2019s motion to suppress on this ground was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">b. <em>Improper execution of the warrant. </em>The defendant also argues that the execution of the warrant violated the \u201cknock and announce\u201d requirement, the requirement to show the warrant, and the requirement that the place to be searched must be described with particularity. These arguments have no merit. We take the following facts from the motion judge\u2019s findings of fact, which are fully supported in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The police officers knocked and announced their presence on entering the lobby of the building. The officers approached the glass sliding window separating the lobby from the office area where Katherine and Patrick Mullane were sitting. The officers displayed the warrant through the window. Katherine and Patrick Mullane were unresponsive to Detective Cherubino\u2019s showing the warrant, and in fact, they appeared to be stalling. The officers, fearing the destruction of evidence, were forced to use a battering ram to enter an internal door in the building that led to the area where the massages were taking place. Based on these facts, the officers\u2019 actions were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">The warrant also was sufficient. Addendum B to the search warrant described with particularity the target of the search by street address, building number, location, and a physical description of the premises.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was no ambiguity or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>misdescription.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, the police were familiar with the premises, having obtained and executed the January, 1998, search warrant of the same premises and having conducted surveillance earlier in the week. There was no risk that the officers would search the wrong location or that they would be unable to locate the premises to be searched. This is all the law requires. See G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 2; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Treadwell, </em>402 Mass. 355, 359 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rugaber, 369 </em>Mass. 765, 768 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">2. <em>Prior bad acts. </em>The defendant disputes the judge\u2019s admission, over his objection, of evidence regarding the 1998 investigation of 238 Broadway. The judge\u2019s decision to admit such evidence will not be disturbed absent a showing of palpable error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gollman, </em>436 Mass. 111, 115 (2002). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">\u201cIt is well settled that the prosecution may not introduce evidence that a defendant previously has misbehaved, indictably or not, for the purposes of showing his bad character or propensity to commit the crime charged, but such evidence may be admissible if relevant for some other purpose.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 224 (1986), and cases cited. \u201cSuch evidence can be highly prejudicial to the defendant, and therefore must be excluded unless it comes within one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>the permitted uses, such as to show a common scheme, pattern of operation, absence of accident or mistake, identity, intent, or motive.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schoening, </em>379 Mass. 234, 242 (1979). \u201cThe judge, within sound discretion, must consider whether the probative value of such evidence is outweighed by potential prejudice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gollman, supra </em>at 114, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>428 Mass. 782, 786 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Prior to the testimony regarding the 1999 raid, the Commonwealth moved to include the evidence of the January, 1998, incident. The judge granted the motion and the evidence was heard over the defendant\u2019s continuous objection. Both prior to the testimony concerning the 1998 investigation and at the close of the evidence, the judge issued a limiting instruction to the jury stating that the evidence could only be relevant to the defendant\u2019s state of mind, his knowledge of the alleged prostitution at 238 Broadway, or his pattern or method of operation of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The following reflects the testimony of Sergeant David Ritchie of the Malden police department drug unit, an undercover officer who participated in the 1998 investigation. The officer entered the Broadway Health Club, paid fifty dollars, and was led to a small room by a woman named Colleen. Colleen instructed the officer to go into the room and remove his clothes. She said she would be back in a few minutes. When Colleen returned, she and Sergeant Ritchie engaged in casual conversation; she asked the officer whether he had ever had a massage before. He replied that he had received a massage at the Danish Health Club in Kittery, Maine, a club that was apparently widely known as a prostitution front. Colleen then asked, \u201cHow much do they charge up there for extras?\u201d The officer understood \u201cextras\u201d to mean sexual favors, and in response, he made up a large sum of money. Colleen replied that that was \u201crather expensive.\u201d Colleen then instructed Ritchie to turn over. As he turned on his back, Colleen asked, \u201cHow would you like to end your massage?\u201d The two then discussed the price list for sexual favors, which included a \u201chand job,\u201d manual manipulation of the penis to ejaculation, and \u201coral sex.\u201d When Ritchie replied that he did not have enough money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>with him, Colleen ended the massage saying, \u201cYou know, we work off of tips here, and you\u2019ve had a massage before. You know what we\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">This evidence was properly admitted. The defendant was the owner of 238 Broadway during the time of the 1998 investigation. Once the Broadway Health Club was shut down, another company owned by the defendant, the Oasis Group, took over the same area. Despite the fact that the defendant was no longer the named owner of the businesses at 238 Broadway at the time of the 1999 investigation, the evidence of the strikingly similar methods of operation of 238 Broadway throughout the course of both investigations was highly probative of the defendant\u2019s knowledge that illicit sexual activity was occurring at 238 Broadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">In both incidents, virtually identical terminology and negotiation styles were used. The defendant may not claim that the incidents resulted from the isolated actions of two renegade employees. The pattern of operation, whereby sexual favors were negotiated for a fee, was simply too well organized and similar to be coincidental. Indeed, the prosecution introduced in evidence a memorandum seized in the 1999 raid advising therapists to contact the defendant directly if any massage session ended early. As the Commonwealth argued and the jury could infer, the defendant learned from the 1998 investigation that massages usually ended early when undercover police officers posed as clients. For these reasons, the limiting instruction was proper and the evidence was properly admitted as to the defendant\u2019s state of mind, his knowledge of the alleged prostitution at 238 Broadway, or his pattern or method of operation of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">3. <em>Extrajudicial statements. </em>During Detective Ahern\u2019s interaction with Lisa Ulwick, they negotiated a fee for \u201cextras\u201d and referred to the \u201cOlde English Health Club,\u201d an establishment the Cambridge police had previously investigated. The defendant argues that the contents of the conversation were improperly admitted. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">As to the first statement regarding the negotiations, the judge allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion in limine to admit the contents of Ulwick\u2019s conversation with Detective Ahem. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>was no error. The portion of the conversation regarding the negotiation was admissible under an established principle that such statements are nonhearsay. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>7 Gray 328, 330 (1856) (proper to admit substance of conversations with prostitutes at alleged house of ill fame because substance of conversation \u201cdirect and pertinent evidence of the character of the house\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">With respect to the reference to the \u201cOlde English Club,\u201d we conclude that the statement was not offered for the truth of the matter, but rather for the limited purpose of giving context to Detective Ahern\u2019s conversation with Lisa Ulwick. The jury were so instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">4. <em>Motion for a mistrial. </em>The defendant argues that the trial judge erred by refusing to grant his motion for a mistrial after one of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, the detective who led the officers executing the warrant, offered unsolicited testimony that the defendant contends was intentionally elicited and prejudicial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree. The decision whether to declare a mistrial is within the discretion of the trial judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kilburn, </em>426 Mass. 31, 37 (1997). \u201cWhere a party seeks a mistrial in response to the jury\u2019s exposure to inadmissible evidence, the judge may \u2018correctly rel[y] on curative instructions as an adequate means to correct any error and to remedy any prejudice to the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37-38, quot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>ing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>404 Mass. 221, 232 (1989). In this case, the judge\u2019s curative instruction immediately after the defendant\u2019s objection and sidebar conference was sufficient to remedy any prejudice against the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garrey, </em>436 Mass. 422, 435 (2002). The motion for a mistrial was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">5. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant claims that his counsel was ineffective in his representation of the defendant in (1) using terms prejudicial to the defendant throughout the trial; (2) not calling Lisa Ulwick as a witness; (3) negatively commenting on defense witnesses and crediting the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses; and (4) conceding prostitution in his closing argument. In reviewing the defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance, we must examine whether there has been \u201cserious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer \u2014 and, if that is found, then typically, whether it has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">As the Appeals Court noted and we agree, at trial there was no real dispute as to the illicit sexual activity occurring at the premises. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mullane, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 317, 318 (2005). The defendant\u2019s principal defense was that he was not in control of the premises at 238 Broadway, but that his children, Katherine and Patrick, ran the businesses. The record shows that defense counsel\u2019s occasional negative references to two of the defense witnesses, Katherine and Patrick; positive reference to Sergeant Ritchie, the officer involved in the 1998 investigation of 238 Broadway; and general references to the illicit activity occurring at 238 Broadway were done strategically. After some of these references, defense counsel attempted to distance the defendant from the illegal activity, asking, \u201cWhere was David Mullane?\u201d We conclude that counsel\u2019s decision to use this tactic was not manifestly unreasonable, and therefore, it fails to give rise to ineffective assistance of counsel. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sena, </em>441 Mass. 822, 825-826 (2004) (court gives deference to counsel\u2019s tactical decisions unless \u201cmanifestly unreasonable when made\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>Concerning defense counsel\u2019s failure to call Lisa Ulwick as a witness, the defendant argues that she was the \u201chighest trump\u201d card that should have been \u201cplayed\u201d by counsel because her alleged testimony would have contradicted the Commonwealth\u2019s position that prostitution was occurring at 238 Broadway. Ulwick was a prostitute who solicited a police officer for illicit sexual activity for a fee. Her behavior was the subject of the charges facing the defendant. The defendant has failed to show that Ulwick would not invoke her privilege under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution not to testify. Nor has the defendant shown that Ulwick\u2019s testimony would have proved helpful to him, beyond his speculative assertion. Accordingly, his argument fails. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortega, </em>441 Mass. 170,178 (2004) (ineffective assistance not established by showing that counsel could have called additional witnesses; defendant must show that witnesses\u2019 testimony would have been relevant or helpful).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Finally, our reading of the transcript reveals that defense counsel\u2019s reference to \u201csex for a fee\u201d in his closing argument was in order to admonish the Cambridge detective for going too far by receiving a \u201chand release\u201d from Lisa Ulwick. Indeed, the comment was a part of the defense\u2019s over-all strategy to distance the defendant from the criminal activity occurring at 238 Broadway, while also highlighting the police department\u2019s excesses during the investigation. Ultimately, defense counsel ended this recounting of the \u201chand release\u201d received by Detective Ahern with, \u201cWhere was David Mullane?\u201d We do not question counsel\u2019s strategy during his closing argument, and conclude that his representation of the defendant was not defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">6. <em>Motions for required findings of not guilty. </em>The defendant moved unsuccessfully for a required finding of not guilty at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, at the close of all of the evidence, and after the jury returned verdicts on two indictments. He argues that the Commonwealth failed to prove the elements of the two offenses with which he was charged; that the Commonwealth\u2019s case was weakened by the defendant\u2019s case; and that, therefore, the judge should have granted the defendant\u2019s motions for required findings of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>The \u201c \u2018question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 (emphasis in original). <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-319 (1979) .... Thus, to sustain the denial of a directed verdict, it is not enough for the appellate court to find that there was some record evidence, however slight, to support each essential element of the offense; it must find that there was enough evidence that could have satisfied a rational trier of fact of each such element beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The defendant was convicted of owning, or assisting in the management or control of, a place for unlawful sexual intercourse and keeping a house of ill fame. We address each conviction, in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">a. <em>G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 6. </em>Conviction of owning, or assisting in the management or control of, a place for unlawful sexual intercourse requires the Commonwealth to show (1) that the defendant owned, managed, or assisted in the management or control of certain premises; (2) that a person was present on those premises for the purpose of unlawfully having sexual intercourse; (3) that the defendant induced or knowingly suffered the person\u2019s presence on the premises for that purpose; and (4) that the purpose of sexual intercourse was for financial gain. See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 6. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bucaulis, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 59, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Bucuvalas </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>439 U.S. 827 (1978). The defendant argues that the Commonwealth proffered no evidence of sexual intercourse and that the Commonwealth failed to prove that the defendant \u201cknowingly\u201d suffered Lisa Ulwick\u2019s presence on the premises for the purpose of sexual intercourse. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The statute does not require the Commonwealth to show that sexual intercourse took place on the premises.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Commonwealth need only show that the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the person\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>presence on the premises was unlawfully to have sexual intercourse. In this case, the Commonwealth, through Detective Ahern\u2019s testimony, demonstrated that Lisa Ulwick was willing to give the detective \u201canything\u201d he wanted with respect to paid \u201cextras.\u201d Based on the amount of money the detective had in his possession \u2014 seventy dollars \u2014 he was entitled to a \u201chand release,\u201d which Ulwick then began to provide while completely nude. The Commonwealth sufficiently proved that the \u201cpurpose\u201d of Ulwick\u2019s presence was to provide customers \u201canything\u201d they wanted, including, presumably, sexual intercourse, as long as the customers had enough money. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bucaulis, supra </em>at 63 (\u201copen for the jury to determine as a matter of fact that [female entertainer] was available for sexual intercourse with customers who desired such service\u201d where only fellatio actually was performed).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">As to the defendant \u201cknowingly\u201d suffering Ulwick on the premises for the purpose of sexual intercourse, the Commonwealth provided ample evidence on this element. Among other things, the Commonwealth showed that the defendant initially established the school; he paid the utility bills; he contacted advertisers; in 1999, his voice was on the outgoing marketing messages to potential clients; there was a similar incident involving \u201cextras\u201d and a massage therapist in 1998; in 1999, an administrative memorandum was seized stating that the defendant was to be notified if any massage session ended early; the same memorandum warned therapists not to discuss \u201canything except massage technique when speaking of a massage session\u201d; and perhaps most damning, the defendant hired and fired massage therapists for the Oasis Group. A rational trier of fact could infer that the defendant knew precisely the illicit sexual activity occurring at 238 Broadway. As to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 6, the judge did not err by denying the defendant\u2019s motions for required findings of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">b. <em>G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 24. </em>Conviction for keeping a house of ill fame requires the Commonwealth to show (1) that the defendant owned, managed, or maintained the premises; and (2) that the premises were resorted to for sexual activity for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>hire. See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 24.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For the reasons discussed <em>supra, </em>the Commonwealth provided sufficient evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s knowledge and control of the illicit sexual activity occurring on the premises.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">7. <em>Jury instructions, </em>a. <em>Joint venture. </em>Prior to discussing the charges in the indictment, the judge provided a general instruction to the jury regarding the elements of joint venture. The joint venture instruction was meant to apply to each of the charges before the jury. The judge essentially instructed the jury that a defendant may be convicted as a joint participant in a crime if he aids in the commission of the crime, or is an accessory before the fact by counselling, hiring, or otherwise procuring the crime to be committed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>424 Mass. 853, 856 (1997), quoting G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 2. Physical presence under this theory of joint venture is not required, but there must be an \u201cassociation with the criminal venture and any significant participation in it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raposo, </em>413 Mass. 182, 185 (1992). The defendant argues that the judge erroneously provided this joint venture instruction to the jury because the facts of this case do not support a conviction on a theory of joint venture. We review the judge\u2019s instruction for prejudicial error, and conclude that the joint venture instruction was proper. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vinnie, </em>428 Mass. 161, 163, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1007 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">As to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 6 (owning, or assisting in the management or control of, a place for unlawful sexual intercourse), the evidence presented at trial sufficiently illustrated the defendant\u2019s association with the illicit sexual activity occurring at 238 Broadway, both directly and indirectly, through his children. Based on the evidence, a rational trier of fact could have found that the defendant orchestrated an elaborate front for prostitution in which his children were gainfully employed. The facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>sufficiently supported the joint venture theory with respect to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 6.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">With respect to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 24 (keeping a house of ill fame), the joint venture instruction also was proper. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ahearn, </em>160 Mass. 300 (1894) (where jury may draw inference of defendant\u2019s participation in misdemeanor, defendant charged directly as principal). The Commonwealth ably demonstrated that the defendant owned, managed, or maintained the premises where prostitution was taking place. Based on this evidence, the jury could have found the defendant guilty of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 24, keeping a house of ill fame as a principal, or that he jointly participated in the keeping of such a house. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">b. <em>Definition of sexual intercourse. </em>The defendant argues, and the Commonwealth concedes, that the judge gave an erroneous instruction on the definition of sexual intercourse. We agree, but conclude that the defendant was not prejudiced by the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">The term \u201csexual intercourse,\u201d as used in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 6, encompasses only penile-vaginal penetration. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>431 Mass. 417, 422-423 (2000). The judge gave a much broader definition: \u201c[T]he term, \u2018sexual intercourse\u2019 describes a variety of sexual conduct, including natural and unnatural sex, unnatural and lascivious acts or engaging in prostitution.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">The erroneous instruction was not prejudicial, because in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>case the Commonwealth had to prove that the defendant induced or knowingly suffered a person to be on his premises for the <em>purpose </em>of sexual intercourse. See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 6. As noted <em>supra, </em>the Commonwealth was not required to prove that \u201csexual intercourse\u201d actually took place on the premises. The Commonwealth\u2019s obligation under the statute was to illustrate that the defendant knew that the purpose of Lisa Ulwick\u2019s presence on the premises was to engage in sexual intercourse. Ulwick, while standing in the nude, offered Detective Ahem \u201canything\u201d he wanted. The jury could properly infer that \u201canything\u201d included sexual intercourse. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bucaulis, supra </em>at 63.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The fact that the detective actually received a \u201chand release\u201d rather than engaged in penile-vaginal intercourse does not detract from Ulwick\u2019s underlying purpose to do \u201canything\u201d a paying client could afford. The defendant was not prejudiced by the erroneous instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">c. <em>The ill fame instruction. </em>The defendant also asserts that the instruction setting forth the definition of keeping a house of ill fame was erroneous. The statute at issue, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 24, defines the offense as follows: \u201cWhoever keeps a house of ill fame . . . shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than two years.\u201d The indictment includes the language, \u201cto the common nuisance of all,\u201d and the judge, at the request of the Commonwealth, added the element of nuisance to the jury instruction. This additional element was not required. A further instruction stated as much, and provided that proof beyond a reasonable doubt of keeping a house of ill fame \u201cis sufficient to prove [nuisance] without further proof that the premises were otherwise disorderly.\u201d The defendant did not object to this instruction, and we find no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alphas, </em>430 Mass. 8, 13 (1999). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>8. <em>Substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. </em>Citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cancel, </em>394 Mass. 567 (1985), the defendant argues that the \u201ccombination of judicial errors, prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d We find this final argument wholly lacking in merit. The only error we noted, the erroneous jury instruction on the definition of sexual intercourse, was not prejudicial. Nothing in the record, standing alone or in conjunction with other evidence, would support a conclusion that a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b723-8\"> \u201cUnder the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>standard, if an affidavit is based on information from an unknown informant, the magistrate must \u2018be informed of (1) some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that the contraband was where he claimed it was (the basis of knowledge test), and (2) some of the underlying circumstances from which the affiant concluded that the informant was \u2018credible\u2019 or his information \u2018reliable\u2019 (the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>veracity test). <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>[378 U.S. 108, 114 (1964)].

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mullane, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 317, 326 (2005). We do not agree. At trial, the defendant objected to the breadth of the judge\u2019s definition of sexual intercourse, and in his brief, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bucaulis, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 59, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Bucuvalas </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>439 U.S. 827 (1978), he argues that sexual intercourse should be narrowly defined as the \u201cpenetration or intrusion of one\u2019s body into another\u2019s body.\u201d The defendant\u2019s objection on these grounds is sufficient to preserve his rights on appeal. It is irrelevant that we now find the definition of sexual intercourse given by the judge erroneous on an even more narrow ground than the one suggested by the defendant.
