L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, seeks direction on the application of the bail revocation provisions in G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, third par., which authorize the revocation of bail on a pending charge or charges when a defendant is charged with committing a new offense while on release. Similar questions concerning the statute\u2019s application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>are raised in two related cases, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cargill, post </em>329 (2005), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hall, post </em>1016 (2005). We shall clarify the statute\u2019s application on the particular facts of each case, concluding generally that, when none of the charges against the defendant has been dismissed or has resulted in acquittal, and where no manifest injustice exists, a District Court judge may not, under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, third par., vacate a bail revocation order. We also conclude that once a bail revocation order enters, it is valid for a period of sixty days, and that, by mittimus returnable on the sixtieth day, the defendant shall be brought back to the court with jurisdiction over the charges to which the bail revocation order relates (the original pending charges) for a new bail hearing on those charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The background of the case is as follows. On June 4, 2002, a grand jury in Suffolk County returned indictments charging the defendant with breaking and entering in the nighttime, possession of a burglarious instrument, possession of a firearm without a firearms identification card, possession of a firearm without a license, and resisting arrest. On June 25, 2002, the defendant was arraigned in the Superior Court. A Superior Court judge set bail at $1,000, which the defendant posted, and the defendant was advised of the potential for bail revocation under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, third par., if he were charged with committing a subsequent offense during the period of his release. After further proceedings, on September 26, 2003, the parties agreed to continue the case to the week of December 8, 2003, for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">On November 26, 2003, the defendant was arrested and arraigned in the Dorchester Division of the District Court Department on charges of receiving stolen property and breaking and entering a motor vehicle. In connection with these charges, bail was set at $500 cash, of which the defendant posted $450. The judge then allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to revoke the defendant\u2019s bail that had been set in connection with the Superior Court indictments. The notation on the docket reflects that the motion was \u201callowed to 12-8-03,\u201d i.e., to the date of the defendant\u2019s scheduled trial on the Superior Court indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The defendant\u2019s trial in Superior Court did not proceed on the scheduled date due to the absence of defense counsel. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>December 8, 2003, after a hearing, a different judge (of the District Court) vacated the order revoking the defendant\u2019s bail on the Superior Court indictments and reinstated the bail originally set ($1,000 cash). With respect to the District Court charges, the judge reduced the bail to $450 cash, which had already been posted.</p>\n<p id=\"pAhM\">The Commonwealth filed a notice of appeal, followed by a petition in the county court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, seeking relief from the portion of the December 8, 2003, order that vacated the revocation of the defendant\u2019s bail on the Superior Court indictments. A single justice reserved and reported the case, without decision, to the full court. Prior to her reservation and report, both the Superior Court indictments and District Court charges against the defendant were resolved.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">1. Because the charges against the defendant were resolved, the case is moot. See <em>Commesso </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>369 Mass. 368, 374 (1975). We nonetheless address the issues raised because they \u201care fully briefed and raise matters of importance that are likely to arise again, but are unlikely to be capable of appellate review in the normal course before they become moot.\u201d <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>415 Mass. 490, 492 (1993), quoting <em>Upton, petitioner, </em>387 Mass. 359, 365 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">2. We examine whether, under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, third par., a District Court judge may vacate a bail revocation order entered by another judge. The statute \u201csets forth the conditions ... for the possible revocation of bail if [a defendant] is charged with committing a subsequent offense during the period of his release,\u201d <em>Paquette </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>440 Mass. 121, 125 (2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1150 (2004), reading, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">\u201c[Should] any person admitted to bail pursuant to this section or section fifty-seven[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] ... be charged with a crime during the period of his release, his bail may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>revoked in accordance with this paragraph and the court shall enter in writing on the court docket that the person was so informed and the docket shall constitute prima facie evidence that the person was so informed.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] If a person is on release pending the adjudication of a prior charge, and the court before which the person is charged with committing a subsequent offense after a hearing at which the person shall have the right to be represented by counsel, finds probable cause to believe that the person has committed a crime during said period of release, the court shall then determine, in the exercise of its discretion, whether the release of said person will seriously endanger any person or the community. In making said determination, the court shall consider [several factors<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]. If the court determines that the release of said person will seriously endanger any person or the community and that the detention of the person is necessary to reasonably assure the safety of any person or the community, <em>the court may revoke bail on the prior charge and may order said person held without bail pending the adjudication of said prior charge, for a period not to exceed sixty days. </em>The hearing shall be held upon the person\u2019s first appearance before the court before which the person is charged with committing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>an offense while on release pending adjudication of a prior charge, unless that person, or the attorney for the commonwealth, seeks and the court allows, a continuance because a witness or document is not immediately available. . . . <em>Said order </em>shall state in writing the reasons therefor and <em>shall be reviewed by the court upon the acquittal of the person, or the dismissal of, any of the cases involved. A person so held shall be brought to trial as soon as reasonably </em>possible.\u201d (Emphases added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, third par.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">We apply settled principles of statutory construction. When the statute\u2019s language is plain and unambiguous, we afford it \u201cits ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>431 Mass. 772, 775 (2000). \u201cWhere the draftsmanship of a statute is faulty or lacks precision, it is our duty to give the statute a reasonable construction.\u201d <em>Capone </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Fitchburg, </em>389 Mass. 617, 622 (1983), quoting <em>School Comm, of Greenfield </em>v. <em>Greenfield Educ. Ass\u2019n, </em>385 Mass. 70, 79-80 (1982). We \u201cmust construe the statute \u2018in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Capone </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Fitchburg, supra </em>at 622-623, quoting <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>367 Mass. 360, 364 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">\u201cThe essential purpose of bail is to secure the presence of a defendant at trial to ensure that, if the defendant is guilty, justice will be served.\u201d <em>Querubin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>440 Mass. 108, 113 (2003), and cases cited. We have previously recounted the history of bail and bail reform in some detail. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>435 Mass. 249, 252-257 (2001); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>343 Mass. 162, 165-168 (1961). Over the y\u00e9ars, as Massachusetts became a leader in the bail reform movement, various bail statutes, including \u00a7 58, underwent numerous revisions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ray, supra. </em>The principal legislative purpose of \u00a7 58 is \u201cto protect the rights of the defendant by establishing a presumption that he or she will be admitted to bail on personal recognizance without surety and by delineating carefully the circumstances under which bail may be denied.\u201d <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>In 1981, the Legislature enacted St. 1981, c. 802, entitled \u201cAn Act relative to bail, pretrial release and confinement.\u201d Section 2 amended G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, by adding a bail revocation provision. See St. 1981, c. 802, \u00a7 2. In a February 27, 1981, letter to the members of the Massachusetts Senate and House of Representatives, Governor Edward J. King indicated that he was proposing the act, in part, to \u201callow [a] judge to revoke bail when the court finds probable cause to believe that the defendant has violated [the] condition [that he refrain from criminal activity during the period of his release], if the court determines that the defendant\u2019s release would pose a serious danger and that his detention is necessary to reasonably assure the safety of any person or the community.\u201d 1981 House Doc. No. 6320. In rejecting a substantive due process challenge to the current version of the bail revocation provision, G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, third par., we explained: \u201cAlthough the public may benefit indirectly from the detention of a defendant whose bail is revoked pursuant to the third paragraph of \u00a7 58 because he may be dangerous, the purpose of \u00a7 58 is not \u2018calculated to protect the public\u2019 from a dangerous person, <em>Aime </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>[414 Mass. 667, 675 (1993)], but to assure compliance with its laws and to preserve the integrity of the judicial process by exacting obedience with its lawful orders.\u201d <em>Paquette </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 129. We also noted that, based on the language in the third paragraph of \u00a7 58, \u201cthe liberty interest of a person admitted to bail is conditional; if the person violates the explicit condition of his release, then his liberty can be curtailed [and] \u2018the keys to continued freedom are left in the pocket of the accused.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126, quoting <em>Rendel </em>v. <em>Mummert, </em>106 Ariz. 233, 238 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, third par., the Legislature has made a specific, but limited, grant of authority to District Court judges (and other designated judicial officials, see note 2, <em>supra) </em>to revoke a bail order that has been entered under \u00a7 58 or \u00a7 57. Under the language of the statute, a bail revocation order may only enter \u201cpending the adjudication of said prior charge, for a period not to exceed sixty days.\u201d As such, if adjudication of the prior charge occurs, the bail revocation order automatically terminates. The only language in the statute pertaining to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>type of review of a revocation order is limited, requiring review (\u201cshall be reviewed\u201d) \u201cupon the acquittal of the person, or the dismissal of, any of the cases involved.\u201d G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, third par. The language is clear. If one of the specified circumstances is not present, a District Court judge (or any other judicial official under \u00a7 58) may not vacate a revocation order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Our conclusion is supported by the purpose of the bail revocation provision. Permitting any District Court judge to vacate a bail revocation order would likely result in multiple motions by a defendant to vacate an order, and would encourage \u201cjudge shopping\u201d for a more favorable determination. Such effects would directly contradict the legislative goal of assuring <em>compliance </em>with judicial orders and preserving \u201cthe integrity of the judicial process by exacting obedience with its lawful orders,\u201d <em>Paquette </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 129. The practice would also offend the Legislature\u2019s objective in curtailing the conditional liberty interest of a defendant when the defendant has violated an explicit condition of release by being charged with another crime during the period of release. See <em>id. </em>at 126.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">We reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the judge who vacated the revocation order permissibly did so by reason of inherent authority. Certainly, a \u201ccourt has inherent authority to exercise its own legitimate powers.\u201d <em>Jake J. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>433 Mass. 70, 77 (2000). Cf. <em>Bradford </em>v. <em>Knights, 427 </em>Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>748, 752 (1998). With respect to bail issues, a Superior Court judge \u201chas the inherent authority to deny a defendant\u2019s motion for admittance to bail where bail will not reasonably assure the defendant\u2019s appearance before the court,\u201d <em>Querubin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>440 Mass. 108, 114 (2003), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 276, 282 (1981); and a Juvenile Court judge has inherent power to revoke a juvenile\u2019s bail for his violation of his conditions of release, see <em>Jake J. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 78. These inherent powers, however, are sparingly invoked. See <em>Fine </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>312 Mass. 252, 257 (1942). There were no exceptional circumstances present here to justify the exercise of inherent power.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">We take up the defendant\u2019s argument that the bail revocation order was only a temporary order that expired by its terms, by the insertion of the date of \u201c12-8-03,\u201d and, therefore, was not vacated. As has been stated, the statute permits a person to be held without bail \u201cfor a period not to exceed sixty days,\u201d and anticipates that the defendant will be tried promptly. G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, third par. Nothing more definitive concerning this time frame is expressed. The statute\u2019s lack of precision and instruction, and the judge\u2019s insertion of, effectively, an expiration date on the bail revocation order in this case (that terminated the revocation order well before the end of the sixty-day period and prior to the actual trial date), generated confusion. We are obligated to give the statute \u201ca reasonable construction.\u201d <em>Capone </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Fitchburg, </em>389 Mass. 617, 622 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">We conclude that a bail revocation order, once entered, shall be valid for a period of sixty days. The judge shall designate in his or her order of revocation the sixtieth day, specifically, the day of the week, the date of the month, and the year on which the sixtieth day falls, to avoid any misunderstanding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Simultaneously, a mittimus shall enter, committing the defendant held without bail until the sixtieth day as designated in the order of revocation (the date in the mittimus specifying the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>next court appearance must mirror the sixtieth day as designated in the order of revocation). The mittimus shall specify that the defendant be returned for his next appearance to the court with jurisdiction over the charges to which the bail revocation order relates (the court where the original bail had been set on the original pending charges, in this case the Superior Court) for a new bail hearing on those charges. At that time, the defendant will be afforded the opportunity to seek new bail or waive his right to his new bail hearing on that day and remain held without bail.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">This procedure is consistent with the statute\u2019s speedy trial objectives in its directive that once a defendant\u2019s bail is revoked, the defendant \u201cshall be brought to trial as soon as reasonably possible,\u201d G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, third par. The procedure also secures the defendant\u2019s presence at trial. Self-expiring revocation orders falling within the sixty-day period would likely weaken a firm trial date and serve to invite a judge or judges to revisit the bail revocation order, action that we have already explained is not authorized. Further, because a bail revocation order extinguishes conditional liberty, once a bail revocation order enters, the bail has been revoked and no longer exists. Thus, a new bail release, if sought by a defendant, must be obtained (as opposed to automatic reinstatement of the bail that had been set prior to the revocation order). New bail must be obtained in the court having jurisdiction over the charges to which the bail revocation order relates (the court where the original bail had been set on the original pending charges) because the judge who revoked the bail might not possess the authority to set a bail on charges pending in a different court, see <em>Serna </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>437 Mass. 1003 (2002), and because the judge in the original court may take into consideration the arrest on the new charge before setting new bail. No statutory or common-law authority exists authorizing a judge to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>set bail in a case not pending in the court in which he or she sits, and an order revoking bail is substantively different from an order setting bail, see <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County </em>v. <em>Pires, </em>438 Mass. 96, 99 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Consistent with our duty to effectuate the statute\u2019s objectives, but mindful of the possibility that special circumstances may arise (albeit rarely) that justify an option different from what has been directed, we conclude that reconsideration of a bail revocation order may be sought when a defendant (or the Commonwealth) can demonstrate that a <em>manifest injustice </em>will result if a bail revocation order is not revisited. Such reconsideration must be sought from the judge who entered the bail revocation order, and any change in the original revocation must be supported by reasons in writing. To give some obvious examples, the discovery that the defendant is not the person charged in the complaints or indictments, or that he did not commit the serious crime on which revocation was predicated, would require reconsideration to prevent a manifest injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In sum, we conclude that, when none of the cases against the defendant has been dismissed or has resulted in his acquittal, and where no manifest injustice exists, a District Court judge may not, under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, third par., vacate a bail revocation order entered by another judge. We also conclude that once a bail revocation order enters, it shall be valid for a period of sixty days, and that on the sixtieth day, the defendant shall be returned to the court with jurisdiction over the charges to which the bail revocation order relates (the original pending charges) for a new bail hearing on those charges. Last, we deny the defendant\u2019s request for appellate counsel fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The case is remanded to the single justice for entry of a judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b335-9\">On January 5, 2004, after a jury-waived trial on three of the Superior Court indictments, the defendant was found guilty on all three indictments.

General Laws c. 276, \u00a7 58, authorizes District Court judges to revoke bail previously set in other courts or by other judges in the same court, when a defendant so released is charged with a new offense thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>violating the conditions of release. This authority may be exercised only if the District Court judge finds \u201cprobable cause to believe\u201d that the newly charged crime has been committed, that the defendant\u2019s further release will \u201cseriously endanger any person or the community,\u201d and that the defendant\u2019s detention is necessary to assure the safety of those constituencies. In determining whether the person poses such a danger and the necessity of detention, the judge is required to consider a number of enumerated factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense, the defendant\u2019s record of convictions, the status of his release, and any present mental condition or drug dependency. The decision to revoke, however, is explicitly made discretionary, not mandatory, regardless of the judge\u2019s findings. The statute repeatedly uses the word \u201cmay\u201d rather than \u201cshall.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, the only mandatory language in the statute requires the \u201ccourt\u201d (presumably the District Court to which \u00a7 58 is directed) to review its revocation order \u201cupon the acquittal of the person, or the dismissal of, any of the cases involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Interpreting this language the court concludes that once a District Court judge enters an order revoking a defendant\u2019s bail it must remain in effect until the underlying offense is disposed of, up to sixty days (the maximum time permitted by \u00a7 58). The court further concludes that the order cannot be revisited or reconsidered unless there is a dismissal or acquittal of the new charges, or the defendant can demonstrate to the judge who revoked the bail that a \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d will result if the order is not vacated. In reaching the latter of these two conclusions the court rejects the well-settled principle that a judge can always reconsider a prior order or decision during the pendency of the case. Because I see no basis in the statutory language for departing from this principle, I dissent from this part of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>\u201cA judge\u2019s power to reconsider his own decisions during the pendency of a case is firmly rooted in the common law . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haskell, </em>438 Mass. 790, 792 (2003). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>437 Mass. 1022, 1022 (2002) (\u201cIt is settled that a judge has considerable discretion to reconsider prior orders . . .\u201d). \u201cJudges are not condemned to abstain from entertaining second thoughts that may be better ones.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Downs, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 467, 469 (1991). \u201c[I]t is more important for a judge to do justice according to his oath and his conscience than to avoid adverse criticism. If further reflection convinces him that he has erred in an announced decision, he ought to correct his error while he still has the power.\u201d <em>Sheriff </em>v. <em>Gillow, </em>320 Mass. 46, 49 (1946). See <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Hopson, </em>306 Mass. 597, 601-602 (1940), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">It seems particularly appropriate that this firmly rooted power be available to correct orders that deprive persons of their liberty \u2014 orders that are themselves discretionary and based on the weighing of a number of factors that are considered almost immediately following the arrest of the defendant on new charges. Some of those factors may well change significantly once more information becomes available. Information that must be relied on instantly may prove not so reliable a few days or weeks later. This may be the result of errors in the record (such as inaccuracies in the person\u2019s record of convictions or release status), the availability of more comprehensive information (such as the circumstances of the offense), or the result of changed personal circumstances (such as an apparent mental condition or drug dependency). To bar judges from reconsidering such important decisions, in light of more, or more accurate, information bearing on the appropriateness of their exercise of discretion is quite extraordinary. It discounts in a categorical way the vast array of circumstances (and changing circumstances) that judges in our busy District Court face on a daily basis. I would not reach this result unless the statute clearly required it. Nothing in its wording would lead me to that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The court appears to reach this result by holding that \u00a7 58 gives very limited jurisdiction to District Court judges, and that once such a judge has acted to revoke a prior bail, that jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>tian is swept away. That is hardly apparent. First, there are many instances where the new (or triggering) offense will be in the very same court as the prior offense, and jurisdiction is not an issue. Second, even if the prior bail was set in another court (such as the Superior Court) the statute specifically requires that the District Court review the revocation order if the new charges are dismissed or there is an acquittal. Surely this suggests that some form of jurisdiction over the revocation order remains in the court considering the new charges \u2014 at least until the new case is disposed of or the revocation order expires, whichever occurs first. Indeed the import of the court\u2019s opinion itself is consistent with this conclusion: how otherwise could a District Court judge reconsider a revocation order based on a plea of \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d if he had no jurisdiction to do so?</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">In any event, I conclude that the District Court judge who revoked the bail has the authority to reconsider that order and to vacate it \u201c[i]f further reflection convinces him that he has erred.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Sheriff </em>v. <em>Gillow, supra. </em>While I do not contend that judges are required to reconsider their orders, or that they should lightly undo what they have done, they have the authority to do so. The presence of \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d has never been a requirement for the exercise of this common-law authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">I would also conclude that other judges before whom the new case may come also have the authority to vacate a revocation order if the judge who entered it is unavailable. While a judge should hesitate before undoing his own actions, \u201c[sjtill more should he hesitate to undo the work of another judge.\u201d <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Hopson, supra </em>at 603. This principle works well in practice and I see no reason (surely nothing in the statute) that requires it to be abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">In sum, I would hold that a District Court judge always retains the authority to review and vacate a bail revocation order he entered and may (albeit rarely) determine that it is necessary and appropriate to do the same with respect to the revocation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>order of another District Court judge if he or she is unavailable to rule on the matter and prompt action is required.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-6\"> contrast, under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58B, \u201c[a] person who has been released after a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 58A [the dangerousness statute] and who has violated a condition of his release, <em>shall </em>be subject to a revocation of release and an order of detention\u201d (emphasis added). As in G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58, third par., the court must make the same probable cause and dangerousness determinations under \u00a7 58B; however, if those findings are made, the \u201cjudicial officer shall enter an order of revocation and detention.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Vacating an order revoking bail has the effect of reinstating the prior bail. I agree that \u00a7 58 does not authorize District Court judges to set a different bail or new conditions of release on a prior charge pending in another court, and that when a revocation order expires after sixty days, a new bail hearing must be held in the court with jurisdiction over that offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
