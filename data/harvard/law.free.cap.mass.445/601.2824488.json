The husband appealed from the judgments, including the judge\u2019s award of alimony to the wife, and the Appeals Court affirmed. <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 719 (2004). We granted the husband\u2019s application for further appellate review, limited to the enforceability of the agreement. Because we conclude that the agreement was valid at the time it was executed and fair and reasonable at the time of divorce, we vacate so much of the judgment that awards alimony payments to the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-15\"><em>Facts and .procedural background. </em>The parties met in 1984 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>and lived together from 1986 until 1988. They were married in May, 1989. Two days prior to the marriage, on May 11, 1989, the couple executed the agreement. The judge found that the husband made the marriage conditional on the signing of the agreement and that the wife \u201cwas not thrilled\u201d about signing. Both parties sought the advice of legal counsel, but it was the draft prepared by the wife\u2019s counsel that the parties executed. Separate lists of each of the parties\u2019 assets were attached to the agreement as exhibits. The husband\u2019s assets were worth approximately $1 million, including interests in various family businesses. The wife\u2019s assets totaled approximately $35,000, most of which consisted of furs and jewelry. See <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Austin, supra </em>at 720 (listing the parties\u2019 assets).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The agreement allowed the separate property listed on the parties\u2019 exhibits to the agreement to be retained separately. In addition, \u201c[t]he separate property of each party . . . , including [the] increase in value of property acquired in exchange therefor, shall remain the sole and separate property of the party in whose name it is titled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">All other property was to be deemed marital property and subject to \u201cdivision under the laws of the jurisdiction which ultimately terminates . . . the marriage.\u201d The agreement provided, in relevant part, that any appreciation on the last marital home at the time of separation would be deemed a marital asset, subject to division. A key provision was that, if the marital residence was owned solely by the husband at the time of separation, although the wife would have to vacate the home,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the husband was required to assist the wife in relocating and to give the wife \u201csupport based upon such considerations as the length of the marriage, their present employment, whether any children were bom to the marriage and such other factors as are cognizable under domestic relations and property laws of the jurisdiction in which the parties last resided.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both parties waived alimony from the other.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Over the course of their twelve-year marriage, the couple had one child, bom in 1991. By agreement, the wife stayed home as a full-time mother, helping out occasionally at the family\u2019s restaurant, which opened in 1999, and other businesses. In addition, in 1995, the couple bought a house in East Sandwich, which was the marital home at the time the wife filed for divorce in 2001. During, the marriage, the family enjoyed \u201can upper class lifestyle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">In a bifurcated trial, the judge first considered evidence whether the agreement was valid. The judge found that the parties made informed, voluntary decisions to sign the agreement, that they represented their net worth to the best of their abilities, and that the wife was \u201cunder neither duress [n]or coercion when she signed the agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>He also found that the wife was fully advised of her rights when she executed the agreement and that the wife, having been divorced previously, was fully aware of her rights to alimony, support, property division, and child support. The judge found that, as it related to the division of property, the agreement was fair and reasonable at the time of execution. However, although he further found that the wife\u2019s \u201cwaiver of alimony at that time was a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver,\u201d the judge concluded that the waiver of alimony was unfair and unreasonable at the time the agreement was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">After a trial on the merits of the divorce, the judge divided the marital assets. Relevant to our discussion is the fact that the wife was awarded, among other things, the marital home, valued at $1,275,000,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> $525,000 in cash, and her Lexus automobile (subject to a loan balance of $24,575). The judge also awarded the wife $500 per week in child support and $1,000 per week in alimony. The husband\u2019s appeal from the alimony provision is the sole issue before this court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>Antenuptial agreements that waive alimony are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>not \u201cper se against public policy and may be specifically enforced.\u201d <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Osborne, </em>384 Mass. 591, 598 (1981). However, to be enforceable, the agreement must be valid at the time of execution and must also be fair and reasonable at the time of divorce. <em>DeMatteo </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>436 Mass. 18, 26 (2002). In order to be valid at the time of execution, the judge must determine whether \u201c(1) [the agreement] contains a fair and reasonable provision as measured at the time of its execution for the party contesting the agreement; (2) the contesting party was fully informed of the other party\u2019s worth prior to the agreement\u2019s execution, or had, or should have had, independent knowledge of the other party\u2019s worth; and (3) a waiver by the contesting party is set forth.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Lipnick, </em>377 Mass. 666, 672 (1979). In determining whether an agreement was fair and reasonable at the time of execution, \u201creference may appropriately be made to such factors as the parties\u2019 respective worth, . . . ages, . . . intelligence, literacy, business acumen, and prior family ties or commitments.\u201d <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Lipnick, supra </em>at 672. An agreement, even a one-sided agreement that leaves the contesting party with \u201cconsiderably fewer assets\u201d and imposes a \u201cfar different lifestyle after divorce\u201d than she had during the marriage, is fair and reasonable unless \u201cthe contesting party is essentially stripped of substantially all marital interests.\u201d <em>DeMatteo </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, supra </em>at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Where an agreement is valid at the time of execution, a judge must take a second look at its provisions at the time of divorce. <em>Id. </em>at 34-35. At that time, the agreement will be enforced \u201cunless, due to circumstances occurring during the course of the marriage, enforcement . . . would leave the contesting spouse \u2018without sufficient property, maintenance, or appropriate employment to support\u2019 herself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37, quoting 1 H.H. Clark, Jr., Domestic Relations in the United States \u00a7 1.9 (2d ed. 1987). We turn first to the validity of the agreement at the time it was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">In concluding that the agreement was not fair and reasonable as to alimony for the wife at the time of its execution, the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>stated: \u201cAlthough at the time it may have been reasonable to for[]go alimony because she was employed and was young and healthy, ... it was not fair and reasonable at the time of execution for [the wife] to for[]go all possible alimony and support given the great disparity of earning potential of the parties.\u201d The wife was employed at a department store in Boston, and the husband had various business interests. The judge noted that the wife entered the marriage intending to build a life with the husband and \u201crightfully believed that what they built together would belong to both of them,\u201d but that the husband made \u201cit his mission ... to prevent the creation of joint marital assets.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although it is important to our analysis, the judge did not address the provision of the agreement that created support for the wife based on, among other things, length of marriage and employment, in the event a jointly owned marital home did not exist at the time a divorce complaint was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">The judge\u2019s findings do not permit the conclusion that the wife was \u201cessentially stripped of substantially all marital interests,\u201d which is the standard required to declare an agreement invalid at its execution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>DeMatteo </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, supra </em>at 31. Disparity of income that has the potential to leave one spouse in an essentially different lifestyle is not a valid basis for determining that the agreement was invalid at its execution. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, \u201c[w]here there is no evidence that either party engaged in fraud, failed to disclose assets fully and fairly, or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>some other way took unfair advantage of the confidential and emotional relationship of the other when the agreement was executed, an agreement will be valid unless its terms essentially vitiate the very status of marriage.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Here there is no evidence of the husband\u2019s taking unfair advantage of the wife at the time the agreement was executed. The wife\u2019s attorney drafted the agreement, after he had advised her not to sign an agreement prepared by the husband\u2019s attorney. Furthermore, as discussed, the judge found that the wife was fully aware of her rights and knowledgeable about alimony, property division, and child support. The agreement provided that the wife\u2019s separate premarital property would remain hers and not be incorporated into marital assets. Cf. <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>372 Mass. 398, 400 (1977) (judge has \u201cdiscretion to assign to one spouse property of the other spouse whenever and however acquired\u201d). The agreement permitted the wife a joint interest in marital assets and provided that \u201cany appreciation on the marital home or such home as the parties reside as their last marital home at the time of separation, whether due to market forces or capital investment,\u201d be divided as a marital asset, even if the husband held sole title to the property. Most important, the agreement entitled the wife to relocation and \u201csupport\u201d from the husband if there were no jointly owned marital home at the time of a divorce, \u201cbased upon such considerations ... as are cognizable under domestic relations and property laws\u201d of the relevant jurisdiction. In short, the agreement provided for either funds from a capital asset or access to support, utilizing standard factors such as those now codified in Massachusetts in G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34. When they were married, the couple resided in the husband\u2019s condominium unit. Therefore, it was reasonably foreseeable that a home owned by the husband would exist in the event of a divorce. There is nothing in this record that would allow us to conclude that the agreement vitiated the status of marriage by stripping the wife of \u201csubstantially all marital interests.\u201d <em>DeMatteo </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, supra </em>at 31. Accordingly, the agreement was valid at the time it was executed. Had the wife been dissatisfied with the terms of the agreement, she could have refused marriage. See <em>id. </em>at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Our conclusion that the agreement is valid requires us \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>consider whether there is any reason not to enforce it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We begin by noting that, although he was not required to do so after he found the agreement to be invalid at the time of execution, the judge also found that the agreement concerning alimony was invalid at the time of divorce. He stated that the wife had spent ten of the twelve years of marriage as a homemaker, completely dependent on the husband, and given her lack of education,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was \u201cnot in a position to secure income which would maintain the lifestyle that she achieved [for her and her daughter] during the marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">In the <em>DeMatteo </em>case, the court held that the so-called \u201csecond look\u201d at the agreement \u201cis to ensure that the agreement has the same vitality at the time of the divorce that the parties intended at the time of its execution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37. The agreement must be enforced unless circumstances such as the mental or physical deterioration of the contesting party, or erosion of promised support by inflation, would lead the court to conclude that the agreement was not conscionable and that its \u201cenforcement . . . would leave the contesting spouse \u2018without sufficient property, maintenance, or appropriate employment to support herself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting 1 H.H. Clark, Jr., Domestic Relations in the United States \u00a7 1.9 (2d ed. 1987). In the <em>DeMatteo </em>case, the court rejected as insufficient the factors the judge had relied on to determine that an antenuptial agreement with \u201cless than modest\u201d financial provisions for the wife was invalid: lifestyle during the marriage, vast disparity in the parties\u2019 ability to acquire assets, and the fact that it was a ten-year marriage that produced two children. <em>Id. </em>at 38. The court stated that \u201cthe wife was fully apprised of the husband\u2019s holdings before she agreed to these \u2018less than modest\u2019 arrangements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In fact, the court recognized that one spouse\u2019s share of the marital assets might be \u201cdisproportionately small.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Here, there has been no physical or mental deterioration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>the wife. She was self-supporting during a period of separation prior to their marriage. The wife has the marital home worth $1,275,000 and was awarded $525,000 in cash. She was allowed to keep many of the contents of the marital home, including jewelry acquired since the marriage worth $74,000. Given the assets she has been awarded, we cannot say that the agreement leaves the wife without sufficient property and maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the agreement is enforceable and vacate the judge\u2019s order to award the wife alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-7\"> After the parties were married, they lived in a condominium unit owned by the husband.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b620-8\">The agreement preserved the parties\u2019 rights concerning support and custody of their child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b620-9\">The paragraph waiving alimony states that both parties \u201cunderstand that any waiver or modification of their right [to alimony] may be, voidable under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>certain circumstances and may be subject to reconsideration by a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b621-10\">For purposes of this appeal, the wife does not contest the judge\u2019s findings that she was fully informed of the husband\u2019s net worth prior to marriage and that the agreement contains a waiver.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b621-11\">The marital home is subject to a $154,000 mortgage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b621-12\">The husband also appealed from the judge\u2019s decision concerning visitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>with his child. That issue was decided by the Appeals Court and was not raised in the husband\u2019s application for further appellate review. <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>62 Mass.

In such circumstances, the judge would have the equitable power to design a remedy, such as adjusting the distribution of assets, regardless of whether the agreement itself was valid either at its execution or at the time of divorce. See <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>354 Mass. 565, 567 (1968) (discussing Probate Court\u2019s equity jurisdiction); <em>Bak </em>v. <em>Bak, </em>24 Mass.

The <em>DeMatteo </em>case was called to the court\u2019s attention by the husband in motions he filed in August, 2002. Neither party contests the fact that the <em>DeMatteo </em>decision, which clarified the standards to be applied to antenuptial agreements, applies to this case. <em>Id. </em>at 30-31, 35. See generally <em>Schrottman </em>v. <em>Barnicle, </em>386 Mass. 627, 630-631 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The wife was bom in 1952 and has a high school education.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Contrary to the suggestion of the dissent, <em>post </em>at 610, today\u2019s decision reaffirms our holding in <em>DeMatteo </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, supra, </em>that as a first stage inquiry, a prenuptial agreement must be found to be valid, a determination that includes, inter alla, a finding that the agreement \u201ccontains a fair and reasonable provision as measured at the time of its execution for the party contesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>the agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26, quoting <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Lipnick, </em>377 Mass. 666, 672 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b626-6\">Greaney, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_e\">(dissenting, with whom Spina, J., joins). The court today denies a woman, in her fifties, with a high school education, low potential earning capacity, and a child to raise, her right to receive alimony. The linchpin of the court\u2019s decision, which pertains to the first standard stated in <em>Rosenberg </em>v. <em>Lipnick, 377 </em>Mass. 666, 672 (1979), for determining the validity of an antenuptial agreement, is the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">\u201cThe judge\u2019s findings do not permit the conclusion that the wife was \u2018essentially stripped of substantially all marital interests,\u2019 [<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] which is the standard required to declare an agreement invalid at its execution. <em>DeMatteo </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>[436 Mass. 18, 31 (2002)].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-8\"><em>Ante </em>at 605. The court erroneously applies this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">As noted, the critical time frame is <em>the time of execution </em>of the agreement. <em>DeMatteo </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, supra </em>at 30. Significantly, at that time, the wife did not simply agree to take less than what she might have received under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34. Instead, she relinquished her right to both alimony and any claim on the husband\u2019s assets, essentially giving up substantially all marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>interests. Contrast <em>DeMatteo </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, supra </em>at 22, 34 (explaining that, although it gave wife less than she would have received under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34, antenuptial agreement did not strip wife of her marital rights because it provided her, at the time of its execution, with a mortgage-free house, an automobile, medical insurance, and lifetime alimony). While the agreement did not impair the wife\u2019s right to seek her share of the marital assets in the event of divorce, there were <em>no </em>marital assets at the time she executed the agreement. The wife, in substance, was given nothing under the agreement. The agreement contemplated only potential marital assets that might be acquired after marriage. Further, although the agreement contemplated the possibility of a future marital residence, it had a provision relating to circumstances where the parties lived together \u201cin a residence owned by only one of them,\u201d and as noted by the Appeals Court, \u201cthere is . . . nothing in the agreement <em>requiring </em>[the husband] to provide a home for [the wife]\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 719, 720 n.2 (2004). Contrary to the court\u2019s statement, if no jointly owned marital home existed at the time of the divorce, the agreement required the husband only to \u201cassist\u201d the wife \u201cin her relocation and support,\u201d with absolutely no monetary obligation specified or required. Thus, at the relevant time, namely, when the agreement was executed, the wife essentially gave up all her marital rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">The parties did subsequently acquire assets during the marriage, and the wife ultimately received a share of the assets. Consideration of that fact, however, is appropriate if it becomes necessary to take a \u201csecond look\u201d at the agreement, a step required only after it has been determined (at the time of the first look) that an agreement is valid. <em>DeMatteo </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, supra </em>at 34. There is no need to reach that consideration in these circumstances. The Appeals Court, in a well-crafted opinion, saw the flaw in the husband\u2019s arguments and voided the agreement in first-stage examination for the reasons I have described. See <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Austin, supra </em>at 727 (\u201cIn so doing [namely, concluding that this agreement should not be enforced], we do not consider the circumstances at the time of the divorce, including whether either party has accumulated additional assets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>since the agreement was made. That inquiry occurs during the \u2018second look\u2019 stage, when a court deciding whether and to what extent to enforce a valid term of the agreement must assess if it is \u2018conscionable\u2019 to do so. <em>DeMatteo </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>436 Mass. at 38\u201d). Thus, the court has analytically transposed the proper order that governs examination of the validity of antenuptial agreements. In so doing, it has implicitly overruled portions of the <em>DeMatteo </em>decision that hew closely to the traditional two-stage analysis, holding, without expressly saying so, that an agreement, perhaps proper at the second look, is valid for all purposes, even if it is nugatory at the time of execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-11\">This language appeared for the first time in <em>DeMatteo </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>436 Mass. 18 (2002), which was decided after the judge had entered his decision concerning the validity of the agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
