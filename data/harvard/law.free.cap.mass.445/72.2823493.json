Feyenord, of trafficking between one hundred and 200 grams of cocaine in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(3). A divided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>panel of the Appeals Court affirmed the conviction. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feyenord, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 200 (2004). We granted further appellate review, limited to consideration of two issues: the denial of Feyenord\u2019s motion to suppress cocaine found by the police in the vehicle he was driving; and the sufficiency of the evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that the exterior sniff of a properly stopped motor vehicle, by a dog trained in drug detection, is not a search within the meaning of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. We also conclude that Feyenord\u2019s extended detention, after his motor vehicle was stopped for a traffic violation, for the purpose of summoning a canine unit, was reasonable and proportional to the unfolding circumstances that suggested his involvement in criminal activity beyond the violation for which he was initially detained. Consequently, Feyenord\u2019s motion to suppress was properly denied. We finally conclude that the evidence at trial was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">1. <em>Motion to suppress. </em>We accept the motion judge\u2019s findings of fact and the undisputed evidence consistent with those findings adduced at the hearing on Feyenord\u2019s motion to suppress.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, </em>408 Mass. 533, 538 (1990). On May 4, 2000, at approximately 5:45 p.m., State Trooper William Pinkes was traveling on Route 395 in Auburn when he noticed a vehicle traveling behind him with one headlight out. The weather did not require the use of headlights, and it was daylight. After Pinkes allowed the vehicle to pass his marked police cruiser, he activated the cruiser\u2019s blue lights, and the driver pulled over. Inside were Feyenord and a passenger. Pinkes approached the vehicle and asked Feyenord for his driver\u2019s license and automobile registration. Feyenord was visibly nervous, and his hands were shaking. He was unable to produce a license but did hand Pinkes a Massachusetts registration that was apparently valid but not in his name. Pinkes asked the pas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>senger for identification, and the passenger produced a photographic identification card from the country of Jamaica that identified him as a Jamaican national named Junior Cox. When Feyenord did not provide an intelligible response to Pinkes\u2019s request for his name, Pinkes ordered him out of the vehicle. Cox remained in the passenger seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Having separated Feyenord from Cox, Pinkes went back and forth between them to ask basic questions about their identities and destination. Standing outside the vehicle, Feyenord told Pinkes that his name was Kadari Bowen and his birthday was June 6, 1978. When asked his age, however, Feyenord struggled with the answer, providing one age and then another. Feyenord told Pinkes that Cox was his brother-in-law and the father of his sister\u2019s child, and that he had known Cox for twelve years. Feyenord also said that he had a New York driver\u2019s license and he and Cox were traveling to visit a friend in Putnam, Connecticut, for whom he could produce neither an address nor a telephone number. In contrast, Cox, still seated in the vehicle, told Pinkes that he had known Feyenord for two to three years, knew him only as \u201cPat,\u201d did not know his last name, and was not acquainted with any members of his family. Cox also said that they were headed to Brooklyn, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">These prehminaries lasted between five and ten minutes. At this point, Pinkes ordered Feyenord to sit in the back seat of the cruiser (unhandcuffed), telling him that he was not under arrest but was not free to leave. Pinkes then radioed for assistance from a canine officer, State Trooper James Devlin, who arrived at the scene within fifteen to twenty minutes with a drug-sniffing dog. Devlin proceeded to direct the dog around the vehicle. The dog displayed a heightened interest in an area near the left rear of the vehicle\u2019s trunk. The officers proceeded to open the trunk and place the dog inside.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The dog again became excited in the area of the trunk near the left taillight. Pinkes then searched the trunk, discovering an access panel in the area that had caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the dog\u2019s agitation. Once he removed this-panel, Pinkes found a gray plastic bag and, within, a digital scale and small black plastic bags each containing a quantity of a substance that appeared to be crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">a. <em>The traffic stop. </em>Feyenord first argues that the judge should have granted his motion to suppress the cocaine because the police had no justification to stop him for driving a vehicle with one inoperable headlight in daylight. We disagree. General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 7, provides that \u201c[ejvery motor vehicle operated in or upon any way . . . shall be provided with . . . suitable lamps.\u201d We interpret this language to mean that a motor vehicle\u2019s headlamps must be suitable at all times so that they are capable of being illuminated whenever road conditions might warrant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Neither the time of day nor the weather conditions during the operation of the motor vehicle has any bearing on this requirement. Although some vehicles driven during daylight may have defective headlights but escape detection by police, Feyenord was nonetheless operating his vehicle in violation of the statute. Pinkes\u2019s stop of Feyenord\u2019s vehicle was lawful. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santana, </em>420 Mass. 205, 207 (1995), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bacon, </em>381 Mass. 642, 644 (1980) (\u201cWhere the police have observed a traffic violation, they are warranted in stopping a vehicle\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">b. <em>The exit order. </em>Feyenord next argues that the judge should have granted his motion to suppress because Pinkes ordered him to leave the vehicle without a reasonable suspicion of danger. We conclude that the exit order was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Under art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution, \u201ca police officer must, at least, have a reasonable suspicion of danger before compelling a driver to leave his motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>429 Mass. 658, 662 (1999). However, \u201c[wjhile a mere hunch is not enough ... it does not take much for a police officer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>establish a reasonable basis to justify an exit order or search based on safety concerns, and, if the basis is there, a court will uphold the order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Here, Feyenord could not produce his driver\u2019s license, and Pinkes had been unable to ascertain his identity. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santana, supra </em>at 213-214 n.8, and cases cited. Feyenord was visibly nervous and with a companion. Pinkes was alone. Although the exit order was not predicated on suspicious movements or the visible presence of a weapon or possible contraband, police officers need not \u201cgamble with their personal safety,\u201d and the course of events after the stop sufficiently gave \u201crise to legitimate safety concerns\u201d to justify the taking of the reasonable precaution of separating Feyenord from Cox and ordering Feyenord from the vehicle. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haskell, </em>438 Mass. 790, 794 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>407 Mass. 147, 152 (1990). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stampley, </em>437 Mass. 323, 328 (2002) (\u201cjustification for an exit order does not depend on the presence of an \u2018immediate threat\u2019 at the precise moment of the order, but rather on the safety concerns raised by the entire circumstances of the encounter\u201d). The order also served a valid investigatory purpose. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>433 Mass. 669, 675 (2001) (\u201cofficer acted reasonably and within the limits of both Fourth Amendment and art. 14\u201d because exit order was \u201cno more intrusive than necessary . . . to effectuate both the safe conclusion to the traffic stop and the further investigation of the suspicious conduct\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riche, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 830, 833-834 (2001) (exit order justified where \u201ctender of a registration not crediting ownership of the vehicle to any occupant raised a question whether the car was stolen,\u201d and order served \u201cspecial practical purpose\u201d of \u201cseparating those in a stopped car from each other to frustrate interchange or collaboration among them\u201d). Feyenord\u2019s claim that the fruits of the subsequent investigation should be suppressed because the exit order was unlawful is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">c. <em>Feyenord.\u2019s further detention. </em>Feyenord next argues that his motion to suppress should have been granted because he was unreasonably detained while the police, without reasonable suspicion of drug-related activity, summoned a canine officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>with a drag-sniffing dog to the scene, thereby impermissibly broadening the scope of the inquiry under art. 14 and the Fourth Amendment. We have not had occasion to decide what type of suspicion police officers must have to escalate a general inquiry of a motorist in connection with a violation of traffic laws to an investigation that utilizes a drag-sniffing dog and justifies the prearrest detention of a motorist for such purpose. We are, however, aided by the progeny of <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1 (1968), applicable to traffic stops and temporary detentions. <em>Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 439 (1984) (investigative stop of a vehicle by police is \u201canalogous to a so-called <em>\u2018Terry </em>stop\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">In considering the temporary detention of a motorist, we begin with the \u201csettled principle that \u2018[a] justifiable threshold inquiry permits a limited restraint of the individuals involved as long as their detention is commensurate with the purpose of the stop.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>424 Mass. 153, 162 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ellsworth, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 554, 557 (1996). \u201cIn evaluating whether the police exceeded the permissible scope of a stop, the issue is one of proportion. \u2018The degree of suspicion the police reasonably harbor must be proportional to the level of intrusiveness of the police conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinforoso, </em>434 Mass. 320, 323 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>422 Mass. 111, 116 (1996). In order to expand a threshold inquiry of a motorist and prolong his detention, an officer must reasonably believe that there is further criminal conduct afoot, and that belief must be based on \u201cspecific and articulable facts and the specific reasonable inferences which follow from such facts in light of the officer\u2019s experience.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>389 Mass. 233, 243 (1983), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>366 Mass. 402, 406 (1974). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, supra </em>at 116 (\u201cWe view the facts and circumstances as a whole in assessing the reasonableness of the officer[\u2019s] conduct\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fraser, </em>410 Mass. 541, 545 (1991) (\u201ca combination of factors that are each innocent of themselves may, when taken together, amount to the requisite reasonable belief\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wren, </em>391 Mass. 705, 707 (1984), and cases cited (\u201cA hunch will not suffice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>In this case, Pinkes conducted a threshold inquiry in which Feyenord could not produce a valid driver\u2019s license, produced a registration in another person\u2019s name, failed to identify himself, and appeared nervous. As discussed above, these circumstances justified an exit order and further inquiry.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After additional questioning of Feyenord and Cox, Pinkes made several decisions: (1) he chose not to arrest Feyenord, as an out-of-State driver without a license, despite having probable cause to do so, see G. L. c. 90, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 21; (2) he focused his investigation on the possibility that the vehicle contained drugs by summoning a canine unit; and (3) he opted to detain Feyenord in the rear of his cruiser for fifteen to twenty minutes while awaiting the arrival of the canine unit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Feyenord contends that this set of actions constituted a violation of his Fourth Amendment and art. 14 rights. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">In the course of questioning Feyenord and Cox about their identities and destination, Pinkes uncovered significant inconsistencies. Given Feyenord\u2019s inability to produce a valid driver\u2019s license, his nervous behavior, and these unsettling inconsistencies, Pinkes could reasonably have concluded, based on \u201cspecific and articulable facts and the specific reasonable inferences which follow from such facts,\u201d that Feyenord and Cox were engaged in criminal activity beyond Feyenord\u2019s non-possession of a license and the vehicle\u2019s malfunctioning headlight. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra </em>at 243. Pinkes was thus justified in further detaining Feyenord and Cox and expanding the scope of his investigation beyond mere motor vehicle violations. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>360 Mass. 557, 559-560 (1971) (defendant\u2019s incredible claim of ignorance about provenance of water pistol in vehicle justified further inquiry); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lantigua, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 526, 528 (1995) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>(\u201cInability to produce a license or a registration reasonably gives rise to a suspicion of other offenses, such as automobile theft . . .\u201d). See also 4 W. R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 9.2(f), at 334-335 (4th ed. 2004), and cases cited (\u201cif the suspect\u2019s explanation needs to be checked out, and in particular if his explanation is known to be false in some respects, there is reason to continue the detention somewhat longer while the investigation continues\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Having concluded that Pinkes was entitled to extend Feyenord\u2019s detention and expand the scope of his investigation, we must consider whether his decision to summon and employ a drug-sniffing dog required additional facts that specifically pointed to Feyenord\u2019s involvement in drug-related activity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feyenord, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 200, 213 (2004) (Greenberg, J., dissenting) (facts must specifically arouse suspicion of narcotics trafficking in order to justify detaining the driver for the purpose of calling canine unit to conduct drug sniff), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>348 F.3d 965, 970-971 (11th Cir. 2003)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and <em>People </em>v. <em>Caballes, </em>207 Ill. 2d 504, 509-510 (2003), vacated, 543 U.S. 405 (2005). See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Wiegand, </em>645 N.W.2d 125, 137 (Minn. 2002) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>(\u201creasonable, articulable suspicion of drug-related criminal activity\u201d necessary to conduct dog sniff after vehicle stopped for routine equipment violation). Because we conclude that Pinkes\u2019s course of action was reasonable, it did not impermissibly expand the scope of his investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Although the facts supported the trooper\u2019s suspicion that criminal activity was \u201cafoot,\u201d <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30 (1968), the specific type of criminal activity that might be \u201cafoot\u201d was decidedly uncertain. The facts were consistent with a number of possibilities, including automobile theft, fugitive flight, and the transportation of contraband, to list just a few. \u201cAn expeditious collateral inquiry which might result in the suspect[\u2019s] arrest or prompt release is not unreasonable when done to meet \u2018the practical demands of effective criminal investigation and law enforcement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barros, </em>425 Mass. 572, 585 (1997), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salerno, </em>356 Mass. 642, 646-647 (1970). Faced with facts such as those presented here, an officer must make judgments about what resources are readily available to him that might quickly dispel or confirm his suspicion that the driver is involved in some form of criminal activity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Such judgments should not be second guessed by courts, particularly where \u201cthe police are acting in a swiftly developing situation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinforoso, supra </em>at 325, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. 675, 686 (1985). We are disinclined to promulgate a rule artificially prioritizing or limiting the investigative methods that an officer may utilize in these circumstances. The test is one of reasonableness, and the decision to call a canine officer and drug-sniffing dog stationed nearby to confirm or dispel the possibility of drug transportation was far from unreasonable in this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Equally important, the detention of Feyenord (while poten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>tially embarassing) was not overly prolonged or onerous in duration. As with all investigative stops of this nature, the police had a responsibility to proceed expeditiously with their investigation. \u201cIn assessing whether a detention is too long in duration to be justified as an investigative stop, we consider it appropriate to examine whether the police diligently pursued a means of investigation that was likely to confirm or dispel their suspicions quickly, during which time it was necessary to detain the defendant.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sharpe, supra. </em>In this case, Pinkes followed his inquiry of the occupants of the vehicle by promptly summoning the canine unit, and the total detention lasted no longer than thirty minutes.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinforoso, supra </em>at 325-326.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">In sum, we conclude that \u201cthe conduct of the officerQ was proportional to the escalating suspicion that emerged over the course of the stop.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinforoso, supra </em>at 323. Consequently, Feyenord\u2019s detention for the purpose of summon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>ing a canine unit with a drug-sniffing dog was not contrary to either the Fourth Amendment or art. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">d. <em>The dog sniff of the vehicle. </em>Finally, Feyenord argues that the motion to suppress was improperly denied because the use of the dog to ascertain the presence of drugs in the vehicle was an unreasonable \u201csearch\u201d contrary to the Fourth Amendment and art. 14. Feyenord\u2019s Fourth Amendment argument is foreclosed by decisions of the Supreme Court, including <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Caballes, </em>543 U.S. 405, 410 (2005) (\u201cdog sniff conducted during a concededly lawful traffic stop that reveals no information other than the location of a substance that no individual has a right to possess does not violate the Fourth Amendment\u201d), and <em>Indianapolis </em>v. <em>Edmond, </em>531 U.S. 32, 40 (2000) (while vehicle stop effectuates Fourth Amendment seizure, use of narcotics-detection dog around vehicle\u2019s exterior does not transform seizure into search). It remains for us to consider whether such a canine sniff is a search under art. 14. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>429 Mass. 658, 662 (1999), and cases cited (\u201c[w]e have expressly granted . . . protections to drivers and occupants of motor vehicles under art. 14 in a variety of areas, and we have done so to guarantee protections that, in some cases, may not be recognized under the Fourth Amendment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u201cWhen we confront the question whether police activities amount to a search or seizure within the meaning of art. 14, we ask \u2018whether the defendants\u2019 expectation of privacy [in the circumstances] is one which society could recognize as reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>400 Mass. 61, 68 (1987), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Podgurski, </em>386 Mass. 385, 388 (1982). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>410 Mass. 290, 301 (1991). We agree with the Appeals Court that \u201cthe dog\u2019s sniff and resulting \u2018alert\u2019 would constitute a search only <em>if </em>society were prepared to say that the defendant was reasonable in his subjective expectation of privacy in the odor of cocaine emanating from his car. We think that society is wholly unprepared and unwilling to take that step.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feyenord, 62 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 200, 207-208 (2004). Accordingly, we conclude that a dog sniff of a properly stopped vehicle is not a search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>under art. 14.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Caballes, supra </em>at 409; <em>Indianapolis </em>v. <em>Edmond, supra </em>at 40; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinforoso, supra </em>at 324, citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Place, supra </em>at 707. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Wiegand, </em>645 N.W.2d 125, 132-133 (Minn. 2002) (canine sniff of automobile not \u201csearch\u201d under Minnesota Constitution; \u201cwe perceive no sound basis on which to reject the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s approach to the Fourth Amendment issue presented in this case\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">After \u201cthe dog indicated the presence of narcotics in the rear of the car, the police had probable cause to search the car.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinforoso, supra </em>at 324, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pinto, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 790, 793 (1998). Consequently, the discovery and seizure of the contraband was proper and Feyenord\u2019s motion to suppress was correctly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">2. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>Feyenord argues that the judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty, which he made at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and at the close of all the evidence, because the evidence did not demonstrate his participation in a joint venture to traffic in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>cocaine. \u201cThe essential question in evaluating the denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty is whether the evidence received, viewed in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, is sufficient so that the jury \u2018might properly draw inferences, not too remote in the ordinary course of events, or forbidden by any rule of law, and conclude upon all the established circumstances and warranted inferences that the guilt of the defendant was proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>406 Mass. 581, 584 (1990), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clary, </em>388 Mass. 583, 588 (1983). \u201cIt is not essential that the inferences drawn from facts or circumstances be necessary inferences. . . . It is enough if the inferences drawn from the circumstances be reasonable and possible. . . . The weight of the evidence is for the jury.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Medeiros, </em>354 Mass. 193, 197 (1968), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Bernier </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>393 U.S. 1058 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">State Troopers Pinkes and Devlin testified at trial, providing much the same account as offered at the hearing on Feyenord\u2019s motion to suppress and credited by the judge in his findings on the motion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> After the troopers arrested Feyenord, they discovered $510 on his person, including twenty-five twenty dollar bills and one ten dollar bill. A State trooper specializing in narcotics investigations testified that later testing of the substance discovered in the vehicle revealed that the bags contained 163 grams of sixty-one per cent concentration crack cocaine, the street value of which was more than $16,000. The State trooper testified that the purity and packaging of the cocaine and the discovery of a scale with the drugs were consistent with drug dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">In Feyenord\u2019s defense, a former girl friend of Feyenord\u2019s uncle testified that Feyenord had stayed in her Worcester home the night before his arrest, after he arrived on a bus from New York City. She also testified that she gave Feyenord permission to drive her vehicle back to New York so long as he returned it the same day, but indicated that there were no drugs in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>vehicle when she lent it to him. Feyenord testified in his own defense and denied that he had any knowledge of the cocaine found in the vehicle. He claimed that he was in Massachusetts investigating the possibility of moving here from New York.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> On the day of his arrest, he borrowed the vehicle to help his friend Junior Cox, with whom he had traveled from New York City, transport numerous shopping bags back home. Feyenord asserted that, while Cox had placed his parcels in the trunk, he had not looked in the trunk himself. He explained that he gave a false name, the name of a cousin, to Pinkes at the traffic stop because he was wanted on an outstanding default arrest warrant from 1995, which he did not want discovered. Feyenord also testified that the large sum of cash on his person had been wired to him for work he performed as an auto detailer while in New York City, although the defense did not further substantiate the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">At trial, the Commonwealth argued alternatively that Feyenord was guilty of cocaine trafficking as a principal or as a participant in a joint venture. The jury found Feyenord guilty solely as a joint venturer.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In order to succeed on a theory of joint venture, the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant was \u201c(1) present at the scene of the crime, (2) with knowledge that another intends to commit the crime or with intent to commit a crime, and (3) by agreement is willing and available to help the other if necessary.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charros, </em>443 Mass. 752, 758-759 (2005), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>388 Mass. 358, 366, <em>S.C., </em>390 Mass. 254 (1983). We conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charros, supra </em>at 759; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sabetti, </em>411 Mass. 770, 780 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">The jury could have reasonably concluded that Feyenord knew of the large quantity of drugs stored in the vehicle he was driving because Feyenord appeared nervous when approached by Pinkes and provided false, evasive, and implausible answers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>to police questions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinforoso, </em>434 Mass. 320, 328-329 (2001) (nervousness and responses to police questions that are inconsistent and implausible suggest defendant\u2019s connection to drugs); <em>Alicea </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>410 Mass. 384, 387-388 (1991) (defendant\u2019s agitation may support inference that he knew drugs were present). In addition, Feyenord possessed a large sum of cash when arrested, in denominations consistent with his involvement with drug dealing. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brzezinski, </em>405 Mass. 401, 410 (1989). From this evidence, the jury could have inferred that Feyenord was at least assisting Cox with the enterprise of trafficking cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">As Feyenord was driving a vehicle containing a large quantity of cocaine and the Commonwealth\u2019s case permitted a reasonable inference that Feyenord knew of the cocaine and intended to assist Cox with trafficking it, the evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict of Feyenord\u2019s guilt as a joint venturer.

I agree with the court that the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was properly denied because the police acted lawfully. In the circumstances that occurred, when a police officer harbors a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed, and that suspicion escalates, based on multiple false and evasive responses, and then reasonably focuses on the possibility of drug-related criminal activity,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a dog sniff around the exterior of an otherwise lawfully stopped vehicle is a permissible investigative technique. I write separately, however, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>voice my concern that it not become a routine occurrence to summon a drug sniffing dog to the scene whenever the operator, or passengers, of a vehicle that has been stopped for a minor traffic violation, appear nervous or answer an officer\u2019s questions inconsistently.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">In our democratic society, special concern must be vigilantly exercised by the courts to balance the rights of the police under the principles of <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1 (1968) (which have expanded considerably over the years since <em>Terry </em>was decided), with the protections afforded less powerful citizens who often feel the brunt of Terry-type stops. Many of these citizens (some even noncitizens), because of their economic standing, will be driving vehicles with defective equipment or driving them without proper licenses or registrations. Moreover, these vehicles will frequently be operated in areas of cities that have known drug zones (Lowell, Holyoke, Springfield, parts of Boston, to mention a few). The police, endeavoring to stamp out drug commerce and use, will invariably be making traffic stops in these zones. The lack of a license or proper registration or the commission of a routine traffic violation, coupled with nervousness, or even some evasion on the part of the operator or others in the vehicle, may provide a basis to continue detention under <em>Terry </em>principles, but should not, by themselves, provide a basis to bring in a drug-sniffing dog. As cogently noted by Professor LaFave:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">\u201cAllowing . . . dogs to be used serves only as a positive encouragement for police to engage in pretext and subterfuge, hardly a defensible move given the common knowledge that traffic-law enforcement has been diverted from its justified objectives to serve as a means for seeking out drugs. Allowing use of the drug dogs at all in conjunction with traffic stops can only encourage the making of stops for insignificant and technical violations on the basis of unarticulated suspicions and mere hunches or, at worst, on totally arbitrary and discriminatory bases. Moreover, allowing use of the dogs at all adds to the process another decision, whether to summon a drug dog, that the cases indicate requires no reasonable suspicion nor, for that matter, any justification whatsoever, but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>the practice indicates is also likely to be made on an arbitrary basis.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">LaFave, The \u201cRoutine Traffic Stop\u201d From Start to Finish: Too Much \u201cRoutine,\u201d Not Enough Fourth Amendment, 102 Mich.

LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 9.3(f), at 400 (4th ed. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">This case also provides an opportunity to speak directly to the subject of racial or ethnic profiling in the context of the use of drug sniffing dogs during traffic stops. The majority of police officers proceed in good faith when making traffic stops. Some officers, however, do not and proceed more on stereotypical thinking and hunches, using dubious investigative techniques that result in the harassment of racial and ethnic minorities. In his concurring opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>429 Mass. 658 (1999), Justice Ireland wrote of \u201cthe dangers posed by unfettered police power to order individuals out of automobiles without any justification\u201d and of documented \u201cwidespread public concerns about police profiling, commonly referred to as \u2018DWB \u2014 driving while black.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 669, 670 (Ireland, J., concurring). The same kind of discriminatory conduct is also directed at other ethnic groups, especially Hispanics. A motorist must <em>never </em>be stopped based on his or her race or ethnicity without legally sufficient cause. Getting a traffic ticket is never a happy experience. Getting a traffic ticket if you are a black or Hispanic person who has committed a minor traffic violation and then been questioned in public view by an armed police officer determined to find a basis, or extract consent, to bring in a police dog, is humiliating, painful, and unlawful. See generally S.R. Gross, Road Work: Racial Profiling and Drug Interdiction on the Highway, 101 Mich. L. Rev. 651 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">A dog sniff is not a search under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, see <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Caballes, </em>543 U.S. 405, 407-410 (2005); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Place, </em>462 U.S. 696, 707 (1983), and the court correctly concludes that a dog sniff of the exterior of an automobile is likewise not a search within the meaning of art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1985 Ford Thunderbird Auto., </em>416 Mass. 603, 607-609 (1993) (helicopter surveillance of backyard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>of private home not a search); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>410 Mass. 290, 301 (1991) (measure of expectation of privacy under art. 14 is \u201c(1) whether the defendant has manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the search, and (2) whether society is willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable\u201d). I would pursue the art. 14 analysis a step further, however, and candidly acknowledge that the use of a dog during a traffic stop, while not a full search in the constitutional sense, is more than a de minimis intrusion into the detained individual\u2019s privacy interests. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, supra </em>at 662-663 (art. 14 extends protections to drivers and occupants of motor vehicles beyond those granted by Fourth Amendment and protects Massachusetts citizens from being subjected to unjustified exit orders during routine traffic stops). I would recognize that the act of summoning a dog heightens the tension inherent in any traffic stop to a measurable degree, and that the use of a drug-sniffing dog, even around the exterior of a vehicle, sends a clear public signal, not only to the detained motorist, but to all others passing by, that a drug investigation is in progress. See 4 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 9.3(f), at 401. In sum, \u201c[ijnjecting [a dog] into a routine traffic stop changes the character of the encounter between the police and the motorist. The stop becomes broader, more adversarial, and (in at least some cases) longer.\u201d <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Caballes, supra </em>at 421 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Taking a broader perspective, there is something viscerally disturbing about the use of police dogs in traffic stops \u2014 something that hints at the oppressive measures used by police in societies where respect for personal freedom and privacy are devalued or nonexistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">In my view, we should clearly delineate the permissible bounds of a routine traffic stop, beyond which police officers may not go, in order fully to protect the art. 14 rights of all our citizens and to avoid even the appearance of having countenanced official discrimination and harassment. A police officer conducting a traffic stop may not summon a canine officer and dog on a mere hunch or unarticulated suspicion that drugs might be discovered in the stopped vehicle. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wiegand, </em>645 N.W.2d 125, 136-137 (Minn. 2002). Nor may the officer continue to engage the vehicle\u2019s occupants in arbitrary or dila<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>tory questioning, thus surreptitiously enlarging the duration and scope of the stop, in the expectation that circumstances may turn up justification, or consent obtained, to initiate a dog sniff of the vehicle. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>202 Ill. 2d 462, 470-471 (2002), cert. denied, 539 U.S. 937 (2003); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>265 Kan. 238, 244-245 (1998). Even when an officer\u2019s decision to summon a dog is based on a justifiable suspicion of drug-related activity that arose during the course of the stop, the dog sniff and its fruits should be suppressed if tainted by the officer\u2019s protracted detention of the vehicle\u2019s occupants and failure promptly to terminate the stop when its original lawful objectives are accomplished. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCleery, </em>345 Mass. 151, 153-154 (1962). The court recognizes this to be true, <em>ante </em>at 78 n.5, but, nonetheless, considers it significant that the defendant\u2019s detention \u201cwas not overly prolonged or onerous in duration\u201d and \u201clasted no longer than thirty minutes.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 81. In the usual case, thirty minutes is too long to detain a motorist, in order to effectuate a dog sniff of the vehicle, in the absence of a reasonable articulable suspicion of drug-related activity. An officer\u2019s conduct during a <em>Terry-type </em>stop of a motor vehicle must be <em>at all times </em>lawfully related in scope to the circumstances that justified the stop in the first place, or to unfolding circumstances as they develop. See <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra </em>at 19-20. We must ensure that, under art. 14, the use of a drug-sniffing dog in connection with a routine traffic stop remains the exception and does not become the rule.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-8\">The situation presented to the State trooper was fused with tension and not simply one in which the defendant had difficulty in producing proper documentation.

Because the scope of the canine detection in this case was neither reasonable in the circumstances nor proportional to the investigating officer\u2019s actual suspicions, as is required by our settled jurisprudence, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">It is black letter law that, to withstand a challenge to evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>seized during an investigatory stop, the Commonwealth must show that \u201cit was permissible to initiate\u201d the stop and that \u201cthe scope of the seizure was justified by the situation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>422 Mass. 111, 116, 118 (1996), citing <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 19-20 (1968). I agree with the court that, in this case, the stop was legal. <em>Ante </em>at 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Our interpretation under art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights of the permissible \u201cscope\u201d of any ensuing investigation is equally settled.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinforoso, </em>434 Mass. 320, 323 (2001) (\u201cIn evaluating whether the police exceeded the permissible scope of a stop, the issue is one of proportion\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, </em>429 Mass. 658, 662-663, 665 (1999) (reasonableness requirement in escalation of scope of traffic stops helps prevent arbitrary or harassing police conduct).

Rather, as the court candidly recognizes, the trooper had only a generalized suspicion that something might be afoot. What that something was, was \u201cdecidedly uncertain,\u201d and \u201cconsistent with a number of possibilities.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 80. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the police \u201creasonably focuse[d] on the possibility of drug-related criminal activity.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 86. A motorist\u2019s nervousness and false responses to police questions, without more, does not permit the police to conclude that illegal narcotics activity is afoot.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this case, as the Appeals Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>noted, at the point he decided to summon a police dog trained \u201cto detect marijuana, cocaine, hashish, and heroin,\u201d the trooper had determined only that <em>\u201csomething </em>meriting further investigation was afoot\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feyenord, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 200, 203 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">I conclude that the use of a drug-detection dog is not \u201cproportional\u201d or \u201cjustified\u201d during a routine traffic stop unless the police have a reasonable suspicion that the detained individual is engaged in unlawful drug-related activities. See <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Caballes, </em>543 U.S. 405, 418-422 (2005) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (use of drug-sniffing dog during traffic stop \u201cbroaden[s] the scope of the traffic-violation-related seizure\u201d and therefore ought to require reasonable suspicion). This is not only required, as I shall explain, by our art. 14 jurisprudence, but also is consistent with the conclusions of numerous other State courts of last resort, examining the limits imposed by their respective State Constitutions on targeted canine drug sniffing. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Wiegand, </em>645 N.W.2d 125, 137 (Minn. 2002) (reasonable suspicion of drug activity required before initiation of canine sniff); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pellicci, </em>133 N.H. 523, 534 (1990) (same); <em>People </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>77 N.Y.2d 19, 26 (1990), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1219 (1991) (same); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>515 Pa. 454, 465-467 (1987) (same). See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Tackitt, </em>315 Mont. 59, 69-70 (2003) (\u201cparticularized suspicion\u201d of narcotics required to initiate sniff).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">A canine drug sniff conducted during the course of a traffic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>stop is intrusive, embarrassing, and anxiety inducing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That \u201c \u2018drug dogs are not lap dogs\u2019 . . . changes the character\u201d of an interaction between a police officer and a private citizen, which \u201cbecomes broader, more adversarial, and (in at least some cases) longer\u201d when the police officer insists on probing the citizen with a drug sniffing dog. <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Caballes, supra </em>at 421 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>356 F.3d 1268, 1276 (10th Cir.) (McKay, J., dissenting), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 852 (2004). See 1 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 2.2(g), at 537 (4th ed. 2004) (canine search of persons \u201cis embarrassing, overbearing and harassing, and thus should be subject to Fourth Amendment restraints\u201d). Traffic stops occur in public places, and the motorist involved may often be known to others passing by. As Justice Greaney notes, a canine search \u201csends a clear public signal, not only to the detained motorist, but to all others passing by, that a drug investigation is in progress.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 89. See 4 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 9.3(f), at 401 (4th ed. 2004). I cannot agree with the court that detaining a motorist at the side of the road while the police use a dog to sniff his vehicle is merely \u201cpotentially embarrassing.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 80-81. Rather, I share Justice Greaney\u2019s concerns that the use of drug-sniffing dogs, when used during a traffic stop, \u201cis more than a de minimis intrusion into the detained individual\u2019s privacy interests.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 89. For these reasons, the use of a narcotics detection dog is \u201cintimidating\u201d and \u201cupsetting to the innocent motorist.\u201d Y. Kamisar, W.R. LaFave, J.H. Israel, &amp; N.J. King, Modem Criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Procedure 430-431 n. (11th ed. 2005), quoting 4 W.R. LaFave, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 9.3(f). No individual should be individually probed in this manner unless the police have reasonable suspicion that drug activity is afoot.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">In my judgment, that conclusion is compelled by our art. 14 jurisprudence. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, supra </em>at 663, we held that a police officer must have \u201ca reasonable belief that the officer\u2019s safety, or the safety of others, is in danger before ordering a [person] out of a motor vehicle.\u201d In other words, even if a police officer has a legitimate basis for extending a traffic stop (in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, supra </em>at 660, the police suspected some illegal activity because the defendant passenger was \u201cextremely nervous\u201d and \u201cappeared to be breathing heavily\u201d), the officer cannot order a person out of a vehicle unless the officer has a reasonable belief that removal from the vehicle is required for reasons of safety. We explained in that case that our \u201crule\u201d is rooted in art. 14\u2019s requirement that the police respect the privacy of motorists, avoid unnecessary delay and inconvenience in making traffic stops, <em>id. </em>at 663-664, and act at all times \u201cin a reasoned way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 665.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If our Constitution requires a \u201creasonable\u201d fear for safety to justify ordering a motorist out of an automobile during a traffic stop, surely it requires no less before a canine drug sniff can be initiated against an individual stopped for a routine traffic violation: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>ordering a person from an automobile typically is less intrusive than conducting a canine narcotics sniff. A particularized \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d requirement for canine drug detection during traffic stops prevents baseless harassment of citizens, without erecting any barrier to legitimate law enforcement activities. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gonsalves, supra </em>at 662-664.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The targeted use of a narcotics detection dog against a particular individual stopped for a routine traffic stop is entirely distinguishable from properly conducted police efforts to ensure public safety. The use of specially trained dogs in airports, schools, subway stations, or other such public arenas gives rise to issues not present in this case. See, e.g., <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Caballes, supra </em>at 424-425 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (distinguishing search and seizure standards involving \u201cgeneral interest in crime control\u201d from those involving \u201cmore immediate threats to public safety\u201d), and cases cited. Reasonable canine detection can be utilized for public safety purposes without violating our carefully developed art. 14 jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The court\u2019s conclusion that canine narcotics detection is permissible in this case means necessarily that drug-sniffing dogs may be called in any time the police sense that the subject of a routine traffic stop is engaged in \u201csome\u201d unspecified wrongdoing. In so holding, the court departs (without reason or explanation) from our settled jurisprudence and deprives our citizens of meaningful protection from an investigatory tactic widely recognized as intrusive and \u201cviscerally disturbing.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 89.1 respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Significantly, the judge did not find that the State trooper had reason to suspect the defendants of illicit narcotics activity, and the Commonwealth has never made such a claim. The record confirms that there was nothing about the actions or responses of the defendant that suggested illegal narcotics activity. The trooper did not testify to an odor of drugs, that the defendant was weaving while driving, that his eyes were glassy, or that his speech was abnormal. The trooper who pulled the defendant\u2019s automobile over was in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>trained in narcotics interdiction. He did not testify that he suspected that the defendant was engaged in any illicit drug activity when he decided to summons the narcotics-detection dog. He testified only that, at the time he summoned the dog, he had ascertained that the defendant may have been driving without a license, that he had given a false name and appeared nervous, and that there were inconsistencies between the defendant\u2019s responses to routine questions and the statements of the passenger in the automobile. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Feyenord, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 200, 211 (2004) (Greenberg, J., dissenting). The officer testified that he was \u201csuspicious\u201d of the defendant and the passenger, but not that he had a particularized suspicion that either of the two men possessed drugs. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wiegand, </em>645 N.W.2d 125, 128-129, 137 (Minn. 2002) (no reasonable suspicion sufficient to conduct canine drug sniff where individual stopped for inoperable headlight appeared nervous, had glossy eyes, and denied consent to search car, and officer was suspicious but did not suspect that individual was under influence of drugs).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The court\u2019s opinion pays little, if any, attention to the issue whether targeted canine narcotics detection itself broadens the scope of any investigatory stop. Rather, the court focuses, unnecessarily in my view, on the length of the defendant\u2019s detention at the side of the road. It is settled that, had they completed their legitimate investigation, the police could not (without reasonable suspicion) have detained the defendant further to await the dog\u2019s arrival. <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Caballes, </em>543 U.S. 405, 408 (2005), citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>202 Ill. 2d 462 (2002), cert. denied, 539 U.S. 937 (2003). Today\u2019s holding creates troublesome incentives because \u201cthe stopping officer is tempted to engage in stalling regarding his proper function during the stop ... in order to give the appearance that the time for the stop has not expired in the interim.\u201d Y. Kamisar, W.R. LaFave, J.H. Israel, &amp; N.J. King, Modem Criminal Procedure 430-431 n. (11th ed. 2005), quoting 4 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure LaFave \u00a7 9.3(f) (4th ed. 2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Well-trained dogs often \u201calert\u201d to innocent people. <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Caballes, </em>543 U.S. 405, 411-412 (2005) (Sauter, J., dissenting). In one case, school officials initiated a canine sniff of their teenage students. The dogs \u201calerted\u201d to fifty students, thirty-three of whom later were revealed to have been innocent. A dog alerted to one junior high school girl. She was asked to empty her pockets, which contained no drugs. She was then strip searched, but, again, no drugs were found. Later, it was revealed that the girl had been playing that morning with her own dog, who was in heat. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Renfrow, </em>475 F. Supp. 1012 (N.D.
