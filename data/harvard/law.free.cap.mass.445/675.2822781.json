The report pertains to the validity and enforceability of an assignment of a general contractor\u2019s claims (for contractual indemnification and breach of contract) against its subcontractor to an employee of the subcontractor who was injured on the job. We conclude that the assignment is valid and the assignees, here the plaintiffs, must prove their assigned claims and damages in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The parties have stipulated to the relevant facts, which we supplement with undisputed facts taken from the record. The plaintiff David J. Spellman, Sr. (Spellman), an employee of East Coast Fireproofing, Inc. (East Coast), a subcontractor, was injured on August 23, 1996, while working at a construction site. Spellman received workers\u2019 compensation benefits from East Coast\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer, and he, his wife, and two sons sued the general contractor, Shawmut Woodworking &amp; Supply, Inc. (Shawmut), claiming that Spellman\u2019s injuries were caused by Shawmut\u2019s negligence<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and asserting claims of loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Prior to Spellman\u2019s injuries, Shawmut and East Coast had entered into a subcontract. Among its provisions is the following indemnification provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-8\">\u201c[T]o the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Subcontractor [East Coast] agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Owner, the Architect/Engineer, Contractor [Shawmut] and anyone else required by the Contract Documents, from and against any and all claims, damages or loss (including attorney\u2019s fees) arising out of or resulting from any work of and caused in whole or in part by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>an[y] negligent act or omissions of [East Coast] or those employed by it, or working under those employed by [it] at any level, regardless of whether [or] not caused by a party indemnified hereunder.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Shawmut filed an answer to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, and then gave notice of its request for defense and indemnification to East Coast\u2019s liability insurer, Pacific Insurance Co. Thereafter, Shawmut filed a third-party complaint against East Coast, claiming tl^t, in its subcontract with Shawmut, East Coast had expressly agreed to indemnify Shawmut, and asserting a breach of contract claim for East Coast\u2019s failure to name Shawmut as an additional insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The parties engaged in discovery. A final pretrial conference occurred, and a'trial date was set and once rescheduled. A few weeks before the scheduled trial date, Shawmut and the plaintiffs entered into an agreement for judgment in the amount of $300,000 that contained a waiver of \u201call rights of appeal.\u201d The agreement for judgment was filed with the court pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 58 (a), as amended, 371 Mass. 908 (1977), and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-7\">\u201cBy Agreement of the plaintiffs and [Shawmut], Judgment hereby enters in favor of [Spellman] in the amount of Two Hundred and Eighty Thousand Dollars on Count One, in favor of plaintiff Frances Spellman in the amount of Nineteen Thousand, Nine Hundred and Ninety-Eight Dollars on Count Two, and in favor of plaintiffs David J. and Anthony Spellman in the amount of Two Dollars in Count Three, the plaintiffs and [Shawmut] waiving all rights of appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">East Coast unsuccessfully moved to strike the agreement for judgment. In connection with the proceedings on this motion, Shawmut and the plaintiffs disclosed that they, together with Shawmut\u2019s insurer, approximately one month before filing the agreement for judgment, had entered into an \u201cAssignment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>Rights and Agreement Not to Pursue Satisfaction Under Agreement for Judgment\u201d (assignment). In the assignment, which by its terms was to have the effect of a sealed instrument, Shawmut, in exchange for one dollar and \u201cother good and valuable consideration,\u201d assigned to the plaintiffs \u201cany and all rights and claims it has brought or may have against [East Coast] arising out of or resulting from Plaintiffs\u2019 claims against [Shawmut] for personal injuries suffered on or about August 23, 1996, [including] whatever rights [Shawmut] has or may have against East Coast for . . . contractual indemnification, . . . legal expenses, negligence, [and] breach of contract.\u201d In return, the plaintiffs agreed \u201cthat they will seek satisfaction of the [agreement for judgment] solely from the proceeds of [Shawmut\u2019s] claims or rights assigned to the Plaintiffs . . . and that they will not collect or seek to collect any or all of the [agreement for judgment] from [Shawmut].\u201d The assignment stated that it was not to be construed as an admission of liability on the part of Shawmut, \u201cliability [which] has been and continues to be expressly denied.\u201d There is no evidence that East Coast had any notice of either the assignment or the agreement for judgment prior to its receipt of notice that the agreement for judgment had been docketed.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Neither Shawmut nor its insurer has paid anything to the plaintiffs to satisfy the agreement for judgment. Shawmut has incurred approximately $35,121 in attorney\u2019s fees in defense of this matter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Approximately ten months after East Coast\u2019s motion to strike was denied, the plaintiffs sought leave to amend their complaint to add East Coast as a primary defendant so that, as recent assignees, they could \u201cpursue the contractual indemnification [and breach of contract] claims that Shawmut had against East Coast.\u201d East Coast opposed the motion to amend the complaint on the grounds that, among other issues, the motion was the product of undue delay and would prejudice East Coast, and that, based on the terms of the assignment, Shawmut incurred no liability or monetary exposure, an event that must occur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>before East Coast can be liable. East Coast also maintained that the plaintiffs should not be permitted to circumvent their evidentiary burden of proving that Shawmut was negligent and that Shawmut\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause or a substantial factor resulting in Spellman\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">East Coast then filed a motion to dismiss Shawmut\u2019s third-party complaint. In the motion, East Coast asserted that the plaintiffs cannot recover $300,000 from East Coast because, by reason of the plaintiffs\u2019 agreement in the assignment not to collect the settlement amount from Shawmut, Shawmut has not incurred an actual loss and, as a consequence, the $300,000 amount is illusory. East Coast also alleged that enforcing the assignment would be prejudicial and would contravene both G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29C, and G. L. c. 152. In their opposition, the plaintiffs challenged East Coast\u2019s arguments and maintained that no actual loss is necessary under the indemnification provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The judge allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend, denied East Coast\u2019s motion to dismiss Shawmut\u2019s third-party complaint against East Coast, and reserved and reported the correctness of her decisions to the Appeals Court. In her reservation and report, she also submitted several questions of law for consideration. The judge stayed all further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">1. The correctness of the judge\u2019s decisions (allowing the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend and denying East Coast\u2019s motion to dismiss Shawmut\u2019s third-party complaint) turns on whether the assignment is valid and enforceable. We separately address each consideration, noting that we need not answer the reported questions \u201cexcept to the extent that it is necessary to do so in resolving the basic issue.\u201d See <em>McStowe </em>v. <em>Bornstein, 377 </em>Mass. 804, 805 n.2 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">a. We have a situation where, because Spellman collected workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the plaintiffs are barred by the exclusivity provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act from directly suing East Coast for negligence. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 23; <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Westerlind, </em>374 Mass. 524, 526 (1978) (employer who pays workers\u2019 compensation benefits that are collected by employee injured during the course of his employment is released under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 23, from all possible resulting tort claims). At the same time, there is no question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>that, under Massachusetts law, the general contractor, Shawmut, is free to seek to enforce any contractual indemnification rights it has against East Coast. See <em>Whittle </em>v. <em>Pagani Bros. Constr. Co., </em>383 Mass. 796, 799-800 (1981), citing 2A A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7\u00a7 76.00, 76.41 (1976 &amp; Supp. 1981). East Coast argues that, while Shawmut may directly seek to enforce its contractual indemnification rights (and claim for breach of contract), Shawmut cannot assign these claims to the plaintiffs because doing so in these circumstances (where the plaintiffs and Shawmut executed an agreement for judgment in a specified amount and where the plaintiffs also agreed not to seek satisfaction of the agreed-on judgment from Shawmut) violates public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">East Coast correctly contends that, to recover under the indemnification provision, there must be a showing that Spell-man\u2019s injury was caused, at least in part, by East Coast\u2019s negligence. Under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29C,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for the indemnification provision to be enforceable, the subcontractor\u2019s action or inaction must have been a cause of the injury, that is, must have \u201cbrought about or provoked the mishap.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Modem Continental Constr. Co., </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 545, 546-547 (2000).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The indemnification provision limits the indemnification obligation further by prohibiting indemnification for \u201cclaims, damages or loss\u201d due to the indemnitee\u2019s (Shawmut\u2019s) sole negligence by expressly requiring a \u201cnegligent act or om-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>mission[] of [East Coast] or those employed by it.\u201d Cf. <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Kiewit Constr. Co., </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 796, 798-799 (1996) (explaining that, under indemnification clause that required subcontractor to indemnify for \u201c \u2018injur[y] ... on account of acts or omissions of . . . any of its . . . employees\u2019 . . .[, t]he only contractual limitation is for an injury caused by the <em>sole </em>negligence of an indemnitee [the general contractor]\u201d). East Coast, however, overlooks the fact that there need not be reliance on a common-law imputation of Spellman\u2019s negligence to East Coast. See <em>id. </em>at 798. Rather, the reliance will be on East Coast\u2019s <em>contractual undertaking. </em>See <em>id. </em>Further, as stated in the indemnification provision, the indemnification obligation applies \u201cto the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.\u201d Last, the noted limitations on the indemnification provision have no bearing on the validity of the assignment, which is a contract to be interpreted according to ordinary rules of contract interpretation, see <em>Larabee </em>v. <em>Potvin Lumber Co., </em>390 Mass. 636, 641 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">With respect to the agreement for judgment and the covenant in the assignment not to pursue satisfaction of the agreement, we have held (following the majority rule), admittedly in different circumstances, that such devices do not operate to invalidate an otherwise valid assignment. See <em>Campione </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>422 Mass. 185, 190-192 (1996), and cases cited. This is so even where the assignee (here, Shawmut) suffers no tangible damages. <em>Id. </em>at 189-190.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">As in the <em>Campione </em>decision, we do not overlook the possibility of collusion or fraud. These risks, however, are mitigated by \u201c[p]lacing with the plaintiffs the responsibility of proving their assigned claims in full,\u201d as well as damages, and by permitting defendants, such as East Coast, \u201cto suggest the issue of collusion, and if a satisfactory basis exists, to argue it to the fact finder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193. The risk of fraud and collusion also is offset by important policy considerations such as encouraging settlement agreements, see <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Travelers Indem. Co., </em>414 Mass. 747, 765 (1993); by settled law that most contract claims are assignable, see <em>Rubenstein </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 244, 246 (1998); by settled law that contracts not to sue (or, by analogy, contracts not to satisfy judgments) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>are usually valid, see 29 S. Williston, Contracts \u00a7 73:5 (4th ed. 2003); and by a permissible objective on the part of a general contractor to shift the financial consequences of risks arising in the performance of a construction contract to another entity (an entity that can protect against such risks by obtaining insurance, a measure Shawmut contends that East Coast was obligated, but failed, to do), see <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Kiewit Constr. Co., supra </em>at 800 (noting parties may negotiate indemnity clauses and may \u201cadjust to any unequal bargaining power by the assumption of the burdens of insurance coverage\u201d). In this case, the risks are mitigated by the fact that there will be no contractual claim or loss for which East Coast must provide indemnity if the plaintiffs do not prevail on their underlying negligence and loss of consortium claims against Shawmut. Because Shawmut did not admit liability in the assignment, there is no risk of any adverse impact to defenses East Coast may choose to assert (to the validity of either the indemnification provision or the assigned claims). Further, discovery was conducted prior to the execution of the agreement for judgment and the assignment. Were Spellman to change his version of events now, any variation or inconsistency in his testimony could weaken his credibility and could be used to impeach him at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">By upholding the assignment, the plaintiffs step into the shoes of Shawmut and may assert against East Coast only those claims that Shawmut had against East Coast, namely claims for contractual indemnification and breach of contract. See <em>Grise </em>v. <em>White, </em>355 Mass. 698, 701 (1969). We agree that \u201c[tjhere is nothing that prohibits or prevents a party from contractually agreeing to greater liability than would have been provided by law.\u201d <em>Byrne </em>v. <em>Sealy &amp; Co., </em>742 So. 2d 668, 671 (La. Ct. App. 1999). The assignment does not change East Coast\u2019s potential exposure; it only affects the party to whom payment must be made if liability and damages are proved.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">b. The enforceability of the assignment is not limited by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>amount specified in the agreement for judgment. The agreement for judgment is not enforceable against East Coast. East Coast was not a party to the agreement, and as previously explained, in order to minimize the risks of fraud and collusion with respect to the assignment of the contractual indemnification obligation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to their underlying claims against Shawmut for negligence and loss of consortium, their assigned claims, establishing liability and damages. See <em>Campione </em>v. <em>Wilson, supra </em>at 193, and cases cited. Only then may the plaintiffs collect pursuant to the indemnification provision. Any holding to the contrary would permit a contrived judgment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Our decision in <em>Fireside Motors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Nissan Motor Corp. in U.S.A., </em>395 Mass. 366 (1985), does not require a different result. In that case, a customer alleged that she was injured when the seat belt system in her automobile, that she purchased from Fireside Motors, Inc. (Fireside), failed during a collision. <em>Id. </em>at 368. She sued Fireside and the distributor. <em>Id. </em>at 367. Fireside settled with the customer and then brought an indemnification action against the distributor and manufacturer under various theories, but not pursuant to an \u201cexplicit contractual right to indemnification. \u2019\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 369 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">In connection with Fireside\u2019s claim for common-law tort indemnification, the court rejected the defendants\u2019 claim that the action was barred because Fireside failed to give them timely notice of the underlying action involving the original plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>at 371. We concluded that the failure to give timely notice \u201cmerely imposes on the person seeking indemnity the burden of litigating the facts supporting the indemnitor\u2019s primary liability to the original plaintiff and giving rise to the indemnity relationship itself,\u201d and \u201cimposes on the indemnitee the burden of proving that the original settlement was reasonable in all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371, 372. We reject Shawmut\u2019s contention that it necessarily follows that, if proper notice is given to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>an indemnitor who neglects to defend, then the indemnitor should be held hable for the settlement amount. The conclusion is not one appropriately drawn in a case such as this, where the indemnitee (Shawmut) has executed an indemnification provision that only applies if it can be shown that Spellman\u2019s injuries were caused, at least in part, by East Coast\u2019s negligence. Until such proof is established, the indemnification provision, with its concomitant duty to defend, does not apply. Further, in <em>Fireside Motors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Nissan Motor Corp. in U.S.A., supra </em>at 368, Fireside paid the settlement and did not enter into an agreement with the injured customer never to pay the settlement, as was the case here between Shawmut and the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">2. The assignment is valid. Consequently, the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend was properly allowed. However, the plaintiffs and Shawmut should not both be able to assert the same claims (contractual indemnification and breach of contract) against East Coast. Because the assignment is valid, the assignees, the plaintiffs, may properly assert those claims in their amended complaint, and East Coast\u2019s motion to dismiss Shawmut\u2019s third-party complaint against it is to be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">3. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b694-9\">The plaintiffs allege that Shawmut Woodworking &amp; Supply, Inc. (Shawmut), failed to exercise reasonable care in taking all necessary precautions for ensuring the safety of the employees working at the construction site, including a failure properly to supervise, manage, and direct its subcontractors in observing, executing, and enforcing all Federal, State, and private contractual obligations pertaining to job site safety and accident or injury precaution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b695-9\">In their amended complaint, the plaintiffs allege that, in its subcontract with Shawmut, East Coast Fireproofing, Inc. (East Coast), agreed to obtain certain insurance to protect Shawmut for any work performed under the contract documents and to name Shawmut as an additional insured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b696-7\">East Coast stipulated to the amount for purposes of the reservation and report only, and reserved the right to challenge the amount in any future proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b698-6\">General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 29C, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">\u201cAny provision for or in connection with a contract for construction . . . which requires a subcontractor to indemnify any party for injury to persons . . . not caused by the subcontractor or its employees . . . shall be void.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\"> \u201cThe language of G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29C, no longer requires a finding of the subcontractor\u2019s negligence in order to trigger a subcontractor\u2019s liability under an indemnity provision in a construction subcontract.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Modem Continental Constr. Co., </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 545, 547 (2000). The statute in no way \u201cprohibit[s] contractual indemnity arrangements whereby the subcontractor agrees to assume indemnity obligations for the entire liability when both the subcontractor and the general contractor or owner are causally negligent,\u201d <em>Herson </em>v. <em>New Boston Garden Corp., </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 779, 788 (1996), or, under the current standard, \u201cbrought about or provoked the mishap,\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Modem Continental Constr. Co., supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b700-7\">We are cognizant of the significant financial exposure faced by subcontractors. As noted by one respected commentator, several States have enacted legislation prohibiting a right of \u201crecovery-over\u201d against an employer, including by indemnity, in the absence of a written agreement made prior to any injury. 7 A. Larson, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law \u00a7 121.04[4] (2005). Any changes affording greater protection to subcontractors in this area involve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>an examination of competing interests and policy considerations, and is better left to the Legislature.
