Bonds, of raping a nineteen year old woman (whom we shall call Ellen) suffering from a brain disorder and resulting mental disability. The Appeals Court set aside the jury\u2019s verdict, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonds, </em>63 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>App. Ct. 163 (2005), holding that the trial judge had improperly admitted character evidence of the victim\u2019s trusting nature and propensity to be victimized, through the testimony of her mother. We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for further appellate review. Because we conclude that the evidence admitted was not character evidence, but evidence of the manifestations of the victim\u2019s disability, and was highly relevant to an issue in the case, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>The following evidence was introduced at trial. On February 15, 2000, Stephanie Hoch, an acquaintance, visited Ellen at her home in Brockton. Immediately on her arrival, Hoch telephoned the defendant, a 'thirty year old man whom Ellen did not know, and spoke to him privately. At some point, Hoch gave Ellen the telephone in order to speak with the defendant. The testimony regarding what was said during that telephone conversation and thereafter was conflicting. According to Ellen, the defendant told her that \u201che wanted to fuck [her],\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that she said \u201cno,\u201d and that she told the defendant she and Hoch were only going to his residence to \u201chang out.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>defendant and Hoch, on the other hand, testified that Ellen made sexually provocative advances to the defendant on the telephone.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ellen also testified that it was Hoch who wanted to go to the defendant\u2019s residence and that Hoch promised to protect her. Hoch, however, testified that Ellen was the one who wanted to meet the defendant and that no promise of protection was asked for or made. In any event, shortly after the telephone call, Ellen and Hoch traveled to the defendant\u2019s residence, a single room in a boarding house.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Soon after arriving at the defendant\u2019s room, Ellen and the defendant engaged in sexual intercourse. Hoch sat near them watching television. According to Ellen\u2019s testimony, the defendant asked her whether she \u201cremember[ed] talking shit on the phone,\u201d locked the door when she looked at it, pushed her down on the bed, pulled down her pants, and placed his fingers in her vagina. When he said he was going to \u201cdo it,\u201d Ellen asked him to put on a condom. After putting on a condom, the defendant commenced penile-vaginal intercourse with Ellen, who repeatedly said \u201cno\u201d and \u201cscreamed\u201d during the episode. The testimony of Hoch and the defendant, however, was to the effect that Ellen was a ready and willing participant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">After the incident, Ellen dressed and took the defendant\u2019s telephone out of the defendant\u2019s room into the hallway of the boarding house to contact a friend. Ellen testified that she told her friend that she was raped, and that the defendant then came into the hallway, grabbed the telephone, went back into his room, and slammed the door. According to the defendant and Hoch, the defendant went into the hallway, took the telephone from Ellen and asked her to leave because she became loud (ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>patently arguing with her Mend) in violation of the rules of the boarding house. All agree that Ellen and Hoch left together.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Hoch then accompanied Ellen to a police station, where Ellen made a report of the rape consistent with her trial testimony. The police officer to whom the report was made testified at Mai that Hoch gave a statement largely corroborating Ellen\u2019s account when questioned at the police station.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In her testimony, however, Hoch denied making any such statement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After reporting the rape, Ellen was taken to a hospital for examination, where she again described what had occurred. No physical injury of significance was found during the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The principal issue at Mai was whether Ellen consented to sexual intercourse with the defendant. The resolution of that issue depended on the jury\u2019s evaluation of the credibility of the two different versions of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">a. <em>The testimony of Ellen\u2019s mother. </em>In his opening statement, the prosecutor told the jury that the evidence would show that Ellen \u201cwas setup by her purported friend to be raped by the defendant\u201d and that this Mend did not protect Ellen despite her promise to do so. After Ellen had testified as described above, she was vigorously cross-examined. Not surprisingly, the cross-examination highlighted the incongruity between the alleged vulgarity of the telephone call, as Ellen had described it, and her subsequent willingness to go to the defendant\u2019s residence. Defense counsel focused on the sexually aggressive and verbally harsh nature of the defendant\u2019s word choice, painting the alleged proposition by the defendant as much more than mere sexual banter. See, e.g., note 1, <em>supra. </em>The clear implication of the questioning was that Ellen would not have gone to the defendant\u2019s residence in light of the telephone conversation unless either she intended to have sexual relations with him or her version of the telephone conversation was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>The Commonwealth then called Ellen\u2019s mother as a witness. She testified that Ellen lived at home and did not have \u201cnormal intellectual capacity and function.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The mother explained that, since ten months of age, Ellen had a \u201cseizure disorder which made her incapacitated for a lot of different functions that the normal child could do.\u201d Moreover, the mother testified that Ellen\u2019s limited mental intellectual capacity \u201cbecame apparent\u201d when she was in fourth or fifth grade, that Ellen was placed in special needs classes in elementary, junior high, and high school, and that she could not hold a steady job. The following colloquy also took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-5\">The prosecutor: \u201c[A]s a result of the intellectual deficiencies, can you describe for the jury how that manifests itself in terms of how she relates to other people, friends, peers, that sort of thing?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-6\">The mother: \u201cWell, I think everyone perceives themselves. We live in a perfect world, so [Ellen\u2019s] little imperfections were not socially acceptable. So [Ellen] clung \u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-7\">Defense counsel: \u201cI think she\u2019s talking about how the world relates to [Ellen], not what [Ellen\u2019s] problem is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-8\">The prosecutor: \u201cI\u2019ll rephrase, your Honor, and narrow it down.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>The judge: \u201cAll right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-5\">The prosecutor: \u201cRelative to how [Ellen] relates to what she characterizes as friends and her judgment and trust in people, could you explain that to the . . . jury?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-6\">The mother: \u201cShe clung on to people thinking they were her friends. She trusted them too quickly. She always called everybody her friend because she doesn\u2019t understand the difference between acquaintances and friends. She held on to that so she could have, you know, her friends.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-7\">The prosecutor: \u201cSo she \u2014 would it be fair to say that she would characterize someone as a friend after one meeting?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-8\">The mother: \u201cCorrect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-9\">The prosecutor: \u201cAnd relative to her trusting people, did that cause her problems in terms of was she victimized as a result of that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-10\">The mother: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-11\">Defense counsel: \u201cObjection, your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-12\">The judge: \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll sustain the objection to the last question and answer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-13\">Subsequent to this colloquy, the mother was asked to describe the \u201ctypes of things [that] happened between [Ellen] and the people she believed to be her friends\u201d that the mother personally witnessed. Without objection, the mother testified to having once seen Ellen\u2019s so-called friends stealing from her. She also testified that on another occasion, shortly after her daughter had agreed to leave the house with three new \u201cfriends,\u201d the mother discovered five girls beating Ellen up. At the conclusion of the prosecutor\u2019s questioning in this area, he asked whether it \u201cwould ... be fair to characterize [Ellen] as lacking in the vernacular street smarts.\u201d The judge, however, sustained defense counsel\u2019s objection to the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-14\">b. <em>Closing argument and the judge\u2019s instruction. </em>In closing, defense counsel argued that Ellen\u2019s testimony was not plausible, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>and that her decision to go to the defendant\u2019s house after his allegedly provocative statements belied her story of rape.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In response, the prosecutor pointed to the mother\u2019s testimony, specifically noting that Ellen \u201cwas desperate for friends, and because of that she mischaracterized people. Someone she only met would be her best friend. She over-trusted people as you heard from her mother. She over-trusted people, and at times they took advantage of her, and she was victimized.\u201d The prosecutor then explained that, although \u201cafter that phone conversation, most of us in her situation wouldn\u2019t have gone over there,\u201d Ellen did so only because she naively \u201cbelieved\u201d her \u201cfriend\u2019s\u201d promise \u201cthat nothing would happen to her.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The judge\u2019s instructions to the jury included a cautionary instruction that they not allow sympathy or prejudice to sway their decision. The judge emphasized that \u201ca verdict must come from the evidence and the evidence only. . . . From that source and that source only must come the verdict. There is no room for any kind of prejudice whether the prejudice is positive or negative, that is whether it is sympathy for someone in a case or whether it is antipathy or hostility toward someone in a case. There is no room whatsoever in our process for any kind of prejudice by reason of hostility or sympathy. . . . Remember that evidence ... is not the opening statements . . . [or] the closing statements of the attorneys.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>On appeal, the defendant argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>testimony of the victim\u2019s mother that the victim was overly trusting was inadmissible character evidence, and, even if admissible for some purpose, it could only have been admitted in the form of evidence of reputation and not through evidence of the mother\u2019s personal opinion. He further contends that the mother\u2019s testimony recounting specific prior instances illustrating the victim\u2019s overly trusting nature was inadmissible as evidence of propensity. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">a. <em>Standard of review. </em>At the outset, we note that the defendant did not properly preserve at trial the objections that he advances on appeal. When the prosecutor began the line of questioning at issue, the defendant objected that the evidence was not \u201cparticularly relevant.\u201d After the judge overruled the objection, the defendant requested a standing objection to this entire \u201cline of questioning the mother about Ellen\u2019s development and prior history.\u201d Rather than an objection to the testimony as impermissible evidence of character or propensity, the defendant\u2019s standing objection was based on relevancy alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">We have consistently interpreted Mass. R. Crim. P. 22, 378 Mass. 892 (1979), to preserve appellate rights only when an objection is made in a form or context that reveals the objection\u2019s basis. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>431 Mass. 30, 41 n.19 (2000) (\u201cRegarding the testimony of the Seattle detective, the issue was not properly preserved because the defendant objected ... on grounds other than the constitutional issue\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Houghtlin, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 691, 694-695 (1983) (\u201cOnly by means of ... <em>a more focused objection . . . </em>would the judge have been alerted to the substance of the particularized arguments now urged on appeal\u201d). Because the basis of the defendant\u2019s objection is not the argument made on appeal,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we review any error the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>made in admitting the evidence at issue for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">b. <em>The description of Ellen as overly trusting. </em>We begin with what the defendant terms the mother\u2019s \u201copinion testimony.\u201d It is correct that \u201c[a]s a general rule, evidence of a person\u2019s character is not admissible to prove that he acted in conformity with that character on a particular occasion.\u201d P.J. Liacos, M.S. Brodin, &amp; M. Avery, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 4.4.1, at 130 (7th ed. 1999). It is also correct that when character evidence is admissible (almost exclusively for some other purpose), it is usually restricted to reputation evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>378 Mass. 116, 129 (1979). We do not, however, consider the mother\u2019s testimony to constitute character evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">\u201cCharacter is a generalized description of one\u2019s disposition, or of one\u2019s disposition in respect to a general trait, such as honesty, temperance, or peacefulness.\u201d <em>Figueiredo </em>v. <em>Hamill, </em>385 Mass. 1003, 1004 (1982), quoting Advisory Committee Notes, Fed. R. Evid. 406. Our principal concern in admitting character evidence is that a person might not necessarily act in conformity with his or her character on a particular occasion. As such, evidence of a person\u2019s character might erroneously lead a jury to conclude a person acted in a particular way simply because his character suggests that he would.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shine, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 613, 614-615 (1988) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>(\u201cpossibility that the decedent had been an alcoholic had no relevance on the question whether he was in fact intoxicated at the time of the accident\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edgerly, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 562, 575 (1982) (no reversible error in admission of character evidence that victim \u201cbehaved well\u201d at a particular bar over one and one-half years).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">The mother\u2019s testimony that Ellen was too trusting was not a generalized description of her disposition. Instead, the testimony described a specific manifestation, over trusting, as an unfortunate but ever-present and inescapable part of Ellen\u2019s mental disorder. It is not a character trait, but a permanent condition.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Such evidence is \u201cnot what is generally referred to as character evidence . . . .\u201d <em>Libby </em>v. <em>State, </em>109 Nev. 905, 916 (1993), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 516 U.S. 1033 (1996) (upholding admission of evidence revealing mental and physical disabilities of victim). The mother\u2019s testimony that Ellen was trusting<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> is no more character evidence than the description of Ellen as having \u201climited intellectual capacity.\u201d Had Ellen been a victim of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, we would not consider testimony that she was forgetful or that she could not remember people as constituting character evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The mother\u2019s explanation that Ellen\u2019s disease resulted in her being overly trusting gave the jury a clear picture of who the victim was.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Our courts and the courts of other jurisdictions, have, at least implicitly, sanctioned testimony relating to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>mental and emotional outgrowths of a medical disorder. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rocha, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 550, 552 (2003) (reciting mother\u2019s description of \u201cvictim\u2019s cognitive and other limitations resulting from mental retardation,\u201d most notably that victim \u201ctrusted her family members, including the defendant [accused of rape], and displayed her affection by hugging them\u201d). Accord <em>B.O. </em>v. <em>C.O., </em>404 Pa. Super. 127, 134 (1991) (relying on evidence that \u201cC.O was a man of limited intelligence . . . known to be subject to the influence of others, and overly trusting\u201d). Similarly, we have upheld the admission of testimony regarding a person\u2019s mental or physical failings after or due to an accident without considering it to be character evidence. See, e.g., <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Hingham Steamboat Co., </em>109 Mass. 449, 451 (1872) (\u201cThe witness had the means of observing the plaintiff from time to time, and her testimony was as to facts within her observation and not a mere expression of opinion reached by a process of reasoning and deduction. She stated what she saw, that the plaintiff was not ... as well as she was two months after the accident\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">While it may be the case that evidence that falls close to the Une between inadmissible evidence of character and admissible evidence of the manifestations of a mental disorder could be offered or used for an improper purpose such as to evoke sympathy for a victim, we rely on a trial judge to exercise discretion in admitting only relevant evidence whose probative value is not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial or cumulative nature. The weighing of the prejudicial effect and probative value of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial judge, the exercise of which we will not overturn unless we find palpable error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valentin, </em>420 Mass. 263, 270 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>407 Mass. 798, 807 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">The question of consent in this case turned on which version of events the jury beheved \u2014 the one told by Ellen or the one told by Hoch and the defendant. As the judge\u2019s instructions estabhsh, plausibihty is one factor a jury may use in weighing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>credibility.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Here, evidence that Ellen\u2019s mental disorder caused her to be overly trusting certainly tended to make her story more plausible than it would have been without that evidence. If believed, it explained why Ellen would have gone to the defendant\u2019s residence with Hoch even after he told her that he wanted to have sex with her. The evidence both bolsters Ellen\u2019s credibility on the central issue in the case and counteracts the natural and clearly argued inference that Ellen\u2019s visit to the defendant\u2019s residence after this telephone call was an indicia of consent, and that Ellen went there specifically to have consensual sexual relations. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Poitras, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 691, 696 n.8 (2002) (complainant\u2019s reason for eventually reporting abuse relevant because \u201ccomplainant\u2019s credibility, which was central to the case, was challenged . . . by questions probing why she had not disclosed the abuse earlier . . . insinuating that she had disclosed it only when . . . \u2018stuck\u2019 in a group home\u201d). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Magraw, </em>426 Mass. 589, 594, 595 (1998) (\u201cmurder victim\u2019s state of mind becomes a material issue if the defendant opens the door by claiming . . . that the victim would voluntarily meet with or go someplace with the defendant... or that the defendant was on friendly terms with the victim\u201d; evidence to rebut defendant\u2019s claim that victim would have consented to be alone with him admitted as relevant). See <em>People </em>v. <em>Peeples, </em>155 Ill. 2d 422, 473, cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1016 (1993) (victim\u2019s trusting nature relevant to explain why she would let stranger into home).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">Of course, the focus of the inquiry in a consent case must be principally on the time of the act. In the circumstances of this case, the defendant\u2019s argument is in essence that Ellen\u2019s consent began with her agreement to come to the rooming house during the telephone conversation. Therefore, her reasons for going are neither tangential nor collateral to the issue of consent.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The judge acted well within his discretion when he determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>the evidence was relevant and not unduly prejudicial in the unusual circumstances of the case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See note <em>4, supra. </em>Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harbin, </em>435 Mass. 654, 656-657 (2002), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>434 Mass. 358, 368 (2001) (victim\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony admissible even though it evoked sympathy from jury because it explained \u201cvictim\u2019s presence in the crack house and . . . provide [d] \u2018family background information\u2019 \u2018to humanize the proceedings\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">c. <em>Prior incidents. </em>There was testimony concerning two instances where the mother observed her daughter being overly trusting of people she perceived to be her friends. In both instances, trusting those \u201cfriends\u201d led to Ellen\u2019s victimization. The defendant did not specifically object to this evidence beyond his standing objection to the entire line of questioning based on relevance.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The evidence was relevant. It provided examples of, and tended to corroborate the mother\u2019s testimony that, one of the manifestations of her daughter\u2019s mental disability was overtrusting people that she did not know well. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>manifestation, in turn, makes it more likely that Ellen trusted Hoch\u2019s alleged promise that she would protect her and bears on why Ellen would accompany Hoch to the defendant\u2019s residence if her testimony about what the defendant said to her during their telephone conversation was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Even if relevant, however, evidence of these prior incidents should not have been admitted if its probative value was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect. Our concern with the prejudice that might flow from the introduction of the details of incidents in which Ellen was taken advantage of is twofold. First, the jury might improperly use the evidence of the victim\u2019s prior victimization as evidence that it was likely that she had been victimized by the defendant. Second, the descriptions of these two prior events might lead the jury to convict the defendant based on sympathy for Ellen. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lodge, </em>431 Mass. 461, 471 (2000). As the Appeals Court properly noted, evidence like this \u201cmust be received with caution, and always tested against its probative value.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bonds, </em>63 Mass. App. Ct. 163, 170 (2005), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Filos, </em>420 Mass. 348, 357 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">We first note that the evidence of prior victimization was not entirely prejudicial in nature. As the Commonwealth argues, the fact that Ellen had been mistakenly trusting and compliant with people in the past might have led the jury to conclude that she consented to the sexual intercourse.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Additionally, as the defendant argued to the jury at trial, that Ellen had been previously victimized might have led the jury to believe she had learned to be less trusting. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, supra </em>at 369 (\u201cthat some of [a witness\u2019s] testimony actually aided the defendant\u2019s case \u2014 such as the fact that the defendant fought only verbally, and not physically with the victim . . . helped to reduce any alleged prejudice caused by the testimony\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">More importantly, as detailed above, the judge instructed the jury forcefully on the issue of prejudice and on the need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>confine their deliberations and decision to the evidence. The judge specifically noted that sympathy for one party should not play any role in the deliberative process. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>425 Mass. 830, 840 (1997) (general assumption that \u201cjury follow all instructions\u201d). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daley, </em>439 Mass. 558, 564-567 (2003) (risk of prejudice in prosecutor\u2019s closing argument remedied by judge\u2019s prompt instruction); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>423 Mass. 180, 187-188 &amp; n.6 (1996) (limiting instruction to jury diminishes potential prejudice of prior act evidence); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>378 Mass. 116, 127-128 (1979) (\u201cAlthough there are certain situations in which the prejudice to a criminal defendant is so great that limiting instructions cannot provide adequate protection . . . the situation described [here] is not one\u201d [citation omitted]). While the judge could have given a more pointed instruction, i.e., that evidence that Ellen had been victimized by others in the past was not relevant to and should not be considered as evidence that she had been victimized by the defendant, the defendant did not ask for such an instruction, and the instruction given was adequate to minimize the potential for prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Finally, the judge\u2019s decision to admit evidence of the prior incidents in the circumstances of this case did not amount to palpable error, although it may have approached the outer bounds of his discretion. In light of the properly admitted testimony of the mother regarding the manifestations of Ellen\u2019s mental disorder, the probative value of this additional evidence was slight and its prejudicial nature not so overwhelming. We cannot conclude that the judge erred in finding that the prejudicial nature of the evidence did not substantially outweigh its probative value. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>26 Mass App. Ct. 578, 582-583 (1988) (assuming relevance of recorded messages on which defendant used inflammatory and scurrilous words \u201cto be no more than borderline,\u201d judge did not abuse discretion in determining probative value of messages outweighed prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">d. <em>Closing argument. </em>The defendant asserts that the prosecutor stepped over the line when, in closing argument, he highlighted to the jury that the victim \u201cover trusted people\u201d and that, at times those people took advantage of her, and that \u201cshe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>was victimized.\u201d In context, it is clear that the thrust of the prosecutor\u2019s reference to Ellen\u2019s over trusting was a direct and proper response to the closing argument of defense counsel and provided an explanation why Ellen would travel to a residence to which \u201cmost of us\u201d would not have gone in the circumstances. However, the prosecutor\u2019s reference to Ellen\u2019s having been previously \u201cvictimized\u201d raised directly the specter that the jury would use that evidence for an improper purpose.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Assuming the prosecutor\u2019s argument went too far, the defendant neither objected nor asked for an instruction on this topic.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We thus review the prosecutor\u2019s closing to determine whether it created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>411 Mass. 120, 120-121 (1991). We are not persuaded that it did. The prosecutor made reference to Ellen\u2019s victimization just once and briefly \u2014 no more than defense counsel had. The thrust of the prosecutor\u2019s argument was the consistency of Ellen\u2019s story and the immediacy of her complaint, as contrasted with what he termed the \u201cbald faced\u201d lies of Hoch, and the substantial self-interest of the defendant. The judge\u2019s instructions that counsels\u2019 arguments are not evidence and should not be used to decide the case, and the jury should not allow sympathy for or hostility against a party to affect their decision, further mitigated any impropriety in the closing argument.

His credibility was impeached by his prior convictions of kidnapping, robbery, assault and battery, and larceny.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b841-10\">The defendant testified that Ellen never said \u201cstop\u201d and that the defendant did not throw Ellen on the bed or force himself on her.

During the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, he testified to the complaint made by Ellen.

At trial, Hoch denied ever speaking to the mother about the rape.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b843-9\">At the opening of this line of questioning, defense counsel objected, arguing that \u201cthe Commonwealth is going to great length to try to play on whatever limited intellectual capacity [Ellen] has in this case,\" which was not \u201cparticularly relevant.\u201d The Commonwealth countered that Ellen\u2019s \u201clow intellectual capacity\u201d is \u201ca central issue\u201d because it \u201cleft [Ellen] vulnerable to being manipulated by a friend which led to the sexual abuse by the defendant.\u201d The judge concluded that testimony about Ellen\u2019s \u201cacumen or alertness or street sense or basic intelligence\u201d was relevant principally because \u201cwe have the unusual circumstance in which the accused is alleged to have told the alleged victim over the phone what he was going to do if he had the opportunity [and] [s]he then proceeded to his apartment ostensibly in some reliance upon protection by her friend . . . .\u201d The judge did explain that he wanted questions in this area to be specific, rather than broad. Defense counsel asked that the judge recognize his \u201cstanding objection to all this line of questioning the mother about [Ellen\u2019s] development and prior history.\u201d The judge so recognized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b845-7\">Defense counsel explained that \u201cthere are things about [Ellen\u2019s] testimony . . . that don\u2019t hang together. . . .

Now the Commonwealth may allege that she just doesn\u2019t have the capacity to consent or know what she\u2019s doing or that . . . she would go over and see somebody if they said, \u2018I want to talk to you, come over here.\u2019 Well, she\u2019s at her house. Nobody has to take her out to go there. It sounds like the only things he has in his room [are] a refrigerator, a stove, a sink, and a TV. She\u2019s got all that at home. She can do all that stuff at home. Why go there in this particular case?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b845-8\">Defense counsel also referenced the mother\u2019s testimony in closing argument: \u201cAnd if [Ellen has] been victimized as her mother has said, she\u2019s also learned from those instances if someone gives you a hard time, get away.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b845-9\">The judge\u2019s instruction also covered suggestions regarding how to weigh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>the credibility of witnesses, noting that \u201cplausibility,\u201d \u201cthe naturalness or likelihood of a witness\u2019s version of events\u201d and whether the story seemed \u201cnatural or probable as a matter of life experience and common sense\u201d; and \u201cintelligence,\u201d \u201cthe intellect or common sense of a witness\u201d are two of the guideposts that can help a juror determine \u201cthe accuracy of the witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b846-8\">The defendant\u2019s standing objection as to relevance did not stop him from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>objecting to various aspects of the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of the mother on other grounds. For example, when the prosecutor asked whether Ellen\u2019s trusting people led to her being victimized, the defendant raised a successful objection. When the prosecutor asked the mother to describe incidents of which she was aware where Ellen was taken advantage of, the defendant successfully objected on hearsay grounds, but then did not object when the prosecutor asked the mother about similar incidents that she personally witnessed. When the prosecutor asked the mother whether \u201cit [would] be fair to characterize [Ellen] as lacking in the vernacular street smarts, the defendant successfully objected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b847-7\">But see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adjutant, </em>443 Mass. 649, 665 (2005) (favoring admission of evidence of past specific acts of violence initiated by victim when defendant claims self-defense and that victim was first aggressor).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b847-8\">While the principal purpose for the rule excluding character evidence is to bar \u201cthe use of character as circumstantial evidence,\u201d i.e., \u201ccharacter to prove conduct.\u201d 22 C.A.

For example, in <em>Proulx </em>v. <em>Basbanes, </em>354 Mass. 559, 562 (1968), this court accepted a husband\u2019s testimony that his wife was \u201cnervous\u201d for a period of two years without discussing such evidence as character evidence. Additionally, summary descriptions of a person\u2019s mental or emotional state \u2014 even over a prolonged period of time \u2014 do not necessarily constitute character evidence.
