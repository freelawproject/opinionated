Because the defendant failed to appear at the scheduled suppression hearing, a Superior Court judge found him in default and deemed the motion waived. After the defendant returned to court one year later and his default was removed, he filed a motion to reinstate his motion to suppress. That motion was denied. The defendant petitioned a single justice of this court for relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, seeking reinstatement of the motion to suppress. The single justice reserved and reported the matter to the full court, describing the petition as presenting the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-14\">\u201c1.) Does the defendant\u2019s unexcused absence at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>scheduled motion to suppress hearing of which he/she has notice constitute an automatic waiver of the motion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">\u201c2.) If the answer to no. 1 is \u2018no,\u2019 does the judge have discretion to treat the unexcused absence as a waiver? If so, what are the criteria on which the judge should base the decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">\u201c3.) Did the judge act within his discretion in determining that the defendant had waived his motion in this case?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">We conclude that the answer to the first question is no: there is no automatic waiver of the suppression motion in these circumstances. The answer to the second question, however, is a qualified yes: by his unexcused absence from the scheduled suppression hearing, the defendant may waive his right to be present at the hearing, but his absence does not waive the motion itself. Consequently, we hold that the judge erred in determining that the defendant\u2019s failure to appear at the suppression hearing constituted a waiver of the motion; however, it would have been within the judge\u2019s discretion to find that the defendant had waived his right to be present at the suppression hearing and to conduct the hearing without him.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the allegations made in the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and supporting memoranda. On April 14, 2001, detectives with the Brockton police department went to a Holiday Inn in Brockton to execute an arrest warrant for Tremmel S. Jackson, also known as David Simpson. Hotel records indicated that a David Simpson had rented two rooms. When the police knocked on the door of one of these rooms, the defendant answered. The officers searched the room, and after failing to locate David Simpson, they escorted the defendant to the room next door and questioned him about Simpson\u2019s whereabouts. During this time, one of the detectives found a bag of cocaine in a pair of pants in the first room. The defendant later was arrested and indicted for trafficking in cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">On June 11, 2002, the defendant filed a motion to suppress the physical evidence seized during the search and any statements he made to the police, claiming that the arrest warrant was not valid because (1) it was not signed; (2) the police ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>ceeded the permissible scope of the arrest warrant in their search of the defendant\u2019s hotel room; and (3) police questioning of the defendant was not permissible as field interrogation and observation. The hearing on this motion was continued by agreement on several occasions. On March 27, 2003, the defendant appeared in court, prepared to proceed with the motion, but the hearing was continued until May 14, 2003, at the Commonwealth\u2019s request. On that date, however, the defendant failed to appear.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The motion judge found the defendant in default and, over defense counsel\u2019s objection, held that the defendant had waived his right to a hearing on the motion by his absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">More than one year later, the defendant was apprehended and returned to court. Defense counsel filed a motion to reinstate the suppression motion, alleging only that the defendant had a viable motion to suppress. The motion to reinstate was denied. The record does not indicate whether the motion to reinstate was supported by an affidavit setting forth an explanation for the defendant\u2019s absence. The defendant then sought relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, arguing that the Superior Court judge had abused his discretion in failing to reinstate the motion to suppress because the defendant\u2019s default did not prejudice the Commonwealth and because the motion raised significant constitutional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Waiver of right to suppression hearing. </em>The defendant argues that his failure to appear at the suppression hearing could not constitute an automatic waiver of the motion, but he concedes that the judge would have the discretion to deem the motion waived by his absence. The defendant\u2019s primary contention is that, based on the strength of the constitutional claims for suppression, the judge in this case abused his discretion by deeming the motion waived. The Commonwealth agrees that an unexcused absence does not constitute an automatic waiver of a suppression motion and that such waiver would be discretionary. The Commonwealth claims that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>the judge acted within his discretion in ruling that, by failing to appear, the defendant waived his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">Two distinct issues of waiver are implicated by the defendant\u2019s failure to appear at the scheduled suppression hearing: (1) waiver of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and (2) waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to be present at the hearing on the motion. Thus, in resolving the questions reserved and reported by the single justice, each of these issues of waiver must be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Neither the defendant nor the Commonwealth contends that the defendant\u2019s failure to appear at the scheduled suppression hearing is an automatic waiver of the motion. They cite no authority that precisely addresses this question, and we have found no such authority. Although this court has held that a defendant may automatically waive certain constitutional or procedural rights by failing to appear, such waiver has been recognized only in limited situations, typically regarding appellate rights. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>374 Mass. 750, 757-758 (1978) (defendant, who appealed to Superior Court for trial de nova after conviction in District Court, waived right to jury trial by failing to appear on scheduled trial date by operation of former G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 24); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rezendes, </em>353 Mass. 228, 228-229 (1967) (defendant, who \u201cleft the Commonwealth\u201d after filing appeal, waived appellate rights not permitted to \u201cfugitive from justice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Both parties rely on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McVicker, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 713 (1985), for the proposition that a judge has discretion to deem a motion to suppress waived by the defendant\u2019s absence from the hearing. See <em>id. </em>at 717 (\u201ca defendant may by his conduct waive or forfeit a motion filed for his benefit\u201d). In that case the defendant sought a jury trial after conviction by a judge of the Boston Municipal Court under the former \u201ctrial de nova\u201d system.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 713. He filed a motion to suppress evidence at the jury trial but failed to appear at the scheduled hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 714. The Appeals Court held that absence from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>the suppression hearing was not a \u201csolid default\u201d that would waive the right to a jury trial under the de nova system; rather, the court concluded that the defendant\u2019s absence from the hearing allowed the judge to determine that the motion to suppress had been waived, and schedule the case for trial. <em>Id. </em>at 716-717.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Although the <em>McVicker </em>case did involve the waiver of a motion to suppress by the defendant\u2019s absence, we do not find that case controlling here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <em>McVicker </em>case involved a statutory scheme that expressly authorized the waiver of the right to trial if a defendant failed to appear. See <em>id. </em>at 715-716. Implicitly, under such a two-tiered system, a judge also could determine that a defendant had waived the right to present a pretrial motion by failing to appear at its scheduled hearing. Under our current one-trial system, however, even a \u201csolid default\u201d at a scheduled trial date does not constitute a waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial. Cf. Mass. R. Crim. P. 18 (a) (1), 378 Mass. 887 (1979) (defendant may waive right to be present at trial \u2014 not right to trial itself \u2014 by voluntary absence after trial begins); Mass. R. Crim. P. 19 (a), 378 Mass. 888 (1979) (defendant must waive right to jury trial in writing and with judge\u2019s approval).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">We have found no other statutes or appellate cases that give a judge discretion to find a suppression motion waived by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>defendant\u2019s absence. In fact, the few State appellate courts that have confronted this issue have concluded that a defendant\u2019s failure to appear at a suppression hearing does <em>not </em>constitute a waiver of the motion to suppress. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Dashner, </em>77 P.3d 787, 791 (Colo. Ct. App. 2003) (defendant\u2019s absence from suppression hearing \u201cdoes not empower the trial court to refuse to hold a hearing on the motion or address the issues on the merits\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Canty, </em>278 N.J. Super. 80, 84 (1994) (when defendant fails to appear at suppression hearing, \u201cthe court may either postpone the hearing ... or proceed <em>in absentia. </em>The court should not dismiss the motion with prejudice\u201d); <em>People </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>143 A.D.2d 1066, 1067 (N.Y. 1988) (\u201calthough a defendant may waive or forfeit his right to be present he does not as a consequence of his actions waive his right to a hearing\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Desirey, </em>99 Or. App. 283, 285 (1989) (when defendant failed to appear at scheduled suppression hearing, \u201c[t]he court could have decided the motion in defendant\u2019s absence, but it did not have the authority to refuse to consider it\u201d). We reserve judgment on whether waiver of the motion ever could occur based on a defendant\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">b. <em>Waiver of right to presence. A </em>separate issue from waiver of the suppression motion itself is whether the defendant\u2019s failure to appear at the hearing constituted a waiver of his right to be present. Rule 18 (a) provides that criminal defendants shall have the right to be present \u201cat all critical stages\u201d of court proceedings. This right to be present derives from the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>L\u2019Abbe, </em>421 Mass. 262, 268 (1995), and cases cited. Rule 18 does not define which court proceedings are critical, leaving the issue to judicial determination, but commentary to the rule explains that \u201cfairness demands that the defendant be present when his substantial rights are at stake.\u201d Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Crim. P. 18 (a), Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, Rules of Criminal Procedure, at 1429 (Lexis 2005). Suppression hearings, which typically involve important issues and require the taking of evidence, thus would seem to constitute a critical stage at which the defendant has the right to be present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>under rule 18 (a). See K.B. Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1607 (2d ed. 1983 &amp; Supp. 2005). Cf. Mass. R. Crim. P. 18 (a) (3) (defendant need not be present at any proceeding where evidence is not to be taken).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Although it is not a settled question of law, a number of appellate courts have concluded that a hearing on a motion to suppress evidence does constitute a critical stage of the proceedings. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Green, </em>670 F.2d 1148, 1154 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (\u201csuppression hearing is a critical stage of the prosecution which affects substantial rights of an accused person; the outcome of the hearing . . . may often determine the eventual outcome of conviction or acquittal\u201d); <em>Olney </em>v. <em>United States, </em>433 F.2d 161, 163 (9th Cir. 1970) (hearing on motion to suppress is critical stage, \u201cparticularly in narcotics cases, where the crucial issue may well be the admissibility of narcotics allegedly found in the possession of the defendant\u201d); <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>16 N.Y.2d 282, 287-288 (1965) (suppression hearing is \u201ccrucial step\u201d in criminal prosecution because facts of search are established and its legality determined, which often determines ultimate question of guilt). Contrast <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>345 F.3d 416, 422-424 (6th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">We are satisfied that, because the suppression hearing in this case would have required the taking of evidence and also involved the admissibility of substantial evidence that could determine the outcome of the case, the defendant was entitled, under rule 18 (a), to be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">However, a defendant may waive the right to be present at critical stages of the proceedings, \u201cby consent or at times even by misconduct.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flemmi, </em>360 Mass. 693, 694 (1971), quoting <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>291 U.S. 97, 106 (1934). Other jurisdictions that recognize a defendant\u2019s right to be present at a suppression hearing have held that the defendant\u2019s voluntary absence from that hearing can function as a waiver of the right to be present. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dalli, </em>424 F.2d 45, 48 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 821 (1970) (\u201cAlthough a defendant has a right to be present at a suppression hearing where testimony is to be taken . . . this right is not absolute and may be relinquished by acts or statements of the defendant which constitute a voluntary waiver\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>[citations omitted]); <em>People </em>v. <em>Stubbs, </em>25 Ill. App. 3d 181, 186 (1974) (defendant \u201cignored his right to be present\u201d at suppression hearing \u201cby virtue of his voluntary absence\u201d). These courts have concluded that, when the defendant waives the right to be present by failing to appear at the suppression hearing, the judge may proceed with the hearing in the defendant\u2019s absence. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dalli, supra </em>(no error by judge in conducting and deciding suppression hearing in defendant\u2019s absence); <em>People </em>v. <em>Stubbs, supra </em>(same).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Waiver of the right to be present by a defendant\u2019s voluntary absence from a suppression hearing is somewhat analogous to a form of waiver long recognized in the Commonwealth: a defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to be present at trial by voluntary absence after the trial has begun.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>223 U.S. 442, 455 (1912); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flemmi, supra </em>at 694; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>163 Mass. 458, 459 (1895). If a defendant fails to appear for trial in these circumstances, the judge may elect to continue with the trial in the defendant\u2019s absence. <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>United States, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flemmi, supra; </em>Mass. R. Crim. P. 18 (a) (1) (\u201cIf a defendant is present at the beginning of a trial and thereafter absents himself without cause or without leave of court, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>may proceed to a conclusion in all respects except the imposition of sentence as though the defendant were still present\u201d). Waiver of the right to be present at trial is not, however, automatic. Both the determination that the defendant\u2019s failure to appear constitutes a waiver of the right to be present as well as the decision to proceed with the trial without the defendant are within the discretion of the trial judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flemmi, supra </em>at 694 (if defendant is voluntarily absent after trial begins, \u201cthe court may proceed without the defendant\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Muckle, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 631, 639 (2003) (\u201cWhen a defendant fails to appear midtrial, the judge is to determine whether the trial should proceed in the defendant\u2019s absence or whether a mistrial should be declared\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Because a judge may find waiver of the right to be present when a defendant absents himself from trial, we hold that it is similarly within the discretion of a judge to find that a defendant has waived the right to be present by fading to appear at a suppression hearing. The defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to be present at the hearing, however, does not imply waiver of other constitutional rights, including the right to the suppression hearing itself and the right to effective assistance of counsel at that hearing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 24, 32 (2003) (\u201cAlthough the defendant voluntarily absented herself, thereby waiving her right to be present at trial and to confront witnesses against her, she did not expressly waive her separate constitutional right to be represented by counsel and to receive effective assistance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">There are a number of factors for the judge to consider in determining whether a defendant has waived the right to be present at a suppression hearing. First, it is critical that the defendant had adequate notice of the time and date of the scheduled suppression hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dalli, supra </em>at 48; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stubbs, supra </em>at 186. The judge also should consider the reason for the defendant\u2019s absence, if known. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flemmi, supra </em>at 694-695 &amp; n.1; Mass. R. Crim. P. 18 (a) (1). Other criteria that may be considered include possible prejudice to the Commonwealth if the hearing does not proceed as scheduled; impact on witnesses or codefendants who are present and ready to go forward with the hearing; and whether the defendant is represented by counsel who can proceed on the defendant\u2019s behalf in a meaningful way. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pastor, </em>557 F.2d 930, 934 (2d Cir. 1977) (deciding whether to proceed with trial in defendant\u2019s absence, judge should consider \u201cthe additional burdens, waste and expense inflicted upon the court, government, witnesses, and co-defendants\u201d); <em>People </em>v. <em>Stubbs, supra </em>(no error in proceeding with suppression motion without defendant where defendant \u201cwas represented by counsel who had adequate opportunity\u201d to cross-examine witnesses).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">If a defendant does not appear at a scheduled hearing on a motion to suppress, the judge should conduct a hearing to determine whether the defendant\u2019s absence is voluntary, making a reasonable inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s failure to appear.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Muckle, supra </em>at 639-640. This investigation could include police inquiries into the defendant\u2019s whereabouts; telephone calls to the defendant\u2019s home, work, and family members; contact with nearby hospitals that may have treated the defendant in an emergency; and a review of any recent attempts to contact defense counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 639 n.9. If the investigation yields no satisfactory explanation for the defendant\u2019s failure to appear, then the judge may make findings that the defendant\u2019s absence is without cause and voluntary, and proceed with the suppression hearing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">If good cause does exist for the defendant\u2019s absence, then the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>defendant has not waived the right to be present at the hearing by failing to appear. Thus, if the judge proceeds with the suppression hearing without the defendant, it may be necessary to hold another suppression hearing if it is later determined that the defendant in fact had good cause to be absent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 129, 135 n.5 (1984) (when trial conducted in absentia, defendant may seek new trial if further information reveals absence was involuntary).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>In sum, we conclude that a defendant\u2019s voluntary absence from a scheduled suppression hearing, like a defendant\u2019s failure to appear after trial has commenced, may constitute waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to be present at that hearing. This does not, however, constitute waiver of any other rights the defendant may have, including the right to the hearing itself. Thus, we answer the reported questions as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"ADt\">The answer to question 1 is, \u201cNo. There is no automatic waiver of the motion to suppress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The answer to question 2 is, \u201cA qualified yes. Under our rules, a judge does not have the discretion to deem a defendant\u2019s unexcused absence to be a waiver of the motion to suppress, but a judge does have discretion to treat an unexcused absence as a waiver of the defendant\u2019s right to be present at the hearing under Mass. R. Crim. P. 18, based on the criteria set forth above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The answer to question 3 is, \u201cNo. The trial judge erred in finding that the defendant\u2019s absence from the hearing on the motion to suppress constituted an outright waiver of the motion.\u201d The case is remanded to the single justice to enter an order vacating the order of the trial judge waiving the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence and remanding the case to the Superior Court for a hearing on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-7\">he record does not provide a clear explanation for the defendant\u2019s absence from the May 14, 2003, suppression hearing.

App. Ct. 713 (1985), was decided, Massachusetts employed a two-tiered trial system in the District Court and Boston Municipal Court Departments: a criminal defendant could have a trial before a judge in the first instance, then elect to have a trial de nova before a jury if convicted. See G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 26A, inserted by St. 1978, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>c. 478, \u00a7 188; G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 27A, as appearing in St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 189. See also <em>Lydon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>381 Mass. 356, 358-359, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1065 (1980) (describing statutory scheme). By defaulting at the de nova trial, however, the defendant waived the right to that trial, and the original conviction would be reinstated and sentence imposed. G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 24, repealed by St. 1992, c. 379, \u00a7 196. Although the United States Supreme Court found the Massachusetts two-tier system to be constitutional, see <em>Justices of the Boston Mun. Court </em>v. <em>Lydon, </em>466 U.S. 294 (1984); <em>Ludwig </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>427 U.S. 618 (1976), Massachusetts abolished the de nova jury trial system by statute in 1992. See St. 1992, c. 379, \u00a7\u00a7 139, 141.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b302-7\">In a later case, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Espinoza, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 65, 69 (1989), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McVicker, supra </em>at 716-717, the Appeals Court said in dicta that \u201cfailure to show up for a hearing on a motion to suppress, made for the defendant\u2019s benefit, . . . works a waiver of the motion by the defendant.\u201d The <em>Espinoza </em>case involved a defendant\u2019s failure to appear at a scheduled trial under the trial de nova system. See <em>id. </em>at 66-68. We interpret the <em>Espinoza </em>language cited above as a restatement of the <em>McVicker </em>holding that, in the circumstances of that case, waiver of the suppression motion was within the judge\u2019s discretion, and we find the <em>Espinoza </em>case inapplicable to this case for the reasons discussed above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Historically, a criminal trial could not begin in the defendant\u2019s absence. See <em>Crosby </em>v. <em>United States, </em>506 U.S. 255, 259-262 (1993). This long-standing practice is embodied in both Mass. R. Crim. P. 18 (a) (1), 378 Mass. 887 (1979), and Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(c)(1)(A) (defendant \u201cwho was initially present at trial\u201d waives right to be present \u201cwhen the defendant is voluntarily absent after the trial has begun\u201d). In the <em>Crosby </em>case, the United States Supreme Court held that it was impermissible to begin a trial without the defendant in Federal court, but the Court reached its conclusion based only on Fed. R. Crim. P. 43: it expressly did not reach the appellant\u2019s constitutional claims. <em>Id. </em>at 263. At least one circuit court of the United States Court of Appeals has held that the United States Constitution does not prohibit the commencement of trial without the defendant, provided the defendant knowingly and voluntarily has waived the right to be present. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>173 F.3d 73, 76 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 884 (1999). There is no historical precedent requiring the defendant\u2019s presence at the beginning of a pretrial hearing on a motion to suppress evidence; pretrial suppression hearings themselves have been conducted with regularity for less than one-half century. See <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643 (1961). There is no requirement in rule 18 (a) that a defendant be present at the beginning of the suppression hearing before he can waive his right to be present, and we see no reason to impose such a requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The defendant need not have knowledge of the specific consequences of failing to appear at the suppression hearing. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>United States, </em>414 U.S. 17, 19-20 (1973) (defendant need not have been warned that trial would proceed in his absence; voluntary absence from trial could be construed as effective waiver of right to be present). See also K.B. Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 <em>1621 </em>(2d ed. 1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b307-7\">It is impossible to determine all possible circumstances that could constitute good cause for the defendant\u2019s absence from the hearing; therefore, this determination must be left to the sound discretion of the judge. For cases discussing what may constitute voluntary absence, see 5 W.R. LaFave, J.H. Israel, &amp; N.J. King, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 24.2(d) n.52 (1999 &amp; Supp. 2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b307-12\">Although the judge did not conduct such a hearing in this case, it appears that he would have been well within his discretion in proceeding without the defendant. The information presented in the defendant\u2019s motion to reinstate offers no explanation for the defendant\u2019s failure to appear at the suppression hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
