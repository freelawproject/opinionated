The petitioner is the stepfather of an eleven year old child (whom we shall refer to by the pseudonym Sharlene) who was admitted to Bay-state Medical Center (Baystate) on September 11, 2005, with critical injuries. As a result of her injuries, Sharlene remains in an irreversible vegetative state. On September 13, the Department of Social Services (department) filed a care and protection petition, pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24, and received custody of Sharlene. Counsel and a guardian ad litem (GAL) were appointed for Sharlene. On September 22, Sharlene\u2019s adoptive mother, and only legal guardian, died. On September 26, a judge in the Juvenile Court denied a motion filed by the petitioner (who has been criminally charged with assault and battery on Sharlene<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>) to be declared the child\u2019s de facto parent. On October 5, after a closed evidentiary hearing, which the petitioner\u2019s counsel attended, but in which he was not allowed to participate, a judge allowed an emergency motion filed jointly by the department and Sharlene\u2019s counsel (joint emergency motion), requesting an order that the child\u2019s health care providers withdraw all life support measures currently in place and make no attempt to resuscitate her on the occurrence of cardiac or respiratory arrest (DNR order). The judge further ordered that his written decision allowing the joint emergency motion be impounded and released only to the department, Baystate, Sharlene\u2019s counsel, and Sharlene\u2019s GAL. The petitioner challenged the impoundment order and, after an evidentiary hearing on October 17, the judge modified that order to provide that his decision be made available only to persons connected with the case, including the petitioner, but not to the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">In a petition filed pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, the petitioner challenges the denial of his motion for de facto parental status <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>and seeks a new hearing on the joint emergency motion, in which he, as Sharlene\u2019s de facto parent, has a voice. He also argues that the public should be allowed access to all proceedings (except for a new hearing, should one be ordered by this court) and all relevant documents in this case. We have carefully examined the record and the GAL report (which we requested and received from the Juvenile Court) and have ordered and listened to recordings of the hearings that took place. For reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the denial of the petitioner\u2019s motion to be declared Sharlene\u2019s de facto parent and conclude that the petitioner properly was excluded from participation in the hearing on the emergency joint motion. As to the public access issue raised in the petition, we seriously question whether someone in the petitioner\u2019s position has standing to assert such a claim on behalf of the public. We nevertheless consider, and reject, the claim and affirm the judge\u2019s order that the documents relevant to this case should not be used for further publication without a specific order by the judge. We also have before us the order to withdraw life support currently in place for Sharlene and to refrain from resuscitation. We affirm that order as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">We will begin by summarizing the relevant facts of Sharlene\u2019s fife. We then will describe, in some detail, the procedural history of this case. Finally, we will address the substantive issues raised by the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Sharlene was born on February 24, 1994. Her biological mother was sixteen years old and not married to Sharlene\u2019s biological father.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When Sharlene was four years of age, she was sent to live with her aunt (who would later become her adoptive mother). That same year, based on a determination that Sharlene had been sexually abused by her biological mother\u2019s boy friend, the department sought and received custody of Sharlene, but allowed Sharlene to remain in her aunt\u2019s home as a foster child. The petitioner began living in the home in February, 2000, and married Sharlene\u2019s aunt in September, 2001. In October, 2001, Sharlene was adopted by her aunt (hereinafter, adoptive mother) as a single parent.</p>\n<p id=\"pAAd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>The GAL report, which was submitted to the judge in connection with the joint emergency motion, contains a considerable amount of information dealing with developmental and social difficulties with which Sharlene struggled throughout her young life. This information appears to have been gathered from the department\u2019s reports, the authenticity of which was never established. We therefore omit the information for purposes of this opinion. The GAL report did disclose that multiple reports have been filed with the department, pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51 A, involving Sharlene and her two siblings,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> since January, 2001. The GAL report set forth the following chronological history of child abuse reports and investigations involving Sharlene alone:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-5\">\u201c9/27/02 Child Abuse/Neglect Report.

Supported. Reasonable cause to believe that a condition of physical abuse and neglect exists. [Sharlene] sustained serious life threatening injuries which were the result of trauma.\u201d6</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-12\">The final allegation of child abuse was filed on behalf of Sharlene on September 11, 2005. On that day, Sharlene was brought in a comatose state to a hospital in Westfield with multiple bmises all over her body in different stages of healing, \u201ccrusted areas\u201d on her chest, a fractured nose, and multiple old fractures, also all over her body. She was transported to nearby</p>\n<p id=\"b779-13\">6In spite of receiving a total of fifteen G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51 A, reports over a period of three years, all alleging that Sharlene was an abused or neglected child, it was not until the last report was filed that allegations of abuse were determined to be supported. That determination came too late to protect Sharlene. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Baystate, and there was diagnosed with a severe traumatic brain injury, manifested clinically by fixed and dilated pupils, complete unresponsiveness, and a body temperature of eighty-five degrees. A CT scan of Sharlene\u2019s brain revealed a right-sided subdural hematoma and a magnetic resonance image (MRI) revealed hemorrhagic contusion of the brain stem and shear injury of the brain, including the corpos callosum (high force injury). Sharlene was intubated and placed on a respirator for breathing and a feeding tube was inserted into her nose. She has been in a vegetative state and on life support since that time. It was the opinion of one of Sharlene\u2019s physicians that her injuries could not have been self-inflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">On September 13, the department named the petitioner and Sharlene\u2019s adoptive mother in the care and protection petition referred to above,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, as has been stated, counsel for Sharlene and a GAL were appointed. The department received temporary custody of Sharlene at that time. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24. On September 19, the department and Sharlene\u2019s counsel filed the joint emergency motion requesting the DNR order that has been described above. The joint emergency motion also requested the judge to expand the role of Sharlene\u2019s GAL to focus on evaluating whether the requested DNR order should issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Sharlene\u2019s adoptive mother and the petitioner were arraigned in the Westfield Division of the District Court Department on charges relating to injuries that Sharlene allegedly sustained at their hands. The mother was released on bail on September 22, and died later that day, apparently, as the result of a murder- \u2022 suicide or double suicide.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">On September 26, the petitioner filed a motion requesting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>be declared Sharlene\u2019s \u201cde facto\u201d parent.* <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That day, the judge held a hearing on the motion at which he considered the arguments of the petitioner and the department. Through counsel, the petitioner described his relationship with Sharlene during the four years in which he had lived in the home. The petitioner proffered that he had supported her financially, had attended her dance recitals, had taught her how to perform minor repair jobs around the house, and generally took an interest in her welfare. He stated that Sharlene had no other father figure during the four years he lived in the house, and pointed out that, to her friends, Sharlene referred to him as \u201cher father, her dad.\u201d The petitioner conceded that he did not perform a majority of Sharlene\u2019s parenting functions, but insisted, essentially, that he did the best that he could. When questioned by the judge as to whether he would testify to his knowledge of Sharlene\u2019s injuries and the manner in which they were inflicted, the petitioner informed the judge that he would assert his privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">In opposition to the petitioner\u2019s motion, the department argued that, in the four years that the petitioner had lived in the home, the department had interviewed him only once as part of a home visit, because he was not \u201cavailable.\u201d Sharlene\u2019s counsel further attested that, by his own statements to police, when the petitioner left home in the afternoon of September 10 (the day before Sharlene was brought to the hospital), he was aware that the child had been injured and was throwing up. He, nonetheless, told the police that he took no steps to check on Sharlene\u2019s condition until the following afternoon. Sharlene\u2019s counsel argued to the judge, \u201c[Tjhat is not a parent, under any circumstances.\u201d She also pointed out that Sharlene had old, as well as recent, severe injuries that occurred while the petitioner lived in the house, and \u201cthroughout that time, [the petitioner] had to be aware of those and had to have some knowledge of what was going on in the house. And if in fact he was acting as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>a de facto parent, he was either participating in the infliction of those injuries or totally ignoring the fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The judge concluded that, based on the good faith offers of proof before him, the petitioner had not demonstrated that he is Sharlene\u2019s de facto parent.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Crediting all of the petitioner\u2019s proffered evidence, the judge found that the petitioner did not provide a majority of the caretaking functions of the child. The judge drew a negative inference from the petitioner\u2019s assertion that he would not testify at an evidentiary hearing as to Sharlene\u2019s injuries. The judge further concluded that, because the petitioner is not the legal, adoptive, putative, or de facto father of Sharlene, he would not be allowed to participate as a party in the hearing on the joint emergency motion. As a \u201ccourtesy\u201d the judge stated he would allow the petitioner\u2019s counsel, and counsel for Sharlene\u2019s siblings, to be present at the hearing but not to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">On September 30, an evidentiary hearing took place at Bay-state in which the judge considered the joint emergency motion requesting a DNR order for Sharlene.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The judge heard testimony from two of Sharlene\u2019s physicians at Baystate, one of Sharlene\u2019s nurses at Baystate, Sharlene\u2019s department social worker, and Sharlene\u2019s GAL. He also considered Sharlene\u2019s medical record from Baystate and a report filed that day by her GAL, which documented background information on Sharlene\u2019s fife, but focused primarily on what should be done for Sharlene at this time.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As has been indicated, the petitioner\u2019s counsel was allowed to attend, but not participate in, this hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">One physician, the director of Baystate\u2019s pediatric intensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>care unit (PICU), testified that Sharlene suffered from a \u201cshear\u201d injury to her brain stem that caused a disruption of nerve fibers in that portion of her brain and resulted in irreparable brain damage. He testified that, after Sharlene\u2019s admission to Bay-state, her intracranial pressure increased due to a stroke of the entire right side, and most of the left side, of her brain. He further testified that Sharlene is in an irreversible coma. The physician explained that, when an injury occurs to the upper brain there are other parts of the upper brain that may be able to take over the function in time. With an injury to a brain stem, however, there is no chance of recovering cognitive or sensate functioning. The physician testified that, \u201cshort of developing the technique for a complete brain transplant, there is no hope that medical treatment will be discovered in the foreseeable future which could reverse [Sharlene\u2019s] condition.\u201d Sharlene\u2019s treating physician, the associate director of Baystate\u2019s PICU, testified that Sharlene\u2019s brain is operating at a primitive level, and that the child cannot see, hear, feel, or respond.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Both physicians supported the issuance of an order that Sharlene not be resuscitated on the occurrence of cardiac or respiratory failure. With respect to the withdrawal of her life support, however, their opinions differed. Sharlene\u2019s treating physician recommended both the removal of the ventilator and her feeding tube. The director of the PICU, on the other hand, recommended removal of the ventilator only and expressed opposition to the removal of her feeding tube. The physicians agreed that, with the feeding tube, Sharlene\u2019s death would likely occur anytime from several weeks up to two months. Without the feeding tube, Sharlene\u2019s death would likely occur in a substantially shorter period of time. The director of the PICU testified that the removal of life support in this case would not be contrary to prevailing medical ethics.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">On October 5, the judge entered a written decision, in which he made findings of fact and concluded that \u201c [Sharlene\u2019s] dignity and quality of life would be most respected by withdrawing both the ventilator and the feeding tube along with the issu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>anee of a [DNR] order, with great sadness I so issue this day.\u201d The judge also ordered that his written decision not be released to anyone except Sharlene\u2019s counsel, her GAL, the department, and Baystate.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The petitioner filed a petition for relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, seeking access to the impounded decision. In response to an order of a single justice of this court, the judge held an evidentiary hearing, on October 17, concerning his impoundment order. At the hearing, the petitioner argued that the order should be vacated in its entirety and that all of the proceedings and court records concerning Sharlene be opened to the general public. The judge decided to modify the order to permit counsel for the petitioner to view the October 5, 2005, findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order allowing the DNR and withdrawal of life support. The department and Sharlene\u2019s counsel assented to the judge\u2019s proposal, and the order was so modified. The judge made written findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the modification of his October 5 impoundment order and ordered that the petitioner be provided a copy of his written findings and order allowing the joint motion for a DNR and withdrawal of support order. The judge made clear, however, that the written decision was \u201cnot to be used for further publication without specific order of this court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">1. We address first the petitioner\u2019s assertion that he is Sharlene\u2019s \u201cde facto\u201d parent. This court expressly adopted the concept of \u201cde facto\u201d parenthood in <em>E.N.O. </em>v. <em>L.M.M., </em>429 Mass. 824, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1005 (1999). In that case, we defined a \u201cde facto parent\u201d as \u201cone who has no biological relation to the child, but has participated in the child\u2019s life as a member of the child\u2019s family. The de facto parent resides with the child and, with the consent and encouragement of the legal parent, performs a share of caretaking functions at least as great as the legal parent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 829, citing <em>Youmans </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>429 Mass. <em>11 A, </em>776 &amp; n.3 (1999), and ALI Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution \u00a7 2.03 (1) (b) (Tent. Draft No. 3 Part 1 1998). In <em>Blixt </em>v. <em>Blixt, </em>437 Mass. 649 (2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1189 (2003), we noted (without adopting) further refinements to the concept \u2014 that a de facto parent must live with the child for not less than two years and that the caretak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>ing relationship have been established \u201cfor reasons primarily other than financial compensation, and with the agreement of a legal parent to form a parent-child relationship, or as a result of a complete failure or inability of any legal parent to perform caretaking functions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659 n.15, quoting ALI Principles of the Law of Family Dissolution \u00a7 2.03(c) (Tent. Draft No. 4 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">Our cases, and those of the Appeals Court, addressing the concept have focused exclusively on the existence of a significant preexisting relationship that would allow an inference, when evaluating a child\u2019s best interests, that measurable harm would befall the child on the disruption of that relationship. See, e.g., <em>T.F. </em>v. <em>B.L., </em>442 Mass. 522, 533 (2004); <em>Blixt </em>v. <em>Blixt, supra </em>at 659; <em>E.N.O. </em>v. <em>L.M.M., </em>supra; <em>Youmans </em>v. <em>Ramos, su</em>pra; <em>Dearborn </em>v. <em>Deausault, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 234, 238 (2004); <em>Sayre </em>v. <em>Aisner, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 794, 800-801 (2001). See also <em>Eccleston </em>v. <em>Bankosky, </em>438 Mass. 428, 439 n.17 (2003) (declining to consider whether \u201cde facto\u201d parent may be held financially responsible for child). The standard established by these cases presumes that the bond between a child and a de facto parent will be, above all, loving and nurturing.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">We agree with the judge that the petitioner has not established that he is Sharlene\u2019s de facto parent. Beyond his unsupported statement in his brief that \u201c[h]e felt in his heart that he was her father and she felt that way toward him,\u201d the petitioner has proffered no evidence that would allow a conclusion that his participation in Sharlene\u2019s life was of a loving or nurturing nature, or even that it was beneficial to the child. See <em>C.O. </em>v. <em>M.M., </em>442 Mass. 648, 654-656 (2004) (in civil adversary proceedings, burden on moving party to establish facts by preponderance of evidence). We reject the petitioner\u2019s claim that the judge erred in drawing a negative inference from the petitioner\u2019s intention to invoke his right not to testify with respect to his knowledge of the manner in which Sharlene\u2019s injuries were inflicted. The judge acted well within his authority in drawing the inference. The privilege against self-incrimination applicable in criminal proceedings is not applicable to child custody proceedings. See <em>Custody of Two Minors, </em>396 Mass. 610, 616 (1986). See also <em>Shafnacker </em>v. <em>Raymond James &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number><em>Assocs., </em>425 Mass. 724, 735 (1997). The petitioner suggests in his brief that any criminal charges that may be pending against him \u201care not relevant to the de facto parent issue, but to whether he was a fit parent.\u201d This bald assertion utterly misapprehends the concept of de facto parenthood. The petitioner stands charged with criminal assault in connection with injuries inflicted on Shariene. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>To recognize the petitioner as a de facto parent, in order that he may participate in a medical end-of-life decision for the child, is unthinkable in the circumstances of this case and would amount to an illogical and unprincipled perversion of the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">2. Because the petitioner has no legal or equitable status, as a de facto parent or otherwise, with respect to Shariene, he has no right to participate in medical decisions affecting the child. Such decisions are within the scope of the custodial powers of the department. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 21.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See also <em>Care &amp; Protection of Jeremy, </em>419 Mass. 616, 620 n.7 (1995). For decisions involving extraordinary medical care of a child in its custody, such as an order to give or withhold life-prolonging treatment, the policy of the department is to seek prior judicial approval and, in addition, the appointment of a GAL to investigate whether an order for such treatment should enter. See 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 11.13, 11.17 (1993); 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 11.18 (1995). At the request of the department and Shariene\u2019s counsel, the judge conducted an evidentiary hearing to make a \u201csubstituted judgment\u201d determination on the merits of the joint emergency motion and requested order that would permit Shariene\u2019s medical providers to withdraw her life support and to refrain from resuscitating her. See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Beth, </em>412 Mass. 188, 194-195 (1992); <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State Sch. </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, </em>373 Mass. 728, 738-739 (1977). In these circumstances, such a judicial determination is appropriate. See <em>Matter of Moe, </em>385 Mass. 555, 565 (1982), quoting <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State Sch. </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, supra </em>at 752 (\u201cthe court dons \u2018the mental mantle of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>incompetent\u2019 and substitutes itself as nearly as possible for the individual in the decision-making process. . . . [T]he court does not decide what is necessarily the best decision but rather what decision would be made by the incompetent person if he or she were competent\u201d); <em>Guardianship of Roe, </em>383 Mass. 415, 444 (1981) (judge should consider [1] patient\u2019s expressed preferences, if any; [2] patient\u2019s religious convictions, if any; [3] impact on patient\u2019s family; [4] probability of adverse side effects from treatment; and [5] prognosis with and without treatment). See also <em>Norwood Hosp. </em>v. <em>Munoz, </em>409 Mass. 116, 125 (1991) (judge also should consider countervailing State interests, including preservation of life, protection of innocent third parties, and maintenance of ethical integrity of medical profession). At the hearing, the judge applied the \u201csubstituted judgment\u201d standard and properly considered as well the traditional \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d test. See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Beth, supra </em>at 195 n.11 (noting that substituted judgment doctrine consistent with \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d test); <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 1), </em>385 Mass. 697, 710 n.10 (1982), quoting <em>Custody of a Minor, </em>375 Mass. 733, 753 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">The judge carefully considered the factors required by our cases, set forth above, under the settled preponderance of the evidence standard. See <em>Guardianship of Doe, </em>411 Mass. 512, 523-525, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>503 U.S. 950 (1992). We summarize his determinations.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The proposed order was requested in good faith and not for \u201cadministrative convenience.\u201d Sharlene is unable to express any preference regarding the requested order. Sharlene is Catholic, although there was no evidence that she, or her family, actively practiced that faith or that Sharlene held any religious beliefs or convictions that would preclude the requested order. Sharlene\u2019s legal mother is deceased, and the rights of her biological parents had been terminated. Sharlene\u2019s biological mother and maternal grandmother both support Sharlene\u2019s removal from life support. Sharlene is in an irreversible and permanent coma, with the least amount of brain function that a person can have and still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>be considered alive. She is not aware of her surroundings and does not experience pain or discomfort. The judge concluded that if Sharlene could rationally consider her current medical condition, and her future prognosis, she would accept the joint request of the department and her counsel to enter the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">The petitioner has no standing to challenge the judge\u2019s findings on this matter or his order to withdraw life support or to refrain from resuscitating the child. The order is the product of careful consideration by an experienced judge who heard from all interested parties, who received a comprehensive and thoughtful GAL report, and who entered specific findings on the appropriate factors he considered. See <em>Guardianship of Doe, supra </em>at 524.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Counsel for Sharlene did not oppose the order, nor did Sharlene\u2019s existing family members. The medical evidence is incontrovertible \u2014 the child is in a persistent vegetative state and there is no medical treatment in the foreseeable future that can restore her cognitive abilities. No provision of medical ethics is violated by the order. As the GAL report notes: \u201cTo all extent and purpose [Sharlene] has already left this world consciously and subconsciously and the only real remaining question is under what circumstances she\u2019ll be allowed to leave it physically.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">3. We now turn to the petitioner\u2019s challenge to the impound<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>ment order, a challenge that is based, as far as we can tell, on the proposition that \u201cend of life\u201d issues involving the courts should be resolved in the full light of public disclosure. According to the petitioner, \u201c[t]he public ought to be in a position to judge whether the [department] succeeded or failed in its supervision of this family.\u201d The petitioner requests that this court vacate the impoundment order entered by the judge and enter a new order requiring that all the proceedings in this case (except the actual hearings) be open to the public and that all documents relevant to this case be accessible by the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">As a preliminary matter, we find the standing of the petitioner to assert the rights of the general public in this case to be highly questionable. The essence of standing, as it pertains to a private person, is whether the person has alleged a personal stake in the outcome of a controversy. See <em>Arlington Heights </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., </em>429 U.S. 252, 261 (1977); <em>Ginther </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>427 Mass. 319, 323 (1998). As has been made clear in this opinion, his status as a party to the care and protection petition does not entitle him to any special status with respect to Sharlene or court records relating to her medical care. The petitioner is not a member of the general public in the context of this case, but one who has been criminally charged with inflicting injuries on Sharlene. Further, the issue is not as the petitioner states it \u2014 whether the department has succeeded or failed in its relationship with Sharlene. Rather, the issue involves the propriety of an order to withdraw medical treatment. In an abundance of caution, we shall nevertheless consider the merits of the impoundment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The Legislature has expressly directed that all care and protection proceedings be closed to the public. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 38 (\u201cAll hearings under [\u00a7\u00a7 1-37], inclusive, shall be closed to the general public and it shall be unlawful to publish the names of persons before the court in any hearing provided for therein . . .\u201d). Consistent with this directive, the Juvenile Court issued a standing order that Juvenile Court \u201ccase records and reports are confidential and are the property of the court. Reports loaned to or copied for attorneys of record, or such other persons as the court may permit, shall be returned to the court after their use or at the conclusion of the litigation, whichever occurs first. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>Said reports shall not be further copied or released without permission of the court.\u201d Juvenile Court Standing Order 1-84. The authority of the Juvenile Court to promulgate standing orders, pertinent to the practice and procedure for conducting the business of the court, is derived from G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 60, which makes such orders effective \u201csubject to the approval of the supreme judicial court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Standing Order 1-84 was approved by this court and adopted on May 8, 1984. This order, which unambiguously makes all Juvenile Court case records the property of the court, makes sense. If the hearings are closed, pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 38, in order to protect the confidentiality of the parties, yet the relevant documents remain unsealed, there is no way to protect the confidentiality of the parties, the purpose for which the statute was designed. By maintaining confidentiality the privacy of Sharlene is safeguarded<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and, importantly, the privacy, both present and future, of her two siblings is protected from public intrusion, so that they may grow and become adults without unnecessary stigma associated with this case. As counsel for Sharlene\u2019s siblings notes, \u201cAfter the media circus surrounding the plight of this child subsides . . . her siblings will be left to endure the pain of its aftermath. All three of these children are entitled to the protection [of confidentiality ordered by the] court,\u201d as required by statute and rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Because the law governing care and protection proceedings makes those proceedings closed to the public, the Uniform Rules on Impoundment Procedure have no general application to this case. See Rule 1 of the Uniform Rules on Impoundment Procedure (2005).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We do not depart from our cases that recognize a common-law right of access to the records of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>judicial proceedings, see <em>Boston Herald, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>432 Mass. 593, 605 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blondin, </em>324 Mass. 564, 569 (1949), cert. denied, 339 U.S. 984 (1950); <em>Cowley </em>v. <em>Pulsifer, </em>137 Mass. 392, 394 (1884), nor disagree with a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, cited by the petitioner, holding that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution may encompass a public right of access to records submitted in connection with criminal cases. See <em>Globe Newspaper Co. </em>v. <em>Pokaski, </em>868 F.2d 497 (1st Cir. 1989). These decisions, however, did not involve Juvenile Court records, which, by law, are confidential. We conclude that the judge properly ruled that the findings and order of the October 5 hearing should remain unavailable to the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">4. A few final observations are in order. Some describe this as a case about death. It should more correctly be described as a case about a young girl who has suffered tremendously from acts of violence and cruelty and who now will be permitted to pass away with dignity. Sharlene\u2019s memory will remind us, time and again, that we, as a society, need to do more to aid children who are neglected and abused, and thereby denied the care and nurturing they so desperately want and need. If Sharlene\u2019s case helps other children to escape their misery, her short life will not have been in vain.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">5. The order denying the petitioner\u2019s motion to be declared Sharlene\u2019s de facto parent and to participate in the hearing on the joint emergency motion for an order to withdraw life support and not resuscitate is affirmed. The orders to withdraw life support currently in place for Sharlene and to refrain from resuscitation of Sharlene, and that the documents and records be released to no one, except by order of the court, are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b775-8\">The petitioner asserts that the criminal case pending against him is in connection with injuries that were inflicted on Sharlene sometime prior to the injuries that have hospitalized her in her present condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The biological father has been absent from Sharlene\u2019s life and has no role in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b777-10\">Sharlene\u2019s siblings, who are nine and two years of age, are the biological children of Sharlene\u2019s adoptive mother.

Their counsel has been involved, to some degree, in the proceedings leading up to this case, including attending the hearing on the joint emergency motion, and filing a petition to this court, pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, seeking access to the judge\u2019s written decision regarding his order allowing that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">The siblings are not, however, parties to this case. Their counsel has filed an amicus brief on their behalf to present their point of view on the impoundment issue. In their brief, the siblings assert that the judge properly ordered that the general public be excluded from the proceedings arising out of the joint emergency motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b780-10\">From newspaper accounts, it appears that the mother\u2019s body and that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>the mother\u2019s grandmother were discovered at the same time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b781-7\">The petitioner also requested in the motion to be declared the \u201cde facto\u201d parent of Sharlene\u2019s nine year old sister.

The petitioner has appealed from the denial of his motion only insofar as it pertains to Sharlene.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b782-8\">The written findings of fact on the judge\u2019s decision are contained in subsequent written findings of fact entered after the October 5 hearing on the joint emergency motion and the October 17 hearing on the petitioner\u2019s challenge to the impoundment issue. The substance of the two written findings is the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b782-9\">The motion considered was a supplemental motion, filed jointly that day by the department and Sharlene\u2019s counsel that did not alter the substance of the original motion but contained additional facts and legal arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b782-10\">The GAL report concluded, \u201c [Sharlene\u2019s] life as she knew it, for better or worse, is over and can never be recovered. While the choice to withhold artificial ventilation, medication, fluid and nutrition is not an easy one that can be made lightly, it is the only decision that will afford [Sharlene] the chance to die quickly and with dignity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b783-7\">The physician testified that Sharlene cannot make any purposeful movements but, occasionally, will make a \u201cbase\u201d movement in response to being touched.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b786-5\">At the time that the department and Shariene\u2019s counsel filed the joint emergency motion, Shariene was in the department\u2019s temporary custody. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 24. At the time of the hearing on the motion, Shariene was (and continues to be) in the permanent custody of the department. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b787-5\">As a preliminary matter, the judge found Sharlene to be incompetent. No one questions this determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b788-6\">As has been discussed above, the judge applied the \u201csubstituted judgment\u201d standard and \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d test as set forth in <em>Care &amp; Protection of Beth, </em>412 Mass. 188, 194-195 &amp; n.11 (1992). The \u201csubstituted judgment\u201d standard is somewhat awkward in a case like this involving a young child who is not old or mature enough to have expressed her wishes on some of the factors. It might be argued that a matter of withdrawal of medical treatment in such a case is more properly left to a decision by the treating physicians, in consultation with such family as the child may have, and consideration of the provisions of medical ethics, under the standards set forth in <em>Matter of Dinnerstein, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 466, 475 (1978). In circumstances such as here, however, where a child in the department\u2019s custody cannot speak for herself and no interested party opposes the order, an objective evaluation of the child\u2019s \u201cbest interests,\u201d with special emphasis on the quality of the child\u2019s life, see <em>Yannas </em>v. <em>Frondistou-Yannas, </em>395 Mass. 704, 711 (1985), and any other factors pertinent to the child, provides critical guidance for a judge charged with the ultimate end of life decision. Here, the child\u2019s biological mother, her grandmother, and her two siblings do not oppose the order and have not come forward with any information that would allow an inference that life support to maintain Sharlene\u2019s irreversible comatose condition would be in her best interests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b790-6\">The petitioner asserts in his brief that \u201cthe child\u2019s grave condition, as a practical matter, leaves her unable to comprehend any invasion of privacy and obviates any need to protect her privacy.\u201d This statement is disturbing and has no merit. Our laws afford incompetent persons, including children such as Sharlene, equal respect for personal dignity and privacy as competent persons. See <em>Care &amp; Protection of Beth, supra </em>at 196-197, and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b790-7\">In order to seek relief from Standing Order 1-84, the petitioner would have had to file a motion, supported by an affidavit, pursuant to Rule 11 of the Uniform Rules on Impoundment Procedure (2005), which applies to cases where material is required to be impounded by statute, court rule, or standing order. The judge\u2019s modification of the original impoundment order, ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>companied by written findings, which allowed the petitioner access to the judge\u2019s written decision on the joint emergency motion, effected the type of relief contemplated by rule 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b791-8\">Spina, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AX-\">(concurring, with whom Cowin, J., joins). I agree with the court\u2019s opinion. I write separately to call attention to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>an issue that was not raised by the parties but has a significant impact on the public interest. The issue is whether a judicial hearing on a petition to withdraw life support systems from a child should be closed to the public simply because it takes place in the context of a care and protection proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The Supreme Judicial Court Guidelines on the Public\u2019s Right of Access to Judicial Proceedings and Records (2000) begins with the following two sentences: \u201cJudicial proceedings should not be shrouded in secrecy. Access fosters informed public discussion of governmental affairs.\u201d The guidelines then quote <em>Cowley </em>v. <em>Pulsifer, </em>137 Mass. 392, 394 (1884) (Holmes, J.), where the court said, \u201cIt is desirable that the trial of causes should take place under the public eye, not because the controversies of one citizen with another are of public concern, but because it is of the highest moment that those who administer justice should always act under the sense of public responsibility, and that every citizen should be able to satisfy himself with his own eyes as to the mode in which a public duty is performed.\u201d This principle is especially apt in cases that will result, irreversibly, in a loss of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Care and protection cases are closed to the public. G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 38. The State has a legitimate interest in protecting children from the stigma that may be associated with having parents who are accused of being unfit, or who have been found to be unfit. Orders in care and protection proceedings address these issues \u201cto insure the rights of any child to sound health and normal physical, mental, spiritual and moral development.\u201d G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 1, first par. Closed proceedings thus are justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">The decision to withdraw life support, however, is unlike any other that may be made in a care and protection case. It focuses not only on the child\u2019s health and the best interests of the child, but on whether under the substituted judgment standard the child would, if competent, choose to forgo the use of extraordinary means to sustain life. <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 1), </em>385 Mass. 697, 703 (1982). This standard is the same standard that is applied in every case involving the issue of withdrawal of life support, regardless of the court or the age of the person who is subject to the withdrawal order. <em>Superintendent of Belchertown State Sch. </em>v. <em>Saikewicz, </em>373 Mass. 728 (1977). The hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>does not implicate the public policy concerns that provide the basis for closing care and protection cases to the public because it involves no accusation of parental unfitness, remediation of parental unfitness, or stigma associated with parental unfitness that the child will carry with her through life. If the order to withdraw life support is made, it is expected that the child will not live to suffer any stigma.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">More important is the need for assurance that those seeking to terminate life in fact have the best interests of the child at heart and that the child\u2019s best interests are being served. The public is entitled to know that those seeking the orders are not trying to conceal foul play, or that the expense of maintaining life is not driving the request. Although there is not a hint of these concerns in this case, the best way to ensure that those involved in the petition are in fact working toward the best interests of the child is to open the hearing to public scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The need for open proceedings is particularly compelling where an agency of the executive branch of government seeks to persuade the judicial branch of government to withdraw life support. Decisions of this gravity, made with this concentration of government involvement, should be made in public. Withdrawal of life support does not arise solely in the context of a care and protection proceeding. It may arise on a petition of a hospital in the Probate and Family Court or the Superior Court. See, e.g., <em>Matter of Rena, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 335 (1999). Such a hearing would be open to the public unless closed after findings are made conformably with the Uniform Rules on Impoundment Procedure (2005). There is no reason to treat these hearings differently simply because the Department of Social Services is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">When care and protection proceedings were first closed to the public by St. 1954, c. 646, \u00a7 1, this issue probably had not been anticipated. The most extreme case to arise in the twenty-four years that followed involved an order to provide life-sustaining medical treatment contrary to the parents\u2019 wishes. See <em>Custody of a Minor, </em>375 Mass. 733 (1978). Medical advances have changed the landscape but the statute remains unchanged. The issue warrants reexamination by the Legislature.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
