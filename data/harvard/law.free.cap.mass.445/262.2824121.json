L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 <em>(a).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In the <em>Kennedy </em>case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>we held that a violation of the statute\u2019s sixty-day commitment and evaluation period required dismissal of the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for civil commitment where there was a fifteen-month delay in the filing of the qualified examiners\u2019 reports. <em>Id. </em>at 528. Although we found that the \u201cperiod of detention for examination [was] vastly in excess of the maximum allowed by the statute,\u201d we did not decide whether <em>any </em>violation of the statute\u2019s sixty-day deadline requires a dismissal of the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for civil commitment of a defendant as a sexually dangerous person. <em>Id. </em>at 530. The statute\u2019s deadlines are mandatory to protect a defendant\u2019s liberty interest, and any delay by the Commonwealth that results in a confinement exceeding sixty days is a violation of the statute. Because we conclude that dismissal is the appropriate remedy for any violation of the sixty-day deadline, absent extraordinary circumstances that would justify a very brief delay, we affirm the decision of the Superior Court allowing the defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration and the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\"><em>Facts and procedural history. </em>On March 18, 2003, the Commonwealth filed a petition pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(b), </em>alleging the defendant to be a sexually dangerous person who should be committed under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 <em>(d). </em>The defendant, who was serving a sentence for rape of a child by force and rape of a child, was due to be released from prison on July 9, 2003. On July 13, 2004, <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> after an evidentiary hearing, a Superior Court judge found probable cause to believe the defendant was a sexually dangerous person and committed him to the Massachusetts Treatment Center (treatment center) for the purpose of examination and diagnosis by two qualified examiners. However, the Department of Correction (department) was not notified of the finding of probable cause until October 8, 2004. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 2. Because the depart-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>meat was not so notified, the statutorily required report of the two qualified examiners was not ordered and was not filed with the court within the statute\u2019s forty-five day requirement. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 <em>(a). </em>Notwithstanding the absence of a report from the qualified examiners, the Commonwealth filed a petition for trial on September 22, 2004. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">On November 18, the Commonwealth moved to withdraw its original petition for trial. The judge treated this motion as a motion to strike and, after a hearing, allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion by agreement of the parties. The judge ordered the Commonwealth, by no later than December 3, to file a new petition for trial. On November 19, the Commonwealth filed the reports of the two qualified examiners, and on December 3, the Commonwealth filed a new petition for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The defendant filed a motion to dismiss both petitions on the ground, inter alla, that the Commonwealth lost its power to proceed against the defendant after the expiration of the sixty-day evaluation period.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After initially denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration and the motion to dismiss. The Commonwealth appealed, and a motion to stay the defendant\u2019s release pending appeal was allowed by a single justice of the Appeals Court. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>The statutory scheme exists to protect the public \u201cfrom harm by persons likely to be sexually dangerous\u201d by striking a balance between the public interest and a defendant\u2019s substantive due process rights. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>441 Mass. 157, 164 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">The Commonwealth concedes that the defendant\u2019s nearly five-month civil confinement from July 13, 2004, until December 3, 2004, exceeded the sixty-day requirement of G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>c. 123A, \u00a7 13 <em>(a). </em>However, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra </em>at 530 n.3, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>439 Mass. 826 (2003), the Commonwealth argues that not all violations of the G. L. c. 123A sixty-day deadline require dismissal. Although the delay in the present case was not as long as that in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>it was both substantial and unjustified by extraordinary circumstances and, we conclude, required the dismissal of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra </em>at 530, we determined that the fifteen-month delay in filing the qualified examiners\u2019 reports was \u201cvastly in excess of the [sixty-day] maximum allowed by the statute.\u201d Accordingly, we found it unnecessary to consider \u201cwhether lesser violations of the deadlines in G. L. c. 123A may result in some lesser sanction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530 n.3. We next considered these statutory deadlines in the <em>Gagnon </em>case, and held that the failure timely to file the qualified examiners\u2019 reports did not trigger dismissal of a petition for trial when the defendant\u2019s confinement did not exceed sixty days. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, supra </em>at 827. The case before us presents a different question, namely, whether <em>any </em>violation of \u00a7 13 <em>(a) </em>that results in a confinement exceeding sixty days requires dismissal of the Commonwealth\u2019s belated petition for trial. We now hold that it does, unless there are extraordinary circumstances justifying an extremely brief delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u201cWhere the statutory language is clear, courts apply the plain and ordinary meaning of that language. . . . [The statute] requires that the person named in the petition <em>\u2019shall be committed to the treatment center for a period not exceeding 60 days . . . </em>under the supervision of two qualified examiners who shall, no later than 15 days prior to the expiration of said period, file with the court a written report.\u2019 . . . The word \u2018shall\u2019 in this context, where substantive rights are involved, indicates that the action is mandatory.\u201d (Citation omitted and emphasis added.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra </em>at 530, quoting G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 <em>(a). </em>\u201cIn terms of a defendant\u2019s liberty interest, the relevant period is the sixty-day time period.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, supra </em>at 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The statute makes clear that the defendant\u2019s evaluation period shall not exceed sixty days, and sets forth no exceptions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>would extend that period.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Where the defendant\u2019s confinement falls outside the sixty-day limitation imposed by the statute, there has been a violation of his liberty that requires dismissal of the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, supra </em>at 531 (noting that \u201cthe liberty interests at stake compel strict adherence to the time frames set forth in the statute\u201d). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, supra </em>at 827 (dismissal not warranted when Commonwealth\u2019s failure to meet report filing deadline does not affect defendant\u2019s liberty interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Here, the defendant was committed to the treatment center on July 13, 2004. The sixty-day evaluation period expired on September 11, 2004. The Commonwealth filed the qualified examiners\u2019 reports on November 19, 2004, sixty-nine days after the expiration of the sixty-day evaluation period. The Commonwealth\u2019s petition for trial was filed on December 3, 2004, eighty-three days after the evaluation period expired. Throughout the G. L. c. 123A proceedings, the defendant remained confined to the treatment center, in violation of his liberty interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The Commonwealth also argues that our holding in the <em>Gag-non </em>case permits us to view violations of G. L. c. 123A on a \u201csliding scale with only Kennedy-type violations requiring dismissal.\u201d Accordingly, the argument continues, we should provide the defendant some alternative remedy to dismissal, such as conditional release. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Our holding in the <em>Gagnon </em>case does not help the Commonwealth because Gagnon was not held beyond the sixty-day evaluation period. Therefore, he suffered no deprivation of liberty beyond that which the statute permits. Here, the defendant\u2019s liberty interests were affected because he was held beyond the sixty-day evaluation period.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Further, nowhere does the <em>Gagnon </em>case suggest the use of a \u201csliding scale\u201d with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>respect to statutory violations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Finally, as our holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knapp, supra </em>at 161-162, makes clear, after a finding of probable cause that the defendant is a sexually dangerous person, a judge has no discretion to order release; commitment is mandatory. Thus, the statute provides no alternative remedy to dismissal. The motion to dismiss was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Our decision is dictated by the requirements of the statute and the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to meet those requirements. It is not our role to disturb the Legislature\u2019s efforts to balance the public\u2019s protection against an individual\u2019s liberty interests. Accordingly, the judgment of dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b280-15\">General Laws c. 123A, \u00a7 13 <em>(a), </em>states: \u201cIf the court is satisfied that probable cause exists to believe that the person named in the petition is a sexually dangerous person, the prisoner or youth shall be committed to the [Mas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>sachusetts Treatment Center] for a period not exceeding 60 days for the purpose of examination and diagnosis under the supervision of two qualified examiners who shall, no later than 15 days prior to the expiration of said period, file with the court a written report of the examination and diagnosis and their recommendation of the disposition of the person named in the petition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The delay between March, 2003, and July, 2004, was not challenged below and is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b282-9\">In his motion to dismiss, the defendant also argued that the September 22, 2004, petition should be dismissed because it was filed before the qualified examiners\u2019 reports. Indeed, the statute requires the petition for trial to be filed within fourteen days of the filing of the qualified examiners\u2019 reports. See G. L. c. \u00a7 14 <em>(a); Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>441 Mass. 157, 160 (2004) (Commonwealth must decide whether to move for trial within fourteen days of filing of report). Because the parties had agreed to strike the first petition, that argument was moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b284-8\">By comparison, the trial of an alleged sexually dangerous person, which should ordinarily be held within sixty days of the petition for trial, may be delayed for good cause or if the interests of justice so require. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 <em>(a); Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeBella, </em>442 Mass. 683, 689 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b284-9\">On September 12, 2005, this court ordered the release of the defendant pending the outcome of this appeal, on appropriate conditions to be determined after a hearing before a judge in the Superior Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\">There may be extraordinary circumstances that would excuse brief violations of the \u00a7 13 <em>(a) </em>sixty-day limit. In this case, however, we are not presented with such circumstances. Here, the Commonwealth\u2019s unexcused failure to meet the requirements of the statute caused the defendant\u2019s confinement beyond the \u00a7 13(a) sixty-day limit. Indeed, the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for trial was not even filed until well past the time that the case should have been tried. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (a). Dismissal was required.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
