Shuman appealed and filed a motion for a new trial in this court on November 19, 2002, on the grounds that newly discovered evidence cast substantial doubt on the justice of his convictions or, alternatively, that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. We remanded the motion to the Superior Court for disposition and stayed appellate proceedings. After reviewing the affidavits and materials filed in support of the motion and without holding an evidentiary hearing, the motion judge, who was also the trial judge, denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>- the motion. The direct appeal from Shuman\u2019s convictions and the denial of his motion for a new trial have been consolidated in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">Shuman\u2019s defense at trial was lack of criminal responsibility due to a mental illness (depression reaching psychotic dimensions), exacerbated by other ailments and the side effects of medications that left him unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. On appeal, he argues that evidence regarding the connection between the prescription medication Zoloft and a state of agitation known as akathisia was discovered after his trial and casts substantial doubt on the justice of his convictions; or in the alternative, his counsel was ineffective in failing to present evidence concerning the connection between Zoloft and akathisia at trial. He also argues that the motion judge erred in denying him an evidentiary hearing before acting on his motion for a new trial. Finally, Shuman asks the court to exercise its power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reverse his convictions and grant him another trial so that the \u201ccritical evidence\u201d he proffers regarding Zoloft may be heard and weighed by a jury. After undertaking a complete review of the trial record, we affirm the convictions, affirm the order denying Shuman\u2019s motion for a new trial, and decline to grant relief under G. L. c. 278 \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the evidence in its light most favorable to the Commonwealth, reserving certain details for discussion in conjunction with the issues raised. The essential facts are not in dispute. On the afternoon of August 5, 1997, Shuman used a nine millimeter Beretta semiautomatic pistol to kill Jack Badler and Howard Librot. Shuman first went to Badler\u2019s office at Cabot Place in Stoughton. Badler called his human resources manager, Helen Anderson, to his office door so she might see that Shuman had a gun on his lap. He told her to dial 911 if Shuman did not put it away. Shuman told Anderson, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t hurt you,\u201d and put the gun away. As Anderson was leaving, Shuman told Badler that he had ruined his business and his life. He then shot Badler in the upper chest, eye, neck, and thumb, and left the office, telling two nearby employees, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not going to shoot you two. I\u2019m not upset with you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Shuman then drove to Librot\u2019s office, also in Stoughton. He entered the office and shot Librot in the head, neck, and chest. With his gun in hand, Shuman left the building and drove away. Both victims died as a result of their wounds. A few minutes later, Shuman arrived at his parents\u2019 house and told his mother that he had killed two people. While there, Shuman raised a gun to his head. His mother begged him to stop. Shuman put the gun away, and his parents drove him to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The shootings were directly linked to a worsening business relationship between Shuman and the victims. That relationship began when Shuman\u2019s printing business (Foremost Printers) purchased Web Corp. from Librot in 1989. Librot and his wife continued to run Web Corp. under Foremost\u2019s ownership. In 1991, Foremost Printers (Foremost) hired Badler to handle all of its finances and maintain control of the company books. Badler was a friend of Librot. By 1996, after a series of poor business decisions, Foremost was experiencing serious financial difficulties. In the face of these financial difficulties, tensions and disputes between Shuman, Librot, and Badler mounted. Badler and Shuman argued frequently about Badler\u2019s control of the company books. Foremost was unable to pay Badler for managing its books, and the company got behind in its financial obligations to the Librots. Librot instructed his employees not to permit Shuman on Web Corp. property and not to assist Shuman with any printing work. On August 1, 1997, Foremost\u2019s assets were sold. In connection with the sale, Shuman was required to sign a document that released Badler from any liability related to his work for Foremost. Shuman would not sign the release. On August 5, Badler processed the payroll for Web Corp., but not for Foremost. Badler refused to process Foremost\u2019s payroll until Shuman signed the release. That morning, there was a loud argument between Badler and Shuman in Badler\u2019s office. Shuman left, but returned later in the day with the gun, and the shootings followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">There was also evidence that, starting in January of 1997, friends and family began to notice changes in Shuman\u2019s personality. He could not sleep, seemed depressed, lost weight, and on one occasion, held a gun to his head. Dr. George Gar-dos, a psychiatrist, saw Shuman on July 29, 1997, one week <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>before the shootings, and diagnosed a major depression but did not believe Shuman to be a risk of harm to others. Dr. Gardos increased Shuman\u2019s preexisting Elavil prescription, to ease depression symptoms, and also prescribed Zoloft, a \u201cmood elevator.\u201d After the killings, psychiatrist and defense expert Dr. Harold Bursztajn, of Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts Mental Health Center, examined Shuman. Dr. Bursztajn opined that Shuman suffered from \u201ca major depression, with anxiety which reached psychotic dimensions.\u201d He also testified that Shuman\u2019s diabetes exacerbated the depression, and that the antidepressants that had been prescribed to Shuman shortly before the killings magnified its symptoms. In particular, Dr. Bursztajn noted that Elavil, combined with Zoloft, can give rise to agitation, a need to act, and compulsive behavior that may be organized but is irrational. He also testified that these troubling side effects can come \u201cright away,\u201d particularly in patients suffering from diabetes.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Newly discovered evidence. </em>Shuman argues that his motion for a new trial should have been allowed on the ground of newly discovered evidence linking Zoloft to a state of violent urges and agitation, known as akathisia, and proffers the following evidence to support his claim: (1) a posttrial study, published in 2000 by Dr. David Healy, linking Zoloft for the first time to violent urges in individuals who had previously suffered no mental illness; (2) expert testimony given in 2001 in civil litigation involving Pfizer, Inc., which publicly linked Zoloft to akathisia; (3) Dr. Joseph Glenmullen\u2019s posttrial examination of Shuman and his medical records, leading Dr. Glenmullen to conclude that Shuman was in a drug-induced state of akathisia when the murders occurred; and (4) an advisory released by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2004, warning of the possible side effects of Zoloft, including akathisia and agitation, especially at the beginning of drug therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">A defendant seeking a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence must establish that the evidence was unknown to the defendant or trial counsel and not reasonably discoverable at the time of trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>432 Mass. 623, 633 n.6 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>431 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Mass. 212, 218 (2000). He must also establish that the evidence \u201ccasts real doubt on the justice of the conviction.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salvati, </em>420 Mass. 499, 506 (1995), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>412 Mass. 664, 679-680 (1992). The evidence said to be new not only must be material and credible, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>378 Mass. 165, 172 (1979), but also must \u201ccarry a measure of strength in support of the defendant\u2019s position.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>397 Mass. 303, 305 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The decision to deny or grant a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence is committed to the sound discretion of the motion judge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cintron, </em>435 Mass. 509, 517 (2001). In deciding whether the new evidence would have been a significant factor in the jury\u2019s deliberations, had it been admitted at trial, we accord special deference to the action of a motion judge who was also the trial judge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, supra </em>at 307, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeChristoforo, </em>360 Mass. 531, 543 (1971). The judge here found that the evidence submitted in support of Shuman\u2019s motion was not \u201cnew\u201d and that there was \u201cno substantial risk the jury would have reached a different conclusion had the evidence been admitted at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, supra </em>at 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Our examination of the record leads us to agree that Shuman\u2019s motion fails on two broad grounds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, the evidence does not meet the test for \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence because it was available prior to the trial. Second, the opinion of the defense expert submitted in support of the motion is not substantially different from the defense offered at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The new evidence \u2014 Dr. Healy\u2019s study, the expert testimony in the Pfizer litigation, Shuman\u2019s examination by Dr. Glenmullen, and the FDA advisory \u2014 are new only in the sense that they had not occurred prior to trial. The link, however, between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as Zoloft, to violence and akathisia, was known in the scientific, medical, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>and academic communities prior to trial and was widely reported.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Shuman claims, however, that the information available at the time of his trial principally linked akathisia to drugs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>such as Prozac, but not to the drug he was prescribed, Zoloft. As the motion judge found, there is \u201cno suggestion in Dr. Glenmullen\u2019s affidavit that Zoloft is qualitatively different than other SSRIs, such as Prozac, such that the medical and other literature about Prozac that was published before October of 1999 would not be understood as relevant to Zoloft.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The proposition that reasonable pretrial diligence would not have revealed the connection between SSRIs such as Zoloft and violent behavior in these circumstances is unconvincing. Moreover, although trial counsel has filed an affidavit stating he was \u201cunaware of the phenomena of Zoloft poisoning and/or the now-established link between Zoloft and violence,\u201d he did question one of his own medical experts and the Commonwealth\u2019s expert regarding the connection between Zoloft and \u201c[ejnhanced aggression,\u201d and the existence of \u201cstudies of whether or not Zoloft has contributed to killings.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Additionally, in his opening statement, trial counsel referred to Shuman as someone \u201cin a state of depression\u201d who had been \u201ccrank[ed] ... up on Zoloft\u201d by his psychiatrist. There was also no evidence presented in connection with the motion for a new trial that Dr. Bursztajn, Shuman\u2019s highly credentialed psychiatric expert at trial (and a colleague of Dr. Glenmullen at Harvard Medical School), was unaware of the link between SSRIs and akathisia when he examined Shuman and formed his opinion, or that his opinion would be significantly different today from what it was at trial. In light of the extensive literature on the subject that existed in 1999, the judge found that a conclusion that Dr. Bursztajn was unaware of this link would be \u201cvery difficult to accept.\u201d She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>also noted that his testimony at the trial suggested otherwise. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The new evidence proffered here is merely a broadening of the research regarding SSRIs and violence already present in legal and scientific circles. The mere addition of further information to the preexisting debate does not amount to \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d for the purposes of a new trial motion: \u201cUndoubtedly, recent research has broadened the scientific community\u2019s understanding [but] we have concluded that expert testimony may not be considered newly discovered for purposes of a new trial motion simply because recent studies may lend more credibility to expert testimony that was or could have been presented at trial. To hold otherwise would provide convicted defendants with a new trial whenever they could find a credible expert with new research results supporting claims that the defendant made or could have made at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeFave, </em>430 Mass. 169, 181 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Even if we concluded that the evidence might marginally meet the \u201cnewness\u201d requirement of a motion for a new trial, the proffered testimony of Dr. Glenmullen does not differ qualitatively from the testimony offered by Shuman\u2019s expert at trial. Dr. Glenmullen\u2019s posttrial conclusion that Shuman suffered from Zoloft-induced akathisia at the time of the killings is consistent with the testimony of Dr. Bursztajn, who testified that Elavil and Zoloft combined can make people more irritable and can give them more energy, \u201cso they feel they have to do something.\u201d Dr. Bursztajn found Shuman \u201cdepressed, panicky and delusional.\u201d Dr. John Daignault, another defense expert who interviewed Shuman within hours of the shootings, found that Shuman was exhibiting signs of paranoia, depression, and that he was \u201c[r]obotic.\u201d Shuman\u2019s delusion was that \u201che had to protect his family at any cost, at any price. And the only way to do so was to go ahead and shoot the two people that he felt had threatened his family.\u201d These descriptions of Shuman\u2019s symptoms are very close to Dr. Glenmullen\u2019s description of akathisia as a state of \u201canxiety, tension, irritability, and impatience,\u201d coupled with \u201cpanic reactions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">In essence, Shuman offers the same evidence of his symptoms simply cast under a different name, akathisia. Other than provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>ing a specific term for those symptoms, Dr. Glenmullen\u2019s observations do little to change or add to the trial expert\u2019s testimony. At best, the distinction between the two opinions is that Dr. Glenmullen identifies Zoloft and the side effect of akathisia as the cause of Shuman\u2019s allegedly panicked, suicidal, and violent thoughts and actions, while Dr. Bursztajn attributed those same thoughts and actions to overwhelming depression exacerbated by Shuman\u2019s diabetes and side effects from the group of medications he was taking, including Zoloft. In these circumstances the motion judge did not abuse her discretion in finding that this distinction was not significant enough to create a substantial risk that the jury would have reached a different conclusion had the evidence been admitted at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeFave, supra </em>at 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The denial of Shuman\u2019s motion either for its failure to establish newness or for its failure to cast doubt on the justice of the convictions, or on both grounds, did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">b. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>\u201cIn evaluating a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in a case of murder in the first degree, we begin by determining whether there was a serious failure by trial counsel.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harbin, </em>435 Mass. 654, 656 (2002). We have described serious failure as \u201cserious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary, fallible lawyer.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). If serious failure is found on the part of counsel, the court then determines whether the failure resulted in a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, as required by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>428 Mass. 852, 854 (1999). Shuman argues that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel because trial counsel failed fully to investigate and raise the defense of Zoloft-induced akathisia.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The record of the trial reflects a vigorous, well-prepared, and well-presented insanity defense, with substantial expert and medical testimony to support it. As the motion judge noted, counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the Commonwealth\u2019s rebuttal psychiatric witness was done \u201cwith skill, and specifically [included] ask[ing] that witness about the possible link between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Zoloft and heightened aggression.\u201d Shuman, on the other hand, emphasizes the affidavit of his trial counsel to the effect that counsel was unaware of Zoloft poisoning or the link between Zoloft and violence, his expert did not inform him of Zoloft-induced violence, and counsel was unaware of the impact Zoloft had on Shuman\u2019s mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Shuman\u2019s claims are unconvincing. Even if trial counsel did not use the term \u201cakathisia\u201d in his questioning of the witnesses, he did, as a part of the insanity defense, raise the link between Zoloft and heightened aggression. The Zoloft defense that Shuman now offers, and the insanity defense that trial counsel presented, are very close indeed; both aver that drugs, in combination with Shuman\u2019s preexisting depression, contributed to his aggressive behavior. Trial counsel argued in his opening statement that the defendant was \u201ccrank[ed] . . . up on Zoloft\u201d by his doctor, and was a man \u201cin a state of depression, with his medical condition, on Zoloft,\u201d who had been driven to the psychotic state that resulted in his pulling the trigger. Counsel also repeatedly argued in his closing that Shuman was affected by a \u201ctoxic soup\u201d of medication, and had been \u201cjack[ed]\u201d up on \u201cmetis,\u201d including Zoloft. Application of the term \u201cakathisia\u201d to the behavior rather than \u201cheightened aggression\u201d is of little consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">In questioning trial counsel\u2019s use of the insanity defense, instead of the \u201cZoloft defense,\u201d Shuman challenges the tactical approach of his counsel and his principal psychiatric witness. This court gives some deference to trial counsel\u2019s tactical decisions, see <em>Breese </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>415 Mass. 249, 251 (1993), and unless such decisions were \u201cmanifestly unreasonable when made,\u201d we will not find ineffectiveness. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaCava, </em>438 Mass. 708, 713 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>427 Mass. 816, 822 (1998). Shuman essentially asserts that his insanity defense may have been more effective if it had emphasized the alleged toxic effects of Zoloft, rather than the effect of depression worsened by a \u201ctoxic soup\u201d of medication. We do not find the choice of emphasis in a defense to be manifestly unreasonable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lucien, </em>440 Mass. 658, 670-671 (2004) (\u201cWhere the claim of ineffectiveness involves a tactical decision of defense counsel, we inquire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>whether the decision was \u2018manifestly unreasonable\u2019 when made\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">This case is not akin to those in which we have found that the failure to investigate an insanity defense falls below the level of competence demanded of an \u201cordinary, fallible lawyer,\u201d where the relevant facts were known by or accessible to the attorney. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>391 Mass. 443, 458-459 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, supra </em>at 96. Presenting a similar but slightly different version of an insanity defense does not fall below the ordinary lawyer\u2019s level of competence. Nor is this a case where defense counsel \u201cfailed to pursue adequately ... the only realistic defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 661 (1992). Shuman cannot claim that he was deprived of an \u201cotherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, supra. </em>Trial counsel\u2019s effective presentation of a well-prepared insanity defense, raising the link between Zoloft and aggression, rather than a pure \u201cZoloft defense,\u201d was not a serious failure on his part, nor is any difference between the two sufficient to create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">c. <em>Denial of motion without an evidentiary hearing. </em>It is within the judge\u2019s sound discretion to determine whether an evidentiary hearing is necessary. \u201cIn exercising the discretion to hold an evidentiary hearing, the judge must decide whether a substantial issue necessitating a hearing has been raised. In doing so, the judge looks not only to the seriousness of the claim presented, but also at the adequacy of the defendant\u2019s factual showing.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trung Chi Truong, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 668, 674 (1993), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>383 Mass. 253, 257-258 (1981). Shuman argues that the motion judge should have at least held an evidentiary hearing before deciding the new trial motion, especially because she discounted trial counsel\u2019s affidavit stating he was unaware of Zoloft\u2019s link to violence. We review the judge\u2019s decision for any abuse of discretion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>437 Mass. 84, 96 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The judge conducted a nonevidentiary hearing, thoroughly reviewed the extensive affidavits and materials filed by Shuman, as well as the trial testimony, and issued comprehensive findings. She found that the motion supported by Dr. Glen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>mullen\u2019s and trial counsel\u2019s affidavits did not present a sufficient basis for a new trial. We agree. \u201c[E]very dispute among experts [does not require] an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meggs, </em>30 Mass. 111, 114 (1991). It is of no consequence that the judge discounted trial counsel\u2019s affidavit stating he was unaware of Zoloft\u2019s link to violence. She had ample reason to do so based on, among other things, trial counsel\u2019s arguments and examinations at trial. A judge may properly discount any portion of defense counsel\u2019s affidavit. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodreau, </em>442 Mass. 341, 351 n.6 (2004); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Savage, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 500, 505 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">d. <em>Review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>We have reviewed the entire record as required by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. The evidence of premeditation in the murders of Badler and Librot was strong. There is no basis for ordering a new trial or directing the entry of a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt.

The judge refused to allow it. Additionally, he elicited testimony from the Commonwealth\u2019s expert that the Physicians\u2019 Desk Reference contains a warning of \u201c[ejnhanced aggression\u201d with respect to the use of Zoloft.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
