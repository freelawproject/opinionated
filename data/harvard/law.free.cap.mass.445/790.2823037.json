L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1), which permits an action by any person who has been \u201cinjured\u201d by another\u2019s unfair or deceptive act or practice. The rental customers contend that the collision damage waiver provision (CDW) in Enterprise\u2019s form rental contract violated G. L. c. 93A, because its terms failed to comply with the requirements of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32E \u00bd, which regulates collision damage waivers in private passenger automobile rental agreements.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the alternative, the plaintiffs argue that the CDW was sufficiently unfair or deceptive as to violate Chapter 93A, irrespective of \u00a7 32E \u00bd.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">We conclude that, because the CDW did not cause the plaintiffs to suffer any loss, they have failed to satisfy the causation requirement of the \u201cinjury\u201d provision of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1); proving a causal connection between a deceptive act and a loss to the consumer is an essential predicate for recovery under our consumer protection statute. We affirm the order of a judge in the Superior Court granting summary judgment for the defendants, albeit for different reasons.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The essential facts are not disputed. Enterprise is a national consumer automobile rental company. On February 3, 2001, Barry Hershenow entered into a contract for a one-day rental of a motor vehicle at Enterprise\u2019s West Newton branch. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>The rental charge was $14.99.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Hershenow purchased optional collision damage waiver protection for an additional $14.99. In general terms, when a customer purchases CDW, the rental company agrees to waive claims against the customer for any damage to the car during the rental period. Hershenow admits that his rental automobile was not involved in a collision nor otherwise damaged during the rental period.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">On July 13, 2001, Dana Beaumier rented an automobile for three days at Enterprise\u2019s Somerville branch. The rental charge was $80. Beaumier too opted for CDW protection, at an additional cost to her of $47.97. Beaumier also admits that the automobile she rented was not damaged during the rental period.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Enterprise\u2019s preprinted form contracts contained numerous specific restrictions on the use of the vehicles.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The collision damage waiver provision provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-7\">\u201cIf Owner offers and Renter agrees to pay an additional fee for DAMAGE WAIVER, renter is relieved of any deductible on renter\u2019s policy, and an additional amount, the total of renter\u2019s deductible and the additional amount will not exceed $1,000.00 .... Damage Waiver does not apply if the car is stolen, or if renter or driver fails to or refuses to make a report of damages to police or other lawful authorities, or to cover tire chain damages. A <em>violation of any provision of this agreement invalidates Damage Waiver\u2019\u2019'\u2019 </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">Pursuant to this last sentence, a violation of any provision of the Enterprise rental contract would purportedly cancel the CDW. This provision is contrary to the requirements of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32E \u00bd, which permits rental companies to cancel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>CDW only as specifically listed in the statute. See \u00a7 32E <em>\u00bd </em>(C) (5).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Additionally, as applied to the CDW, many restrictions that Enterprise imposed on the use of its vehicles were inconsistent with other provisions of \u00a7 32E <em>\u00bd. </em>For example, \u00a7 32E <em>\u00bd </em>(C) (5) <em>(e), </em>permits CDW exclusion for damage incurred while an authorized driver \u201cis driving outside the United States or Canada, unless expressly authorized in the rental agreement,\u201d but Enterprise\u2019s form contract provided for exclusion if the vehicle was driven outside Massachusetts without Enterprise\u2019s written consent. See note 6, supra, (subsection <em>\\f\\).</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Enterprise characterizes its contract provisions that are contrary to the Massachusetts statute as a \u201cmistake.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>\u201c13. VIOLATIONS OF THE CONTRACT. A violation of the contract shall exist if the car is used or driven:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-13\">\u201c(a) In violation of any term or condition of this agreement. . . . (f) Outside the state of rental without written consent of Owner. . . . (h) If renter or driver leaves the car unlocked or fails to secure the keys, (i) Other than [on] a paved public highway, private road or driveway. . . . (j) In a reckless or imprudent manner .... (k) Or if renter misrepresents facts to Owner pertaining to rental, use, or operation of the car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>On November 21, 2001, the plaintiffs wrote to Enterprise pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, on their own behalf and on behalf of a class of other Massachusetts renters whom they sought to represent.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The letter demanded that Enterprise cease including the \u201cillegal\u201d CDW exclusions in future rental contracts, cease relying on those exclusions to deny CDW protection, and refund all CDW payments to each purported class member, with interest. Enterprise responded that the contracts complied with G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32E <em>\u00bd. </em>It nonetheless agreed to modify its rental agreements and remove the challenged language that a \u201cviolation of any provision of this agreement invalidates Damage Waiver.\u201d They noted that the automobiles at issue had sustained no damage. Thus, asserted Enterprise, even if its CDW provision contained impermissible exclusions, \u201cthe only customers who could have been injured would have been those who dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>aged the rented cars and against whom Enterprise refused to waive its claims based on a reason not allowed [under Massachusetts law].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">On November 21, 2001, the plaintiffs also filed this action in the Superior Court. Before the issue of class certification was addressed, Enterprise moved for judgment on the pleadings and for summary judgment. Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (c), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). Mass. R. Civ. P. 56, 365 Mass. 824 (1974). The plaintiffs also moved for summary judgment. A judge in the Superior Court ruled in favor of Enterprise on both motions, and judgment entered on August 6, 2003.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The judge concluded that no private right of action exists under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32E \u00bd, and that there is no right to bring a separate action for any violation of that statute under G. L. c. 93A. He entered judgment on the pleadings for the defendants. The judge also entered summary judgment for the defendants \u201cbecause there is no claim for private right of action under [G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32E V2] or under [G. L. c. 93A],\u201d noting that he was not ruling \u201con the merits of the motion.\u201d The plaintiffs appealed. We transferred the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>As noted, the Superior Court judge did not rule \u201con the merits\u201d of Enterprise\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The judge did not, however, exclude any of the evidence submitted by Enterprise in support of the motion that was beyond the pleadings, and the amended judgment states that the judge considered the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, and affidavits. We therefore consider the entire record on appeal. Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (c). We will sustain the judge\u2019s ruling entering judgment for Enterprise if it is sound on any ground established in the record. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>413 Mass. 730, 734-735 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The plaintiffs here advance two theories for recovery under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9. First, they argue that Enterprise\u2019s violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32E \u00bd, constituted a \u201cper se\u201d violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9. In support of this argument, they point to 940 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.16 (3) (1993), which provides that an act or practice is a violation of \u00a7 2 of G. L. c. 93A, if it fails to comply with consumer protection statutes, rules, regulations, or laws.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Second, they contend that Enterprise\u2019s CDW was \u201cunfair and deceptive\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 93A, independent of any noncompliance with G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32E \u00bd.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">Before we turn to the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments, we address the defendants\u2019 predicate argument that a violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32E \u00bd, may not be enforced in a private action under G. L. c. 93A.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendants maintain that, because G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32E \u00bd (E), provides for civil fines and a public enforcement action brought by the Commonwealth, private relief for violations of that statute is not available. The plaintiffs counter that the absence of a private remedy in \u00a7 32E \u00bd does not demonstrate a legislative intent to preclude consumer claims under G. L. c. 93A, and that the two statutes form a \u201ccomplementary,\u201d rather than an \u201cirreconcilable,\u201d scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">We do not perceive a conflict between the two statutory schemes, nor do we perceive any clearly expressed legislative intent that G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32E \u00bd, displace entirely any existing private remedies for deceptive practices concerning collision damage waivers in private passenger automobile rental agreements. Section 32E \u00bd was enacted in 1990, one year after a report by the National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) detailed nationwide \u201cabuses\u201d in the car rental industry, including the industry\u2019s use of \u201chigh pressure sales tactics\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>persuade consumers to purchase collision damage waivers. See Final Report and Recommendations of the National Association of Attorneys General Task Force on the Car Rental Industry Advertising and Practices, 56 Antitrust &amp; Trade Reg. Rep. S-1, S-3, S-5, S-15 (Special Supp. Mar. 16, 1989). NAAG reported that some rental companies had sold damage waivers that were \u201cso unreasonably restricted as to be worthless,\u201d and that \u201c[c]or rental contracts [were] not a useful source of information on either the extent of the consumer\u2019s liability or CDW.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at S-14. NAAG recommended that State Legislatures enact statutes to address these abuses. The Massachusetts Legislature promptly did so.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> These events lead us to conclude that the Legislature\u2019s intent was to supplement, not curtail, existing consumer protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">We infer that the absence of a private right of action in the 1990 legislation \u201cstemmed from the Legislature\u2019s knowledge that such a consumer right of action already existed pursuant to [G. L.] c. 93A, \u00a7 9, rather than from a desire to bar such actions.\u201d <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>373 Mass. 72, 77 (1977) (G. L. c. 176D, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts in the insurance industry, did not exclude application of G. L. c. 93A). See <em>Ciardi </em>v. <em>F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd., </em>436 Mass. 53 (2002) (Antitrust Act, G. L. c. 93, \u00a7\u00a7 1-14A, did not infringe on scope of G. L. c. 93A). Contrast <em>Cabot Corp. </em>v. <em>Baddour, </em>394 Mass. 720, 722-723, 725 (1985) (Uniform Securities Act intended to provide comprehensive regulation of securities field, and distinguishing <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., supra, </em>where absence of private actions established that insurance field not comprehensively regulated); <em>Reiter Oldsmobile, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number><em>eral Motors Corp., </em>378 Mass. 707, 711 (1979) (G. L. c. 93B, which addresses unfairness in dealings in the automotive industry, provided specific private remedies for violation, so no relief available under G. L. c. 93A). The enactment of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32E \u00bd, does not foreclose the availability of remedies under G. L. c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Having considered the applicability of G. L. c. 93A, we turn now to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and consider first whether they have been \u201cinjured\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1). This court has consistently recognized that, to warrant an award of damages under G. L. c. 93A, there must be a \u201ccausal connection between the seller\u2019s deception and the buyer\u2019s loss.\u201d <em>Kohl </em>v. <em>Silver Lake Motors, Inc., </em>369 Mass. 795, 801 (1976). See <em>Slaney </em>v. <em>Westwood Auto, Inc., </em>366 Mass. 688, 695-696 (1975) (G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, permits action by one who suffers loss \u201cas a result of\u201d unfair or deceptive act). The requirement of a causal connection between deception and loss was not affected by 1979 legislative changes to G. L. c. 93A, which we shall now describe.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">In 1975, this court held that G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, then in effect, required a plaintiff to prove a loss of \u201cmoney\u201d or \u201cproperty,\u201d holding that a claim of severe emotional distress was not actionable under the statute.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Baldassari </em>v. <em>Public Fin. Trust, </em>369 Mass. 33, 44-46 (1975) (Baldassari). Two years later, the court ruled that G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, permitted only those in privity with an insurer to bring a claim under the statute. <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., supra </em>at 79-81. In reaction to those two holdings, the Legislature amended G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1), as appearing in St. 1979, c. 406, \u00a7 1, to provide for a private right of action to any person \u201cwho has been injured by another person\u2019s use or employment of any method, act or practice declared to be unlawful [under G. L. c. 93A].\u201d See <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>434 Mass. 556, 565 n.12 (2001) (1979 amendment was, in part, legislative response to <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Commercial Union </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number><em>Ins. Co., supra); Leardi </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>394 Mass. 151, 158 (1985) (Leardi) (1979 amendment was, in part, legislative response to <em>Baldassari).</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">The relevant 1979 amendments thus clarified that the Legislature intended to permit recovery when an unfair or deceptive act caused a personal injury loss such as emotional distress, even if the consumer lost no \u201cmoney\u201d or \u201cproperty.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Haddad </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>410 Mass. 855, 865-866 (1991) (following 1979 amendment to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, severe emotional stress was cognizable loss); <em>Maillet </em>v. <em>ATF-Davidson Co., </em>407 Mass. 185, 192 (1990) (following 1979 amendment, \u00a7 9 applicable to product liability cases involving personal injury). Nothing in the statutory language or the legislative history suggests that the 1979 amendments eliminated or altered the requirement of a causal connection to a loss. See <em>Kohl </em>v. <em>Silver Lake Motors, Inc., supra; Slaney </em>v. <em>Westwood Auto, Inc., supra </em>at 698. See also Greaney, Consumer Protection Law, 65 Mass. L. Rev. 88, 89 (1980) (\u201cDespite the breadth of the [1979] amendment, some limitation will occur by the requirement that the plaintiff still establish causation\u201d). We have recently reaffirmed that, in enacting and then amending G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, the Legislature intended that \u201ccausation is a required element of a successful G. L. c. 93A claim.\u201d <em>Aspinall </em>v. <em>Philip Morris Cos., </em>442 Mass. 381, 401 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">The plaintiffs do not directly address the issue of causation, arguing simply that under <em>Leardi, any </em>misrepresentation of legal rights in a consumer contract is a \u201cper se injury\u201d and that no more is needed to establish injury under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9. We disagree. A misrepresentation of legal rights in a consumer contract may indeed be per se \u201cunfair\u201d or \u201cdeceptive\u201d under \u00a7 2 of G. L. c. 93A. See 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.16 (3).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> But a plaintiff seeking a remedy under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, must demonstrate that even a per se deception caused a loss. <em>Leardi </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>is not to the contrary, as we shall explain.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">As previously discussed, in the wake of the 1979 amendments to G. L. c. 93 A, and the legislative overruling of <em>Baldassari, </em>it was abundantly clear that a person was \u201cinjured\u201d under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, when an unfair or deceptive act caused loss of money, loss of property, or personal injury. Then in <em>Leardi, </em>this court considered whether, in light of the 1979 amendment, the term \u201cinjury\u201d now encompassed another form of loss, \u201cthe invasion of any legally protected interest of another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 159, quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 7 (1965). (The court specifically noted that <em>Leardi </em>was an appeal that \u201cinvolves the interpretation of a recent amendment to G. L. c. 93A.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 152.) In that case, a residential landlord had included statutorily noncompliant provisions in standard apartment leases with his residential tenants. The terms of the lease misled the tenants as to the landlord\u2019s statutory obligation to maintain the premises in habitable condition. <em>Id. </em>at 156-158. For example, the lease terms provided that the rented premises \u201cshall be conclusively presumed\u201d to be in \u201cgood, tenantable order\u201d unless the tenant notified the landlord of any unlawful conditions within two days of occupancy. <em>Id. </em>at 157. That provision was contrary to the State sanitary code. The court concluded that the statutorily noncompliant leases could be the basis for injury under G. L. c. 93A. <em>Id. </em>at 158-160.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\"><em>Leardi </em>thus established that, in the wake of the 1979 amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>ment to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, a claim of \u201cinjury\u201d now encompassed \u201cthe invasion of any legally protected interest of another,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 159, just as it now encompassed severe emotional stress, see <em>Haddad </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, supra, </em>or personal injury, see <em>Maillet </em>v. <em>ATF-Davidson Co., supra. </em>What <em>Leardi </em>did not do was to eliminate the required causal connection between the deceptive act and an adverse consequence or loss. In <em>Leardi, </em>the requisite causal connection was established: confronted by unhabitable conditions, the illegal lease terms would deter tenants from exercising their legal rights on pain of loss of their tenancy. Stated differently, the illegal lease terms acted as a powerful obstacle to a tenant\u2019s exercise of his legal rights. If a tenant challenged unhabitable conditions by withholding rent, for example, he faced immediate eviction. The mere existence of statutorily prohibited lease provisions placed all tenants in a worse and untenable position than they would have been had the leases complied with the requirements of Massachusetts law.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">In marked contrast, the statutorily noncompliant terms in Enterprise\u2019s automobile rental contracts did not and could not deter the plaintiffs from asserting any legal rights. Nor did the plaintiffs experience any other claimed economic or noneconomic loss. The CDW made neither rental customer worse off <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>during the rental period than he or she would have been had the CDW complied in full with the requirements of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32E \u00bd.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Assuming that the Enterprise CDW was per se unfair and <em>deceptive </em>because it did not comply with \u00a7 32E \u00bd, see 940 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.16 (3), the plaintiffs have nevertheless failed to establish that the \u201cper se\u201d deception caused a loss. For that reason, there can be no recovery under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9 (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The absence of any causal connection between the deception and any loss readily distinguishes this case from <em>Aspinall </em>v. <em>Philip Morris Cos., supra, </em>our most recent consideration of the \u201cinjury\u201d aspect of G. L. c. 93A. There, deceptive advertising to the contrary, the members of the plaintiff class purchased \u201clight\u201d cigarettes that, in most instances, delivered as much or more tar and nicotine as regular cigarettes. <em>Id. </em>at 402. As the deceptive advertising \u201ccould reasonably be found to have caused a person to act differently from the way he [or she] otherwise would have acted,\u201d causation was established. <em>Id. </em>at 394, quoting <em>Purity Supreme, Inc. </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>380 Mass. 762, <em>777 </em>(1980) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Under the plaintiffs\u2019 theory of \u201cinjury,\u201d any consumer contract, oral or written, that violates the requirement of law in any respect, i.e., is noncompliant with any statute, rule regulation or court decision, automatically constitutes an \u201cinjury\u201d under G.

The statutory damage provision does not supplant the requirement to prove causation under \u00a7 9. It merely eliminates the need to quantify an amount of actual damages if the plaintiff can establish a cognizable loss caused by a deceptive act. See, e.g., <em>Ciardi </em>v. <em>Hoffman-La Roche, Ltd., </em>436 Mass. 53, 66-67 n.20 (2002) (\u201cTo the extent that the plaintiff is able to prevail on the issue of liability but is unable to prove actual damages, the Legislature has decided that she is entitled to a specified remedy\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b817-9\">By describing the facts at issue in <em>Leardi </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>394 Mass. 151, 158 (1988) <em>(Leardi), </em>we do not suggest that the holding of that case is limited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>landlord-tenant actions.

In that case the plaintiff alleged that an automobile dealership failed to disclose various defects in the automobile it had sold to him and to honor its promise to repair the defects. Distinguishing the G. L. c. 93A cause of action from a common-law action for deceit and fraud, the court noted that, in a G. L. c. 93A action, \u201cproof of actual reliance by the plaintiff on a representation is not required.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 703. See also <em>Heller Fin. </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of N.

There is nothing to suggest that the unlawful language contained in the Enterprise rental contract influenced or affected the renters in any way.

The Legislature\u2019s silence more likely reflects its agreement with the consumer protection regulations promulgated at that time by the Attorney General: an act that violates a consumer statute is per se deceptive under G.

I agree with the court that private action pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, requires proof of a causal connection between a deceptive act and injury to a consumer. <em>Ante </em>at 797. The plaintiffs in the present case have not offered proof of an injury. Private action pursuant to \u00a7 9 is thus not available. \u201cThe statutory language, when clear and unambiguous, must be given its ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Bronstein </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>390 Mass. 701, 704 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">I write separately because the court fails to overrule expressly the contrary holding of <em>Leardi </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>394 Mass. 151, 152 (1985) <em>(Leardi). </em>In the <em>Leardi </em>case, a fact situation similar to that in today\u2019s case yielded an opposite result. Insofar as the court suggests today that <em>Leardi, supra, </em>remains a viable precedent, <em>ante </em>at 798-800, its opinion can only engender confusion among those who rely on our decisions for guidance. I believe the time has arrived to put the <em>Leardi </em>decision to rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>The problem with <em>Leardi, supra, </em>was its determination that the plaintiffs suffered an injury cognizable under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, although the harm they suffered was wholly speculative and abstract. The <em>Leardi </em>court described this supposed injury as an \u201cinvasion of any legally protected interest of another,\u201d <em>Leardi, supra </em>at 159, quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 7 (1965), but to the extent this phrase has any meaning at all, it does not comport with the injury requirement of \u00a7 9. None of the plaintiff tenants in the <em>Leardi </em>case suffered harm as harm is traditionally understood. They lost no money or other benefit, and they made no complaint with respect to the conditions of their apartments. <em>Id. </em>at 153-154. Recovery for plaintiffs such as those in the <em>Leardi </em>case was not contemplated by \u00a7 9, the purpose of which was to allow recovery to consumers who have actually been injured by an unlawful trade practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Today, the court seeks to preserve the status of the <em>Leardi </em>decision by distinguishing it from the instant case on two grounds. First, the court suggests that the circumstances of the cases differ in their potential for injury to the respective plaintiffs. The court states that in the present case, the \u201cstatutorily noncompliant terms in Enterprise\u2019s automobile rental contracts . . . could not deter the plaintiffs from asserting any legal rights.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 800. This is true in a limited sense. Certain speculative events must first occur before the plaintiffs could assert their rights: the rental vehicles must have been damaged and Enterprise must have inappropriately sought recovery pursuant to the unlawful provision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Ante </em>at 793-794. In contrast, in the earlier <em>Leardi </em>case, the court suggests today that the deterrent effect of the deceptive apartment lease provisions at issue actually \u201cmisled the tenants as to the landlord\u2019s statutory obligation to maintain the premises in a habitable condition.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">However, despite the court\u2019s suggestion otherwise, the salient facts of the cases are quite similar. In neither case did the plaintiffs show they had occasion to exercise the rights that were negated by the deceptive practices of the defendants. The two necessary preconditions for injury in the instant case have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>been described. In the <em>Leardi </em>case, the plaintiffs would have had no occasion to enforce their relevant rights unless their apartments were unsanitary or unhabitable and the landlord failed to honor the pertinent statutory obligations. <em>Id. </em>at 154, 156-157 (noting tenants conceded landlord never attempted to enforce offending portions of lease). See <em>ante </em>at 799-800 &amp; n.20. In other words, the plaintiffs in both cases showed that contractual arrangements violated their statutory rights, and, in both cases, the applicability of the unlawful provisions was speculative and uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The court\u2019s effort to distinguish the cases seems to me to arise not so much from analytical conviction but from a desire to avoid acknowledging that <em>Leardi </em>was wrongly decided. It also, unfortunately, might be read to revive a tenuous distinction regarding the nature of events that might give rise to claims by plaintiffs, specifically, the passive failure by the defendant in Leardi, <em>supra, </em>to do what was necessary to comply with habitability requirements versus an active effort by Enterprise to recover damages from the renter of a vehicle. However, we have disfavored artificial distinctions between action and inaction in the past. See, e.g., <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>373 Mass. 208, 221 (1977) (abandoning \u201cmisfeasance-nonfeasance distinction as a relevant factor\u201d in determining municipal immunity because it lacked \u201creal connection with sound reasoning or policy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">A second distinction made by the court is also unpersuasive: the <em>Leardi </em>case involved misleading apartment lease provisions that would have \u201cacted as a powerful obstacle to a tenant\u2019s exercise of his legal rights.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 800. By contrast, the court suggests, with respect to the present case, that Enterprise\u2019s contract language was not as serious a deterrent to the exercise of the legal rights of these plaintiffs. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">Several problems are apparent with this subtle reasoning. Section 9 does not distinguish for purposes of recovery between injuries that are serious in nature (\u201cpowerful obstacle[s] to . . . [the] exercise of . . . legal rights\u201d) and injuries that are less serious. Generally, any actual harm from a deceptive business practice within the meaning of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2, will confer private rights pursuant to \u00a7 9. See <em>ante </em>at n.20. Furthermore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>even if \u00a7 9 did recognize such a difference, it is not present in the comparison of these cases. The threat created by the improper <em>Leardi </em>lease provisions was their tendency to deceive tenants as to their lawful rights. See <em>Leardi, supra </em>at 156 (lease provision \u201cclearly tends to deceive tenants\u201d). The same is true here. The possibility that the provisions in the <em>Leardi </em>case would have tended also to intimidate tenants from asserting their rights, as suggested today by the court, <em>ante </em>at 799-800, was, perhaps, a secondary concern. However, in this respect the cases are similar also. In the present case, the prospect of protracted and potentially ruinously expensive litigation against a large organization such as Enterprise for the purpose of determining allocation of damages would present a formidable deterrent to a typical consumer who sought to enforce statutory rights. In any event, this entire line of inquiry into the magnitude of the potential injury is unworkable. Reliance on an examination that is so vague and wholly subjective seems inadvisable.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">With today\u2019s decision, the case law pertaining to the elements of an action under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, becomes unnecessarily confused. To the extent that today\u2019s decision and the <em>Leardi </em>case can be reconciled at all, they appear to stand for the proposition that private action may accrue from an unlawful business practice where the practice causes only a speculative, theoretical \u201cinvasion of a legally protected interest,\u201d except that such an invasion does not occur if it is contingent on affirmative, and not passive, conduct, or if the potential effect of the invasion is not \u201cpowerful\u201d in the court\u2019s view. There will inevitably follow more litigation that will generate additional distinctions without differences. The truth is that today <em>Leardi </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>has been overruled as it should be, but sub silentio. While he disagrees with the outcome, Justice Greaney, in his dissent, makes the same observation. <em>Post </em>at 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Stare decisis alone will not obviate the need to admit that the accumulation of experience has proved an earlier holding to be ill advised. \u201cNo court is infallible . . . .\u201d <em>Stonehill College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>441 Mass. 549, 562 (2004). There are myriad opinions where we have over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>ruled earlier decisions after concluding that the holding on an issue is no longer correct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\"><em>Leardi </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>should also be expressly overruled. Its holding diverged markedly from the language of \u00a7 9, which plainly requires a showing of injury as we have traditionally understood the concept: proof that the plaintiff has, in fact, been harmed. The Legislature never intended \u00a7 9 to allow a plaintiff who has not been adversely affected to recover nominal damages leading to attorney\u2019s fees that may eclipse that damage award many times over. See, e.g., <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 309, 313-314 (2004) (reviewing nominal damage award of $25 that resulted in further award of $9,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and $2,170 in litigation costs). The <em>Leardi </em>decision itself acknowledged that \u00a7 9 did not authorize \u201cvicarious suits by self-constituted private attomeys-general,\u201d <em>Leardi </em>v. <em>Brown, supra </em>at 161, quoting <em>Baldassari </em>v. <em>Public Fin. Trust, </em>369 Mass. 33, 46 (1975). Thus, for the reasons stated, while I am convinced that the court\u2019s decision today is correct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>I respectfully must decline to join so much of the opinion as fails to overrule expressly the holding of <em>Leardi </em>v. <em>Brown.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b821-7\">Of course, there was no showing that either event actually did occur or was likely to occur.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Some of our more recent decisions overruling previous holdings are as follows: <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cong Due Le, </em>444 Mass. 431, 432 (2005) (eyewitness identification), overruling in part <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>393 Mass. 55, 60-63 (1984); <em>Knott </em>v. <em>Racicot, </em>442 Mass. 314, 322-323 (2004) (sealed contract doctrine), overruling <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Norton Hous.

Despite the defendant\u2019s efforts to characterize the unfair and deceptive provisions as a \u201cmistake,\u201d the provisions were inserted, apparently intentionally, to cancel, in defined circumstances, the right of a purchaser of a CDW to recover on its protection, if an accident occurred while the purchaser was lawfully using the rental vehicle. For this nonprotection, the defendant received a steady stream of income, pocketing an extra $14.99 (or more) a day from customers, such as the plaintiffs, who purchased CDWs that were illusory and void. The defendant\u2019s conduct represents the precise kind of double dealing and trickery prohibited by G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32E <em>\u00bd, </em>and G. L. c. 93A. The plaintiffs are entitled to pursue their action. The court\u2019s conclusion that no \u201cinjury\u201d exists nullifies a major purpose of G. L. c. 93A, and grants carte blanche to businesses, like the defendant, to prey on unsophisticated consumers as they pocket unearned charges. I, therefore, dissent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">The Legislature intended G. L. c. 93A to be \u201ca statute of broad impact which creates new substantive rights and provides new procedural devices for the enforcement of those rights.\u201d <em>Ciardi </em>v. <em>F. Hoffinann-LaRoche, Ltd., </em>436 Mass. 53, 58 (2002), quoting <em>Linthicum </em>v. <em>Archambault, </em>379 Mass. 381, 383 (1979). This court has repeatedly recognized that, in amending the statutory requirement of injury in the wake of <em>Baldassari </em>v. <em>Public Fin. Trust, </em>369 Mass. 33 (1975), the Legislature \u201csubstantially broadened the class of persons who could maintain actions under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9.\u201d <em>Leardi </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>394 Mass. 151, 158-159 (1985) <em>(Leardi), </em>quoting <em>Van Dyke </em>v. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>388 Mass. 671, 675 (1983). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>After careful consideration of the 1979 amendments, the <em>Leardi </em>court construed the term \u201cinjury,\u201d in the context of G. L. c. 93A, to denote \u201can invasion of a legally protected interest.\u201d See <em>Leardi, supra </em>at 160. The defining principle of that case is that a plaintiff need not demonstrate an ascertainable loss of money or property, or suffer actual personal injury, in order to recover under G. L. c. 93A. In <em>Leardi, </em>and again in <em>Aspinall </em>v. <em>Philip Morris Cos., </em>442 Mass. 381 (2004), we broadly declared that it is enough that a consumer has been wronged in a discernible way. See <em>id. </em>at 401; <em>Leardi, supra. </em>See also <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Home Depot, </em>436 Mass. 210, 211-212, 216 (2002) (implicitly agreeing with conclusion of District Court judge that plaintiff had suffered \u201cinvasion of a legally protected interest\u201d when Home Depot violated item pricing regulation). The court today retreats from those declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">The court\u2019s failure to recognize the \u201cinjury\u201d suffered by the plaintiffs misapprehends what occurred here. The express terms of the rental agreements misrepresented the plaintiffs\u2019 rights to use the rental vehicles in ways that were permitted by law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs paid additional daily charges for illusory CDW protection. In the plainest terms, the plaintiffs paid money to the defendants to buy nothing of value and, moreover, were unlawfully restricted to limited use of the vehicles. The suggestion that the plaintiffs are \u201cself-constituted private attorneys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>general\u201d is way off the mark.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Ante </em>at 806. It is undisputed that Enterprise imposed objectively false and statutorily prohibited terms into the rental agreements purchased by the plaintiffs. The efforts of the court to distinguish <em>Leardi </em>are transparently feeble.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I agree with that part of the separate opinion of Justice Cowin which states that there is no meaningful way that this case can be distinguished from Leardi, and that the substance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>injury in this case and in <em>Leardi </em>are, for all legal purposes, the same. Further, the Legislature presumably is aware of <em>Leardi </em>and, in the twenty years since that case was decided, it has not indicated any intent to modify the \u201cinjury\u201d requirement of the statute to limit the requirement in the way the court has done today. The Legislature, as noted above, acted promptly to change G. L. c. 93A in response to the <em>Baldassari </em>decision. The Legislature\u2019s quick action there, and its lack of action after <em>Leardi, </em>is some indication that the <em>Leardi </em>facts, and, a fortiori, what occurred here, present discernible injuries within the meaning of the redefinition enacted by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Now that the court has effectively set aside the principles stated in the <em>Leardi </em>and <em>Aspinall </em>cases, companies will be insulated against liability for certain types of consumer fraud that are patently unfair or deceptive. General Laws c. 93A will be unavailable as a remedy to those aggrieved by, for example, repeated and unwanted telephone calls; the failure to provide disclosures mandated by law; or (as here) the sale of products accompanied by contractual provisions that are unlawful or limit the use of the product. The list could go and on. Unless the unfair or deceptive conduct results in monetary loss beyond the loss that occurred here, or personal injury, the conduct may be unconscionable, but an aggrieved plaintiff will be unable to satisfy the heightened \u201cinjury\u201d requirement the court today reads into the statute. The court\u2019s result is a defeat for Massachusetts consumers and a major victory for businesses that choose to cheat them.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-7\"> I agree with the court\u2019s analysis of the preemption issue. <em>Ante </em>at 795-797.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Enterprise submitted affidavits stating that it never relied on statutorily prohibited exclusions to deny a customer CDW protection, and asserted at oral argument that \u201cthe record is undisputed\u201d that Enterprise enforces only those exclusions that the law allows. This assertion is not accurate. In their memorandum in opposition to Enterprise\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the plaintiffs cited to three separate actions in New York and New Jersey where Enterprise subsidiaries were determined to have pursued renters for damages in circumvention of the law, see <em>ELRAC, Inc. </em>v. <em>Britto, </em>341 N.J. Super. 400 (2001); <em>ELRAC, Inc. </em>v. <em>Giordano, </em>177 Misc. 2d 545 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1998); <em>ELRAC, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>186 Misc. 2d 67 (N.Y. County Ct. 2000), and to a complaint filed, in May, 2000, by the Attorney General of New York, alleging Enterprise\u2019s failure to provide minimum coverage required by State law through the use of illegal contractual language. The plaintiffs stated in their memorandum: \u201cThe pattern of Enterprise\u2019s behavior is disturbing, and its chutzpah in representing to this court that it has found religion, at least in Massachusetts, astounding. Its affidavits about its enforcement practices cannot be given credence in light of its duplicitous history, certainly not without providing [the plaintiffs] an opportunity for discovery to test those affidavits.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b827-5\">That now familiar phrase was used for the first time by this court in <em>Baldassari </em>v. <em>Public Fin. Trust, </em>369 Mass. 33 (1975), to explain G. L. c. 93A\u2019s requirement at the time that a plaintiff suffer loss of money or property. See <em>id. </em>at 46, quoting Rice, New Private Remedies for Consumers: The Amendment of Chapter 93A, 54 Mass. L.Q. 307, 314 (1969). The quotation reads in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-6\">\u201cAccording to the principal draftsman of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, the \u2018sole purpose\u2019 of the requirement that the plaintiff suffer loss of money or property \u2018is to guard against vicarious suits by self-constituted private attorneys general when they spot an apparently deceiving advertisement in the newspaper, on television or in a store window.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-7\"><em>Baldassari </em>v. <em>Public Fin. Trust, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">It was repeated, as a caution, in <em>Leardi </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>394 Mass. 151 (1985) <em>(Leardi), </em>lest that court\u2019s broad interpretation of the 1979 amendments be misunderstood to do away with G. L. c. 93A\u2019s \u201cinjury\u201d requirement altogether. The court then made the following pronouncement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-9\">\u201cOne could hardly characterize the relationship of these plaintiffs [in Leardi] to the illegal lease at issue here as vicarious. We need not, and do not, decide whether we would reach a similar result under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 9, in other circumstances. . . . Here, the plaintiffs are tenants of the defendants, and the illegality of the defendants\u2019 lease is the subject of the instant c. 93A action.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">Viewed in context, the <em>Leardi </em>court\u2019s use of the term \u201cself-constituted private attomey[]-general\u201d can only be understood to mean someone who recognizes what may be a questionable commercial practice in the marketplace, but, as a bystander who did not participate in the transaction, was completely unaffected by any unfair conduct. The plaintiffs, who purchased CDWs from the defendants that were admittedly unlawful, cannot fairly be said to fall within this category.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b827-12\">In concluding today that an illegal consumer contract (the invasion of a legally protected interest) cannot constitute an injury under G. L. c. 93A unless a plaintiff demonstrates an ascertainable loss, the court appears to limit the reach of the <em>Leardi </em>holding to the circumstances of that case. <em>Ante </em>at 799-800. This is surprising. We recently held to the contrary. See <em>Aspinall </em>v. <em>Philip Morris Cos., </em>442 Mass. 381, 401 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
