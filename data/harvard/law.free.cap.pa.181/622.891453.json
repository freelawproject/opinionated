On March 16, 1895, an affidavit was filed that a mistake had been made in the bringing of the suit, in the names of the parties defendant, and the court then allowed the record to be amended by adding the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company, the county of Lehigh and the township of Whitehall as codefendants with the said Allentown &amp; Bethlehem Rapid Transit Company, and an alias summons issued against the parties so made co-defendants, which was duly served upon them. The county of Lehigh objected to being made a party. The court overruled the objection. A new statement of cause of action was then filed. A rule to plead was then entered, and all the defendants pleaded under protest. At the trial it appeared that the approaches to the bridge had been constructed by the county, which had been indemnified against loss by the transit company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-8\">The county presented inter alia the following points :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b645-9\">1.

There was no evidence of any joint liability or tort, and the defendant, the county of Lehigh, being simply added and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>brought in after the inception of the suit, there can be no verdict against the said county of Lehigh. <em>Answer: </em>Negatived.

Tins point we decide against the county, and we instruct you that if the plaintiff has suffered injuries by reason of that, which you can consider on that point, you can find against county of Lehigh. I instruct you that there can be no finding here against the transit company, nor against the township, nor against the Lehigh Valley Railroad.] [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-6\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff against the county of Lehigh for $1,400.

This we do not believe is embraced within the powers given the courts to exercise: Leonard v. Parker, 72 Pa. 236; Rangler v. Hummel, 37 Pa. 130; Cochran v. Arnold, 58 Pa. 399; First Nat. Bank v.

That for such injuries the county is liable in a proper action is beyond dispute: Chester County v. Brower, 117 Pa. 647.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b647-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>A mistake may at any time be corrected by amendment, whether it arises from mistake of law or fact: Beringer v.

Rosenzweig, 144 Pa. 520.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ARG\">July 15, 1897 :</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AuQ\">Mr. Justice G-been,</author>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The learned counsel for the appellant, with entire candor, concedes that if the plaintiff suffered damage and had brought an action of case instead of an action of trespass, the county would be responsible. This was certainly ruled by this court in County of Chester v. Brower, 117 Pa. 647. But .they contend that no recovery can be had in an action of trespass, and they complain that the county was brought in by way of amendment, not having been made a party at the inception of the \u2018suit. So far as the amendment as to parties is concerned it is not before us-because no assignment of error has been made on that ground. But the county was brought in by means of an alias summons duly served, and appeared by counsel and pleaded to issue, and went to trial on the merits. Thereafter it could not be claimed that the county was not duly a party and bound by the proceedings. We do not concede that the amendment was not properly granted but it is not necessary to discuss the question for the reason above stated. The only matter seriously discussed by the appellant is the right to recover in the present form of action. It must be conceded that there would have been much force in the appellant\u2019s contention prior to the passage of the Procedure \u2022 Act of May 25, 1887, P. L. 271, abolishing all distinctions between trespass and case. But in the case of Duffield v. Rosenzweig, 144 Pa. 520, we held that the effect of the act of 1887 was to abolish the distinctions between these actions, and that a recovery might be had in either form. Mr. Justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Clark, delivering the opinion said, \u201cWe are of opinion that perhaps an action of trespass technically so called, could not have been maintained, but by the Act of May 25, 1887, P. L. 271, the distinctions theretofore existing between actions of trespass, trespass on the case and trover, so far as they relate to procedure, were abolished, and although the plaintiff\u2019s statement sets forth his claim as in trespass, we cannot, in view of the provisions of the statute, distinguish in the form of the procedure one from the other. If the facts establish his right to recover in either form, therefore, he is entitled to judgment.\u201d It is true in the present case the action is in trespass, but the injury is consequential, and therefore at common law the remedy should have been in case. But the act of 1887 was intended to, and did, effect a radical change in the common law upon this subject, and as-held in the above cited case, a recovery may be had in the action of trespass although the injury sustained was formerly remediable only in case. As to the fact and quantum of the injury the verdict is conclusive. The assignments of error are not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"AYcV\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"A4Q\">Dissenting opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A6T2\">Mr. Justice Mitchell :</author>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">, I am unable 'to concur in this judgment. It sanctions a change which is not an amendment at all, but a substitution of a new cause of action against a new party, a perversion of the statutes of amendment going far beyond any precedent however liberal. It is no answer to say that the count}'- appeared \u00e1nd thereafter is estopped from denying that it was a proper party. It had no choice in the matter. It was served with an alias summons, and pleaded under protest after the court had overruled its objection to being made party by the so-called amendment. These facts appear on the face of the record and are brought before us by the second assignment of error. The appellant may be liable for damage done to plaintiff but that fact should be ascertained by a proper action properly brought against it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
