Respondents deny the correctness of the facts stated in the sixth and seventh paragraphs thereof. As to the facts stated in the eighth paragraph in the said petition, respondents answer and say, that under the terms of the will of Ecldey B. Coxe, deceased, the collateral inheritance tax, due the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, did not become due and payable one year from the date of the death of the decedent, on May 13,1896, with interest thereon as stated\u2014 as they are advised by counsel.

Coxe.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-8\">That the respondents are advised by counsel that under the laws of the state of Pennsylvania regulating the payment of collateral inheritance tax and the provisions of the last will and testament of Eckley B.

Coxe are executors of'his will. He left a widow, Sophia G. Coxe, but no children nor their descendants. By his will, after giving his wife the personal property in and about his home, except his professional library, he gave to his executors, the successor of them and their heirs, all his estate in trust; (1) to pay over to his wife the entire net income thereof during the whole term of her natural life; (2) from and immediately after her death to \u201c hold the same in trust for all my nephews and nieces, children of my brothers, Brinton Coxe, dec\u2019d, Alexander B. Coxe, Henry B. Coxe and Charles B. Coxe, deceased,\u201d etc. Thus, after the death of the widow the entire estate is given collateral heirs. And as will be seen, by reference to the will, the remaindermen cannot be identified until after the death of the widow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-6\">June 18,1895, inventory-and appraisement of personal estate filed by said executors, amounting to $1,311,737.61. Also itemizing a large amount of property, of which the value is said to be \u201cnot ascertainable.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-7\">It appears that an appraiser has been appointed in said estate to fix the value thereof, for the purpose of assessing the collateral inheritance tax, but that he has made no return, except as to the value of certain legacies, given under a nuncupative will probated November 22,1895. Said legacies amounted to $28,000 appraised at $22,000, upon which the legatees took the benefit of the act of assembly, May 6, 1887, P. L. 79, and paid the tax May 26, 1896. After the expiration of the life estate the residuum,- less debts and expenses of settlement, is subject to the collateral inheritance tax. The question is, when is the tax on this personal estate assessable and payable?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-8\">Section three, act of assembly, May 6, 1887, reads : \u201c In all cases where there has been or shall be a devise, descent or bequest to collateral relatives or strangers liable to the collateral inheritance tax, to take effect in possession or come into actual enjoyment after the expiration of one or more life estates, or a period of years, the tax on such estate shall not be payable, nor interest begin to run thereon, until the person or persons liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>for the same shall come into actual possession of such estate, by the termination of the estate for life or years, and the tax shall be assessed upon the value of the estate at the time the right of possession accrues to the owner, as aforesaid.\u201d But the privilege of postponing payment is given upon the following terms: \u201c And the owner of any personal estate shall make a full return of the same to the register of wills of the proper county, within one year from the death of the decedent, and within that time enter into security for the payment of the tax to the satisfaction of the register, and in case of failure so to do the tax shall he immediately payable and collectible'.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-4\">The usual inventory and appraisement has been filed, but no return has been made of the personal property, for the purpose of assessing the collateral inheritance tax, except as to aforesaid legacies, and no security has been' entered by the owners. As above stated it is impossible to identify the remaindermen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-5\">The act of 1887, after stating what estates are liable to the collateral inheritance tax says, \u201c And all owners of such estates, and all executors and administrators and their sureties, shall only be discharged from liability for the amount of such tax or duties, the settlement of which they may be charged with, by having paid the same over for the use aforesaid, as hereinafter directed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-6\">[We sustain the citation and hold and find, that Alexander B.

And, that in default thereof, the said tax has become, and now is immediately due and payable upon all personal properly of said estate, after legal deductions for expenses, life estate, etc., with interest thereon, at the rate of twelve per centum per annum, from the 18th day of May, 1896.] [2] .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-7\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1) in sustaining citation; (2) decree of the court, quoting it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-8\"><em>A. 3.

The life estate to the widow is exempt from the collateral inheritance tax but the entire estate m remainder is liable, and the question presented is whether the tax is now demandable from the executors. By sec. 3 of the Act of May 6, 1887, P. L. 79, the tax on estates in remainder is not payable \u201cuntil the person or persons liable for the same shall come into actual possession of such estate, by the termination of the estates for life or years,\u201d provided that \u201cthe owner shall have the right to pay the tax at any time prior to his coming into possession,\u201d and provided further \u201c that the tax on real estate shall remain a lien on the real estate on which the same is chargeable until paid. And the owner of any personal estate shall make a full return of the same to the register of wills of the proper county, within one year from the death of the decedent, and within that time enter into security for the payment of the tax to the satisfaction of such register, and in case of failure so to do, the tax shall be immediately payable and collecti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>ble.\u201d It is under this last clause that the commonwealth claims that the tax in the present case is now collectible and the learned court b\u00e9low has held that the executors are the owners liable for its payment. This construction however cannot be sustained without doing violence to the letter as well as the plain intent of the statute. The tax is not payable until \u201cthe person liable for the same \u201d shall come into actual possession. This cannot possibly mean anyone but the remainderman, for he is the only one to come into actual possession by the termination of the precedent estate for life or years. And in the proviso which adds that the \u201c owner shall have the right to pay the tax .at any time prior to his coming into actual possession,\u201d the \u201c owner \u201d must for the same reason be the remainderman, for he is \u201cthe person liable for the same,\u201d and the only one who is to come into possession. And when in the second proviso \u201c the owner of any personal estate \u201d is directed to make a full return of the same and enter security for the payment of the tax, and in case of failure to do so the tax is to become immediately payable, the \u201c owner \u201d meant is the same person as in the preceding clauses, the person liable to pay, and the person who is to come hereafter into actual possession, i. e. the remainderman. The intent of the statute is to charge the beneficiary of the estate, and whether the phrase used is \u201c person liable\u201d or person who \u201cshall come into actual possession\u201d or \u201c owner \u201d it always means the same person, the remainderman. It is to him alone that the commonwealth must look for present payment of tax on property, whether real or personal, the actual possession or enjoyment of which is postponed by an intervening period of life or years. Under the act executors and administrators are charged with the duty of deducting the tax before payment of legacies or distributive shares or the delivery of specific articles bequeathed, and therefore under some circumstances they may be considered as persons liable to pay the tax, but they are notin any sense \u201cowners \u201d within the language of section three. They cannot be compelled to make present payment of the tax on estates in remainder, for the very obvious reasons that they are not the parties primarily charged with the payment, either present or future, they are not responsible for the owner\u2019s default of return and security which makes the future tax payable immediately, and in the present case they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>cannot pay it now without taking it out of the widow\u2019s estate which is not liable to the tax at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">It is said that the remaindermen under the testator\u2019s will are not now ascertainable. On this we express no opinion. The commonwealth disputes this position, but the parties charged by it as remaindermen are not before us. All we need to say now is that if the remaindermen are not yet ascertainable, that is no reason why the tax should be collected from the life tenant who is exempt. The only effect of such condition would be that the tax would not be presently collectible at all, and the commonwealth would have to depend on its lien on the real estate, and its claim on the executors when they make distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Decree reversed and petition dismissed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
