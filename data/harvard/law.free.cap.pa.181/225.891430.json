D. 1841, which was duly proved, and remains of record in the office of the register\u2019 of wills in and for said county, in will book D, page 8, etc., in and by which he devised, inter alia, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-9\">\u2022 \u201c Eighthly: \u2014 I give and devise to the before mentioned Perry C.

Pike for life. A citation was issued and duly served on all parties in interest, and John B. Hinkson, Esq., was appointed trustee to make sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AbZ\">Sale was made by John B. Hinkson, who was appointed by the court, trustee to make sale. John B. Hinkson upon his own petition was discharged <em>from </em>the trust, and Thomas Lees, the defendant, duly appointed, and the funds turned over to him.. At the time of said sale the said Perry C. Pike had three children living, Pearson, Isaac S. and Priscilla. In March, 1874, \u201con account of natural love and affection,\u201d Perry C. Pike authorized the trustee to pay to each of his children (Isaac S., Pearson and Priscilla), the interest of $5,000 of the principal. After the decease of Pearson, Perry C. Pike in January, 1875, authorized the trustee to pay to the executors of Pearson the share of income Pearson would have received under the paper of March, 1874, if he were still living. In April, 1882, Perry C. Pike, his son. Isaac S. and daughter Priscilla and the executors of Pearson revoked the foregoing papers of 1874 and 1875, and authorized the trustee to divide the income of the whole principal among them as follows: one half tobe paid to Perry C. Pike, and the other half thereof to be divided into three equal parts, one of which should be payable to the said Isaac S. Pike, another to the said Priscilla Pike, and the other to Isaac S. Pike and Joseph It. Johnson, executors of the last will and testament of Pearson Pike, deceased; and the income has been so divided until now, Perry getting one half, Isaac S. and Priscilla each a sixth, and the executors of Pearson getting a sixth, until Lizzie May Pike arrived at full age, since which time she got a sixth up to the time of her decease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>The said Pearson Pike died before his father, but after the death of John L.

Pike\u2019s other son and daughter are now living and are both of full age, but no other descendants. Pearson Pike died in 1874, having first made his last will and testament wherein and whereby he did give and devise as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b250-5\">\u201cItem.

It involves the construction of the eighth clause of the will of John L. Pearson, deceased, of whose estate the defendant is trustee. By the clause in question the testator devised the real estate therein described to Perry C. Pike during his life and after his death \u201c to his lawful child or children and to their heirs and assigns.\u201d As it appears from the case stated that Perry. C. Pike died leaving lawful issue, and that his sons, his daughter, and his granddaughter attained the age of twenty-one years, the principal question for our determination is when did the estate in remainder vest in his children. The defendant claims that it did not vest \u201c until after his death,\u201d and the plaintiff claims that as Perry C. Pike had no children at the death of the testator it was contingent until tbe bii'th of a child to him, at which time it vested, subject to open and let in after born children and subject also to a contingency which might divest it.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">It seems to us that the plaintiff\u2019s claim accords with the true interpretation of the devise and the decisions in like cases: Keller v. Lees, 176 Pa. 402; Blanchard v. Blanchard, 1 Allen (Mass.), 227. But it makes no difference in the result in this case whether the estate vested in the children at their birth or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>on their attaining the age of twenty-one years. The contingency on the happening of which the estate might have passed, under the will, to the children of Price or of Smith was the death of the life tenant \u201c without leaving lawful issue to survive him, or leaving such issue who should not live to the age of twenty-one years, nor their lawful issue.\u201d The contingency did not occur and, therefore, the only persons now interested in the estate or in the question when the remainder vested are the children of the life tenant and their heirs and assigns.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Perry C. Pike had three children who in his lifetime attained the age of twenty-one years. One of them, Pearson Pike, died in the lifetime of his father. He left to survive him a daughter who attained full age and died before the life tenant. The fund created by the sale, under the Price act, of the land devised as aforesaid, was in existence in the lifetime of Pearson Pike, and he was receiving, interest by direction of his father on $5,000 of it. Tire fund was a substitute for the land sold. What was the interest of Pearson Pike in this fund? We think it was a vested interest which could not be divested, if at all, except by the occurrence of the contingency on which the devise over depended. The extent of the interest could not have been definitely ascertained at his death because it might be reduced by the birth of other children entitled to share in the fund. It was, however, .a descendible and devisable interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The devise in question was to the lawful child or children of the life tenant and to their heirs and assigns. It was a devise to the whole class without restriction to the member or members who survived him. It was unlike the devise in any case cited by the defendant to sustain his contention that the interest of the children of Perry C. Pike did not vest until after his death. The contest for the fund being virtually between the devisee of the daughter of Pearson Pike and the surviving son and daughter of Perry C. Pike, there is no room for the application of the rule or principle for which Stewart\u2019s Estate, 147 Pa. 383, is cited as authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">For the reasons above - stated we concur in the conclusion of the learned court below that the plaintiff is entitled to one third of the principal, and one sixth of the income, as defined by the case stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
