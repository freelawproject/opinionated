Ct. L.A. County No. A449187.)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Procedural and Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">In 1977 appellant, then 18 years old, having been found not guilty by reason of insanity of voluntary manslaughter, was committed to a state hospital. While there, another patient reportedly stole some of his money. Appellant retaliated by stabbing him with a steak knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">The district attorney charged appellant with assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)) and with causing great bodily injury (\u00a7 12022.7).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">On September 19, 1980, appellant, represented by counsel, entered into a plea bargain with the district attorney. The bargain was accepted by the court and implemented that same day. Its terms, memorialized both by a signed written statement and a transcript of the oral proceedings, were: appellant would plead nolo contendere and not guilty by reason of insanity. The \u201csanity phase to be submitted on M.D.\u2019s reports.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Court will find defendant NGI .[not guilty by reason of insanity] and commit him to state hospital at Patton.\u201d The agreement included a chart depicting the \u201cmaximum total punishment\u201d appellant could receive as seven years. (Four years for the assault charge and three years for the enhancement.) During the court proceedings the district attorney advised appellant \u201cyou understand as a consequence of this plea that this carries a maximum term of four years in state prison with an additional subsequent three years for great bodily injury allegation making a total of seven years; you understand that?\u201d Appellant stated he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>The court accepted appellant\u2019s pleas, found him not guilty by reason of insanity and ordered him \u201ccommitted to Patton State Hospital until such time as his sanity has been restored . . . period not to exceed the maximum period of time that he could have been imprisoned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The record is barren of any reference to section 1026.5, subdivision (b)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and its authorization of repeated two-year commitment extensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">On February 18, 1987, the district attorney filed a petition pursuant to section 1026.5, subdivision (b) to extend appellant\u2019s commitment. Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition was denied, a hearing was held, the petition was found true, and appellant filed a notice of appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Appellant urges three grounds for invalidating the extended commitment order. All focus on the events of September 19, 1980, the day of his plea bargain and original commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">He contends: 1. The extended commitment order violated the terms of his plea bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">2. Appellant was improperly advised of the consequences of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">3. Appellant was denied effective assistance of counsel by counsel\u2019s failure to advise him his commitment could be extended.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">1. <em>The extended commitment order violated the terms of his plea bargain.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">In <em>Santobello </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1971) 404 U.S. 257 [30 L.Ed.2d 427, 92 S.Ct. 495] the prosecutor induced the defendant to plead guilty by reducing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>charges and by agreeing not to make a sentence recommendation. He then violated that agreement by urging the maximum sentence of one year imprisonment. In reversing the judgment the court held that \u201c. . . when a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor . . . such promise must be fulfilled.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 262 [30 L.Ed.2d at p. 433].)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Similarly, when the court, as part of a plea bargain, said it would obtain a diagnostic report before imposing sentence, and then failed to do so, it committed reversible error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mancheno </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 855 [187 Cal.Rptr. 441, 654 P.2d 211].)  The \u201cintegrity of the process [must] be maintained by insuring that the state keep[s] its word when it offers inducements in exchange for a plea of guilty.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 860.)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Thus if, as part of the bargain which induced appellant to plead nolo contendere and not guilty by reason of insanity, the prosecutor made some promise which he failed to keep, appellant is entitled to specific performance of that promise, to withdraw his pleas, or to some other appropriate relief. (32 Cal.3d at pp. 860-861.)</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">We have examined the signed plea agreement, read the plea proceeding transcript and have found no unkept promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The exchanged promises were that appellant would concede his guilt and the district attorney would concede appellant\u2019s insanity. The mechanisms for these promises were appellant\u2019s nolo contendere and not guilty by reason of insanity pleas and the district attorney\u2019s submitting the sanity issue upon doctors\u2019 reports. The mechanisms were employed, the promises kept, and the objectives achieved. Appellant avoided prison, the district attorney succeeded in having appellant confined.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">The district attorney did state to appellant, both in the signed plea agreement and orally, that the prison term for the enhanced offense was seven years. These statements were not promises nor unkept concessions. They were an accurate statement of maximum punishment. That appellant may have understood, with reason, that he would not and could not be confined in a state hospital for longer than seven years is a separate and different matter (which we next consider). But the district attorney expressly stated, as appellant acknowledges, that there was \u201cno sentence bargain\u201d component to their plea agreement. Thus, appellant could not reasonably believe that the district attorney relinquished any punishment prerogative.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">We conclude that the district attorney\u2019s petition to extend appellant\u2019s commitment did not violate the September 19, 1980, plea bargain nor did the commitment order itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>2. <em>Appellant was improperly advised of the consequences of his plea.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">If <em>People </em>v. <em>Lomboy </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 67 [171 Cal.Rptr. 812] is retroactive the instant judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">In <em>Lomboy </em>the defendant was originally charged with murder. She pleaded not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity and the court advised her that if convicted of murder but found insane she could be confined in a mental institution for life.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">But three months later, pursuant to a plea bargain, the defendant was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter but not guilty by reason of insanity. While the court was determining whether or not the defendant had recovered her sanity the court advised the defendant that her maximum period of confinement was six years. The court did not mention two-year extensions. Defendant was found not to have recovered her sanity and was committed to a state hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\"><em>Lomboy </em>held that the court committed prejudicial error in failing to advise the defendant that being found guilty of manslaughter subjected her to six years confinement but being found not guilty by reason of insanity of manslaughter subjected her to possible confinement for life (six years plus repeated two-year extensions).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\"><em>Lomboy </em>is factually indistinguishable from the instant case except that the defendant in <em>Lomboy, </em>unlike appellant, <em>was </em>initially informed that if found insane she could be committed for life.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant was never so informed. Like the defendant in <em>Lomboy </em>appellant was misinformed about maximum confinement. Both the prosecutor and the court told him the maximum confinement period was seven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Holding that <em>People </em>v. <em>Lomboy </em>is not retroactive is <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Bannister) (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 1525 [250 Cal.Rptr. 909]. <em>Bannister </em>cites the <em>Tahl (In re Tahl </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 122 [81 Cal.Rptr. 577, 460 P.2d 449]) criteria for determining retroactivity: \u201c \u2018(1) The purpose of the new rule; (2) the extent of reliance upon the old rule; and (3) the effect retroactive application would have upon the administration of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 134.)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">Concerning the first criterion, purpose, <em>Bannister </em>is silent. About the second, reliance, <em>Bannister </em>states \u201c[the] plea in this case was made accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>ing to a procedure \u2018upon which trial courts and prosecutors had justifiably relied for decades.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Bannister), supra, </em>203 Cal.App.3d at p. 1529.) Regarding the third, effect upon the administration of justice, <em>Bannister </em>comments: \u201cWe can only guess at the number of individuals who, like Bannister, entered NGI pleas prior to <em>Lomboy, </em>had their commitments extended pursuant to Penal Code section 1026.5, and are still confined in state hospitals or other treatment facilities.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1530.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">An additional reason <em>Bannister </em>gives for holding <em>Lomboy </em>not retroactive is that \u201cin 1980, there was no requirement that individuals ... be advised that they were facing a possible lifetime commitment to the state hospital.\u201d (203 Cal.App.3d at p. 1529.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">We have considered these reasons for the <em>Bannister </em>holding and find them unsupported and unsupportable and therefore respectfully disagree that <em>People </em>v. <em>Lomboy </em>is not retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Our analysis begins with <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, supra, </em>395 U.S. 238. That landmark case held that before a court may accept a guilty plea the record must reflect that the defendant has been advised of and has personally waived his self-incrimination, confrontation, and jury trial rights. <em>(Id., </em>at p.243 [23 L.Ed.2d at p. 279].) More pertinent to our inquiry, the court stated: \u201cWhat is at stake for an accused facing death or imprisonment demands the utmost solicitude of which courts are capable in canvassing the matter with the accused to make sure he has a full understanding of what the plea connotes and of its consequence.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 243-244 [23 L.Ed.2d at p. 280].)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">California courts promptly and consistently implemented this <em>Boykin </em>mandate. <em>In re Tahl, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 122, rejected an inferential interpretation of Boykin<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and instead adopted an interpretation requiring specific advisements and express waivers. The court stated, \u201c. . . the record must contain <em>on its face </em>direct evidence that the accused was aware, or made aware, of his right to confrontation, to a jury trial, and against self-incrimination, as well as the nature of the charge and the consequences of his plea.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 132.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">This responsibility to insure that the defendant was aware of the consequences of his plea was emphasized by <em>Tahl. </em>\u201c. . . it is salutary for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>court ... to explain the full import of his guilty plea to the accused.\u201d (1 Cal.3d at p. 133.) <em>Tahl </em>also adopted this advice: \u201c. . . the trial court is best advised to conduct an on the record examination of the defendant which should include ... an attempt to satisfy itself that the defendant understands . . . the permissible range of sentences.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 133, fn. 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">In 1970, one year after <em>Boykin </em>and <em>Tahl, </em>the California Supreme Court indicated that <em>Boykin </em>applied to \u201cslow plea\u201d trials <em>(In re Mosley </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 913 [83 Cal.Rptr. 809, 464 P.2d 473]) and in 1973 squarely so held <em>(People </em>v. <em>Levey </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 648 [105 Cal.Rptr. 516, 504 P.2d 452]).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">In 1971 <em>People </em>v. <em>Redmond </em>(1971) 16 Cal.App.3d 931 [94 Cal.Rptr. 543], foreshadowing <em>People </em>v. <em>Lomboy, </em>held that when a defendant who was originally charged with felony assault but convicted of misdemeanor assault then moved to withdraw his NGI plea, it was prejudicial error to deny his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">In 1973 <em>Boykin </em>was held applicable to misdemeanors. <em>(Mills </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 288 [110 Cal.Rptr. 329, 515 P.2d 273].) Additionally, the California Supreme Court required trial courts to advise defendants of the lifetime sex-offender registration provisions of section 290. <em>(In re Birch </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 314 [110 Cal.Rptr. 212, 515 P.2d 12].)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">In 1974 the requirement to advise a defendant of the consequences of his guilty plea was held to include admissions of prior felony allegations.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>(In re Yurko </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 857 [112 Cal.Rptr. 513, 519 P.2d 561].)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Also decided in 1974, Seven years prior to <em>People </em>v. <em>Lomboy, </em>was <em>People </em>v. <em>Vanley </em>(1974) 41 Cal.App.3d 846 [116 Cal.Rptr. 446],  In <em>Vanley, </em>much like <em>Lomboy </em>and the instant case, the defendant entered a \u201cslow plea\u201d by submitting guilt on the transcript of the preliminary hearing and sanity on the reports of doctors. He was found guilty of felony joyriding (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851) but insane. On appeal he urged that his NGI plea \u201cshould not have been accepted without the record showing that he was aware of the fact that a successful assertion of the plea could result in an indefinite commitment in a state hospital for a 90-day minimum and a lifetime maximum.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 855.)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">The court stated that this \u201cpoint has merit.\u201d (41 Cal.App.3d at p. 855.) Two supporting sources were relied upon. One was <em>People </em>v. <em>Redmond, supra, </em>16 Cal.App.3d 931. The court stated, \u201cWhat is important is that</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>The other was <em>In re Yurko. </em>The court noted \u201cthe principle of <em>Yurko </em>demands that any defendant who pleads not guilty by reason of insanity be advised that he thereby runs a risk of a possible lifetime commitment.\u201d (41 Cal.App.3d at p. 856.)</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The following year our Supreme Court held that an NGI plea must be personally entered by a defendant, not by counsel, and that a court cannot compel an insanity defense. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gauze </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 709 [125 Cal.Rptr. 773, 542 P.2d 1365].)</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Also in 1975 the court elaborated upon required advisements, stating \u201cIn all guilty plea and submission cases the defendant shall be advised of the direct consequences of conviction such as the permissible range of punishment provided by statute, registration requirements, if any (e.g., \u00a7 290; Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11590), and, in appropriate cases the possibility of commitment pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code, sections 3050, 3051, or 6302. [fl] We are satisfied that compliance with these requirements will not unduly burden trial courts, some of which have anticipated most if not all of the requirements set forth herein.\u201d <em>(Bunnell </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 592, 605 [119 Cal.Rptr. 302, 531 P.2d 1086].) The court then footnoted this reference: \u201cSee, e.g., Los Angeles Superior Court, Criminal Trial Judges\u2019 Benchbook pages 267-274, 279-280.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 605, fn. 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Three years later, in 1978, the Supreme Court approvingly noted the required <em>Vanley </em>advisement and trial court compliance with that requirement: <em>\u201cPeople </em>v. <em>Vanley </em>[cite omitted] required that the court before accepting a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity advise the defendant that the successful assertion of that plea might result in his indefinite commitment to a state hospital. The trial court here complied with that requirement.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wetmore </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 318, at p. 322, fn. 2 [149 Cal.Rptr. 265, 583 P.2d 1308].)</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">Less than a month after <em>Wetmore </em>the Supreme Court further protected persons acquitted of criminal charges because of insanity. The court stated that \u201cwell established constitutional principles of equal protection require that the duration of institutional confinement of such persons cannot exceed the maximum term for the underlying offense, unless the People or other committing authority establish grounds for an extended commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>ment. . .<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>(In re Moye </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 457, 460 [149 Cal.Rptr. 491, 584 P.2d 1097].)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Urgency legislation, including section 1026.5, subdivision (b), incorporating the mandates of <em>In re Moye </em>was enacted and became effective September 28, 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">It was a year after this legislation, on September 19, 1980, that appellant entered his nolo contendere and \u201cslow NGI\u201d pleas. Five months after that <em>People </em>v. <em>Lomboy </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">To summarize: 10 years before <em>Lomboy </em>its decision was foreshadowed by <em>People </em>v. <em>Redmond. </em>Seven years before <em>Lomboy, People </em>v. <em>Vanley </em>required that an advisement indistinguishable from Lomboy\u2019s be given. Three years before <em>Lomboy </em>the California Supreme Court approvingly noted this <em>Vanley </em>advisement and the fact that trial courts were giving it. <em>(People </em>v. Wetmore.)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Thus the statement in <em>Bannister </em>that \u201cin 1980, there was no requirement that individuals be advised that they were facing a possible lifetime commitment to the state hospital\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Bannister), supra, </em>203 Cal.App.3d at p. 1529) is not correct. <em>People </em>v. <em>Vanley, </em>in 1974, required just such an advisement and in 1978 this advisement was approved by the California Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wetmore.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">Additionally, <em>Bannister\u2019s </em>pronouncement that \u201c[the] plea in this case was made according to a procedure \u2018upon which trial courts and prosecutors had justifiably relied for decades\u2019 \u201d (203 Cal.App.3d at p. 1529) is similarly incorrect. At least since <em>Vanley, </em>if not <em>People </em>v. <em>Redmond, </em>seven years prior to <em>Lomboy, </em>trial courts were required to advise persons in appellant\u2019s circumstances that they faced a possible lifetime hospital commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">Finally, and for the same reasons, <em>Bannister\u2019s </em>comment (203 Cal.App.3d at p. 1530) that \u201cWe can only guess at the number of individuals who, like Bannister, entered NGI pleas prior to <em>Lomboy, </em>had their commitments extended pursuant to Penal Code section 1026.5, and are still confined in state hospitals or other treatment facilities\u201d is unsupportable. We also observe that seven years elapsed before a California appellate court questioned the retroactivity of <em>Lomboy, </em>implicit evidence of trial court compliance with both <em>Vanley </em>and <em>Lomboy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>Our analysis of the <em>Tahl </em>retroactivity criteria differs from <em>Bannister\u2019s. </em>The purpose of the <em>Vanley-Lomboy </em>advisement is to ensure fundamental fairness. If an accused, aware of his risked liberty, pleads NGI that is fair. But if an accused, ignorant of his risked liberty, is allowed to plead NGI, that is unfair. To tolerate such unfairness is incompatible with basic notions of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Secondly, as we have discussed, there has been negligible \u201creliance upon the old rule,\u201d at least since the 1974 <em>Vanley </em>mandate. And thirdly, for these reasons, there would be scant if any adverse effect upon the administration of justice to apply <em>Lomboy </em>retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">We therefore hold <em>Lomboy </em>retroactive to September 28, 1979, the effective date of section 1026.5, subdivision (b), and find the court\u2019s failure to advise appellant he could be committed to a state hospital for life prejudicial error.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In so holding we are mindful of this observation: \u201cIt must be remembered that, except for their own plea of insanity, even the most dangerous of offenders are released to society upon serving their maximum term. Under such circumstances, the possibility of an indefinite, lifetime confinement provided by section 1026 may well deter from entering an insanity plea those very persons most in need of hospital treatment. Such a result serves neither the interest of the public nor those like petitioner who have entered insanity pleas.\u201d <em>(In re Moye, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 457, 468.)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">We find it unnecessary to address appellant\u2019s third contention that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Further, we deny as moot appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">The judgment is reversed. On remand the superior court is directed to vacate its order denying appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the extension petition and to enter a new order granting appellant\u2019s motion. Unless there is other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>cause to detain or confine appellant<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the superior court shall order his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Lillie, P. J., and Johnson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied May 2, 1989, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.
