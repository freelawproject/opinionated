' '</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">As to the latter finding, even the appellants\u2019 \u2022 counsel admits that in the proceedings for the sale of the infant Ehler\u2019s.title or interest in the property now of the defendant, that the general rules of practice relating .to proceedings for the sale of an infant\u2019s real estate were not technically followed, but contends that these apparent irregularities were cured by the court\u2019s consent..</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">We cannot agree with this contention, but think that the rules of practice as well as the statutory requirements must be strictly followed to make the sale thereunder valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">Said rules have, in our judgment, all the force and effect of statutory enactments 'and must be adhered to.; besides this, an examination of these infant proceedings clearly shows that the purpose of the same was not to protect the interests of the infants, but they were undertaken solely for the purpose of giving the defendant herein a clear, title to the premises in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">A sale under such circumstances and made for the purposes just mentioned is not, we think, a valid one and cannot divest the infant of her interest in the said property.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">The fact that the sale was fair and that she was paid full, value for her holding does not alter the result. Weinstock v. Levison, 37 N. Y. St. Repr. 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">For these reasons _ we think the trial justice was right in his finding that the defendant\u2019s title was not a marketable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">We think no error was committed by the court in granting the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to conform the pleadings to the proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-15\">The sole objection made by the defendants to1 the granting of such motion was \u201cthat the court at Special Term had no power to conform pleadings to the proof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-16\">We have no doubt of the court\u2019s power to do so, unless surprise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>is claimed, in which event it is usual to withdraw a juror and send the parties to Special Term.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">No surprise being claimed in this instance, in our judgment the motion was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">We do not find any exceptions which, in our opinion, entitled the defendant to a new trial, and his exceptions are overruled and the judgment ordered on the verdict, with costs and a 5 per cent. allowance. -</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Conlan and McCarthy, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Exceptions overruled and judgment ordered on verdict, with costs and extra allowance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
