This disputed question of fact was decided in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>plaintiffs by the denial of defendants\u2019 motion, and this determination' of that question by the court at Special Term is justified ' by the proofs and will not be disturbed.'</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"AhMZ\">Scotchman, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Order affirmed, with qosts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
