Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">\u2022It appears, however, that the case was tried as an action for assault, and evidence being given as to what occurred at the time which presented facts showing both the alleged conversion and the slander.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-14\">. At the conclusion of the judge\u2019s, charge the defendant\u2019s counsel asked\u2019the court to charge as follows: \u201c That the jury cannot award \u25a0any damages for anything beyond the assault alleged to have been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-15\">\u201c The Court.\u2014 I shall charge the jury that in arriving at a verdict for damages, if they do so arrive, that they take into- consideration the fact of the slander and the conversion of the property at this time, and determine the whole damage as to the wrong charged against this defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-16\">Defendant excepts to the refusal to charge as requested, and also to the charge as made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-17\">\u25a0 Also to charge the jury that the <em>\u201c </em>defendant had a right to insist that the plaintiff ..should vacate his store, and that, if he refused to go upon requ\u00e9st, and then he only used such force as was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>necessary to put him out, that the defendant would not be liable for any assault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-3\">\u201c The Court.\u2014 I shall refuse to charge as requested, and shall leave the whole question as to the ejection of this plaintiff from that store to the jury upon all the evidence before them.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">\u201c Defendant excepts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">This was error (Comstock v. Dodge, 43 How. Pr. 97; Bristor v. Burr, 120 N. Y. 427-431), and for which the judgment should be reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Eitzsimons and Conlan, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Judgment reversed and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
