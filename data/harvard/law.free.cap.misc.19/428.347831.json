The only question presented for our determination is one relating to the costs awarded by the decision of the General Term upon the appeal from the judgment on the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-16\">The plaintiffs contend that having succeeded in the action they are entitled to tax the .costs of the first trial and insist that the \u201c costs to the appellant to abide the event,\u201d upon the reversal of the judgment on the first trial, relate to the costs of the.appeal only.
