I know Mr.' Gage, Mr\" -Follett, Mr. Peetsch and Mr. O\u2019Connell. I conducted the transactions respecting the mortgage held by the brewery company with a saloon at No. 11 Third avenue personally. I made the sales and the collections. Q. \u2018Paid by James McClenahan and James D. Smith as executors, and Suanee M. Stevenson as executrix of the estate of David Stevenson, of the city of New York, and doing business in- the city, county and state of New York.\u2019 Were you employed by these people? A. Yes,-sir, and acting for them, and in that capacity I conducted the business between that' saloon and them. Q. State, if you know, the amount that was due from that saloon to' these people on the 28th day of September, 1893. Defendant\u2019s counsel objects as calling-for a conclusion, as incompetent and irrelevant and immaterial. Q. Do you know? A. Yes. Qi How much? Defendant\u2019s counsel objects as incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial and not within the issues and as calling for a conclusion. Admitted. Defendant excepts. A. $1,444.10, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>including Mr. Coleman\u2019s indebtedness. Q. Did you collect the money? A. No, sir. Q. Upon whom did you make the demand? A. Of Mr. Gage. Q. Did he pay? A. No, sir. Q. What was done respecting the mortgage after the demand was made? Defendant\u2019s counsel objects as immaterial and incompetent and not within the issues. Objection overruled. Defendant excepts. Q. Was the mortgage foreclosed? Same objection, ruling and exception. A. The mortgage was foreclosed afterward.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u201c Cross-examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u201c I was in the employ of the David Stevenson Brewing Company in September, 1893, when I made a demand for the mortgage. I made it on behalf of the David Stevenson Brewing Company, and on behalf of no one else, and the David Stevenson Brewing Company is a corporation. Defendant\u2019s counsel: Now I ask to have the evidence of the witness stricken out. It is now admitted that he made no demand on behalf of the mortgagees. Motion denied. Defendant \u00e9xcepts. The David Stevenson Brewing Company commenced business years before I went into their employ. I sold ale and lager for the David Stevenson Brewing Company. I sold ale and lager to Mr. Coleman. That ale and lager I sold for the David Stevenson Brewing Company. Q. And you did not sell it for the executors of David Stevenson? A. I sold it for the corporation. Q. And this money that you said was due at the time you made the demand on Mr. Gage was money that was due to the David Stevenson Brewing Company? A. Tes, sir. Q. You had no authority from the executors as individuals to collect money, did you? A. I had from the company. Q. But only for the company? A. From the president of the company, Mr. Clenahan. Q. Who was the president of the David Stevenson Brewing Company? A. Yes, sir. Q. There is no mistake about this fact, that this four hundred and forty-four dollars was for ale and lager that was sold and delivered to P. J. Coleman by the David Stevenson Brewing Company? A. Yes, sir. Q. And how do you know that' amount? A. From the books in the brewery. Q. Did you keep the books? A. No, sir. Q. You did not make the delivery of the ale and lager, did you? A. No, sir. Q. And all the knowledge you had on the subject was what the bookkeeper of the brewery told you? A. That was all, sir. Q. And that was the bookkeeper of the David Stevenson Brewing Company? A. Yes, sir.-' Q. Who told you that there was four hundred and forty-four dollars and ten cents due over and above the amount of the mortgage? A. Yes. Q. For ale and lager sold to Coleman? A. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>\u201c Bedirect-examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u201c Q. Did you represent or take any part in the placing of the mortgage itself? A. Yes. Q. What part did you take? A. I transacted that business with Mr. Coleman and tbe brewery. Q. On which this mortgage was made? <em>A. </em>Yes, sir. Q. And the money for which you demanded of Mr. Gage was money due under this mortgage? A. And for goods delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\"><em>\u201c </em>By the Court: And for goods delivered subsequent to the making of that mortgage? ' A. Yes, sir; after.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\u201cBecross:</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">\u201c Q. But the goods that were delivered after the making of the mortgage were ale and lager? A. Delivered to Mr. Coleman. Q. By the David Stevenson Brewing Company? A. Y'es, sir. Defendant\u2019s counsel: Now I renew my motion to strike out the testimony of the witness, on the ground that there is no competent testimony to prove the amount of any indebtedness over and above the amount of the mortgage in the mortgagee by the mortgagor. Motion denied. Defendant excepts.\u201d \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">It is clear from the foregoing that there is a lack of proof here, and that such would not bind Patrick J. . Coleman as between him and the David Stevenson Brewing Company, and the liability not being properly proven cannot certainly bind this defendant in order to prove the falsity of an alleged representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">The date of sales, credits or delivery of and the number of such transactions that go to make up this additional liability of Coleman are not given, and he knows nothing about these transactions nor their sale and delivery, and all he knows is hearsay from the bookkeeper. Dayton v. Parke, 142 N. Y. 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">For all that appears, Coleman may have another place of business and these particular, sales and deliveries may be made to. another place or to another man of the same name and the repre1-sentations were true.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">\u2022 The fact that the brewery foreclosed the mortgage does not prove the debt nor the falsity of the defendant\u2019s representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">The plaintiff must therefore prove by Coleman or other competent testimony or evidence the indebtedness * or liability for this extra $444.10 over the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">Nor is there any legal evidence as to the falsity of the daily receipts, that portion at folio 64 was hearsay and was on motion stricken out at folio 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-15\">There are many other serious objections presented, but we think, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>without going into the other questions, this was error for which a new trial should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Judgment is, therefore, reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Eitzsimons, J., concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Judgment reversed and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
