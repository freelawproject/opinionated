Lee, or whether its deposit was coupled- with a condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-15\">Upon that issue it was proper for the trial justice to have admitted evidence on the defendant\u2019s behalf, showing by whom'and under what circumstances said fund was deposited.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-16\">' It was - also proper for the defendant to show upon what \u2018con- . dition the said fund was to become the property of Annie T. Lee, and only upon the happening of such a condition would she have had a vested right or interest therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-17\">As the jury evidently believed the conditions attached to the deposit of the money never happened,- therefore she never had any property or interest therein, and certainly the plaintiff as her administratrix stands in no better position.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-18\">From an examination of the record, we think that the verdict of the jury upon the question of .fact submitted to them was just and right.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>We find no error in the appeal record and the judgment must be affirmed, with- costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">McCarthy,.
