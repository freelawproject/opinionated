In view of the above sections the answer must be divided into three parts, as follows: .</p>\n<p id=\"b466-17\"><em>First. </em>A denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-18\">Second. A defense..</p>\n<p id=\"b466-19\"><em>TMrd. </em>A counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-20\">Section 522 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b466-21\">\u201c Each material allegation of the complaint, not controverted by the answer, must, for the purposes of the action, be deemed admitted, and taken as true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ad_\">The allegations contained in the second paragraph or subdivision of the answer are affirmative statements of new matter, and under the Code, if sufficient, they.constitute a defense, which the defendant must prove. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>\u2022 It is claimed that these affirmative statements amount to a denial, but upon examination we find that they are specifically addressed to the second paragraph or subdivision of the first cause of action set forth in the complaint, and on examining the second paragraph of the complaint it will be found to contain none of \u25a0 the allegations which are attempted to be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">The allegations contained in the fourth paragraph of the answer in regard to the delivery of the merchandise mentioned in the second cause of action, do not deny the allegations contained in the eighth paragraph of the complaint either specifically or generally. \u2022 1</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">It is a well-settled rule of pleading that no proof can be admitted in support of new matter contained in the answer which is inconsistent with an allegation in the complaint which is not denied. Beard v. Tilghman, 66 Hun, 12; Fleischmann v. Stern, 90 N. Y. 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The answer containing neither a general nor a specific denial of any of the allegations of the complaint, the plaintiff\u2019s causes of action stood admitted without proof and. it was error for the . court to dismiss the complaint, as it did, upon the ground that the plaintiff had failed to establish the causes of action set forth in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">If the new matter alleged as constituting, a defense and counterclaim was sufficient in law, then the defendant under the pleadings had the affirmative and was bound to prove those defenses and counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The judgment appealed from should be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Van Wyck, Oh.
