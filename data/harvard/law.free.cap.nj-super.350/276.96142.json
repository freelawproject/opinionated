Plaintiff cross-appeals the dismissal of his punitive damages claim as well as his tort claim against the individual defendant. The primary issues raised by this appeal are the proper burden of proof and the sufficiency of the judge\u2019s findings to support the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Plaintiff, Donald Donofry,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was employed by defendant Autotote Systems, Inc. (defendant or Autotote) as General Manager at its facility at the Atlantic City Race Track, known as the Hub. Defendant, which operates simulcasting facilities from racetracks around the country, sent simulcast signals to several Atlantic City casinos from this location. The Casino Simulcasting Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>5:12-194(b), and its implementing regulation, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>19:55-6.3, required the technicians operating the equipment in the Hub to be licensed by the Casino Control Commission. Plaintiff was discharged shortly after he informed Autotote\u2019s senior management, through their local counsel, that unlicensed technicians were working at the Hub facility, thus necessitating admissions to the Commission that prompted disciplinary action and threatened Autotote\u2019s casino license.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Plaintiff was awarded compensatory damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs against Autotote. However, the judge denied plaintiffs demand for punitive damages and dismissed his claim against defendant Sital Singh Dhanoa, Autotote\u2019s district manager and plaintiffs immediate supervisor, for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>On appeal Autotote contends that the judge erred in finding retaliation under CEPA because plaintiff would have been fired anyway for several reasons, and because plaintiff was himself a \u201ctransgressor\u201d who cannot succeed under CEPA. Defendant contests the amount of the compensatory damage award on the ground that the judge should not have assumed that plaintiff would have worked until age seventy. Finally, defendant contends that the award of attorneys\u2019 fees was excessive. On his cross appeal, plaintiff contends that the judge should not have dismissed his claim against Dhanoa, should have awarded punitive damages, and improperly reduced his requested attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Based upon our review of the record, the briefs, and the arguments of counsel, all under applicable law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">A brief summary of the facts surrounding plaintiffs employment and his termination will suffice to place this appeal in context.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Plaintiff was first hired by defendant in 1993 to fill an administrative position as general manager of defendant\u2019s Atlantic City Hub. The technical work of the Hub is performed on totalisator (\u201ctote\u201d) equipment that is essential to the simulcasting operation. The equipment is maintained in a secure room, known as the tote room. The tote room manager was Brian Rogers, who supervised the technical work of the operators.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The tote room equipment is operated only by specially trained persons, who are required by law to be licensed by the Casino Control Commission. The operators, other than the manager of the tote room, were members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), which was threatening to strike in the spring and summer of 1994. As a result, the company began to develop a strike contingency plan, including training plaintiff to operate the equipment and hiring additional tote operators. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>June, the company applied to the Commission for a temporary waiver of the licensing requirements for tote room operators in the event of a strike; however, the waiver was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">On the defendant\u2019s organizational chart, filed with the Casino Control Commission, Rogers answered to plaintiff. However, because plaintiff\u2019s job and his background was on the administrative and not the technical side of the operation, Rogers responded directly to Dhanoa with respect to the operation. It was Rogers, with Dhanoa\u2019s approval, who made the decisions to hire new or replacement personnel for the tote room. Dhanoa reported to Brooks Pierce, who was then the Vice President and General Manager of Autotote. By 1998, when Pierce testified at this trial, he had become President of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Autotote had retained local counsel, Mark Sandson, to facilitate its regulatory affairs involving the Casino Control Commission. Sandson handled a variety of legal matters for defendant in Atlantic City, including the waiver application, and plaintiff frequently had occasion to consult him. Sandson or his office staff oversaw the process of obtaining the required licenses for defendant\u2019s tote room personnel, and plaintiff was involved in transmitting the applications between the employees and Sandson.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">In August, the tote room operators did go out on strike at Autotote\u2019s facilities across the country, and it became a major priority of the company to keep the operations running with substitute personnel. At various times during the summer and fall of 1994, three persons who were employed in the tote room at the Hub were not licensed as required. Those persons were hired by Rogers, but plaintiff became aware of their status and made some attempts to discourage the practice as he became more and more \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with the situation. He reported the situation to Dhanoa, and instructed Rogers to get the unlicensed people out of the tote room, but Rogers saw no way to keep the operation going without them, and they remained. Plaintiff tolerated the situation until mid-October.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>At some point in October, plaintiff learned that one of the three unlicensed tote room employees had been sent to work on the simulcasting equipment at the Taj Mahal and had been turned away by the casino because he was unlicensed. At the time, Autotote\u2019s own application for a plenary casino service industry license was before the Commission, and plaintiff became more disturbed about the potential for repercussions with the Commission. On October 18,1994, plaintiff went to Sandson, and knowing Sandson would have to report the matter to upper management and to the Commission, told him about the several individuals who were operating the tote room equipment without the proper casino licenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sandson recognized the threat to Autotote\u2019s application if the violations became known. In a telephone conference with Pierce the same day, plaintiff and Sandson reported the situation to him. It was determined that it was in Autotote\u2019s interest to disclose the matter to the Commission itself, rather than risk its discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">As a result, the plenary license application was postponed, and administrative charges were lodged by the Commission against Autotote and against plaintiff, Dhanoa, Rogers, and one of the unlicensed employees. Each was represented by separate counsel provided by Autotote, and the charges against each were resolved by settlement based upon written stipulations entered on or before December 14,1994. Each entered a guilty plea to a violation, and Donofry paid a $1,100 fine. Autotote was also fined $25,400. In his written stipulation of settlement, plaintiff as well as Dhanoa and Rogers admitted some responsibility for the unlicensed operators. Autotote also admitted its responsibility for the violations. On that same date, the Commission granted Autotote\u2019s plenary license. Both Sandson and separate counsel engaged to handle the plenary license application testified at this trial that having reported its own violations to the Commission was helpful in securing the plenary license.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>According to plaintiff, on December 13, 1994, he called Pierce \u201cto find out what my disposition was after the hearing,\u201d and Pierce \u201ctold me that I was terminated.\u201d When plaintiff asked why, Pierce \u201ctold me because I cost the company a lot of money and that I jeopardized their license that they were going for the next day, their permanent license, and also that they were in the process of negotiating the New Jersey Lottery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Pierce did not deny giving plaintiff those reasons, but added that he terminated plaintiff because he thought that as general manager of the facility, plaintiff \u201cwas responsible for what was going on at the HUB.\u201d Pierce \u201cfelt that [plaintiff] basically allowed unlicensed people to work under his watch and I felt that he was personally responsible for it.\u201d Pierce denied that plaintiffs disclosure played \u201cany part\u201d in his decision. \u201cI fired him because he knew what was going on right from the beginning. He allowed it to happen and the fact that ... he confessed to that a month and a half later, to me was not justification.... \u201d Plaintiff \u201cknowingly and willingly let this happen\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Pierce asserted that he initially decided to terminate plaintiff on October 18 when he talked to Sandson and to plaintiff by telephone. He did not discuss it with his subordinates because \u201cit was a plain as day decision.\u201d He did ask Sandson whether his decision was \u201coff base.\u201d He also asked Autotote\u2019s general counsel to verify that. He made no other investigation of the circumstances, except a call to Dhanoa. He later learned that Dhanoa lied when he claimed not to have known about the unlicensed employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">In distinguishing his treatment of plaintiff from his treatment of Rogers and Dhanoa, Pierce testified that he did not find Rogers culpable because his responsibility was \u201cto make sure the tote system was up and running,\u201d whereas plaintiffs responsibility was to ensure that employees were licensed.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Pierce also explained that he felt that Dhanoa was not personally responsible because he was not present at the site of the violations. Pierce agreed on cross-examination that Dhanoa\u2019s technical expertise and employment history with defendant were part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>of his reason for retaining him. Pierce claimed that he did not find out that Dhanoa had lied about his own knowledge of the unlicensed workers \u201cuntil this case started, [un]til we got to the depositions and started talking about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The only other evidence at trial with respect to the company\u2019s motivation for firing plaintiff is the record of the December 14 Commission hearing on the pending plenary license application, when outside counsel argued that Autotote terminated plaintiff \u201cto show this Commission that it [is] aware of the stringent requirements of this regulatory scheme.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In his letter opinion, the trial judge made the following critical findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">If that was [plaintiffs supervisor\u2019s] only reason for terminating plaintiff, as callous as it may have been, it would not be actionable. Plaintiff was an at-will employee, so defendant did not need a good reason to fire him. Despite [the supervisor\u2019s] protestations to the contrary, I conclude that the fact that it was plaintiff who brought this situation to light more probably than not contributed to the decision to terminate him____No one would ever have known but for plaintiffs revelations. There had to be some element of retribution in the decision to fire only plaintiff and not the two others who equally shared the blame for the unlicensed workers. It\u2019s only human nature. I conclude, therefore, that the fact that it was plaintiff who \u201cblew the whistle\u201d played a significant part in the decision to fire him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">At the outset, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that the plaintiffs own role in allowing the unlicensed employees to work in the tote room precludes his recovery. We are not aware of any New Jersey case holding that plaintiffs participation in the unlawful conduct he reports is a <em>per se </em>bar to a whistleblower claim. <em>See Paolella v. Browning-Ferris, Inc., </em>158 <em>F.3d </em>183, 191 (3d Cir.1998)(applying Delaware\u2019s whistleblower law):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-10\">Although the exceptions to the at-will doctrine are to be narrowly drawn, the policy reasons for protecting whistleblowers remain whether or not the employee can avoid involvement in the illegal activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-11\"><em>See also Jacobs v. Universal Dev. Corp., </em>53 <em>Cal.App. lpth </em>692, 702, 62 <em>Cal.Rptr.2d </em>446, 451 (1997). When an employer defending a whistleblower claim contends that its employee\u2019s unlawful conduct by itself, and not the employee\u2019s whistleblowing activity, was the determinative factor in a firing, the employee\u2019s conduct surely will be part of the picture from which a factfinder will determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>whether the employer acted with a retaliatory motive; but it is <em>not </em>the whole picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">A review of any judgment on appeal requires that we consider whether the findings of fact were supported by sufficient credible evidence, and whether the law was properly applied to those facts. In the case of a jury trial, we approach the second consideration by examining the jury charge. If the instructions correctly reflect the applicable law, we infer that the jury reached its conclusions based on a proper application of the law to the evidence. When the trier of fact is the judge, we depend upon the judge to articulate the legal basis for his decision, that is, the elements of the plaintiffs cause of action and the applicable burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The trial judge here provided a written opinion which carefully set forth the evidence adduced and his findings thereon. As defendant contends, the opinion did not, however, articulate the legal standard against which the judge weighed the evidence and found that evidence tipped the scales in plaintiffs favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Our review of the record nevertheless satisfies us not only that the judge\u2019s findings of fact are adequately supported by credible evidence, thereby warranting our deference under <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974), but also that having ourselves measured those findings against the elements of a CEPA cause of action and the applicable burden of proof, the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">We are also satisfied that the judge properly dismissed plaintiffs claim for punitive damages, there being insufficient evidence of egregious conduct, and that plaintiffs tort claims against Dhanoa were properly dismissed for lack of proof of the requisite intent or proximate cause. We find insufficient merit in plaintiffs arguments on these points of his cross-appeal to warrant further discussion in this opinion. <em>See R. </em>2:11-3(e)(l)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">We shall explain why we conclude that the trial judge properly found that plaintiff proved his CEPA claim. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3(a) prohibits retaliatory action against an employee who: \u201cDiscloses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>... to a supervisor or to a public body an activity, policy or practice of the employer ... that the employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, or a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">It is beyond dispute that the framework for proving a CEPA claim follows that of a LAD claim. <em>E.g., Abbamont v. Piscataway Township Bd. of Educ., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>405, 418, 650 A.2d 958 (1994); <em>Kolb v. Bums, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>467, 477, 727 A.2d 525 (App.Div.1999). It is also plain that the methods of proof and the applicable burdens in LAD and CEPA cases generally follow Title VII law, and we therefore frequently look to federal as well as state discrimination and retaliation cases as precedent. <em>E.g., Mogull v. C.B. Commercial Real Estate Group, Inc., </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>449, 461-62, 744 A.2d 1186 (2000); <em>Erickson v. Marsh &amp; McLennan Co., </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>539, 549-50, 569 A.2d 793 (1990); <em>Velantzas v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>189, 193, 536 A.2d 237 (1988); <em>Kolb v. Bums, supra, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 478-79, 727 A.2d 525; <em>see also Bowles v. City of Camden, </em>993 <em>F.Supp. </em>255 (D.N.J.1998): \u201cThe elements necessary to prove a retaliatory discharge claim under CEPA are similar to those necessary to prove a violation of Title VII [of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2000e]. Therefore, we will utilize principles from the Title VII landscape in analyzing plaintiffs CEPA claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">There are two frameworks, or approaches, to proving a discrimination or retaliation claim: pretext and mixed motive.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The critical distinction between the two is the extent to which the plaintiff relies upon inferences from the circumstances to establish a causal connection between the discrimination or retaliation and the firing or other adverse action suffered by the employee. There is little question that this is a pretext case, and we shall analyze it accordingly. In a pretext case, once the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>establishes a prima facie case, only the burden of producing evidence shifts to the defendant. In a mixed motive case, however, because the plaintiff produces more direct evidence of the unlawful motive, the burden of persuasion is also shifted to the defendant. <em>See generally, Kolb v. Burns, supra, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>467, 727 A.2d 525; <em>Bowles v. City of Camden, supra, </em>993 <em>F.Supp. </em>255. We see no evidence that the judge shifted the burden of proof to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Under a pretext theory, in order for plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of unlawful retaliation, he had to present evidence that (1) he reasonably believed that allowing unlicensed employees to operate the tote room violated casino law; (2) that he reported it to a supervisor or public authority; (3) that he was fired; and (4) that there was a causal connection between his reporting and his firing. <em>See Kolb v. Bums, supra, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 476, 727 A.2d 525; <em>see also Bergen Commercial Bank v. Sisler, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>188, 210, 723 A.2d 944 (1999); <em>Craig v. Suburban Cablevision, Inc., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>623, 629-30, 660 A.2d 505 (1995). There is no dispute here that plaintiffs proofs satisfied the first three elements of the claim. As in most CEPA cases, the trial and now the appeal turn <em>on </em>the fourth element: evidence of a causal connection. Specifically, we are called upon to focus on the nature of the required causal connection \u2014 that is, the definition of proximate cause \u2014 in a CEPA case.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u201cPretext\u201d as a means of meeting plaintiffs burden of proof was initially described in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 <em>U.S. </em>792, 802, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>1817, 1824, 36 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>668, 677 (1973) \u201cto address the difficulty in obtaining direct evidence of discrimination.\u201d <em>Bowles, supra, </em>993 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 261. Pretext triggers a presumption that enables the employee to \u201cprove an employer\u2019s discriminatory intent through circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Bergen Commercial Bank. v. Sisler, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 209, 723 A.2d 944. Recognition that direct evidence of motive or intent is often unavailable to an employee who has suffered an adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>employment decision is merely a specific application of a more general proposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\">[Ilntent is [a] condition of the mind which cannot be seen and can only be determined by inferences from conduct, words or acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">A state of mind is rarely susceptible of direct proof, but must ordinarily be inferred from the facts---- It is within your power to find that such proof has been furnished beyond a reasonable doubt ... from all of the surrounding circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\"><em>[Model Jury Charge (Criminal), </em>\u201cState of Mind\u201d (2000).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Under the pretext theory, once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the evidentiary burden on the employer is to advance \u201ca legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its rejection of the employee.\u201d <em>Sisler, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 210-11, 723 A.2d 944. The plaintiff retains the ultimate burden of proving that the retaliatory motive played a determinative role in the adverse decision. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center v. Hicks, </em>509 <em>U.S. </em>502, 511, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2742, 2749, 125 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 407, 419 (1993); <em>Sisler, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 211, 723 A.2d 944; <em>Erickson v. Marsh &amp; McLennan Co., supra, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>at 550, 569 A.2d 793. As in any cause of action, plaintiff can meet that burden by means of circumstantial as well as direct evidence, or a combination of the two. One way the employee can do this is by proving that the employer\u2019s articulated reason \u201cwas not the true reason for the employment decision but was merely a pretext for discrimination.\u201d <em>Sisler, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 211, 723 A.2d 944 (quoting <em>Andersen v. Exxon Co., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>483, 493, 446 A.2d 486 (1982)); <em>see also Romano v. Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>284 <em>N.J.Super. </em>543, 551, 665 A.2d 1139 (App.Div.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">That is simply another way of saying that the factfinder is permitted to draw an inference of a guilty state of mind from a defendant\u2019s proffer of false evidence. <em>See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>133,147,120 <em>S.Ct. </em>2097, 2108,147 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 105, 119-20 (2000). The extent of the falsity and defendant\u2019s awareness thereof determine the strength of the negative inference. If it is strong enough, it can, along with plaintiffs <em>prima facie </em>case, prove the causal connection. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>148, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2109, 147 L.Ed.2d at 120-21. It is this reliance upon circumstantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s motive that gives plaintiff\u2019s case the shorthand label of a pretext ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Defendant here offered some evidence that plaintiff was terminated because of his role in the employment of unlicensed workers in the tote room, by itself a lawful explanation for a firing. Thus the burden of producing evidence shifted back to plaintiff. Plaintiff relied in part upon evidence that neither Dhanoa nor Rogers were terminated for their involvement, which was equally if not more culpable than his own. Plaintiff also relied on the inference to be drawn from the timing of his firing, less than two months after he blew the whistle and while defendant\u2019s license application was pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">When a defendant offers affirmative, credible evidence of a lawful reason for the termination, that does not necessarily end the pretext case. The legal issue raised here, where the defendant contends that the factfinder ignored credible evidence of several lawful reasons for plaintiffs termination,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is the extent of plaintiffs ultimate burden of persuasion. To prove a CEPA claim, the plaintiff must show that the \u201cretaliatory discrimination was more likely than not a determinative factor in the decision.\u201d <em>Kolb, supra, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 479, 727 A.2d 525 (quoting <em>Bowles, supra, </em>993 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 262). Substituting \u201cretaliation\u201d for \u201cdiscrimination,\u201d we find the plaintiffs burden to be as described by the Court in <em>Sisler, an age </em>discrimination ease:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">Although the burden of production shifts throughout the process, the employee at all phases retains the burden of proof that the adverse employment action was caused by purposeful or intentional [retaliation].

But both sides apparently agreed on plaintiffs burden of proof. According to plaintiff, \u201c[t]o prevail under CEPA, [he] need only show that he suffered an adverse employment action <em>motivated in part by retaliation </em>for disclosing to a supervisor what he reasonably believed to be a violation of the law.\u201d (emphasis added.) Defendant did not disagree, as noted above. In its written argument, defendant\u2019s sole reference to the applicable legal standard is the following: \u201cThe sole issue which the Court must now decide is whether ... Donofry has proven he was fired in contravention of ... CEPA, <em>i.e., </em>that he was fired, <em>at least in part, </em>in retaliation for making a disclosure to a supervisor or public body.\u201d (emphasis added). The doctrine of invited error bars a litigant from claiming on appeal that a position it advocated and that the judge adopted at trial was error. <em>Brett v. Great Am. Recreation, Inc., </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>479, 503, 677 A.2d 705 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Plaintiffs ultimate burden of proof is to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his protected, whistleblowing activity was a determinative or substantial, motivating factor in defendant\u2019s decision to terminate his employment \u2014 that it made a difference. Plaintiff need not prove that his whistleblowing activity was the only factor in the decision to fire him. <em>Bergen Commercial Bank v. Sisler, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 211, 723 A.2d 944. The trial judge reached the conclusion that plaintiffs whistleblow-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>ing \u201cplayed a significant part in the decision to fire him.\u201d That conclusion, which is supported by sufficient if not overwhelming credible evidence in the record, establishes that plaintiff met his burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Defendant contends that plaintiff \u201cdeserved to be fired\u201d for his violation of the Casino Control Act\u2019s licensing rules, \u201cand he knew it.\u201d However, defendant admits, as it must because it did not fire Dhanoa and Rogers, that \u201cviolating the Act was not a firing offense per <em>se.\u201d </em>Defendant then argues that it had other \u201ccredible, well-supported reasons to fire Donofry while retaining Rogers and Dhanoa,\u201d specifically, poor supervisory performance in allowing the licensing violation to occur; a new and overlapping position of compliance officer, required by the CCC as a condition of its license, for which plaintiff lacked some qualifications; insufficient technical expertise to be able to take over the actual operation of the totalisator during a strike; and an excessively high salary. However, there is no evidence in the record that any of these theoretical grounds for firing plaintiff actually motivated Pierce<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; certainly no one in the company ever gave plaintiff any of those reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Defendant met its burden of production by offering some reasons for retaining Dhanoa and Rogers, who were equally if not more culpable in the licensing violation. In other words, defendant offered evidence to counter the inference of retaliatory motive arising from the disparate treatment of two culpable employees who did not blow the whistle on defendant and who were not fired. Nevertheless, the judge was not bound to accept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>defendant\u2019s explanation or to conclude that retaliation was not a motivating factor, and he apparently did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">As we have shown, the overwhelming number of cases describing the burden of proof on a plaintiff such as Donofry describe that burden in terms of proving a substantial or determinative, motivating factor. In other words, a factor that made a difference. The judge relied largely on circumstantial evidence to conclude that plaintiffs whistleblowing activity \u201cplayed a significant part in the decision to fire him.\u201d We in turn conclude from those words that the judge found both reasons to be significant or substantial determinative, motivating factors that made a difference in the end result: plaintiffs termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Defendant now belatedly argues that plaintiffs burden was to.prove \u201cbut-for\u201d causation, that is, that he would not have been fired anyway for a lawful, non-retaliatory reason. Defendant cites <em>Bowles v. City of Camden, </em>993 <em>F.Supp. </em>255 (D.N. J.1998), for the proposition that in a case based on pretext theory, plaintiff has the burden of proving that he would not have been fired but for his whistleblowing activity (the retaliatory motive), whereas in a mixed motive case, defendant has the burden of proving that plaintiff would have been fired for some other, lawful reason, irrespective of his whistleblowing. Defendant contends that \u201c[either way, the dispositive element is whether the employee would have been fired anyway (the \u2018but-for\u2019 test).\u201d But defendant admits that it finds the \u201csignal for the but-for test [in] the phrase \u2018determinative factor,\u2019 as set forth in <em>Bowles, </em>993 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 262.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While in many eases there will be little difference, we decline to require that the trial judge find any more than that retaliation was a motivating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>The burden of disproving but-for causation has been placed upon defendants in mixed motive cases, that is, when a plaintiffs proof of unlawful motive is sufficiently strong; the defendant then must prove that it would have taken the same action against the employee irrespective of the protected activity or status. <em>See </em>42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 2000e-2(m), as amended; <em>Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </em>490 <em>U.S. </em>228,109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1775,104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989); <em>see also Zubi v.

The judge recognized that sacrificing an employee in an effort to show penitence for the violation would not itself be actionable, but went on to conclude that plaintiffs whistleblowing activity \u201cmore probably than not contributed to the decision to terminate him.\u201d Key to our conclusion is that the judge cited the disparate treatment of \u201cthe two others who equally share the blame for the unlicensed workers\u201d and then concluded \u201c[tjhere had to be some element of retribution in the decision to fire only plaintiff____\u201d With those explanations, we understand the trial judge\u2019s final conclusion that whistleblow-ing \u201cplayed a significant part in the decision to fire him\u201d to mean that plaintiff would not have been the one of the three employees to be sacrificed \u201cbut for\u201d his protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">We find no reason to reverse the judge\u2019s determination that defendant violated CEPA when it fired plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">[At the request of the court, those portions of the opinion addressing defendant\u2019s challenge to the admission of plaintiffs expert witness\u2019s testimony respecting future lost wages and benefits and to the amount of the counsel fee award, as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>plaintiffs cross-appeal with respect to the counsel fee, have been excluded from publication.]</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b315-9\"> Defendant Madeline E.
