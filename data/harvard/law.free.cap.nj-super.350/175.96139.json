The Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services within the Department of Human Services (DMAHS) issued a final agency decision concluding that A.K., the institutionalized spouse, was not eligible for Medicaid at the time she and her husband W.K. applied for benefits because the couple\u2019s resources exceeded the maximum amount allowed by law. We now affirm that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">A.K. and W.K. are now both deceased. We assume, but have no specific information, that this litigation is being pursued on behalf of appellant A.K.\u2019s estate. The Division does not raise mootness as an issue or otherwise contend that the deaths of A.K. and W.K. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>preclude a remedy if appellant\u2019s legal arguments are otherwise correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The underlying facts are not in dispute. In September 1995, A.K. began continuous institutionalization in a nursing home. On October 1, 1995, the first day of the first full month of continuous institutionalization, DMAHS calculated the couple\u2019s total countable resources, although no application for benefits was then made. The calculated resources amounted to $219,725.40. At that time, the \u201ccommunity spouse resource allowance\u201d (CSRA), which is the maximum community spouse\u2019s share of resources exempt from total countable resources, was $80,760. As discussed below, that figure is established by a formula set forth in a federal statute tied to the Consumer Price Index. The maximum amount of a CSRA can change annually. For instance, effective January 1, 1999, the figure rose to $81,960. It appears that the CSRA did not change from October 1, 1995 until January 1, 1999. An institutionalized spouse is also allowed to retain resources not in excess of $2,000. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.8(a)(2). Thus, as of January 1998, this couple was permitted to retain total resources not in excess of $82,760 in order to qualify for Medicaid benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">As we understand it, appellant contends that the couple\u2019s asset evaluation was <em>fixed </em>and frozen on October 1, 1995. Thus, upon application for benefits in January 1998, they claimed to have been eligible for Medicaid on the theory that during the intervening period they had expended at least $136,965.40, the difference between countable resources on October 1, 1995 <em>of </em>$219,725.40 and $82,760 (the CSRA plus the $2,000 allowed to the institutionalized spouse).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">The Division\u2019s position is that in order to establish Medicaid eligibility the calculation of assets must be made as of the date of application. Thus, any earlier calculation and subsequent \u201cspend down\u201d in accordance therewith, is not controlling. Here, eligibility could only be established if at the time of application the couple\u2019s countable assets did not exceed $82,760.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>In the present case, the couple had spent down a considerable portion of their countable assets between 1995 and their 1998 application for Medicaid. However, at the same time there had been asset appreciation, most notably their Mobil stock which had split and increased in value. The heart of the present debate is whether assets acquired, or appreciated, after the date of the original asset calculation may be counted as resources affecting Medicaid eligibility when application is finally made.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">It is apparently admitted that as of the couple\u2019s first application for Medicaid in January 1998, insufficient resources had been expended even under appellant\u2019s theory of eligibility. It was subsequently agreed between the parties that June 1, 1998 would be the date of application for Medicaid. At that point, the couple apparently had expended at least $136,965.40 in resources. They were reluctant to reveal their assets as of that date, but the director of the Division found that they retained countable assets in excess of $82,760. Our own review of the record reveals sufficient credible evidence to support that finding, although an exact figure cannot be achieved. We do not believe appellant explicitly contests the Division\u2019s calculation. Appellant\u2019s position, rather, is that the couple\u2019s assets should be fixed as of the calculation of countable assets made on the first day of the first month of continuous institutionalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The relevant statutory and regulatory provisions are hardly a model of clarity. However, in our view, the statutory and regulatory schemes support the position of the DMAHS, which was reached in part by application of the agency\u2019s expertise. We also find support in our conclusion from the decision of the Minnesota Supreme Court in <em>Estate of Atkinson v. Minnesota Department of Human Services, </em>564 <em>N.W.2d </em>209 (Minn.1997), that is directly on point and reaches the same result as that espoused by the Division in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Medicaid is a federal program that provides funds to states so that eligible needy persons may be reimbursed for the cost of medical care. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396a to -1396v. The states have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>significant discretion to design programs, but those programs must be consistent with federal law.

In New Jersey, the implementing statutory provisions are set forth in the Medical Assistance and Health Services Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-1 to -42. The relevant regulations, for purposes of this appeal, are found in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.1, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">Prior to 1988, the determination of Medicaid eligibility for married applicants, one of whom needed nursing home care, \u201cresisted simple solutions.\u201d <em>Blumer, supra, </em>534 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 967, 151 L.Ed.2d at-.

The goal of the MCCA was to ensure sufficient income and resources for the community spouse, while committing a fair share of their resources to the institutionalized spouse\u2019s care. <em>Cleary v.

To that end, the MCCA established a level of income and resources for the community spouse that is protected from inclusion when determining the institutionalized spouse\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid and which need not be spent down for the spouse\u2019s care. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-16\">The procedure for calculating income and resource eligibility is set out in 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(c), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-17\">(1) Computation of spousal share at time of institutionalization</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACa\">(A) Total joint resources</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-18\">There shall be computed (as <em>of the beginning of the first continuous period of institu-tixmalization </em>(beginning on or after September 30, 1989) <em>of the institutionalized </em>spouse)\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-19\">(i) the total value of the resources to the extent either the institutionalized spouse or the community spouse has an ownership interest, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-20\">(ii) a spousal share which is equal to)t of such total value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>(B) Assessment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">At the request of an institutionalized spouse or community spouse, <em>at the beginning of the first continuous period of institutionalization </em>(beginning on or after September 30, 1989) <em>of the institutionalized spouse </em>and upon the receipt of relevant documentation of resources, the State shall promptly assess and document the total value described in subparagraph (A)(i) and shall provide a copy of such assessment and documentation to each spouse and shall retain a copy of the assessment for use under this section.

If the remaining resources exceed $2,000, eligibility may not be established.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-9\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.8 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">We view the state regulations as consistent with and reflective of the federal statutes. No argument is made to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">The present debate is fueled by the absence of a clear statement in the law specifying the purpose and consequences of the \u201csnapshot\u201d resource evaluation that occurs, or may occur, at the start of a spouse\u2019s continuous institutionalization. The lack of clarity is also caused, in part, by the variety of circumstances that may be present at that point. A couple may or may not seek to apply for Medicaid benefits at the start of a spouse\u2019s continuous institutionalization. As we read the federal statute and state regulations, a resource evaluation is not mandatory at the time of institutionalization unless a Medicaid application is also made at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(c)(l)(B), paraphrased, provides that the state shall assess and document the total value of joint spousal resources at the beginning of continuous institutionalization \u201c[a]t the request\u201d of either spouse. A fair hearing provision is included, but contingent upon an application for benefits being made. <em>See </em>42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(e)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">Similarly, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.8(a) states that the determination of resource eligibility, including establishment of the couple\u2019s combined countable resources as of the first period of institutionalization, \u201cshall be made upon a request for a resource assessment in accordance with <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.9 or at the time of application for Medicaid benefits.\u201d In turn, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.9(a) provides, \u201c[a]t the beginning of the first continuous period of institutionalization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>... the institutionalized spouse or the community spouse ... may request an assessment of the couple\u2019s total countable resources. The purpose of the assessment is to establish the community spouse\u2019s share of the couple\u2019s total countable resources.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">We believe that absent an accompanying Medicaid application, this process is informational only. It tells the couple which assets are countable and which may be excludable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It informs them of the total value of countable assets and whether the community spouse\u2019s share thereof is above or below the maximum amount that the law then allows the community spouse to keep free of any obligation to expend it (the CSRA).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">We do not find any basis for appellant\u2019s claim that the resource evaluation is fixed at the point of institutionalization and cannot be reevaluated at the point of application, which may be many years later. <em>N.J.AC. </em>10:71^.8(a)(2) states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">In determining the resource eligibility of the institutionalized spouse, the community spouse\u2019s share of the resources is subtracted from the couple\u2019s total combined resources as of the first moment of the first day of the month of application for Medicaid. If the remaining resources are less than or equal to $2,000, the institutionalized spouse is resource eligible. If the remaining resources exceed $2,000, eligibility may not be established.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The Division interprets this language as requiring an evaluation of resources at the point of application, not as requiring utilization of previously calculated resources at the time of application. We believe that in the context of the entire statutory and regulatory scheme, that interpretation is sustainable. For instance, <em>N.J AC. </em>10:71-4.1(b) defines resources and goes on to state, \u201c[b]oth liquid and nonliquid resources shall be considered in the determination of eligibility____\u201d There is no formal determination of eligibility until application is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\"><em>N.J.AC. </em>10:71-4.1(e) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Resource eligibility: Resource eligibility is determined as of the first moment of the first day of each month. If an individual or couple is resource ineligible as of the first moment of the first day of the month, subsequent changes within that month in the amount of countable resources will not affect the original determination of ineligibility. If resource eligibility is established as of the first moment of the first day of the month, resource eligibility is established for the entire month i-egardless of any increase in the <em>amount o\u00ed </em>countable resources.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">1. This policy applies equally to individuals and couples in the month of application. Regardless of the date of application, resource eligibility is determined as of the first moment of the first day of that month.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">When addressing excludable resources the regulations begin, \u201c[a] resource which is classified as excludable shall not be considered either in the deeming of resources or in the determination of eligibility for participation in the Medicaid Only Program.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71^4.4(a). Again, an evaluation process at the point of eligibility is envisioned. Between initial evaluation and application, the nature of a resource, such as a house, may change from excluded to included or vice-versa, and new resources, such as an automobile, may be acquired that need to be added to the \u201cexcluded\u201d list. Over and over, eligibility and resource evaluation are temporally linked. Eligibility is determined upon application.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">These regulations appear consistent with federal statutes. 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396r-5(c)(2)(B), specifies, \u201cresources shall be considered to be available to an institutionalized spouse, but only to the extent that the amount of such resources exceeds the amount computed under subsection (f)(2)(A) of this section (as of the time of application for benefits).\u201d The reference to (f)(2)(A) is to the CSRA and computation thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">Appellant relies, in part, on 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396r-5(c)(4), which states that once an institutionalized spouse is determined to be eligible for Medicaid benefits, \u201cno resources of the community spouse shall be deemed available to the institutionalized spouse.\u201d A similar provision is <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.5(a)l which states that, \u201c[r]esource eligibility is determined as of the first moment of the first day of the month. Changes in the amount of countable resources subsequent to the first day of the month shall not affect eligibility.\u201d In both instances the focus is on assets acquired after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>eligibility. On one level it may seem anomalous to include the community spouse\u2019s resources and resource appreciation up to the point of eligibility but not thereafter. A distinction, however, is made in the statutory and regulatory scheme that cannot be ignored. Those portions of the statute or regulations that stand for the proposition that resources are to be determined at the time of application, <em>see e.g., </em>42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(c)(2) and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.8(a)2, cannot be nullified because another statutory or regulatory provision excludes consideration of the community spouse\u2019s resources post-eligibility. One may argue over the logic of the provisions, but not over the obvious differentiation before and after eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In <em>Atkinson, supra, </em>the Minnesota Supreme Court was faced with essentially the same issues and arguments presented in this case. The question explored was what purpose and what goal is achieved by the financial analysis that occurs when one spouse is institutionalized, and how does that analysis relate to an application for Medicaid that may occur significantly later than the point of institutionalization. After quoting portions of 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5 and noting the parallel provisions of Minnesota law, the court discussed the statutory history of the MCCA as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"al-dedup-0\">The statutory history of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-5 further supports our interpretation of the statute. The House Report accompanying the proposed spousal impoverishment provisions of the MCCA which later became section 1396r-5, makes it clear that the purpose of section 1396r-5 is to prevent the community spouse from being impoverished by having to spend down the entirety of the couple\u2019s assets to the SSI eligibility standards before the institutionalized spouse can become eligible for Medicaid benefits. [1988 U.S.C.C.AN. 857, 888.] The Report does state that the spousal share and the limit of the community spouse\u2019s share are to be calculated only as of the time of institutionalization. <em>Id. </em>at 894. It does not, however, demonstrate an intent by Congress to prohibit states from reassessing a couple\u2019s assets and determining <em>eligibility </em>based on the assets available at the time of application for benefits. On the contrary, the Report states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">The Committee observes that, in many cases, the institutionalized spouse may not apply for Medicaid benefits until months after his admission to a nursing home. Often these individuals and their spouses have \u201cspent down\u201d a significant amount of their life savings to pay the nursing home charges. <em>Repeated division of the couple\u2019s total resources into equal shares at each application or reapplication for benefits would result in the pauperization of the community spouse, as the couple\u2019s total resources would effectively be reduced to twice the resource eligibility </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number><em>standard, generally $3600, before the institutionalized spouse qualified for Medicaid. Precisely the opposite result is intended by the Committee. For this reason, the bill requires, in effect, that a </em>\u201csnapshot\u201d <em>of the couple\u2019s total resources be taken at the time of initial institutionalization, and that attribution of resources into spousal shares proceed on the basis of that \u201csnapshot, \u201d regardless of the point at which the institutionalized spouse actually files application for benefits.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 894 (emphasis added). Clearly, the purpose of taking a \u201csnapshot\u201d of the couple\u2019s resources at the time of institutionalization is to establish the spousal share so that the couple\u2019s resources are not continually halved with each application or reapplication for benefits, thereby impoverishing the community spouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\"><em>[Atkinson, supra, </em>564 <em>N.WSd </em>at 214 n. 7.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">The Minnesota Supreme Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\">While the interpretation urged by the Atkinsons is appealing from a policy standpoint because it would provide a greater measure of certainty by permanently fixing the amount that must be spent down to become eligible for MA [medical assistancej upon institutionalization, we are constrained by the plain language of the federal and state statutes: the spousal share is to be fixed based on the couple\u2019s assets as of <em>institutionalization, </em>but eligibility is to be determined by reference to the total assets owned by the couple at the time of <em>application </em>for medical benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 214-215.J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">We agree. Spousal assets are determined at the time of institutionalization. The exempt portion of those assets, attributable to the community spouse, <em>i.e., </em>those assets not available for institutionalization expenses, are determined at that point and may not exceed a maximum amount calculated pursuant to a set formula, but subject to annual change in concert with the Consumer Price Index. Eligibility for Medicaid, however, is determined at the point of application by reference to the total assets owned by the couple at that time. The previously established amount of exempt assets attributable to the community spouse, plus $2,000 of assets attributable to the institutionalized spouse, constitute the asset cap that cannot be exceeded at the time of application, unless that cap was increased to reflect a rise in the Consumer Price Index, <em>see </em>42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396r-5(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-12\">Although the statutes and regulations are not pellucidly drafted, we believe this interpretation most closely accords with the state and federal legislative intent. <em>Merin v. Maglaki, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>430, 435, 599 A.2d 1256 (1992); <em>Accountemps Div. of Robert </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number><em>Half v.

Union County Park Comm\u2019n, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>333, 337, 196 A.2d 781 (1964). One of those legislative goals is to \u201cprotect community spouses from \u2018pauperization\u2019 while preventing financially secure couples from obtaining Medicaid assistance.\u201d <em>Blumer, supra, </em>534 <em>U.S. </em>-, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 967,151 L.Ed.2d at-. So too, although we are not bound by an agency\u2019s construction of the law, we acknowledge our obligation to defer to agency expertise when the agency is interpreting the statutes and regulations it is charged with enforcing. <em>Mem, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>at 430, 436-437, 599 A.2d 1256 (1992). The agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute will prevail provided it is not plainly unreasonable. <em>Metromedia, Inc. v.

The DMAHS director, however, specifically found that on that date the couple\u2019s countable resources exceeded the maximum allowable amount. Although the director did not specify the calculations leading to that conclusion, as previously indicated, we have reviewed the record and we are satisfied that there was sufficient credible evidence in the record to support the agency\u2019s determination. No further hearing is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">The final decision of the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-11\"> There are specific assets that are excluded, such as a principal residence, one automobile, personal effects, household goods and other resources as set out in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:71-4.4. In the present case, there was some confusion at one point about the exclusion of certain realty owned by the couple, but that issue was settled and is no longer in contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
