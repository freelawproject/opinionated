Central Jersey Concrete Pipe Co., </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>65, 775 A.2d 716 (App.Div.2001), in light of <em>Laidlow v. Hariton Machinery Co., Inc., </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>602, 790 A.2d 884 (2002). We have reconsidered our prior decision and adhere to it. Accordingly, we again affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">In <em>Crippen, supra, </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>65, 775 A.2d 716, we affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant Central Jersey Concrete Company (Concrete Pipe) in a claim based on the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8, arising out of the death of Harold Crippen, husband of plaintiff Annabelle Crippen, <em>Id. </em>at 68, 775 A.2d 716. Relying on <em>Millison v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>161, 501 A.2d 505 (1985), we found that in the absence of an employer\u2019s deliberate intent to injure, demonstrated by showing either, \u201can actual intent to injure or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>knowingly exposing the employee to a risk that is substantially or virtually certain to result in injury or harm,\u201d 342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 73, 775 A.2d 716 <em>(citing Millison, supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 178, 501 A.2d 505), a plaintiff could not establish an intentional wrong necessary to overcome the exclusive remedy provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>Id. </em>at 72, 775 A.2d 716. There was no evidence in the record that, despite repeated citations by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), an injury or death was virtually or substantially likely to occur. <em>Id. </em>at 74, 775 A.2d 716. This finding was based on a lack of injuries or accidents at Concrete Pipe in connection with the material hopper. Furthermore, there we concluded that <em>Millison </em>did not create a <em>per se </em>rule that misrepresentations to OSHA constitute an intentional wrong for separate third party tort liability purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 75, 775 A.2d 716. Hence, the result in this case would have been the same had we not even cited <em>Laidlow v. Hariton Machinery Co., Inc., </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>330, 762 A.2d 311 (App.Div.2000), which was subsequently reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In <em>Laidlow, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>602, 790 A.2d 884, the Supreme Court interpreted <em>Millison, supra, </em>101 N.J. 161, 501 A.2d 505, and concluded that a lack of prior accidents will not prevent a finding of substantial certainty. <em>Id. </em>at 621, 790 A.2d 884. However, the deliberate and systematic deceptions to OSHA that a milling machine was well-guarded would support a finding of substantial certainty. <em>Id. </em>at 622, 790 A.2d 884. The essential holding of <em>Millison </em>that requires a showing first that the employer knows his actions are substantially certain to result in injury or death to an employee, and second that the resulting injury is either more than a fact of industrial employment or plainly beyond anything the Legislature intended to immunize, was approved by <em>Laidlow. Id. </em>at 617, 790 A.2d 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\"><em>Laidlow </em>does not alter our prior analysis. Although a lack of prior accidents is not dispositive, in <em>Laidlow, </em>there were several \u201cclose calls,\u201d alerting the employer of the potential hazards of the unguarded milling machine. There were no reported incidents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>with the material hopper in the present case. In addition, Concrete Pipe had taken some steps towards curing the safety hazards identified by OSHA. In <em>Laidlow, </em>the employer had removed safety devices from the milling machine, with knowledge that several workers had come close to being injured, but \u201cthe only time the' guard was ever activated ... was whenever OSHA inspectors came.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 621, 790 A.2d 884. The extreme circumstances in <em>Laidlow </em>are not present here and summary judgment was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">We reaffirm our earlier decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
