The complaint sought a declaration that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:3-25.1, which mandates that certain local health employees receive the maximum salary in their respective salary ranges after five years of service, applies to licensed Registered Environmental Health Specialists (formerly Sanitary Inspectors) employed by defendant Monmouth County Board of Health (Board). The complaint also sought an award of back pay for plaintiff Fulvio Stanziale who, as of September 1995 had been employed by the Board as a Registered Environmental Health Specialist for five years, was still so employed as of the date of the complaint, February 2000, yet had never received the maximum salary for that position. The trial judge concluded, as a matter of law, that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:3-25.1 does not apply to a county board of health. We disagree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">The critical facts are easily set forth. Following the enactment of the Local Health Services Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:3A2-1 to -35, <em>L. </em>1975, c. 329, the Monmouth County Board of Chosen Freeholders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>created the Board. As required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:3A2-6, the Board\u2019s first resolution, Resolution # 1-1978, was to create a county health department. The certification from the Monmouth County Public Health Coordinator, filed in support of defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, refers to plaintiff Stanziale as employed by the county health department. It is, however, asserted in the complaint, admitted in defendants\u2019 answer and clearly established by the Board\u2019s Resolution #33-90, which memorializes plaintiffs employ, that plaintiffs employer is the Board. We make a point of this at the outset as this fact is critical in our analysis of <em>Mizerak v. County of Middlesex, </em>230 <em>N. J.Super. </em>577, 554 A.2d 476 (App.Div.1989), <em>certif. denied, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>617, 583 A.2d 316 (1990), which held that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:3-25.1 does not apply to a sanitary inspector employed by the Middlesex County Health Department, and in our rejection of the trial judge\u2019s view that <em>Mizerak </em>is controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">We begin with the statute. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:3-25.1 (hereinafter \u00a7 25.1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">Every person holding a license issued under section 41 of <em>P.L. </em>1947, <em>c. </em>177 (C:26:1A-41), who is employed in a position for which this license is required by <em>any board of health, </em>municipality or group of municipalities shall receive the maximum salary in the person\u2019s range, within five years from the date of appointment to this position if the majority of the person\u2019s job performance evaluations are satisfactory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">\u201c[A]ny board of health,\u201d facially, would seem to include a county board of health.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">This clarity of facial meaning is somewhat clouded, however, because Chapter 3 of Title 26, in which \u00a7 25.1 is located, is captioned <em>\u201cLocal </em>Boards of Health\u201d (emphasis added). In the early ages of our State implemented local health services scheme, the primary responsibility for public health protection was delegated to the municipalities. Over time, the Legislature recognized the need for a broader approach to health services. Certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>County Boards of Health were legislated early on, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>26:11-1 to -31, repealed by <em>L. </em>1975, c. 329, \u00a7 21, but the county board of health as a viable option was not effectively legislated until the 1975 Act. <em>See generally, </em>New Jersey County and Municipal Government Study Commission, Community Health Services: Existing Patterns \u2014 Emerging Trends (November 1974) <em>{1971 Study </em>Commission), pp. 7-10; Interim Report of the Governor\u2019s Committee on Local Health Administration (June 1, 1950) <em>(1960 Interim R&amp;port), </em>pp. 7-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Thus, when originally enacted in 1947, \u00a7 25.1 applied to persons employed by a \u201cmunicipality or group of municipalities.\u201d <em>L. </em>1947, c. 181, \u00a7 5. But when amended in 1950 to extend to \u201cany board of health,\u201d county boards of health were very much in the contemplation of the Legislature. <em>See generally </em>1974 <em>Study Commission; I960 Interim Report. </em>Moreover, over the history of Title 26 and its various legislative enactments, the term \u201clocal boards of health\u201d invariably has been defined in such a way as to encompass a county board of health. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>26:1-1; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:1A-1; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:3-69.1. As we said in <em>Mizerak v. County of Middlesex, supra, </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 581, 554 A.2d 476, \u201c[s]ection 25.1 preceded the <em>Interim Report, </em>but must be considered in context with the history of health legislation described in the <em>[Interim Re</em>port].... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Both facially, then, and consistent with the legislative history of local health <em>services </em>enactments, we are convinced the <em>term </em>\u201cany board of health\u201d as used in \u00a7 25.1 applies to a county board of health. We are further convinced that not only does <em>Mizerak v. County of Middlesex, supra, </em>not require a different result but, rather, supports our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Before discussing <em>Mizerak, </em>we digress briefly to explain the various options afforded local governments with the 1975 enactment of the Local Health Services Act. As the <em>1971 Study Commission </em>indicates, the intent of the 1975 Act was to encourage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>county provided health services over municipal provided health services for both political and fiscal reasons. <em>See Mizerak v. County of Middlesex, supra, </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 579, 554 A.2d 476. The Act, therefore, empowers county boards of chosen freeholders to establish a vehicle to provide such health services. The boards of chosen freeholders were given two choices \u2014 1) establish an independent and autonomous county board of health, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:3A2~4, which would, itself, establish a county health department, <em>N.J.S.A </em>26:3A2-6a; or 2) establish its own county health department, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:3A2-6b. <em>Id. </em>at 579-80, 554 A.2d 476. Here, Monmouth County opted to enact a county board of health, to exercise all the powers of a local board of health, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:3A2-3c, -5c, including the power to adopt, amend and repeal health ordinances, <em>N.J.SA </em>26:3A2-8. But, though fairly independent of its political creator (the board of chosen freeholders), the Board does not escape the budgetary control thereof. <em>N.J.S.A </em>26:3A2-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">This leads us to <em>Mizerak. </em>There, unlike Monmouth County, Middlesex County chose to bypass the creation of an independent, autonomous in all but budgetary concerns, county board of health. Instead, it \u201cdirectly established] a county health department.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580, 554 A.2d 476. Plaintiff in <em>Mizerak </em>was employed as a sanitary inspector by the Middlesex County Health Department and sought the salary protections of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:3-25.1. We noted that such a health department \u201cis not a local or county board of health,\u201d and that, \u201c[consequently, the department is not covered by the plain language of \u00a7 25.1 <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>26:3-25.1] which applies only to \u2018any board of health, municipality or group of municipalities.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580, 554 A.2d 476. That is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">We also observed that the legislative history did not support an extension of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:3-25.1 to the Middlesex Health Department. After tracing that history, we observed that one of the concerns of the Legislature was \u201cinadequate resources and ... municipalities\u2019 reluctance to provide adequate funding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>581, 554 A.2d 476. One of the \u201cbarrier[s] to effective health services ...seen by the Legislature, and as an impetus for the mandate of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:3-25.1, was \u201cthe friction between a local board of health and the governing body of its municipality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582, 554 A.2d 476. This friction existed because such boards, despite their autonomy, remain at the mercy of their respective local governing bodies for fiscal approval of their budgets. <em>Id. </em>at 582-83, 554 A.2d 476. In <em>Mizerak, </em>the Middlesex Health Department was a direct entity of the county, not an autonomous board independent of all but the fiscal strings. <em>Id. </em>at 585, 554 A.2d 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Not so with the Monmouth County Board of Health. It, as well as the County Health Department it has created, are independent in all but its fiscal constraints. In that respect, it is dependent upon the Board of Chosen Freeholders for approval of its budget, including the salaries for its health officers and employees. <em>N.J.S.A </em>26:3A2-19. The motivating rationale for <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:3-25.1, then, applies here, whereas it did not in <em>Mizerak.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Reversed and remanded. We caution that our reversal should not be read as reaching or resolving plaintiffs claims for retroactive back pay under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:3-25.1. That issue was not reached by the motion judge and should be considered on remand. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
