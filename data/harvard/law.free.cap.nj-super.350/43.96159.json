We conclude that defendant was prejudiced by the admission of this license revocation evidence on the issue of whether he was operating the vehicle with the requisite state of mental culpability, and therefore reverse his convictions on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">Defendant, Benhart Bakka, appeals from his conviction, after a trial by jury, on all three counts of an indictment charging third degree operation of an unlawfully taken motor vehicle in a manner likely to create a risk of injury, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-10(c) (count one), first degree aggravated manslaughter, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-4 (count two), and second degree vehicular homicide, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-5 (count three). The trial judge also found defendant guilty on two motor vehicle offenses, driving while intoxicated (DWI), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50, and operating a motor vehicle while his license was suspended, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">At sentencing, the court granted the State\u2019s motion to impose an extended term based on defendant\u2019s persistent offender status, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3a. The extended term of life imprisonment with twenty-five years of parole ineligibility was imposed on count two. A five-year prison term with two and one-half years of parole ineligibility was imposed on count one, concurrent with the life sentence. Count three was merged with count two. Appropriate penalties were also imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>On the motor vehicle offenses, Bakka was sentenced to 180 days in the County Correctional Institution, a ten-year loss of license for DWI, and a ten-day jail term with a six-month license suspension for driving with a suspended license. The county jail terms were consecutive to the life sentence and consecutive to each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">On appeal, defendant raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-7\">I. WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN PERMITTING THE STATE TO INTRODUCE EVIDENCE THAT DEFENDANT\u2019S DRIVING PRIVILEGES WERE REVOKED SINCE IT WAS NOT ADMISSIBLE TO PROVE RECKLESSNESS, THEREBY DENYING DEFENDANT HIS RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-8\">II. WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DETERMINING THAT THE ORAL AND WRITTEN STATEMENTS MADE BY DEFENDANT WERE ADMISSIBLE?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-9\">A.

WHETHER DEFENDANT\u2019S SENTENCE IS EXCESSIVE?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-18\">On January 2, 1997, Eileen McCray, who was involved in an estranged boyfriend/girlfriend relationship with Bakka, was driv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>ing her 1998 Acura Integra in the area of Route 37 and Hooper Avenue in Toms River. McCray saw Bakka, who flagged her down. After some discussion, Bakka finally entered McCray\u2019s car and said that he wanted to drive. McCray declined because Bakka was \u201cnot licensed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">After a brief stop, Bakka took control of the car and drove to the Lakehurst Motel where they rented a room to talk about their relationship. Bakka was angry and McCray could tell that he had been drinking. As a result, McCray left Bakka in the motel room and drove off but returned about an hour later to find him with an almost empty pint bottle of vodka that had not been there earlier. Bakka\u2019s anger continued unabated. Eventually, he took McCray\u2019s car keys and left at about 10:45 p.m. McCray went to the police station and signed a complaint concerning Bakka\u2019s taking of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">According to Eddie Leugo, one of Bakka\u2019s roommates, Bakka returned home around midnight. Leugo had been sleeping but Bakka\u2019s loud talk caused him to awake. Leugo testified that Bakka was quite drunk. Leugo and Bakka began arguing, which caused their other roommate, Wayne Teague, to awake. Thereafter, Teague and Bakka began drinking heavily. Leugo went to bed around <em>5:00 </em>a.m. and when he awoke around 7:30 a.m., Bakka and Teague were gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">Jane Gross testified that just before 11:00 a.m. on January 3, 1997, she was traveling 55 m.p.h. northbound on the outer, local lanes of the Garden State Parkway when a black Acura passed her at a high rate of speed and eventually \u201cdrifted\u201d out of its lane and hit the left guardrail. The Acura then moved diagonally across the parkway lanes, hit the guardrail on the right side, spun around, then crossed over the grassy median of the parkway into the inner, express lanes of traffic, colliding with a 1995 Yukon SUV.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">The driver of the Yukon, Eric Haberstroh, testified that his car eventually stopped about fifty feet from where it was hit. Haber-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>stroh walked back to the Acura, and related his observations of the occupants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-5\">Well, out of the passenger side of the car \u2014 the ear was directly in the middle of the road, across the road now. And as I walked up I saw this fellow, say from the top half of his body, arms hanging out, and his head down, bleeding very profusely. And I knew there was no help for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">So I walked around the front of the car and I saw this fellow in a semi-prone position in the driver\u2019s seat. Like laying back like this. So I motioned to him with my hands like this, and he nodded his head. And he didn\u2019t seem to be in any pain. His eyes were open. He wasn\u2019t in immediate need of help. So I just stepped back and I waited for the police to come.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">Haberstroh stated that Bakka\u2019s \u201cfeet were underneath the steering wheel and the pedals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">At 11:16 a.m., New Jersey State Troopers James Miani and Richard Laverty responded simultaneously to the scene. Miani approached the Acura and saw that Teague \u201chad catastrophic head trauma; he was hanging out of the passenger\u2019s side window from the waist up,\u201d and \u201chis rear end and legs\u201d were in the car. Miani observed that Teague had not gone through any glass; the window having been rolled down when the car hit the guardrails.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">Miani observed that Bakka was conscious and \u201chad his back actually leaning against the legs and buttocks of [Teague], [Bak-ka\u2019s] left foot was partially across the seat, his foot hanging down where the normal driver foot would be.\u201d The accelerator was about ten inches away from his right foot. Miani entered the car and \u201cdetected a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming directly from [Bakka\u2019s] breath.\u201d In fact, Bakka\u2019s blood alcohol content at the time of the accident was later determined to be 0.271%. Bakka told Miani that his back was injured and that he was not the one driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">Laverty related the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-11\">When I approached the defendant I immediately detected a strong odor of alcoholic beverage emitting from his breath. The defendant began to speak in a rambling and slurred manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-12\">The defendant claimed to have no identification on his person. The defendant continued to ramble on about using pain medication and drinking alcohol prior to the accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Bakka was cervieally immobilized as a precaution and placed in an ambulance for transportation to the Riverview Medical Center. Paramedic John Shook conducted a trauma assessment of Bakka in the ambulance. Shook testified that he also smelled a strong odor of alcohol about Bakka. Although Bakka\u2019s speech was slurred, Shook found him to be \u201calert,\u201d and \u201coriented,\u201d and answering \u201call questions appropriately and promptly.\u201d Shook deliberately transposed certain information in an effort to trick Bakka; however, Bakka corrected Shook\u2019s deliberate errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">State Trooper Patrick O\u2019Dwyer went to Riverview Medical Center in order to obtain a blood sample and information about the accident from Bakka. When O\u2019Dwyer got to the hospital, Bakka was immobilized on a back board, wearing a neck brace and in obvious pain. O\u2019Dwyer told Bakka that he was under arrest and administered Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> warnings. Bakka signed the <em>Miranda </em>warning card and allowed a nurse in the emergency room to take the blood sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">O\u2019Dwyer testified to the following conversation he had with Bakka at the hospital:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">I told him, \u201cWhat happened, Ben?\u201d And he responded, \u201cI picked up my friend Wayne. We went to go home. I hit the guardrail. I blacked out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">And second question I asked him was, \u201cWho owns the Acura, Ben, do you know?\u201d And he responded, \u201cYeah. It\u2019s my girlfriend\u2019s car. I just got out of jail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">\u201cBenhart, I know you are hurting right now. Do you know that you are under arrest for being under the influence and in this accident?\u201d And Mr. Bakka continued to cry and stated that he wasn\u2019t a scum bag or a bad guy, and just wanted to go home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">Bakka also told O\u2019Dwyer that he was depressed and took pain pills. Although Bakka was in pain and apparently under the influence of alcohol, O\u2019Dwyer believed Bakka understood clearly what the officer was saying. Shook, who was also present, corroborated O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s testimony in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Laverty testified that among Bakka\u2019s personal belongings turned over to him by medical personnel at Riverview were two pill bottles: one bottle contained Meprobamate and one contained Paxil. The labels on the pill bottles stated, \u201cmay cause drowsiness,\u201d and indicated that the prescriptions had been issued to Bakka.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The State presented testimony from Reginald Grant, an accident reconstruction expert, who performed an occupant kinetics analysis of the car crash. In light of the damage to both the car and the guardrail, Grant stated that \u201c[t]here would be no expectation or any reasonable expectation whatsoever that [the occupants of the vehicle] would be moved from any position other than where they were sitting when they approached \u2014 when the vehicle approached and collided with the guardrail.\u201d Grant stated that based on the collision diagram and the eompartmentalization of the vehicle, the only place for Bakka to have been seated was in the driver\u2019s position. Grant\u2019s expert opinion was that Bakka was the operator of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">On January 6,1997 \u2014 three days after the accident \u2014 State Police Detective Anthony Sempkowski was informed that Bakka was being discharged from Riverview Medical Center. Sempkowski went to the hospital and met with Bakka in order to obtain a formal statement regarding the accident. Sempkowski advised Bakka that he was not obligated to comply; however, \u201c[Bakka] wanted to cooperate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">The two left the hospital and drove in a police vehicle to the Holmdel State Police Barracks where Sempkowski advised Bakka of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and proceeded to take a five-page, formal statement. In that statement, Bakka said that he was \u201cguessing\u201d that he was driving at the time of the accident, but that it \u201cbothered\u201d him that he could not fully remember. Bakka\u2019s version of the events leading up to the accident differed somewhat from McCray\u2019s version. He admitted to having three drinks at a bar before meeting McCray, and then drinking seven to nine beers while with McCray and while he was alone in the motel. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>stated that he consumed two \u201cstiff\u2019 drinks, mixed by Teague, before leaving their apartment in the morning, and another drink before the accident, possibly at a rest area.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Although there was no conclusive evidence that Bakka was under the influence of either Paxil or Meprobamate at the time of the accident, an assistant medical examiner testified that both drugs should never be used in conjunction with alcohol because they will cause drowsiness. The witness stated that \u201c[i]f you are driving, it is very dangerous to use in combination with alcohol,\u201d and that a person with a blood alcohol level of 0.271% who simultaneously takes Paxil and Meprobamate would have a greater level of impairment than someone who is just drinking alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Testifying in his own defense, Bakka stated that after Leugo went to bed on January 2-3, he and Teague had two to three vodka and sprite drinks, which Teague prepared. Bakka eventually went to bed at midnight, woke up around 6:00 a.m., took a shower, and had some more vodka and sprite drinks with Teague (who was awake when Bakka got up), which Teague again mixed. Bakka and Teague left the house at 9:00 a.m. because Teague needed a ride \u201cup north to a truck stop somewhere where somebody owed him some money.\u201d Before leaving, Bakka took both of his medications. Bakka drove the Acura up the Garden State Parkway northbound, with Teague as the front-seat passenger. Teague mixed more vodkas and sprites, which the two consumed while driving. They stopped at a rest area for food while on the parkway, and, according to Bakka, \u201cWayne went inside and got food. I remember, I remember him walking in, and that\u2019s the last I remember.\u201d The next thing Bakka remembered was waking up in a hospital. The scene of the accident was about eleven miles north of the rest area.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Prior to opening statements, the State sought a ruling that would permit the introduction into evidence of the fact that defendant was driving on the revoked list at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>accident.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After argument and consideration of briefs, the trial judge agreed to admit the evidence, concluding that the conscious decision of the defendant to violate the law by driving while his license was suspended was a factor that could be considered by a jury on the issue of recklessness. The evidence subsequently came before the jury at several points in the trial: (1) through McCray\u2019s testimony that defendant was \u201cnot licensed\u201d; (2) by stipulation that defendant\u2019s license was revoked on the date of the accident; and (3) through cross-examination of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Evidence is relevant if it has \u201ca tendency in reason to prove or disprove any fact of consequence to the determination of the action.\u201d <em>N.J.RE. </em>401; <em>see also State v. Hutchins, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>353, 358, 575 A.2d 35 (App.Div.1990). Although the admissibility of evidence that defendant was operating a vehicle while on the revoked list has never been discussed in a criminal case in New Jersey, a closely related issue has been addressed in the civil context. In <em>Mattero v. Silverman, </em>71 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 176 A.2d 270 (App.Div.1961), <em>certif. denied, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>305, 177 A.2d 490 (1962), a negligence action arising out of an automobile accident, the trial court had permitted evidence that plaintiff was an unlicensed driver operating his vehicle with a learner\u2019s permit, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-10 and 39:3-13. <em>Id. </em>at 6,176 A.2d 270. We reversed, holding that \u201cthe lack of a license stands as a neutral fact, irrelevant to the issue of a driver\u2019s negligence, unless it be shown directly or by reasonable inference that this was a moving and efficient cause of the accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, 176 A.2d 270. We went on to state that \u201cthe statutory violation, to be evidential, must be causally related to the happening of the accident, since a permissible inference of causality is indispensable to its relevancy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9, 176 A.2d 270. The rule set out in <em>Mattero </em>reflects, as the court noted, the weight of authority in other jurisdictions. <em>Id. </em>at 7-8, 176 A.2d 270; R.P. Davis, Annotation, <em>Lack of Proper Automobile </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number><em>Registration or Operator\u2019s License as Evidence of Operator\u2019s Negligence, </em>29 <em>A.L.R.2d </em>963, 970 (1953); <em>see also Lawrence v. Taylor, </em>8 P.3rd 607, 610 (Colo.App.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">We fail to see any meaningful distinction between driving while on the revoked list and driving while unlicensed. Indeed, there is less reason to admit evidence of license revocation than of unlicensed driver status since the driver on the revoked list presumably has the basic ability to operate a motor vehicle while the unlicensed driver may not. The distinction is pointed up by the decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Piper, </em>183 <em>Pa.Super. </em>229, 130 A.2d 195 (1957). There, the defendant had been out one night drinking with a companion, and, finding himself intoxicated, defendant told his friend to drive. <em>Id. </em>at 196. The Mend informed defendant that she not only did not have a license, but had never driven a car before and did not know how to drive. <em>Ibid. </em>Defendant, nevertheless, started the engine and told his friend how to drive. <em>Ibid. </em>Predictably, the car traveled only a few blocks before the driver lost control and hit an oncoming vehicle, killing its passenger. <em>Ibid. </em>In that case, the court was able to conclude that the driver\u2019s lack of license was admissible as probative of her inability to drive and defendant\u2019s culpability in permitting her to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 197. Of course, by contrast, in the present case the evidence suggests that defendant had considerable experience driving and the accident was not caused by his general inability to operate a vehicle, as opposed to his inability to operate it properly on this occasion. Thus, we see no reason why the rationale of <em>Mattero </em>should not be applied in this criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Criminal cases in other jurisdictions have addressed this question. In <em>Madison v. State, </em>40 <em>Ala.App. </em>62, 109 So.2d 749, 753 (1958), cert <em>denied, </em>268 <em>Ala. </em>699, 109 So.2d 755 (Ala.1959), the court, in reversing a manslaughter conviction resulting from a fatal accident due to admission of evidence that defendant\u2019s license was revoked, stated succinctly: \u201cWith or without a license, the manner of driving is not affected.\u201d In <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em>133 <em>Pa.Super. </em>104, 1 A.2d 812 (1938), the court con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>fronted a conviction for involuntary manslaughter premised solely upon a death resulting from defendant\u2019s commission of an \u201cunlawful act,\u201d which was the operation of a vehicle without a license. In reversing defendant\u2019s conviction and ordering a judgment of acquittal, the court stated that \u201cthe unlawful act must be something more than an attendant condition without which the death could not have occurred; that the death must be the natural result or probable consequence of the unlawful act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 815. The court rejected the type of \u201cbut for\u201d causation urged by the State in this case, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-6\">In the instant case, it is true that the death would not have occurred if appellant\u2019s automobile had not been on the highway. Its presence was unquestionably a condition without which Vincent\u2019s death could not have taken place. But appellant\u2019s violation of the Vehicle Code had no direct relationship to the death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">\n<em>[Ibm</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">We acknowledge that cases from other jurisdictions have, under a variety of circumstances, permitted evidence in vehicular homicide prosecutions that the defendant was driving with a revoked or suspended license. However, those decisions generally contain no analysis of the issue and we do not find them helpful. <em>See McGhee v. State, </em>338 So.2d 865 (Ala.Crim.App.1976); <em>State v. Yowell, </em>184 <em>Kan. </em>352, 336 P.2d 841, 849-50 (1959); <em>State v. Thomas, </em>17 <em>N.C.App. </em>8,193 S.E.2d 450 (1972). Indeed, in each of those cases, the convictions were actually reversed, rendering the courts\u2019 statements <em>dictum. </em>In two other cases, courts permitted evidence that a defendant\u2019s license was revoked along with evidence that the defendant had prior DWI convictions. Because those opinions do not separate out the license revocation evidence for discussion, <em>see United States v. Loera, </em>923 F.2d 725, 729 (9th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>502 <em>U.S. </em>854, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>164, 116 L.Ed.2d 128 (1991); <em>State v. Yowell, </em>276 <em>Ark. </em>258, 634 S.W.2d 118 (1982), they likewise provide no guidance on the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">To be probative on the issue of defendant\u2019s recklessness, the lack of a valid driver\u2019s license had to be causally related to defendant\u2019s driving conduct that resulted in the fatal accident. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>That critical connection was absent in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To reason, as the trial judge did here, that the lack of license demonstrated a lack of respect for the law and was thus probative of recklessness, proves too much. By that same logic, the fact that defendant was driving a car without the owner\u2019s consent should have been admissible on the issue of recklessness, a proposition that would not withstand serious scrutiny and is not advanced by the State here. Many offenders are engaged in one form of illegal conduct while committing another, but we are unable to find any precedent for the proposition that disregard of the law is itself a factor to be evaluated in determining a defendant\u2019s level of mental culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Although driving on the revoked list is not a \u201ccrime,\u201d it is certainly within the scope of the other \u201cwrongs or acts\u201d proscribed by <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b). Biunno, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>comment 7 on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404 (2001). While the State\u2019s purpose in offering the revocation evidence, to substantiate defendant\u2019s recklessness, does not fit neatly into the purposes set out in <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b), those examples \u201care not intended to be exclusive.\u201d <em>Stale v. Stevens, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>289, 300-01, 558 A.2d 833 (1989). Whatever the purpose, however, a precondition of admissibility under the rule is that the evidence be \u201crelevant to a material issue in dispute.\u201d <em>See State v. Cofield, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>328, 338, 605 A.2d 230 (1992). Since we have determined that the evidence was not relevant, no further <em>N.J.R.E. </em>404(b) analysis is required, nor need we address the potential impact of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Finally, the State\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Fearick, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>32, 350 A.2d 227 (1976), is misplaced. There, the Court was reviewing the mandatory jail term imposed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-40 upon a driver who, while on the revoked list, was involved in an accident resulting in personal injuries. <em>Fearick, supra, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>at 34, 350 A.2d 227. In the course of rejecting Fearick\u2019s contention that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>jail term only applied if the driver was at fault in the accident, the Court referred to the \u201clegislative goal to protect the public, as well as the suspended driver himself, by removing presumptively unsafe drivers from the road____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37, 350 A.2d 227. Given the entirely different context in which the Court\u2019s observation was made, we do not find <em>Fearkk </em>dispositive of the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">We must still decide whether the erroneous admission of this evidence resulted in prejudice to defendant or was harmless. <em>R. </em>2:10-2. There is no doubt that the evidence was quite overwhelming, both as to defendant\u2019s identity as the driver and as to his intoxication. However, there was little, if any, evidence about the manner in which defendant was driving when he crashed the vehicle. The only witness, Jane Gross, testified that defendant \u201czoomed past\u201d her while she was going 55 m.p.h. and \u201cdrifted\u201d out of his lane, striking the guardrail and causing him to apparently lose control of the car. The State\u2019s accident reconstruction expert attributed the accident to \u201coversteering\u201d by defendant after hitting the left guardrail. Thus, defendant was speeding and not in full control of his vehicle, likely as a result of drinking, medication, and lack of sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Defendant was convicted of aggravated manslaughter, which requires that \u201cthe actor recklessly causes death under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:11-4a. The court properly charged the jury as to the meaning of \u201crecklessly,\u201d as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(3), and, with respect to \u201ccircumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life,\u201d instructed the jury not to \u201cfocus on the defendant\u2019s state of mind but rather on the circumstances under which you find he acted.\u201d The jury was instructed that vehicular homicide similarly requires that the death be caused by driving a vehicle recklessly, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-5a.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court also charged the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>on the elements of DWI, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50, and driving while one\u2019s license has been suspended or revoked, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-40, and instructed that, if satisfied defendant violated either of those statutes, the jury could consider such fact, along with all of the other evidence, in deciding whether he acted recklessly.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">With respect to the offense charged in count one, there are two distinct components, one related to the taking of the vehicle, the other as to its operation. Concerning the former, the statute prohibits taking, operating, or exercising control over a vehicle without the consent of the owner, with purpose to withhold it temporarily from the owner. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-10c. As to this prong, the mental state is clearly spelled out by use of the words \u201cwith purpose,\u201d which means \u201cpurposely.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(l). It is not as clear, however, what level of mental culpability is applicable to the second component of the offense, operation of the vehicle \u201cin a manner that creates a risk of injury.\u201d If no requisite mental state could be gleaned from the statute, then the gap-filler provision, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2c(3), would come into play and \u201cknowingly\u201d would be the applicable mental state. However, it could be argued that because purposeful action applies to one element of the offense, it should apply to all. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2c(l). Such a construction would avoid the unusual situation of having different mental states applicable to different elements of the same statutory offense. <em>See State v. Demarest, </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>323, 331, 599 A.2d 937 (App.Div.1991). A similar question was addressed in <em>State v. Dixon, </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>126, 135-36, 787 A.2d 211 (App.Div. 2001), but it would appear that the basis of the result there was the structure of the eluding statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2b, which differs significantly from the offense at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In any event, the parties have not briefed this interesting issue and we need not decide it at this time. The trial judge charged the jury as to the definition of purposely, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(1), without making any distinction between the two components, an approach that seems to be sanctioned by the model charge. <em>See Model Criminal Jury Charge (N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-10b and -10c). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Given that instruction, which focuses on whether defendant had the \u201cconscious object\u201d to engage in the proscribed conduct, in this case the operation of the vehicle, so as to create a risk of injury, or \u201cis aware of the existence of such\u201d risk, we have no doubt that the revocation evidence could and likely did impact the jury\u2019s determination that defendant possessed the required mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the admission of the license revocation testimony was harmless error. Evidence of uncharged bad conduct is inherently prejudicial. <em>State v. Nance, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>376, 386, 689 A.2d 1351 (1997); <em>Stevens, supra, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 302-03, 558 A.2d 833. In this case, the prejudice was not merely general but quite specific. The prosecutor used the evidence to affect severely defendant\u2019s credibility on cross-examination and in summation specifically referred to defendant being on the revoked list at least three times. Indeed, the prosecutor concluded his summation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">My burden is to prove this case to you beyond a reasonable doubt. Beyond a reasonable doubt, he was the driver. He caused the death of Wayne Teague. And he did so driving the vehicle not only recklessly at almost three times the legal blood limit, 60 chances, 60 times the likelihood of risk, but he did it recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to Wayne Teague, whether it was Wayne Teague\u2019s or anybody else who happened to have the misfortune to be on the roadway with him, <em>the guy who was on the revoked l-ist. </em>The guy who said, well, I\u2019m going to try to get away with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Given the court\u2019s charge, in conjunction with the prosecutor\u2019s comments, we conclude that the improperly received evidence clearly had the capacity to influence the jury\u2019s verdict on the homicide charges, despite the strength of the State\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">Because there was essentially no dispute that defendant took the vehicle without McCray\u2019s consent, it is less clear that the license revocation evidence, which the court told the jury it could consider on the issue of \u201crecklessness,\u201d could have prejudiced the defendant on the unlawful taking charge. Nevertheless, given its highly inflammatory nature and the fact that the court did not expressly limit the jury\u2019s consideration of the evidence, <em>see Co-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number><em>field, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 340-41, 605 A.2d 230, we have no assurance that the jury did not consider the license revocation in finding defendant guilty of count one. Indeed, it might well be questioned whether a limiting instruction \u201cno matter how meticulously phrased\u201d could \u201coffset the devastatingly prejudicial impact\u201d of this proof. <em>Id. </em>at 342, 605 A.2d 230 (Stein, J., concurring). Accordingly, we conclude that defendant must receive a new trial on count one as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">(At the request of the Court, Parts II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII of this opinion have been excluded from publication.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-12\"> <em>Miranda v.
