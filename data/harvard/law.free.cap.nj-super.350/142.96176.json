As detailed in the trial court\u2019s reported opinion, <em>Tartaglia v. Paine Webber, Inc., </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>182, 184-87, 775 A.2d 786 (Law Div.2001), the material was obtained by plaintiff, an attorney formerly employed by Paine Webber, prior to her termination and, thereafter, through a co-worker for use in this contemplated litigation. Plaintiff appears to have obtained the material in anticipation of her termination and the Law Against Discrimination (\u201cLAD\u201d) suit concerning the termination. She contends that the information she obtained supports her LAD claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Although believing that the \u201cdocuments in question would have fallen under the purview of plaintiffs omnibus request for the production of documents\u201d and \u201cthe Doctrine of Inevitable Discovery,\u201d the trial court concluded that \u201cplaintiffs conduct goes far beyond its impact on defendant,\u201d 342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 194, 775 A.2d 786, and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">[a] judicial policy that ignores a party\u2019s pre-litigation lawlessness in connection with the gathering of evidence and further permits such tainted evidence to be admitted at trial merely because the evidence would have been otherwise admissible if the offending party had adhered to the rule of law, corrupts the judicial process and converts the court into an accomplice after the fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-10\">[342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 194-95, 775 A.2d 786.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-11\">The judge further concluded that \u201ca judicial policy that deters such lawless conduct by excluding such tainted evidence from being admitted at trial ... preserves the integrity of the judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>process and promotes proper pre-litigation evidence gathering,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 195, 775 A.2d 786, and \u201cthat the Inevitable Discovery-Doctrine does not bar the exclusion of evidence in a civil case when such evidence was obtained by the offending party through lawless pre-litigation activities.\u201d Ibid. He therefore held \u201cthat plaintiffs lawless pre-litigation evidence gathering activities warrant the sanction of excluding the evidence so gathered from being admitted at the time of trial,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>in this LAD action against defendants, her former employer and supervisor at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Before us, plaintiff argues that \u201cno evidence should be suppressed in the absence of \u2018substantial prejudice\u2019 to the defendants,\u201d that her allegedly wrongful conduct was itself protected by the LAD, and that \u201cevidence that will inevitably be discovered should not be suppressed.\u201d While we have much sympathy for the policy the trial judge tried to support (and particularly the integrity of the judicial process and the need to deter), we find it inconsistent with existing judicial philosophy which permits a search for the truth in the underlying litigation and leaves defendant with other remedies which might be available independent of the suppression of relevant evidence. This is especially true in a situation in which the judge found that \u201cunder the Doctrine of Inevitable Discovery, plaintiffs pre-litigation self help measures appear to have resulted in no actual harm to defendant.\u201d Id. at 194, 775 A.2d 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Plaintiff is an attorney at law admitted to practice in New York as well as New Jersey. Defendant Paine Webber employed her as an attorney in its legal department from August 1992 until April 1998 when it terminated her employment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>April of 1999, plaintiff commenced this action alleging, among other things, violations of the LAD. Specifically, she alleged that she was fired because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\">of retaliation for her assertion and support of various internal complaints within the legal department regarding such matters as sex harassment, racial discrimination, gender discrimination, non-compliance with wage and hour laws, non-compliance with subpoenas and other orders served upon the company. Plaintiff also allege[d] that she was discriminated against due to her psychiatric disability which [was] aggravated as a result of defendant\u2019s alleged misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">[342 <em>N.J.,Super, </em>at 184, 775 A.2d 786.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">On October 19, 1999, plaintiff produced documents in response to defendants\u2019 request for the production of documents. Among the documents produced were \u201cprivileged and/or confidential documents respecting the employment of other Paine Webber attorneys and employees.\u201d With regard to those documents, defendant Herbert Janick submitted a certification in support of defendants\u2019 application for an order to show cause seeking to have the documents returned and the complaint dismissed. As the trial judge developed in his opinion, Janick certified that a personnel memorandum, dated December 5, 1997, produced by plaintiff was labeled \u201cconfidential attorney work product material\u201d and was obtained without permission. Janick further certified that the memo was filed in his computer in an area only accessible by him and Paine Webber\u2019s computer systems administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">During plaintiffs deposition, plaintiff was asked whether such a memo that had nothing to do with plaintiff was \u201cfair game for everyone in the department.\u201d She responded in the affirmative if it was on the shared system from which she asserts the memorandum was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">In his reported opinion, the trial judge suppressed the December 1997 personnel memorandum. He also suppressed two com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>puter generated lists of terminated and active employees, one of which was apparently obtained by plaintiff through a friend and former co-worker after plaintiffs termination. These documents were also generated by the Paine Webber Human Resources Management System and stored on its computer. After his decision was rendered, the trial judge clarified that plaintiff could not use the evidence even though it may have become available in the ordinary course of discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Plaintiff contends that no evidence should be suppressed in the absence of \u201csubstantial prejudice\u201d to defendants. Relying on cases like <em>Manoteare Health Services, Inc. v. Osmose Wood Preserving, Inc., </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>218, 764 A.2d 475 (App.Div.2001), she urges that the \u201csubstantial prejudice\u201d standard sensibly prevents a party from gaining an unfair advantage through wrongful conduct and that she has not gained any \u201cunfair advantage\u201d through her allegedly wrongful conduct. Defendants counter that the trial judge\u2019s order was \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d and can in no way be said to constitute a reversible \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\"><em>Manoteare </em>dealt with the spoliation- of evidence in which the defendant was permitted to inspect the fire resistant plywood in question but was \u201cdenied notice of the removal and replacement of the damaged plywood and thereby lost the ability to monitor the removal and replacement phase.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221, 764 A.2d 475. We held that the appropriate sanction was to bar the evidence obtained during the removal and replacement stage but not to dismiss the eomplaint. <em>Ibid. </em>In so holding, we noted that the prejudice in the case was apparent, as defendant\u2019s experts were not able to observe the removal and repair work themselves, despite the fact that plaintiff produced reports and videotapes concerning the work that was done. <em>Id. </em>at 230, 764 A.2d 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">We agree with plaintiff that defendants in <em>Manoteare </em>were \u201cprejudiced\u201d by the lost opportunity to inspect and observe critical evidence, whereas in this case they had all the disputed evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>in their possession at all times. Stated differently, plaintiff did not destroy or deprive defendants of any evidence or any of their file contents. Nor is it clear how plaintiff may have obtained some \u201cunfair advantage\u201d in the litigation. As noted, defendants were at all times in the possession of their documents. <em>Cf. Rosenblit v. Zimmerman, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>391, 766 A.2d 749 (2001) (no spoliation claim where plaintiff had copy of record defendant destroyed in contemplation of malpractice litigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Moreover, evidence illegally obtained in violation of the Constitution is generally deemed inadmissible only in a criminal prosecution and only because of the illegal conduct of government officials. <em>See, e.g., Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 <em>U.S. </em>643, 81 <em>S.Ct. </em>1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961); <em>State v. Carty, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>632, 657, 790 A.2d 903 (2002); <em>State v. Novembrino, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>95, 519 A.2d 820 (1987). <em>See also United States v. Janis, </em>428 <em>U.S. </em>433, 459-60, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>3021, 3034-3035, 49 L.Ed.2d 1046 (1976) (exclusionary rule not extended to preclude admission of evidence seized by a State law enforcement officer in a federal civil action). The goal of the exclusionary rule is to prevent \u201cinsolence in office\u201d and \u201cdeter\u201d government officers from violating the law. <em>State v. Novembrino, supra, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>at 165, 519 A.2d 820 (Handler, J. concurring); <em>State v. Bisaccia, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>586, 591, 279 A.2d 675 (1971) (Weintraub, C.J.); <em>State v. Calcagno, </em>120 <em>N.J.Super. </em>536, 537, 295 A.2d 366 (App.Div.1972) (result of search by employer\u2019s private investigators of employer admissible because \u201c[t]he cloak of protection furnished by the Fourth Amendment is directed against official arrogance and insolence in office by public agents\u201d). <em>See also State v. Carty, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 657, 790 A.2d 903 (purpose of exclusionary rule is \u201cto deter police conduct and to preserve the integrity of the court,\u201d quoting <em>State v. Johnson, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>639, 651, 573 A.2d 909 (1990)). Accordingly, illegally obtained evidence, which would be subject to suppression if secured by a government official, need not be suppressed when obtained by a private citizen acting on his or her own behalf. <em>See, e.g., Mercer v. Parsons, </em>95 <em>N.J.L. </em>224, 112 A 254 (E &amp; A 1920) (wife\u2019s illegal interception of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>husband\u2019s mail did not preclude its admission into evidence); <em>State v. Calcagno, supra </em>(evidence obtained from workplace drawer by employer\u2019s investigators admissible in criminal prosecution); <em>DelPresto v. DelPresto, </em>97 <em>N.J.Super. </em>446, 235 A.2d 240 (App.Div. 1967) (reversing suppression of evidence obtained by illegal entry into husband\u2019s paramour\u2019s house in matrimonial proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\"> The policy objectives behind the exclusionary rule, designed to deter police and government officers from infringing on constitutional rights of individuals, are not achieved by suppressing relevant evidence in the present dispute involving private parties. It has been well settled that our mission, as a judiciary, is to limit the exclusion of probative evidence and to promote a search for the truth. <em>See, e.g., State v. Briley, 53 N.J. </em>498, 506, 251 A.2d 442 (1969). Moreover, even when evidence illegally obtained by the police violates the Fourth Amendment or State Constitution, <em>see N.J. Const, </em>art. I, H 7, it is nevertheless admissible if \u201cinevitably discoverable,\u201d <em>see e.g., Nix v. Williams, </em>467 <em>U.S. </em>431, 444, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2501, 2509, 81 L.Ed.2d 377 (1984); <em>State v. Sugar, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>214, 238-40, 495 A.2d 90 (1985), and there is no other basis for exclusion. <em>See also Fox Searchlight Pictures, Inc. v. Paladino, </em>89 <em>Cal.App.4th </em>294, 106 Cal.Rptr.2d 906, 920 (2d Dist.2001) (\u201cfundamental fairness to the plaintiff requires the plaintiff be allowed to make such a limited disclosure of the former employer\u2019s secrets to her own attorneys to the extent necessary to prepare a claim for wrongful discharge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\"> In this case it is disputed whether plaintiff unlawfully obtained the confidential memorandum or took it from a computer to which she had authorized access. Plaintiff claims that the memo was on a shared system and, therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that it was \u201cinnocently acquired\u201d and admissible on that basis alone. <em>See Kempcke v. Monsanto Co., </em>132 F.3d 442 (8th Cir.1998). Defendants assert that the material was acquired unlawfully. The factual dispute need not be resolved in this context, although it may be relevant to plaintiffs credibility. Independent of the Fourth Amendment values discussed, we can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>find no judicial policy which requires exclusion of the contested evidence in this case. In fact, defendant points to no statute or court rule which trumps the judicial policy which favors the admission of all probative evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Sackler v. Sackler, </em>15 <em>N.Y.M </em>40, 44, 255 N.Y.S.2d 83, 203 N.E.2d 481 (1964) (illegal entry did not require suppression of evidence obtained because judicial policy is to promote introduction of relevant evidence; \u201cthe New York Legislature, when it has found necessity for outlawing evidence because it was secured by particular unlawful means, has provided specific statutory prohibitions such as those against the use of proof gotten by illegal eavesdropping\u201d); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-17 to <em>-44 </em>(regarding privileges and the Rules of Evidence). In any event:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">As a general rule, our legal system does not attempt to do justice incidentally and to enforce penalties by indirect means. A judge does not attempt, in the course of a specific litigation, to investigate and punish all offenses which incidentally cross the path of that litigation. Such a practice would offend our system of law in several ways. (1) It amounts to trying a violation of law without the proper complaint and process which are essential for its correct investigation. (2) Determination of incidental violations jeopardizes the primary litigation by delaying, interrupting, confusing and sometimes frustrating it. (3) It does all of this unnecessarily and gratuitously; the persons harmed by the supposed incidental violations have direct means of redress available and should not be allowed to attend to their complaints in this indirect and possibly tardy manner. (4) The judicial rales of evidence were never meant to be used as an indirect method of punishment. To punish the incidental violation by rendering evidence obtained thereby inadmissible in the primary litigation is to enlarge improperly the fixed penalty of the law, that of fine or imprisonment, by adding to it the forfeiture of some civil right through loss of the means of proving it. \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-7\">The incidental illegality is by no means condoned. It is merely ignored in <em>this </em>litigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>For these reasons, it has long been established that the admissibility of evidence is not affected by the illegality of the means through which the party has obtained the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">[8 <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>\u00a7 2183 (McNaughton rev.1961).] <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeF\"><em>See also </em>P.A. Agabin, Annotation, <em>Admissibility, in Civil Case, of Evidence Obtained by Unlawful Search and Seizure, </em>5 A.L.R.3d 670, 674 (1966) (\u201cMaking the view that the prohibitions of the Fourth Amendment run only against governmental actions, the courts in most of the few cases where the issue has been raised have held that evidence would not be excluded in a civil case merely because it had been obtained by an allegedly unlawful search or seizure carried out by one other than a governmental agent\u201d); 12A <em>Fed. Proc., L.Ed. </em>\u00a7 33:603 (1988) (\u201c[a]s for civil proceedings, the Supreme Court has noted that it has never applied the exclusionary rule to exclude evidence in such actions\u201d); Bernard A. Nigro, Jr., Note, <em>The Exclusionary Rule in Administrative Proceedings, </em>54 <em>Geo. Wash. L.Rev. </em>564, 565 (1986) (\u201cMhe Supreme Court has held that the exclusionary rule applies in all federal and state criminal trials, but never in purely civil cases\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">We reverse the suppression order in this civil dispute between private parties involving no governmental or State action. We find no basis in these circumstances to suppress any evidence which tends to preclude development of the true and relevant facts, particularly when the documents were inevitably discoverable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">We do not, however, conclude that the documents are admissible in the cause.

The trial judge has already determined that there is no \u201cprivilege\u201d regarding the December 5, 1997 Janick memorandum. Defendants did not seek leave to cross-appeal from the trial judge\u2019s ruling that the memorandum was \u201cnot privileged as either an attorney-client communication under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>504 or under the work product doctrine as material prepared in anticipation of trial,\u201d 342 <em>N.J.Super, </em>at 185 n. 4, 775 A.2d 786, and we do not address that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The order under review is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the Law Division for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-9\"> In her brief plaintiff includes a \u201cStatement of Facts Alleged by Plaintiff\" in order \u201cto provide the Court with a fuller understanding of what Ms. Tartaglia hopes to prove at trial than that which is provided by her Complaint.\" Defendants object to the inclusion of this \u201cunsubstantiated set of allegations,\" which is not part of the record and is submitted in violation of the Rules governing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>appellate practice.
