Section 307e caps a municipality\u2019s \u201cfair share\u201d obligation at 1,000 units \u201cwithin six years from the grant of substantive certification, unless it is demonstrated, following ... an evidentiary hearing ... that it is likely that the municipality through its zoning powers could create a realistic opportunity lor more than 1,000 low and moderate income units within that six-year period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">The matter comes before us as a result of an interpretation of \u00a7 307e by COAH, which was issued in response to an inquiry by Philip Cat\u00f3n, the Master appointed by Judge Serpentelli in a declaratory judgment action instituted by appellant, Township of Jackson, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-313a, in which Jackson seeks approval of its second cycle fair-share obligation. Cat\u00f3n asked COAH for a written explanation as to how the 1,000 unit cap would be applied to Jackson\u2019s second cycle fair-share obligation, which had been fixed at 1,323. Jackson devised a plan for 1,165 units. Judge Serpentelli has elected to withhold any decision on Jackson\u2019s declaratory judgment action pending COAH\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">By letter dated November 1, 1999, COAH responded to Cat\u00f3n by stating that the 1,000 unit cap applied to a municipality\u2019s \u201ccalculated need,\u201d not its pre-eredited need; that is, if, after applying applicable credits and reductions, Jackson\u2019s fair-share <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>number is more than 1,000, \u201cit is capped at 1,000.\u201d Jackson moved for reconsideration. By written opinion dated May 3, 2000, COAH reaffirmed its prior determination that the 1,000 unit cap applied to a municipality\u2019s calculated, not pre-credited need, and therefore stated that Jackson\u2019s entitlement to cap relief depended upon whether its calculated need exceeded 1,000 units. Jackson has appealed COAH\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Preliminarily, strictly speaking Jackson\u2019s appeal is not from a final decision of a State agency. <em>See B. </em>2:2-3(a)(2). Jackson appeals from an advisory opinion by COAH given in order to guide the Law Division in a pending declaratory judgment action. <em>See N.J. Civil Serv. Ass\u2019n v. State, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>605, 612, 443 A.2d 1070 (1982) (opinions of an administrative agency on which no action is taken do not constitute final' agency action which may be appealed as of right). Jackson should have awaited entry of a final judgment in the Law Division and then appeal as of right. <em>B. </em>2:2-3(a)(1). The appeal is inconsistent with the policy of the Supreme Court that all <em>Mount Laurel </em>issues should be decided in one proceeding, with a single appeal. <em>So. Burlington Cty. N.A.A.C.P. v. Tp. of Mount Laurel, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>158, 290, 456 A.2d 390 (1983) <em>(Mount Laurel II). </em>Nevertheless, for the purpose of resolving the narrow issue before us, whether the 1,000 unit cap applies to pre-credited or calculated need, we treat the appeal as a motion for leave to appeal and grant the motion. <em>B. </em>2:4 \u2014 4(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Section 307e caps a municipality\u2019s \u201cfair share\u201d at 1,000 units. The term \u201cfair share\u201d is undefined by the FHA and COAH regulations, despite the fact that it is at the heart of the <em>Mount Laurel </em>doctrine. In defining the municipalities\u2019 constitutionally-mandated obligation to provide affordable housing, the Court in <em>Mount Laurel II </em>acknowledged that a judicially-imposed remedy to such housing could result in the \u201cconstruction of lower income housing in such quantity as would radically transform the municipality overnight.\u201d 92 <em>N.J. </em>at 219, 456 A.2d 390. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>stressed that the <em>Mount Laurel </em>doctrine was not intended to \u201csweep away all land use restrictions or leave our open spaces and natural resources prey to speculators.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>After setting forth the parameters of the doctrine and procedure to carry it out, the Court ultimately encouraged legislative initiatives to implement the doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 212-13, 352, 456 A.2d 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The legislative response was the FHA, <em>L. </em>1985, c. 222. Section 307e, as initially enacted, authorized COAH to place a limit on the number of units allocated to a municipality based on a percentage of existing housing stock and other criteria. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:27D-307c(2)(b) authorized COAH to adopt guidelines to address the potential that an \u201cestablished pattern of development in the community [may] be drastically altered.\u201d Obedient to the legislative mandate, in May 1987, COAH adopted <em>N.J.AC. </em>5:92-7.1 which, provided in applicable part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">After receiving the crediting provided in Subchapter 6, Credits, where a municipality\u2019s present and prospective fair share exceeds 1,000 low and moderate income housing units, the municipality may adjust its fair share to 1,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">[19 <em>N.J.R. </em>806(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">In <em>Calton Homes, Inc. v. Council on Affordable Hous., </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>438, 447-48, 582 A.2d 1024 (App.Div.1990), <em>certif. denied, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>326, 604 A.2d 601 (1991), we invalidated <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:92-7.1(b) because it was not based on any \u201ccriteria,\u201d observing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-10\">By granting the Council the power to base its fair share limits upon any criteria \u201cwhich the [C]ouncil deems appropriate,\u201d N.J.S.A. 52:27D-307e, the Legislature could not have intended to convey unbridled discretion to select an absolute cap on the number of units to be built without first considering the burden imposed on the petitioning municipality and its relationship to other municipalities sharing the burden of providing regional and statewide housing needs. <em>See generally Mount Laurel II, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 219, 456 A.2d 390.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at 448, 582 A.2d 1024.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">The Legislature responded by adopting the present text of \u00a7 307e which adds criteria correlating a 1,000 unit cap with a municipality\u2019s capacity to absorb a substantial amount of affordable housing. <em>L. </em>1993, c. 31, effective January 29, 1993. Thus, COAH adopted the present rule, <em>N.JAC. </em>5:93-14.1, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>No municipality shall be required to address a fair share beyond 1,000 units within six years from the grant of substantive certification, unless it is demonstrated, following an objection and an evidentiary healing, based upon the facts and circumstances of the affected municipality that it is likely that the municipality through its zoning powers could create a realistic opportunity for more than 1,000 low and moderate income units within the six year period. The facts and circumstances which shall determine whether a municipality\u2019s fair share shall exceed 1,000 units shall be a finding that the municipality has issued more than 5,000 certificates of occupancy for residential units in the six year period preceding the petition for substantive certification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Jackson claims that \u201cfair share\u201d under \u00a7 307e equates to \u201cpre-credited need.\u201d \u201cPre-credited need\u201d is defined as \u201cthe municipal low and moderate income housing obligation resulting from subtracting filtering, residential conversion and spontaneous rehabilitation from the sum of indigenous need, reallocated present need, prior cycle prospective, prospective need and demolitions.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:93-1.3. In other words, COAH calculates pre-credited need by adding and deducting \u201csecondary sources of demand and supply,\u201d such as demolitions, filtering, residential conversions and spontaneous rehabilitation. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:93-2.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The major difference between the first cycle and second cycle regulations is that the second cycle formula factors in \u201cprior-cycle prospective need,\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:93-2.13, which is defined as \u201cthat portion of the 1987 1993 prospective need included in the 1987-1999 low and moderate income housing need calculations.\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>5:93-1.3. COAH elected to employ this \u201ccumulative\u201d methodology for the 1987-1999 cycle. It did so because the data from the 1990 census, which COAH relies upon in calculating housing need, showed a significant drop in the overall state-wide need for affordable housing, based in large part on growth that did not occur. <em>See Morris Cty. v. Riverview Condominiums, Inc., </em>304 <em>N.J.Super. </em>322, 336-37, 700 A.2d 884 (App.Div.1997), <em>certif. denied, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>364, 704 A.2d 1299 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">As noted, in this case, COAH interpreted the 1,000 unit cap as applying to calculated, not pre-credited need. A municipality\u2019s \u201ccalculated need\u201d is the number determined by \u201csubtracting adjustments, reductions, credits, bonuses, prior cycle credits and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>20 percent cap from the precredited need.\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>5:93-1.3. <em>See also N.J AC. </em>5:93-2.17. For example, COAH allows a \u201cone-for-one reduction\u201d from pre-credited need \u201cfor affordable housing activities undertaken from 1987 to 1993 as part of a COAH certified or court settlement plan.\u201d <em>N.J AC. </em>5:93-2.14. Likewise, under prior-cycle credits, a \u201cone-for-one credit shall be granted for low- and moderate-income housing constructed between April 1, 1980 and December 15, 1986 that conforms to [certain] criteria----\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:93-2.15. The twenty percent cap applies where a municipality\u2019s calculated need could result in new construction that would exceed twenty percent of a municipality\u2019s estimated 1993 occupied housing stock. <em>N.JAC. </em>5:93-2.16(a). The various credits and reductions are further defined in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:93-3.1 to -3.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">In ruling that the 1,000 unit cap applied to calculated need, not pre-credited need, COAH emphasized two factors. First, it notes that in <em>Calton Homes, supra, </em>244 <em>N.J.Super, </em>at 445, 582 A.2d 1024, we equated a municipality\u2019s \u201cfair share number\u201d with pre-credited need minus \u201ca variety of credits, caps and adjustments____\u201d Second, COAH relied on its own 1989 determination that the number of units that could be transferred pursuant to a regional contribution agreement was based on calculated need, not pre-credited need. See <em>In re Parsipanny Troy Hills Tp., </em>decided April 24,1989. COAH reasoned that it would be inconsistent with its own past practice and with the court\u2019s calculations in <em>Calton Homes </em>to equate \u201cfair share\u201d with \u201cpre-credited need.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">COAH\u2019s decision, like that of any administrative agency, must stand unless arbitrary or capricious. <em>In re Warren Tp., </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>1, 26, 622 A.2d 1257 (1993); <em>Van Dalen v. Washington Tp., 120 N.J. 234, 244, 576 A.2d 819 </em>(1990); <em>Williams v. Deft of Human Servs., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>102,107, 561 A.2d 244 (1989). The Court has repeatedly noted COAH\u2019s broad discretion to implement its statutory mandate. <em>Warren Tp., supra, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>at 27, 622 A.2d 1257; <em>Holmdel Builders Ass\u2019n v. Holmdel Tp., </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>550, 577, 583 A.2d 277 (1990); <em>Van Dalen, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 245, 576 A.2d 819; <em>Hills Dev. Co. v. Bernards Tp., supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 32, 510 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>A.2d 621 (1986). This broad power includes wide latitude in determining standards and procedures for how many affordable units are required to meet a municipality\u2019s fair share, <em>Van Dalen, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 246, 576 A.2d 819, and in establishing standards for compliance with the fair share. <em>Holmdel Builders Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 577, 583 A.2d 277. The Court has also acknowledged that the novelty of the legislation demands that courts give COAH wide latitude in carrying out its statutory duties. <em>Van Dalen, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 246, 576 A.2d 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Based on the limited record before us, we cannot conclude that COAH\u2019s ruling is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable, or inconsistent with the statutory guidelines under the FHA. As demonstrated by the <em>Parsipanny-Troy Hills </em>decision, COAH has consistently equated fair share with calculated need. Moreover, the original 1,000 unit cap regulation adopted by COAH specified that the cap applied to municipalities whose fair share exceeds 1,000 \u201c[a]fter receiving the crediting provided in <em>[N.J.A.C. </em>5:92-6] Credits.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:92-7.1(b). In addition, as noted in <em>Calton Homes, supra, </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 445, 582 A.2d 1024, we interpreted COAH\u2019s methodology equating fair share as pre-eredited need minus a variety of credits and adjustments. Finally, \u201ccalculated need\u201d is the figure that \u201cmunicipalities shall address in their housing elements,\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:93-2.1(a), the figure that truly reflects the municipality\u2019s obligation to provide for affordable housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The Legislature, in amending the statute in 1993, is presumed to have been aware of the <em>Calton Homes </em>decision, the then extant COAH rule, and COAH\u2019s own interpretation of the legislation. <em>See Chase Manhattan Bank v. Josephson, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>209, 227, 638 A.2d 1301 (1994); <em>In re Estate of Gillmore, </em>101 <em>N.J.Super. </em>77, 86, 243 A.2d 263 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, 52 N.J. </em>175, 244 A.2d 304 (1968). It may be assumed that it concurred with the Appellate Division\u2019s and agency\u2019s interpretation that pre-credited need less appropriate credits and adjustments constituted the municipality\u2019s \u201cfair share.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Jackson\u2019s principal argument before us is that COAH\u2019s interpretation ignores the first sentence of \u00a7 307e which authorizes COAH, in its discretion, to place a limit \u201cupon the <em>aggregate </em>number of units which may be allocated to a municipality as its fair share____\u201d (Emphasis added). We understand this argument to mean that the word \u201caggregate\u201d is equivalent to pre-credited need.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">However, the word \u201caggregate\u201d was not added to the 1993 amendment; it was part of the FHA when originally enacted. <em>See L. </em>1985, c. 222, \u00a7 7(e). Moreover, by its very terms, \u00a7 307e permits COAH to place limits on the aggregate number of units which may be allocated to a municipality, but does not require COAH to do so. Further, Jackson\u2019s argument amounts to what is in essence a facial challenge to the validity of the rule, a challenge we should not address here, considering the manner by which the issue is before us. Indeed, the present record does not disclose how COAH\u2019s advisory opinion will operate in Jackson\u2019s case. We do not even know what Jackson\u2019s calculated need is.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">In addition, COAH or a court may always invoke COAH\u2019s waiver rule so as to avoid the prospect of a municipality having to dramatically alter its character if it is required to construct more than 1,000 units within a six-year period. COAH may grant waivers from a specific rule upon a showing that: (1) such a waiver fosters the production of low and moderate income housing; (2) the waiver fosters the intent of, if not the letter of, COAH\u2019s rules; or (3) the strict application of the rule would create an unnecessary hardship. <em>N.J.AC. </em>5:93-15.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">We reject Jackson\u2019s argument that COAH\u2019s interpretation regarding the 1,000 unit cap requires formal rulemaking under <em>Metromedia, Inc. v. Dir., Din. of Tax., </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>313, 478 A.2d 742 (1984). The methodology employed by COAH\u2019s expert, Dr. Robert W. Burchell, addressed two discrete issues: (1) how the 1,000 unit cap, which is for a six-year period, relates to the council\u2019s twelve-year cumulative methodology; and (2) whether the cap should be applied to pre-credited or calculated need. The first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>issue involves COAH\u2019s employment of a \u201ccumulative\u201d methodology in that it accounts for the actual housing activity that occurred during COAH\u2019s 1987-1993 fair-share cycle. COAH emphasizes the necessity of having the new methodology correct projections and assumptions made during that cycle in order to reflect the most current information available as to what housing activity occurred between 1987 and 1993, and the need to incorporate this information into the calculation of the 1993-99 cycle cumulative fair-share obligation. <em>See </em>Prior-Cycle Prospective Need (1987-1993), <em>N.J.AC. </em>5:93 App. A and <em>N.J.AC. </em>5:93-2.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The methodology employed by Dr. Burchell in addressing this first issue may indeed require rulemaking because of its novelty and complexity, and because it may apply to other municipalities. <em>Metromedia, Inc., supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 331-33, 478 A.2d 742. However, Jackson has not demonstrated clearly how this methodology impacts, if at all, on its declaratory judgment action pending in the Law Division. Further, because this matter reaches us on an interlocutory basis, we decline to decide whether the expert\u2019s complex methodology requires rulemaking in this case. We note that any interested party may petition COAH to adopt appropriate rules if it considers rulemaking necessary.. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B-4(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">We reject Jackson\u2019s argument that rulemaking is necessary to implement the second issue addressed by Dr. Burchell, adopted by COAH, that under \u00a7 307e, the calculated need, rather than the pre-eredited need, represents a municipality\u2019s \u201cfair-share.\u201d Agencies have wide discretion to act through rulemaking, adjudication, or informally, and ordinarily we defer to the procedures chosen by the agency to discharge its statutory duty. <em>In re Solid Waste Util. Customer List, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>508, 518-19, 524 A.2d 386 (1987). In our view, COAH\u2019s interpretation is \u201csimply a reaffirmation\u201d of requirements already set forth in existing regulations, and thus does not constitute \u201crulemaking.\u201d <em>Radiological Soc\u2019y of N.J. v. Dep\u2019t of Health, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>548, 559, 506 A.2d 755 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>444, 517 A.2d 434 (1986). COAH\u2019s inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>pretation may be inferable from the statute since the Legislature adopted the present 1,000 cap rule without rejecting <em>Calton Homes </em>\u2019 equating \u201cfair share\u201d with pre-credited need minus adjustments, reductions and credits, and COAH\u2019s own previous methodology employed in its <em>Parsipanny-Troy Hills </em>decision. Moreover, the interpretation is consistent with rules requiring that the housing element and fair-share plan should be tailored to meet calculated need, not pre-credited need. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>5:93-2.1(a). Consequently, its interpretation was at least inferentially expressed in its prior determinations. <em>Metromedia, Inc., supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 332, 478 A.2d 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
