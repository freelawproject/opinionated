According to his own testimony, defendant was dozing in an easy chair when he was awakened by the sound of a car exhaust in front of his house. The sound faded away. The same sound recurred and faded away a second time. On hearing the car a third time, defendant looked out the window. He saw a male leave a black car stopped in the street with its engine running. That person carried an object in his hand and crossed the street walking toward the homes of defendant and his neighbor. Defendant retrieved a handgun and returned to the window to see the intruder attempting to break the driver\u2019s side window of the neighbor\u2019s parked car. Defendant then went out the front door of his home onto the porch, yelled at the individual, and simultaneously fired a shot. Defendant contended that he aimed at a wall across the street because he only wanted to scare the person and chase him away, not hit him.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">After the shot was fired, the intruder ran across the street to the idling car, jumped in, closed the door, and drove backwards up the street. Defendant walked down one or two steps and fired another shot just as the vehicle began to back up. He claimed that he pointed his gun toward the neighbor\u2019s parked car, not at the moving car, and that he had no intent to injure anyone. He said he was unaware that the moving car had any occupants other than the driver. After the second shot was fired, the black ear continued to back up and disappeared from view.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">One of the shots penetrated the windshield of the black car. The front seat passenger was shot through the head. The driver testified that the second shot was fired several seconds following the first after he had been traveling in reverse for about five seconds. Defendant testified that the entire time he had been outside was no more than five seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>After moving a bag containing his collection of handguns and related equipment from a gun safe on the first floor of the house to his bedroom upstairs, defendant telephoned the police, falsely reporting that some children had been shooting off firecrackers and trying to break into his neighbor\u2019s car. He adhered to varying versions of that account in a series of conversations with police personnel until, confronted with the results of their investigation later that morning, he admitted he had fired the shots in a version similar to that which he recounted at trial. With a search warrant for defendant\u2019s home, the police, shortly thereafter, secured the handguns and a cache of other firearms, ammunition and related equipment, including the weapon which defendant had discharged earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The State produced no evidence that defendant had \u201cpurchased, acquired or received\u201d in New Jersey the handguns charged as predicates for the ten fourth-degree weapon permit counts. Defendant testified in a hearing outside the jury\u2019s presence that he had obtained the weapons in private purchases in Florida, and he produced evidence that he possessed a Florida Class \u201cW\u201d concealed weapon or firearm license. While acknowledging that one can lawfully acquire a handgun in another state and transport it to one\u2019s home in New Jersey without being required to obtain a New Jersey permit to purchase, acquire or receive a handgun, the trial judge denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the weapons-permit charges on the basis of the presumption contained in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-2b. The statute provides that when the legality of a person\u2019s conduct under chapter 39 depends on his possession of a permit, it shall be presumed that he does not possess such a permit until he establishes the contrary. The judge ruled that the State had produced evidence from which a jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant possessed the handguns named in the indictment and that he had not obtained a New Jersey permit to purchase, acquire or receive these handguns, thus rendering the statutory presumption applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The weapons-permit charges must be dismissed for a lack of any proof by the State of an essential element: that the handguns specified were purchased, acquired or received by defendant in this State. As defense counsel argued to the trial judge, as the judge acknowledged, and as the State concedes in its brief on appeal, New Jersey may not regulate the acquisition of handguns in other states. To the extent New Jersey law may forbid the importation of such weapons into the State or require that they be registered upon entry, <em>see e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5b; <em>State v. Hatch, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>179, 313 A.2d 797 (1973),<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the indictment did not charge any such violations, only that defendant \u201cdid knowingly receive, purchase or otherwise acquire [the specified handguns] without first securing a permit to purchase\u201d them.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">The statutory presumption applied by the court has no bearing in this matter. As we have noted, it provides that where defendant has not established he possesses a permit \u201cit shall be presumed that he does not possess\u201d one. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-2b. Yet, there was no question in this ease whether defendant possessed a New Jersey permit. He conceded he did not. The ultimate question before the jury, therefore, was whether defendant had received the ten handguns in New Jersey so as to be subject to the purchase permit requirement of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:58-3a. As explained in 33A <em>New Jersey Practice, Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 30.12, at 214 (Gerald D. Miller) (3d ed.2001), for the fourth degree crimes of violating the regulatory provisions relating to firearms, the State must prove that 1) \u201cthe instrument is the type of firearm ... which is being regulated\u201d; 2) \u201cthe defendant is subject to the regulation\u201d; 3) the \u201cdefendant\u2019s conduct violated [the] regulatory provision\u201d; and 4) the \u201cdefendant acted knowingly.\u201d Here, the State failed to present evidence from which the jury could have found that defendant\u2019s conduct violated the purchase permit re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>quirement. The State offered no proof that defendant had purchased, acquired or received the handguns in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\"> Although a \u201cjury may draw an inference from a fact whenever it is more probable than not that the inference is true,\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>587, 592, 404 A.2d 1111 (1979), the mere fact that defendant had a residence in New Jersey does not mean that he purchased or acquired the handguns in this State. \u201c[T]he State\u2019s right to the benefit of reasonable inferences should not be used to shift or lighten the burden of proof, or become a bootstrap to reduce the State\u2019s burden of establishing the essential elements of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>A presumption, whether created by statute or otherwise based, is no substitute for affirmative proofs. The function of a presumption is to allocate the burden of producing evidence, <em>see </em>9 <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>\u00a7 2491 at 304 (Chadbourn rev.1981), <em>cited in </em>Biunno, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>comment 1 on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>301 (2001); it should not be used as a surrogate for substantive evidence or as a substitute for satisfying the burden of proof assigned by law. <em>See State v. Ingenito </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>204, 215, 432 A.2d 912 (1981); Biunno, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>comment 1 on <em>N.J.R.E. </em>303 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Since the State failed to present evidence from which any jury could have found that the ten handguns were purchased, acquired or received by defendant in New Jersey, the trial judge erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion at the close of the State\u2019s case for a judgment of acquittal on counts five through fourteen. The judgment of conviction in those respects must be vacated and a judgment of acquittal entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Defendant also contends that the judge\u2019s decision to close the courtroom to spectators during jury selection, including members of defendant\u2019s family and the victim\u2019s family, violated his light to a public trial under the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and article I, 1110 of the New Jersey Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Immediately prior to jury selection, defense counsel and the prosecutor met with the judge in chambers. The conference was not recorded. When counsel and the judge returned to the courtroom, defense counsel stated on the record that he had requested in chambers that defendant\u2019s brother, an attorney, be allowed to sit at counsel table to assist since he had been helping defense counsel \u201call along\u201d with regard to defendant\u2019s case. Defense counsel further stated that when the prosecutor objected to this, the judge ruled that \u201cit would be better if everyone just left\u201d. The prosecutor then stated on the record that he had objected to defense counsel\u2019s request because he had never heard of a member of a defendant\u2019s family being allowed to sit in the well of the courtroom. The judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-5\">We have someone who happens to be an attorney. I\u2019m well aware of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">I have to have the courtroom cleared when the jurors are here. I cannot have family members or victims\u2019 families mingling with the jurors, nor any spectator at all mingling with the jurors. First of all, I don\u2019t want that. I don\u2019t know what they will be talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">Second of all, there\u2019s no room for them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-10\">It\u2019s a procedure we have to follow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-11\">When I fill this [courtroom] with jurors, there is simply not enough seats. If this was a very large courtroom, I could maybe put every one aside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-12\">My concern here is: [defendant\u2019s] brother, he\u2019s an attorney, he wants to be here. [The prosecutor] is objecting!,][and] says to me, well, can I have the victims\u2019 family members. We have the defendant\u2019s family members to ascertain [sic] \u2014 I think it\u2019s fair if I simply exclude everyone. I\u2019m being fail- to both sides in doing that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">Jury <em>voir dire </em>then began and continued into the following day. After a panel of sixteen jurors was selected, defense counsel moved for a mistrial, asserting that he had \u201cvigorously objected\u201d the previous day to four or five members of defendant\u2019s family, as well as defendant\u2019s brother, being removed from the courtroom and from the floor on which the courtroom was situated. Although the judge did not explicitly rule on the motion, he once again explained his reasons for having closed the courtroom during jury selection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>[T]here were many jurors here, you know, going in and out and it\u2019s one of the problems when you fill a courtroom, I think we had 80 here. I think I sat like 70, 75. We had it filled. I wanted to get as many people as I can from this first selection as opposed to going through another panel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">As I said .. yesterday I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for family members .. to be intermingled with the jury especially at this stage. I don\u2019t think they were deprived of anything. Then there were some problems, so to speak, about being down the hall, intermingling with jurors in the elevator. My ruling was simply having them stay off the floor until we get our jury In place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">We have our jury now and if you wish, .. you can ... have [defendant\u2019s family I come up now, if you wish to see [the jurors] sworn in and my opening remarks, because my concern ... was .. the intermingling of the jurors ... with possibly the victim\u2019s family, the defendant\u2019s family. I know both ... have been here. I think 20 or so[,] maybe ten, maybe five but there were a number of people and every occasion, every status conference there\u2019s always been people here from both sides, so it is my feeling it would be best at this stage to have them separated, but now we have .. our jurors].] [IIf you wish, tell [the family members] to come up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">When defense counsel pointed out that there had been no problems between defendant\u2019s family and the victim\u2019s family, and that both sides had been respectful towards each other, the judge stated that he was \u201cnot making accusations\u201d but explained that he wanted \u201cto keep the peace\u201d and \u201creally that\u2019s the reason [for] ... what I did yesterday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">The following morning, before opening statements and out of the presence of the jury, the trial judge heard defense counsel\u2019s description of potential conduct problems arising from the interrelationship between some members of both defendant\u2019s and the victim\u2019s families. The judge acknowledged that the families were \u201cvery emotional\u201d and he requested the attorneys to speak with the families and ask that they sit on opposite sides of the courtroom. The judge further commented that it was a \u201cpublic trial\u201d and the families had the right to be in attendance as they had been for all of the pretrial proceedings. The judge then addressed the families, also outside of the jury\u2019s presence, acknowledging their presence, their interest and their emotional involvement, and urging them to be on their \u201cbest behavior\u201d. He ended these comments saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>I think it would be wise to have one sit on one side of the courtroom, the other side sit on the other side____[I]t can\u2019t continue during the trial and if it does I\u2019ll have to deal with it on another level. I do not want to have to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">I want everyone here to be able to see this ease in its entirety. I know both sides have been here for every proceeding. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a deep interest to see the case, so again please just try to be on your best behavior, okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and article 1, 1110 of the New Jersey Constitution afford a criminal defendant the right to a public trial. <em>Waller v. Georgia, </em>467 <em>U.S. </em>39, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31 (1984); <em>State v. Williams, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>39, 60, 459 A.2d 641 (1983). This guarantee, which is also a right belonging to the public secured by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and article 1, 116 of the New Jersey Constitution, applies to all phases of the trial including jury selection. <em>Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of California, </em>464 <em>U.S. </em>501, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>819, 78 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 629 (1984); <em>Williams, supra, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 51-62, 459 A.2d 641. <em>See also United States ex rel. Bennett v. Rundle, </em>419 <em>F.2d </em>599, 605 (3d Cir.1969); <em>United States v. Sorrentino, </em>175 <em>F.2d </em>721, 722 (3d Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>338 <em>U.S. </em>868, 70 <em>S.Ct. </em>143, 94 <em>L. Ed. </em>532 (1949); <em>State v. Sugar, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>214, 243-45, 495 A.2d 90 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">As with most constitutional guarantees, the right to a public trial is not absolute. In <em>Waller, </em>the United States Supreme Court considered the extent of an accused\u2019s right under the Sixth Amendment to insist upon a public trial. The Court held that any closure over the objections of the accused must meet the following test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-10\">[T]he party seeking to close the hearing must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced, the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest, the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, and it must make findings adequate to support the closure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-11\">[467 <em>U.S. </em>at 48,104 <em>S.Ct </em>at 2216, 81 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 39.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">In so holding, the Court adopted the test set out in <em>Press-Enterprise, </em>framed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-13\">The presumption of openness may be overcome only by an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. The interest is to be articulated along with findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>specific enough that a reviewing court can determine whether the closure order was properly entered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">1464 <em>U.S. </em>at 510, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 824, 78 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 638.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">In adopting the <em>Press-Enterprise </em>test, the Court in <em>Waller, supra, </em>467 <em>U.S. </em>at <em>46-48, 104 S.Ct. </em>at 2215-16, 81 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at 38-39, confirmed the constitutional equivalence of the right of the accused to a public trial, as explicitly conferred by the Sixth Amendment, and the right of the press and public to a public trial, as implicitly guaranteed by the First Amendment. In <em>Sugar, supra, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 243-44, 495 A.2d 90, the New Jersey Supreme Court employed the multi-pronged test set out in <em>Waller </em>in determining whether the trial judge\u2019s decision to conduct taint and suppression hearings <em>in camera </em>violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional guarantee to a public trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">A defendant is not required to prove specific prejudice in order to obtain relief for a violation of his or her Sixth Amendment public trial guarantee. <em>Waller, supra, </em>467 <em>U.S. </em>at 49-50,104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2217, 81 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at 40; <em>Bundle, supra, </em>419 <em>F.2d </em>at 608. The denial of a public trial to a criminal defendant is a \u201cstructural\u201d error and thus subject to automatic reversal since it affects the \u201cframework within which the trial proceeds.\u201d <em>Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, </em>8, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>1827, 1833, 144 L.Ed.2d 35, 46 (1999); <em>Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 <em>U.S. </em>279, 310, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>1246, 1265,113 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>802, 331 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">Exclusion of a defendant\u2019s family or other members of the public from the courtroom during the jury selection process has been held to be violative of the public trial guarantee, requiring a new trial. In <em>People v. Willis, </em>274 <em>Ill.App.2d </em>551, 211 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>109, 654 <em>N.E.2d </em>571 (1995), the trial judge excluded members of defendant\u2019s family from the courtroom prior to the commencement of jury <em>voir dire. </em>The judge stated that his sole reason was to avoid the chance of contamination since a large number of potential jurors would have to be seated in the public viewing area. The judge specifically noted he had not determined that defendant\u2019s family would in fact contaminate the jurors. <em>Id. </em>at 573.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>On appeal, the trial judge\u2019s action was held to have violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial. Although the goal of preventing contamination of potential jurors facially satisfied the \u201coverriding interest\u201d requirement of <em>Waller, </em>the record failed to show that jury selection was \u201clikely to be prejudiced\u201d by the presence of defendant\u2019s family in the courtroom. <em>Willis, supra, </em>211 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>109, 654 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 573. The trial judge had failed to make a finding adequate to support the exclusion and had omitted to evaluate several reasonable alternatives that were available. <em>Id. </em>at 574. For example, the Appellate Court of Illinois opined, \u201cdefendant\u2019s family could have been separated from the potential jurors by being seated on the other side of the courtroom or on one of the benches not occupied by potential jurors\u201d; the judge could have \u201cadmonished prospective jurors and spectators to refrain from contact with each other\u201d; or \u201ca bailiff could have been stationed next to the prospective jurors to deter contact.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Sinee a defendant need not prove specific prejudice to obtain relief for a violation of his or her right to a public trial, the court reversed defendant\u2019s murder conviction and remanded for a new trial. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In <em>People v. Taylor, </em>244 <em>Ill.App.M </em>460, 183 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>891, 612 <em>N.EM </em>543, <em>appeal denied, </em>152 <em>Ill.2d </em>577, 190 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>907, 622 <em>N.E.M </em>1224 (1993), the trial judge, over defense counsel\u2019s objection, excluded defendant\u2019s siblings from the courtroom during the jury selection process. The judge\u2019s stated reason for the exclusion was to avoid the possibility that the jurors might overhear comments made by the siblings and be influenced thereby. <em>Id. </em>at 544-45. Exclusion of family members during jury <em>voir dire </em>was a policy followed by the judge in every trial. <em>Id. </em>at 545, 549. However, neither the press nor all members of the general public were excluded. <em>Id. </em>at 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The defendant\u2019s aggravated sexual assault conviction was reversed and remanded for a new trial. The Appellate Court of Illinois held that defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial had been violated by the exclusion of his siblings. <em>Id. </em>at 544, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>549. Although the partial closure of jury <em>voir dire </em>to prevent contamination of potential jurors facially satisfied the \u201coverriding interest\u201d requirement of <em>Waller, </em>the record failed to reveal any circumstance that might meet the \u201clikely to be prejudiced\u201d requirement. There was nothing in the record to suggest a reasonable likelihood that defendant\u2019s siblings would have attempted to influence the jurors. 183 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>891, 612 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 548-49. A reversal was necessary since defendant was not required to prove specific prejudice, and it was impossible to separate the jury selection process from the rest of the trial. <em>Id. </em>at 549.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">In <em>Watters v. State, </em>328 <em>Md. </em>38, 612 A.2d 1288 (1992), <em>cert, denied, </em>507 <em>U.S. </em>1024, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>1832, 123 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 460 (1993), a deputy sheriff, without the knowledge or consent of the trial judge or the parties, excluded the public, including members of defendant\u2019s family and possibly the press, from the courtroom during jury selection. <em>Id. </em>at 1289-90. After the defendant learned of the courtroom closure, he moved for a mistrial, claiming a deprivation of his Sixth Amendment right to a public trial. <em>Id. </em>at 1290. In a hearing on the motion, the deputy sheriff stated that his reason for closing the courtroom was because of space limitations although he admitted that some seats were available. The judge denied the motion, finding that the closure was a matter of court security because of the crowded condition of the courtroom. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">The Maryland Court of Appeals, reversing the murder conviction and remanding the matter for a new trial, held that the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial was violated by the closure. There was no compelling need for it since seats were available in the courtroom. Moreover, even if the State had a legitimate interest in preventing overcrowding, it could not show the exclusion of all members of the public was a sufficiently narrowly tailored means of protecting that interest. <em>Id. </em>at 1291, 1293-94. The court was of the view that not every technical violation of the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial requires a new trial, but it found the scope of the closure to have been substantial since the only persons allowed in the courtroom during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>the jury selection process, which consumed an entire morning, were court personnel, witnesses and the venirepersons. Thus, the court held the violation could not be considered <em>de minimis. Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In <em>People v. Bici, </em>211 <em>A.D.2d </em>804, 621 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>666, <em>appeal denied, </em>85 N.Y.2d 969, 629 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>729, 653 <em>N.E.2A </em>625 (1995), the trial judge, <em>sua sponte, </em>announced his determination, over objection, to exclude the public from a portion of the jury <em>voir dire. </em>There had been no specific requests by potential jurors based on their privacy concerns; nor had there been a proper inquiry into the need for the closure, and a balancing of those reasons against the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial. <em>Id. </em>at 667. In reversing the second degree murder conviction and remanding the matter for a new trial, the New York Appellate Division held that the procedure employed, including the judge\u2019s failure to fully articulate on the record the reasons for his decision, was reversible error. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">In <em>Commonwealth v. Johnson, </em>309 <em>Pa.Super. </em>367, 455 <em>A.2d </em>654 (1982), the trial judge, over -the defendant\u2019s objection, excluded the public from the courtroom during jury selection. The judge\u2019s reasons for doing so were that the courtroom would be overcrowded and the jurors might be intimidated. <em>Id. </em>at 655, 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The appellate court, in reversing defendant\u2019s conviction for second degree murder and remanding the matter for a new trial, held that the trial judge\u2019s action violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial. <em>Id. </em>at 655. There was no need for the closure of the courtroom since there were fifty empty seats. The court observed that the mere \u201cfact that a courtroom cannot accommodate everyone is no reason for accommodating no one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 662. Moreover, the record disclosed no reason to suppose that permitting the public to be present would have resulted in any intimidation. <em>Id. </em>at 663. On the contrary, the court felt that public scrutiny would encourage those who participate in jury selection \u201cto enhance the quality of the process and safeguard its integrity.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>We are satisfied, as well, that in the instant matter the trial judge\u2019s exclusion of all spectators, including defendant\u2019s family and the victim\u2019s family, from the courtroom during the jury selection process violated defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial. In the face of that error, a reversal is required without a showing by defendant of specific prejudice. The trial judge\u2019s stated reasons for clearing the courtroom were that he wished to avoid spectators mingling with the potential jurors because he did not know what type of conversations might occur and there was no room for spectators in the courtroom. On the following day, after jury selection was completed, the judge stated another reason for his closure of the courtroom during jury <em>voir dire, </em>that he wished \u201cto keep the peace\u201d between defendant\u2019s family and the victim\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Jurors should not be in such close contact with those observing a trial that the remarks of bystanders as to the guilt or innocence of the accused may reach their ears. <em>State v. Unger, </em>103 <em>N.J.L. </em>18, 21, 134 A 886 (Sup.Ct.1926), <em>affd o.b., </em>104 <em>N.J.L. </em>448, 140 A. 922 (E. &amp; A.1928). A trial judge has the duty to preserve the jury\u2019s impartiality throughout the trial process by acting swiftly and decisively to overcome the potential bias of a jury that might develop from outside influences. <em>Williams, supra, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>at 62-63, 459 A.2d 641. Therefore, a trial judge\u2019s effort to prevent contamination of potential jurors tends to satisfy the \u201coverriding interest\u201d requirement of the <em>Waller </em>test, if it is premised upon a specific finding of need that has a basis in actual fact. The record in this matter does not disclose that the jury selection process was \u201clikely to be prejudiced\u201d by the presence of the families and other spectators in the courtroom, or that that eventuality could not have been avoided by other measures which did not violate constitutional guarantees or which impinged upon them to a lesser extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">At the time the judge ordered the exclusion, there was nothing in the record to suggest a likelihood that the families or other spectators were likely to make improper remarks within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>hearing of the jurors. Moreover, it seems that reasonable alternatives to closure were available. For example, the judge could have instructed the families and other spectators not to mingle with the potential jurors or say anything concerning the case that might be overheard by them. If the problem was primarily one of sufficient seating, additional chairs could have been brought into the courtroom so that at least some members of defendant\u2019s family and the victim\u2019s family could observe the jury selection process. The judge\u2019s concern regarding the families or other spectators mingling with the prospective jurors could also have been addressed by an order requiring observers to be segregated from prospective jurors, such as by keeping some of the prospective jurors in other parts of the courthouse until they were needed in the courtroom. The judge might even have arranged for temporary use of a larger courtroom for jury selection, and then moved the balance of the trial back to his own courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">With regard to the public\u2019s right of access, a trial judge is not restricted from imposing reasonable and, as circumstances may dictate, well-considered limitations on access to a trial in order to prevent situations which might impede the progress or fairness of the trial, as long as basic rights involved are not unduly infringed. <em>Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, </em>448 <em>U.S. </em>555, 581 n. 18, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2814, 2830 n. 18, 65 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>973, 992 n. 18 (1980); <em>see also, e.g., Unger, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J.L. </em>at 21, 134 <em>A. </em>886. Nevertheless, closure of the courtroom can only be effected as a last resort.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">In <em>In re Closure of Jury Voir Dire, </em>204 <em>Mich.App. </em>592, 516 <em>N.W.M </em>514 (1994), the trial judge barred the public and the press from attending jury <em>voir dire </em>in a criminal case because of a lack of space. The courtroom sat 131 people and twenty extra chairs were brought in to accommodate the 150 potential jurors. The judge did not want reporters who were taking notes mingling with the pool of jurors. <em>Id. </em>at 515-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The Michigan Court of Appeals determined the exclusion to have been unconstitutional, observing that, although the size of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>courtroom may justifiably limit attendance, a judge must still narrowly tailor the closure order. <em>Id. </em>at 516. The judge failed to do this when he closed the proceeding to all members of the press, rather than finding space for even one journalist. <em>Ibid. </em>Moreover, the trial judge did not consider the alternatives of issuing an order requiring the reporters to be segregated from the prospective jurors, warning both prospective jurors and journalists not to discuss the case, or keeping some of the prospective jurors in other parts of the courthouse until they were needed in the courtroom. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Here too, the judge not only failed to give due regard to the imperatives of the public trial requirement by considering alternatives to closing the jury selection process, he also omitted to establish the unavoidable need for the step he took and did not narrowly tailor the closure order. The judge\u2019s perceived need to exclude the families from the courtroom in order \u201cto keep the peace\u201d was not adequately supported in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">A judge must always maintain decorum in the courtroom during trial. <em>In re Application of Nat\u2019l Broad. Co., Inc., </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>476, 478, 317 A.2d 695 (1974). As a general rule, neither the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial nor the public\u2019s right of access precludes a limited exclusion of spectators where necessary to avoid disorder. <em>United States v. Akers, </em>542 <em>F.2d </em>770, 772 (9th Cir.1976), <em>cert, denied sub nom. Wallace v. United States, </em>430 <em>U.S. </em>908, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>1181, 51 <em>L. Ed.2d 585 </em>(1977); <em>United States ex rel. Orlando v. Fay, </em>350 <em>F.2d </em>967, 971 (2d Cir.1965), <em>cert, denied sub nom. Orlando v. Follette, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>1008, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1961, 16 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>1021 (1966); <em>State v. Genese, </em>102 <em>N.J.L. </em>134, 141-42, 130 A 642 (E. &amp; A.1925). Here, however, there was no overriding interest that was likely to be prejudiced since defendant\u2019s family and the victim\u2019s family had been present in the courtroom for all of the pretrial proceedings and had, until the moment of exclusion, always been decorous during the course of the proceedings. The first disruption in the courtroom occurred the day after jury selection had been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>We reject the State\u2019s argument that the closure as effected was too trivial to amount to a violation of defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial. In <em>Peterson v. Williams, </em>85 <em>F.3d </em>39 (2d Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>519 <em>U.S. </em>878, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>202, 136 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 138 (1996), the courtroom was inadvertently closed for a period no longer than fifteen or twenty minutes during defendant\u2019s brief testimony in his criminal trial. <em>Id. </em>at 41, 44. Before summation, defense counsel moved for a mistrial, stating that she had just noticed when she stood up to start her summation that the courtroom was being unsealed. <em>Id. </em>at 41. After the judge denied the motion, defense counsel repeated most of defendant\u2019s relevant testimony as part of her summation. <em>Id. </em>at 42-43. In holding that a reversal was not warranted because the unjustified closure was too trivial to amount to a violation of the Sixth Amendment, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals emphasized that the closure was extremely short, it was followed by an informative summation, and it was entirely inadvertent. <em>Id. </em>at 42, 44. <em>See also Ayala v. Speckard, </em>131 F.3d 62 (2d Cir.1997), <em>cert, denied, </em>524 <em>U.S. </em>958,118 <em>S.Ct. </em>2380, 141 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 747 (1998) (regarding limited closure).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Here, the closure lasted a full day and continued over into the next morning until jury selection was concluded. It occurred during a critical phase of the trial; it was not inadvertent; and no action by counsel or the court could restore the deprivation. We are constrained to conclude, as the court did in <em>Watters, supra, </em>612 <em>A.2d </em>at 1293, that the scope of the closure was substantial, rather than <em>de minimis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Although raised only in the context of the trial court\u2019s exclusion of defendant\u2019s family, and not as an independent issue, we regard the exclusion of defendant\u2019s brother, an attorney-at-law who was assisting in the defense, as a likely violation of defendant\u2019s right to counsel, also guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, \u00b6 10 of the New Jersey Constitution. Without reaching a conclusion on that basis because the issue has not been squarely presented, we reverse the convictions on counts one through four of the indictment for violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial, <em>i.e., </em>the presence of the public, including family, during a significant on-the-record phase of the criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">In view of the jury\u2019s verdict acquitting defendant of purposeful and knowing murder, the retrial on count one must be for the lesser-included aggravated manslaughter crime for which defendant was convicted, as well as for the crimes charged in counts two, three, and four, in respect of which a guilty verdict was returned. For reasons we have articulated, the ten counts charging receipt, purchase or acquisition of a handgun without a permit must all be dismissed. Because the context of the retrial will be different from the original trial by reason of the modified charges for jury consideration, it is, with a single exception, unnecessary for us to consider the remaining issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The exception bears upon the trial court\u2019s ruling on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized during the search of his home. We are in substantial agreement with the trial judge\u2019s stated reasons for denying that motion, and we affirm the ruling. Whether or not some or all of the evidence seized qualifies for admission in the retrial is a new question to be determined in the context of the changed dynamic that will exist by reason of the modified charges to be tried. Similarly, questions concerning the admissibility of \u201cother conduct\u201d evidence must be dealt with anew. With the guidance provided by reflection upon the experience of the first trial, issues arising from the conduct of counsel, to the extent any such conduct may reasonably be seen as a source of error, should not recur.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">The trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is affirmed. The convictions on counts one through four of the indictment are reversed and remanded for a new trial, <em>i.e., </em>on lesser-included aggravated manslaughter in count one and the crimes charged in counts two, three, and four. The convictions on counts five through fourteen are reversed and the charges are dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-6\"> Even the power to require licensure upon entry into the State is subject to exceptions. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-6e; <em>Hatch, supra, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>at 187, 313 A.2d 797.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
