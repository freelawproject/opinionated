He-also refuses to apply said $1000 upon the contract for said: lake front.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">And the bill prays that the amount of the payments- \u201c made on said mortgage may be ascertained and the balance unpaid thereon be fixed by the court,\u201d and \u201cthat said Fletcher may be required to execute and deliver to youiorator or to Kobert G-. Churchill, to whom your orator has - agreed to convey the same, a good and sufficient deed of conveyance of the said lake front,\u201d and that complainant may have other and further relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">An answer was filed to this bill, and the case has been heard on pleadings and proofs. The decree made combines-this case'with several others, and need not be further mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">That the bill made no case for any relief whatever is very-apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Complainant does not pretend that his intestate wasassignee of the contract of September 13, 1876, and his bill is not filed upon any such assumption. What he claims is-that he became purchaser of the equity of redemption in the - land covered by the Fletcher mortgage, and also of such-rights as the lumber company acquired by the contract, in the lake front, and in consequence was entitled to have-applied on the mortgage and on the purchase of the lake \u2022 front the value of the' logs and lumber which Fletcher, by the contract, agreed should be applied. In effect, complain-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>ant contends that his intestate acquired by conveyances from the assignees of the lumber company certain interests in particular stipulations contained in the contract of September 13, 1876, and he prays that these, separated and dealt with separately from the rest of the contract, be specifically performed in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">To justify any such relief it would be essential that the stipulations in question should clearly and distinctly appear by the contract to stand by themselves, independent of and wholly unaffected by any others ; for if the contract is an entirety it would not be pretended that one party could select out particular provisions for enforcement while ignor- \u25a0 ing the remainder, or that he could assign to a third party the right to such partial enforcement. The party insisting upon parts of an entire contract must abide by it in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">That the particular stipulations which complainant seeks to enforce are not independent is manifest on a reading of the contract. It is on its face a compromise contract; and what is to be done by one party is the consideration for that which is to be done by the other. The bill itself concedes this as to the harbor dues, but the concession was not needed when the contract was so plain. In particular the stipulation for the application of the value of the lumber and logs was plainly in consideration of the proposed partition; and if the one should fall through the other would go with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">No specific performance could be had of any portion of such an agreement without bringing all 'the parties in interest before the court, so as to give opportunity for disposing of the whole controversy. That has not been done in this case It follows that the bill should have been dismissed. It will now be dismissed with costs of both courts, but without prejudice.</p>\n<judges id=\"b625-7\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b622-6\"> Memorandum, of agreement made this thirteenth day of September, 1876, by and between George N.
