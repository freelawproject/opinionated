The circuit court decided that the defence was not available. This was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\">The cases of <em>Gibbs v. Linabury </em>22 Mich. 479 and <em>Anderson v. Walter </em>34 Mich. 113, which are supposed to countenance the defence, are different from this. The defence in each of those cases was that the party had never executed as a promissory note the instrument in that form which was-sued upon; and if the fact was established, the paper was no more his than- if his signature had been forged by another. In this case the making of the note was not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">The judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b209-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
