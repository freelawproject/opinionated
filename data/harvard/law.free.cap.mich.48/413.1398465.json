His claim for the former work is based on the ground that he did more than was necessary to work the mine on his-contract during the year 1873, in reliance on further similar work in the succeeding years, of which he was deprived by countermand at the close of that year. He insisted on the trial that it was agreed he should be paid for the work which became unnecessary for his own mining operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">It appears that there was a written contract, confined to-one year, for getting out ore and work connected therewith, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>from October 1, 1872, to November, 1873, and that tbe stripping was done during this time. Gingrass undertook to show \u2014 and was so permitted \u2014 that he misunderstood this contract, which he was induced to believe was to run longer, and that he would not have done it unless he had so supposed. The superintendent\u2019s work he claims to have done under employment of one of the company\u2019s agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">All of the stripping work, which was the chief ground of \u00a1recovery, was done long enough ago to have been barred by the Statute of Limitations, which was not pleaded for the \u00a1reason suggested by counsel that it was supposed the issues were the same in fact in this direction as in a ease formerly before us which was discontinued. And it was claimed on the trial that Gingrass had estopped himself, by a presentation and settlement of accounts in 1875, from now setting up any such claim as the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">We think this ground well taken. In 1874 he presented a claim of $4240, which included among other things several charges for removal of dirt, and labor and outlays of \u25a0various kinds, which was reduced by agreement to $3000, which was credited on account. In the latter part of 1875 a full account of nearly $40,000 was settled between the parties, leaving a balance due Gingrass of $367.57, against which there was a claim of rent as an offset, but no dispute as to the items of the account itself. It appeared from the \u2022\u25a0testimony of Gingrass himself that he had quit his business with the company long before this, and that complaint was made to him not only that he had made charges that were not expected, but also that he had waited longer than he .should in presenting it. It further appeared from his own testimony that he did not present the principal claims now in suit at all, and never informed the company that he -claimed them before the trial of the suit formerly brought in 1877, and, as we understand him finally to admit, he never \u2022did so until this suit was bi\u2019ought in February, 1880.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">It appears then from his own testimony that when he was called upon by all the usages of business to make a full \u2022showing of his claims against his employers, for the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>poses of a complete settlement, he made no such claim as is now set up. It appears further that this was not caused by any understanding with the company that the comparison of accounts should embrace less than all his demands, and that he kept this back \u2014 if he had really any such claim in his mind \u2014 purposely. Ilis attention had also been called \u2014 \u25a0 as he says himself \u2014 to the objection of the company to the delay already had, and its surprise at the extent of his demands. Under such circumstances we think he had no right to keep back anything whatever, and that the arrangement and comparison then had must be regarded as a final statement of his claims which it would be a fraud to disturb.

Bushey </em>45 Mich. 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">We have not found any admissible ground on any legal theory on which the judgment below could be allowed to stand, but we do not consider it necessary to discuss the other questions presented, because the views already given render it needless.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Judgment must be reversed with costs and a new trial granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b431-6\">Cooley and Marston, JJ. concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
