J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVC\">This is a case made after judgment. The parties agreed on a state of facts which the court embodied in a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The question involved is whether the appellant is entitled to share in a particular fund or is cut off by advaucement. His. father Isaac Turner died on the 6th of March, 1879, leaving eight children including appellant. He left a will a copy of which is given below.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Whether his wife sur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>vived him and if she did whether she is still living is not stated in the record; and there is nothing express touching the probate of the will. The litigants and the court below have virtually assumed that the facts in regard to these matters are such that the issue on the question discussed is left by them in the very shape in which the discussion regards it.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">About two yeai\u2019s before the date of the will the testator and his wife conveyed to appellant a lot in Grand Kapids and the deed set out the consideration as $300 cash \u201c and the relinquishment of all right or title to any of the estate of Isaac Turner as heir or otherwise.\u201d This property was-worth $1700 in excess of the cash consideration of $300, and the appellant immediately sold his interest for $2000 in money. The share which would result to each of the other children of the fund in controversy, \u2014 $5000,\u2014in case of appellant\u2019s exclusion would not exceed about $1400. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>court below concurred with the court of probate in holding against the right of appellant to participate.in the fund, and he excepted to the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">The parties in making up the case have expressed their assent to the proposition that an intestacy existed in regard to the fund in question, and the court seems to have assumed this to be so, and therefore that the specific property was open to the doctrine of advancement, which the deed was deemed sufficient to call up. Whether the fund referred to is intestate is a question of construction and not a matter of fact, and the court must act on its own views' of the law. The admissions of the parties are not entitled to control.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">There can be no doubt that the grant made to appellant must have operated as an advancement in case the grantor had so elected. But he was not bound to leave it to have that effect. He could not recall what he had given, but his power over his remaining property was plenary and he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>bestow it according to his own views of propriety and without regard to the notions which others might entertain. It was in his power to waive or disregard his original purpose and to select the appellant as the object of further bounty, and we think he did this by the will before us. We find on the face of the will very satisfactory evidence that he did not intend to die intestate as to any part of his property, and we also find what we consider a distinct disposal of the fund of $5000 to a class of which the appellant is a member. In the foreground of the will and by way of preamble to the intended dispositions we find him declaring his desire to dispose of his property, money and effects according to his own will and judgment and we see him following this declaration by gifts which to all appearance covered his whole fortune. No exception is expressed or implied. His object was not to merely dispose of some share or portion; but of his <em>\u201cproperty, money cmd effects\u201d </em>\u2014 that is to say, whatever he possessed, and there is no ground of inference that this object was departed from. He was chiefly solicitous about his wife and his son Isaac, and he set apart $7000 as a source-of income for their benefit during the minority of Isaac, but provided that $2000 should be withdrawn and given to Isaac on his coming of age and that his wife should have the use of the remaining $5000 during her life. In the-event of her death during Isaac\u2019s minority another course was provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">But the testator took care to manifest his will in regard to the final disposition of the $5000. He ordered that on his wife\u2019s death it should revert to his estate, or in other words be subject to- his further disposition, and such further disposition is disclosed near the end of the will. He there states it to be his will that his gifts to Isaac shall be received in lieu of all claims except to the amount of his share in the $5000, and that he is to have said interest, or in other words his share in the $5000, with <em>the rest </em>of the testator\u2019s heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">This provision is fairly open to only one construction. It. is a gift of the $5000 to the persons answering the descrip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>tion of heirs. <em>Smith v. Butcher </em>10 Ch. Div. 113: 26 Eng. 558. The bequest is to the whole class and the appellant is included. Such is the proper sense of the language and framework adopted by the testator, and the court has no right to depart from it in the pursuit of some theory supposed to be more equitable in its consequences. The result is that the appellant is entitled as legatee under the will to an equal one-eighth of the fund of $5000.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">The orders made by the courts below must therefore be reversed and one entered here in conformity with this opinion, and the costs will be paid out of the fund and the clerk will certify the determination to the said courts respectively.</p>\n<judges id=\"b391-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b387-7\"> I, Isaac Turner, of the city of Grand.
