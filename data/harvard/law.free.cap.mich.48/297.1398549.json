Defendants filed a claim for recoupment of damages on the ground that soon after the work was done the boiler leaked as badly as ever. The case was tried by the court without a jury, and the judge gave judgment for plaintiffs on a finding that the work was done in a workmanlike manner and the labor and materials furnished were firstjclass, though he also found that within a few days after the repairs were completed the boiler began to leak and in two or three months leaked nearly as badly as before. Defendants bring error.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AQN\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b313-9\"><em>A.
