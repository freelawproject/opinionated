Pl. 504, 506; a discharge granted with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>out jurisdiction to grant it is inoperative: Bump\u2019s Bankruptcy (6th ed.) \u00a7 526, \u00a7 34, n.; a fact which goes to defeat the jurisdiction of the bankrupt court may bo shown by plea and proof in any court by any one not estopped : id., .and see <em>Batchelder v.

Angell </em>6 Mich. 515; a discharge in bankruptcy duly granted shall release the bankrupt from all debts, claims, liabilities and demands, which were or might have been proved against his estate in bankruptcy: U. S. Rev. Stat. (2d ed. 1878) \u00a7 5119 ; proceedings in bankruptcy oannot be impeached in a collateral proceeding, as they are in the nature of a proceeding <em>in rem </em>before a court of record having jurisdiction: <em>Shawhan v. Wherritt </em>7 How. 627; <em>Lathrop v. Stuart </em>5 McL. 167; <em>McMaster v. Campbell </em>41 Mich. 516:</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b610-5\">Cooley, J\".</author>\n<p id=\"AhkT\">This suit is upon a note given by defendant Smith to Fletcher Benedict and by him endorsed to the plaintiff. The plea of Smith is the general issue, with special plea of discharge in bankruptcy. Special pleas are not allowed in this State: Comp. L. \u00a7 5794; but where one \u25a0is put in it is customary to allow it to stand as a notice of \u25a0defence ; and there can be no valid objection to that course. \u25a0Special pleas were abolished to avoid technicality and prolixity, but notices containing the substance of special pleas are required where such pleas were formerly essential, and if the one is put in where the other should have been, the difference, being in matter of form only, may be disregarded, and the general purpose the statute had in view will be advanced by that course.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">In support of the special plea or notice Smith introduced the records of the bankruptcy court, and they showed a full discharge granted October 22,1879. But it appeared from the files that the name of Fletcher Benedict did not appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>as a creditor anywhere in the proceedings, although he then held this note; and he was not shown to have been served with any notice as was required by the bankrupt law. On this showing the plaintiff claimed that the discharge in bankruptcy was void as to Fletcher Benedict for the reason that the bankruptcy court never'obtained jurisdiction of his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">If bankruptcy proceedings were strictly proceedings <em>in personam </em>this view would be unanswerable; but this is not the case. Jurisdiction over the estate empowers the court .to make decree, and the decree is conclusive upon claims unless attacked for fraud in the bankrupt court itself. R. S. of U. S. (1878), \u00a7 5120. It cannot be attacked collaterally in other courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b611-6\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
