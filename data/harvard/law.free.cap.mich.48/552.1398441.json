The charter of Muskegon provides that <em>\u201c </em>the common council shall be judges of the election, and the qualification of its own members, and shall have the power to determine contested elections.\u201d Section 33. And the mayor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>and other respondents, at a special meeting of which notice was not given to relator, declared the latter\u2019s seat vacant' on the ground that he had removed from the ward which he represented.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"AvWC\">Motion submitted June 20.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AU3\">Denied June 21.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b569-4\"><em>James I\u00a3 Campbell </em>for relator.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AffC\">A certificate of election confers a <em>prima facie </em>right to the office until voluntarily surrendered or divested by judicial action: <em>People v. Miller </em>16 Mich. 56; <em>People v. Cicott </em>id. 283; <em>Keeler v. Robertson </em>27 Mich. 116; <em>People v. Board of Education </em>38 Mich, 95; <em>Jhons v.

(Mich.) 411; the validity of his election must generally be tried on an information in the nature of a <em>guo warranto: </em>Dillon Mun. Corp. \u00a7 843; High Ext. Leg. Rem. 49, 57, 77.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b569-6\"><em>Kelson </em>Delong, in person, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b569-7\">Graves, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AF5T\">The petitioner was regularly admitted to the office, and was an alderman <em>defacto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">The respondents ejected him and now offer to justify it: 1st, on the ground that he lacked legal capacity to take the office; and 2d, on the ground that he subsequently disqualified himself by removing from the ward.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">The legislative authority to try relator\u2019s capacity to receive the office expired with the council that acknowledged his capacity and received him, and whatever as matter of fact\u2019 and law may be true in regard to his having disqualified himself by removal from the ward, the question was not triable by the council, but only by a judicial tribunal; and the end of this proceeding, which is only to correct the wrong \u25a0done by respondents in presuming to remove him, is not to be defeated by converting it into a trial of the abstract right.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">The present remedy has no concern yvith the legality of relator\u2019s title. It relates solely and exclusively to the right of respondents to pass upon it.</p>\n<author id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Campbell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALq\">The decision of the common council upon the original admission of relator io the office of aider-man was under the charter conclusive upon all questions of qualification or election. It may be that within a reasonable time that council might for sufficient cause have granted a re-hearing \u2014 as was done in the Port Huron ease. <em>Cooley v. </em>Fitzgerald, 41 Mich. 2; <em>Cooley v. </em>Ashley, 43 Mich. 458. But this could not be done by any subsequent council, and the power to reconsider ended at least as early as the termination of the former council, if not earlier. All these questions are, I think, closed during the remainder of relator\u2019s official term.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">So far as declaring a vacancy is concerned I do not think it can be done in any case where the office is actually held by a person in by regular title and disputing the facts claimed to make him incompetent. No power to decide that a vacancy exists in such a case has been vested in the council, and I think relator is entitled to hold during his term.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
