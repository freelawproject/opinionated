McLaren pleaded the general issue, .and annexed to his plea an affidavit denying not only the \u2022execution of the note by himself, but also its execution by any one having authority to bind him or to bind defendants jointly..</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">On the trial the circuit judge held that this affidavit was \u2022not sufficient without an affidavit from Wren also, to allow .any defense to be introduced against the existence of the note as executed by defendants, and ordered judgment for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-12\">This affidavit was as broad as it could very well be made, .and distinctly denied any such execution by any one as would bind McLaren. To require one defendant to lose his \u25a0defense unless his co-defendant will join him in an affidavit \u2022of non-execution would subject him to such danger of fraud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>and collusion as would render such a rule as contained such a requirement unjust and arbitrary in the extreme. No-such meaning can be applied to the rule which requires a plea to be supported by affidavit; and such dangerous practice can receive no sanction. The regulation was intended to prevent sham defenses or surprises, and not to entrap men into responsibilities they never incurred. <em>McCormick v. Bay City </em>23 Mich. 457; <em>Anderson v. Walter </em>34 Mich. 114; <em>Freeman v.
