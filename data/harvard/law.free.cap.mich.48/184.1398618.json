L. \u00a7 5822 provides that where a defendant in justice\u2019s court has a set-off exceeding $800, defendant shall have judgment for costs and enough shall be applied on plaintiff\u2019s claim to satisfy it, or a judgment of discontinuance shall be entered. <em>Held, </em>that an appellate court can render no other judgment than the justice could have given.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-9\">Error to Kent.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"A_K\">Submitted April 12.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A8p\">Decided April 19.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-10\">Assumpsit.

Miller </em>and <em>Taggart &lt;&amp; Wolcott </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_2g\">Judgment on appeal is limited by tbe jurisdiction of the lower court: <em>Evers v. Sager </em>28 Mich. 47; <em>Matter of Jerry Irvin </em>29 Mich. 43; <em>Nelson v. People </em>38 Mich. 619; <em>Brown v. People </em>39 Mich. 57; <em>Louisville &amp; New Albany R. R. v.

To enlarge the claim of the plaintiff or that of the defendant in the circuit court, would to that extent be original and not appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-14\">The statute in relation to set-off in justice\u2019s court provides that if the balance found due to the defendant exceed three hundred dollars, the justice shall set off so much of the defendant\u2019s demand against the plaintiff\u2019s debt as shall be sufficient to satisfy it, if requested to do so by the defendant, and shall render judgment for the defendant for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>costs; but if tbe defendant shall not require such set-off, the justice shall render judgment of discontinuance against the plaintiff with costs to the defendants. \u00a7 5322.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">In this case the balance found due the defendant did exceed three hundred dollars, and had the case been in justic\u2019s court, one of two judgments must have been rendered, viz.: a judgment for the defendant for his costs, or a judgment of discontinuance against the plaintiff, with costs to defendant. On appeal no other or different form of judgment could be rendered on the main controversy, and the attempt of the circuit court to render judgment in favor of the defendant in this case for $500 was without authority. Nor can this court render any different judgment upon the finding, than the justice could have done. We cannot therefore render judgment in this court for $300 as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The judgment must therefore be reversed with costs of \u25a0this court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b201-6\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
