Warner </em>14 Mich. 157, the court properly rejected the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">\"What would be a reasonable rent, and what would be a. reasonable compensation to be paid for pasturing a horse, could not be arrived at by any mere mathematical process,, but would have to be determined from the conflicting opinions of witnesses. The claim was \u00a1therefore neither liquidated nor capable of being ascertained by calculation, and therefore not such an one as the statute permits .to \u2018be the-subject of a set-off, not coming under any of the other statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">The judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b631-14\">The other Justices concurred.
