There is no foundation suggested for- any other rule unless on the theory that the plaintiff must always sign in person or by agent as principal in a replevin bond. This, in case of absence or for many \u2022other easily-suggested reasons, might defeat his remedy altogether. The statute allows the bond to be signed by \u25a0\u201c some one in his behalf.\u201d \u00a7 6735. This cannot mean an \u25a0agent only, for then it would be the plaintiff\u2019s own bond, for the agent is his representative and the agent\u2019s act is his act. It cannot make any difference to the defendant what person rsigns the bond, if- it is only signed by responsible parties. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>think that a bond signed by none bnt sureties is sufficients Unless (which is not claimed) the bond would in all cases be-void when some obligor named fails to sign it, the liability exists in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">The judgment must be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b634-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
