L. \u00a7 4971, it is competent to order the transfer of a case pending in a circuit court on an appeal from commissioners on the estate of a decedent,' and in which the circuit judge has been, of counsel, to some other circuit court for trial and final disposition</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Mandamus to prohibit respondent from hearing an appeal from the disallowance of a claim against the estate of relator\u2019s decedent.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"AB7\">Submitted April 11.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aqu\">Denied April 19.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b193-4\"><em>Geo.

Walker </em>4 Mich. 177; <em>Welch v. Byrns </em>38 Ill. 20; and cannot be extended by the Legislature beyond the constitutional limit: Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim. 107: High Ext. Leg.

L. \u00a7 4971.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The case is within the terms of the statute; for it is a proceeding pending in the circuit court on the law side thereof. <em>Prima </em>facie, therefore, it is within the intent; If so, it was rightly transferred. No constitutional provision precludes such a transfer; and the Legislature in providing for it and in conferring upon the circuit court to which the case is sent authority to adjudicate, has given by implication all the necessary incidental powers, including the power to enforce its jurisdiction. \"With any question of incidental or possible embarrassments or inconveniences, we have no concern on this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">The writ is denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b193-9\">The other Justic\u00e9s concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
