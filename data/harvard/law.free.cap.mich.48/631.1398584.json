Next follow provisions devising and bequeathing the same lands to his son Lewis and daughter Sarah, \u201c from and after the decease of my wife Bet- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>\u25a0 sey.\u201d Then follows another clause, giving, devising and bequeathing to his wife Betsey, the same lands, <em>\u201c </em>during her natural life.\u201d The will then proceeds as follows: <em>\u201c </em>I give \u2022 and bequeath to my wife Betsey all the residue of my estate, real, personal and mixed, of which I shall die seized and pos- . sessed, or to which I shall be entitled at the time of my decease, to have and to hold the same to her own use and benefit, \u2022 during her natural life, and then to be divided equally between my son and daughter Lewis and Sarah or their heirs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Now whatever right this may have given to Betsey \u2022 Schmeele to dispose of the personal property during her .life-time, and which we need not at present determine, it is \u25a0very clear, that whatever remained at her death, did not pass to her administrator, but under this will at once passed to the testator\u2019s son and daughter, and for all such property in itheir possession, Betsey Schmeele\u2019s administrator could not maintain this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">The provisions in this will are very different from those in either of the cases referred to by counsel, and the question here raised comes up in a very different manner. See <em>Jones v. Jones </em>25 Mich. 401, and <em>Proctor v. Robinson </em>35 Mich. 288. In each of these cases the language of the will left no doubt as to the title which the testator intended to .give to his wife with the full and absolute power of disposition; besides, the question arose during the life-time \u2022of the wife, and the important point related to the rigid \u2022and power o\u00b1 the wife over the property devised during her life-time.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">In this case the real estate is given during the term of her \u25a0natural life, and then it is to be equally divided, and the same disposition is made of the personalty. It cannot be . successfully contended that an absolute title to the real estate was devised or intended to be, but that, in accordance with \u25a0other provisions, at her death it was to go to the testator\u2019s \u25a0children, and the same language, when applied in the same interest to the personalty, cannot be held to give the present .administrator any right to maintain this action, whatever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Betsey Sclimeele\u2019s rights thereto may have been during her life-time.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The judgment must be reversed with costs and a new trial ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"A2U\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
