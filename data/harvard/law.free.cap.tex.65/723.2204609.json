H. Buhl bought of Julius Kauffman, Sr., now deceased, December 1, 1874, lots thirteen and fourteen, in block two hundred and fifty-four, for $3,000, taking deed therefor; and on the same day bought of the same party lot twelve, in the same block, for $1,400, taking a separate deed therefor. August Boemer, on the same day, bought of Kauffman lot eleven, in the same block, for $1,400. Buhl <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>sold lot twelve, \u00a1November 3, 1876, conveying by his own deed\u2014his wife not joining\u2014to Gabardie, for $1,450. Bnhl bought of Boemer, September 18, 1879, lot eleven, for $720. Buhl and wife were married July 5, 1875, and, thereupon, established their homestead on lots thirteen and fourteen. Gabardie erected his residence on lot twelve, after purchasing of Buhl, and continued, with his family, to use and occupy it as such until January 20, 1881, when he resold it to Buhl for $4,000 cash.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b747-4\">Boemer, called by Mrs. Buhl, testified, that when (September 18, 1879,) he sold lot eleven to Buhl, there were no improvements on it,' and that just afterwards Buhl fenced it off from lot twelve (Gabardie\u2019s place) and built a stable on it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b747-5\">Tobey, called by Mrs. Buhl, testified that he commenced, in the latter part of October, and finished early in December, 1879, a stable for Buhl on lot eleven. He was employed by Buhl to build it. It was built for the accommodation of horses and carriages\u2014a stable and carriage-house combined, with servants\u2019 rooms in the upper story. It was built on the north part of lot eleven, on the alley, and had three or four stalls. Witness also built to the south of the stable, on the same lot, a shed-roof, attached to temporary posts, for the protection from the weather of loose stock in the yard, and vehicles when being washed; and sank a well and put in a pump. He understood, at the time, from Buhl, that the stable was for his, Buhl\u2019s, own private use. The improvements named were all that were made by the witness on lot eleven.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b747-6\">Mrs. Bnhl, for herself, testified, that, at the time her husband died, (October 17,1882,) he, she and their little children were living on the property, part of which is involved in this suit. There were three children\u2014seven, five and two years of age, respectively.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b747-7\">Buhl bought lot eleven of Boemer to put a stable on it. He had no place on lots thirteen and fourteen to put a stable, and as he owned a horse and buggy, he had to buy lot eleven to put a stable on it. He had the stable built on the north part of lot eleven, in the fall of 1879; and used it from that time till his death, for the keeping of the family horses and vehicles. Their cow and calf were also kept in the stable and stable-yard all that time, and since Buhl\u2019s death there has been no change in the uses of the stable and stable-yard. Kauffman boarded with them, and kept his own two horses in the stable for the first year. After that, he kept one horse there until 1882.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b747-8\">Witness thought Buhl was, for awhile, a partner of Freedman in the livery stable business. Freedman, and also Kauffman <em>&amp; </em>Bunge, occasionally sent horses to the stable. It was only an act of accom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>modation extended them by Buhl. The Gabardie place, lot twelve, was bought by Buhl in January, 1881, and very soon thereafter the cottage was moved from that lot to lot eleven, and was thenceforward used for the family. Bornefeld (the administrator) rented two of the rooms on the first floor from the time the cottage was ready for occupation. Witness\u2019 parents occupied two rooms on that floor for about two months, at first; and afterwards, these rooms were rented to Huber. From that time until Buhl\u2019s death, Bornefeld and Huber rented and occupied their two rooms, respectively. The other rooms were occupied by members of the family. The cottage is one and a half stories high. Witness\u2019 brothers occupied rooms in the attic. Witness calls her parents and brothers members of her family.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b748-4\">The family had three servants, some of whom slept at the cottage, which was always more or less in use by them, especially during the summer months, when it was more comfortable than for more than one to occupy the same bed in the main house. Very often witness had no place for th\u00e9m to sleep in the main house, and then they slept in the garret of the cottage. The bedding and furniture not in use from time to time was stored and kept in the cottage, upstairs, and in the kitchen. A room in the cottage was occupied from August 26, 1882, until February, 1883, continuously, by a servant who was wait-. ing on witness, personally. Ho other uses than those indicated were made of the cottage until after Buhl\u2019s death, when witness rented it to a private family. When Buhl bought lot twelve (January 20, 1881,) there was a fence separating that lot from lots thirteeen and fourteen. As soon as that purchase was made, and the Gabardie cottage moved from lot twelve to lot eleven, the fence was torn down by Buhl, and ever since that time, continuously, there has been an unbroken front to the south of the four lots\u2014fourteen, thirteen, twelve and eleven\u2014 without any fence or partition dividing them; the four lots being embraced in one enclosure. There was, and is, a partition fence run ning from the stable, on lot eleven, south, to the north corner of the cottage, to keep the stock from going off that lot to the lots west of it. There is a gate in this fence, through which access is had to and from the stable and lot twelve. The stable opens to the south, on lot eleven, and to the north on the alley\u2014it does not open on lot twelve. \u2022 Its west end is flush with the division line between lots eleven and twelve. It is not on a line with the west line of the cottage, nor with the brick pillars supporting the cottage. The cottage, is on a line at least three or four feet east of the line on which the fence is built.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b748-5\">When Buhl bought the Gabardie place (lot twelve) the cottage was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>a complete residence and occupied as such. There was then no improvement on the lot but the cottage; neither stable, woodshed nor chicken-house. The woodshed and chicken-house, now on lot twelve, were moved from lot eleven at the time the cottage was moved from lot twelve to lot eleven. They were put there for the use of the family, as woodshed and chicken-house, and were so used from that time on. Buhl\u2019s purpose in buying lot twelve was to enlarge the homestead and provide space for a garden. So soon as the Gabardie cottage was moved to lot eleven, lot twelve was made a garden, and a play place for the children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b749-5\">The residence on lots fourteen and thirteen is a commodious, handsome and agreeable house\u2014two stories, with eleven rooms. The servants\u2019 rooms were in that part of the building on lot thirteen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b749-6\">The improvements on the respective lots, the arrangement and enclosure thereof, and the uses of the property, underwent no change during Buhl\u2019s lifetime, and were as stated. For has there been any change since his death, save the renting of the cottage on lot eleven to a private family.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b749-7\">G. Buhl, called for Mrs. Buhl, testified that he was a brother of J. H. Buhl, and knew all about the location and arrangement of his house. Buhl\u2019s object in buying lots eleven and twelve was to enlarge his homestead; he often expressed that purpose to witness before and at the time of the purchases. His principal purpose in buying lot eleven was to erect a stable there for the accommodation of his horses, cows and vehicles. As witness remembers, there were, at the time, belonging to the family, two horses, one or two cows, and one or two buggies. The stable was built, and these animals and vehicles were kept there from that time until Buhl died, for the use of the family. Buhl\u2019s particular object as to lot twelve was to make of it a garden and playground for his children, and it was put to that purpose as soon as the Gabardie cottage was moved to lot eleven, and it was used in that way continuously to his death, and has ever since been so used. At the time lot eleven was bought, there was a fence between eleven and twelve, and one also between twelve and thirteen. Immediately after the purchase of lot twelve, these fences were removed, and since that time the four lots, fourteen, thirteen, twelve and eleven, have been embraced in one enclosure.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b749-8\">The lots are each one hundred and twenty feet deep, and witness thinks cottage on eleven is twelve feet from the fence on the south front. A fence was run between the corner of the stable on lot eleven to the corner of the cottage moved to that lot from lot twelve, to separate the stable and stable-yard from lot twelve, and to keep the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>stock in their yard on lot eleven. In this fence there was a gate, giving ingress and egress between lots eleven and twelve. Witness had seen other horses besides those of the family there. Ruhl, as a special favor to Kauffman &amp; Runge, allowed them to keep their horses and mules there about a month, pending the erection of a stable for them, on lot five, in the same block.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b750-4\">Julius Runge, called for Kauffman <em>&amp; </em>Runge, testified, that he knew Ruhl; was an employe of their house from 1872 until his death; Ruhl erected first on lots thirteen and fourteen a cottage residence, which he enlarged to a handsome two-story residence, a year or two before buying the Gabardie place. The Gabardie lot and cottage, while occupied by Gabardie and family, constituted a comfortable home. That family lived there for years. Gabardie had no stable on the lot, or other improvements, save the cottage house. Ruhl, after buying lot eleven of Roemer, erected a stable on it. Witness didn\u2019t know whether the erection of a stable was contemplated at the time of the purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b750-5\">Adolph Brenker, called for Kauffman &amp; Runge, testified, that he came to Galveston December 7, 1879; was employed by Kauffman &amp; Runge in the spring of 1880, and soon afterwards, during the same spring, went to work for Ruhl, at his place. At that time there was a stable with five or six stalls in it, and a shed on the south side of the stable, on lot eleven. After a few months, in the summer of the same year, an open stable was built on the same lot, to the south of the first stable and a little to the east of the center of the lot and near its middle, which would accommodate from sixteen to eighteen horses. It had racks for hay, and a place at the top to keep oats and hay. It was used to accommodate livery horses, from twelve to eighteen, of Freedman <em>&amp; </em>Co., of which firm Ruhl was a partner. Before the open stable was built, the first stable built\u2014that on the north end of the lot\u2014was used to shelter livery horses, to the extent of its stalls, and as a paint-shop up stairs. An elevator ran to the upper floor, and the up-stairs was used for painting buggies and carriages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b750-6\">Witness remained in Ruhl\u2019s employ until the fall of 1880\u2014then hired to Kauffman and attended to his horse there in the same stable until the summer of 1881, after which Kauffman\u2019s horse was moved and witness had nothing- more to do with the place. \u201cSo far as I know, Mr. Ruhl had no horse on the place until I went there, and I brought his first horse there from the country and broke it in. He kept a horse there in the stable, his own horse, for his private use, and his own buggy, the whole time of my stay at the place. He kept also a cow and a calf for family use the whole time. These were kept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>under the shed next to the stable, on lot eleven. The horses of Freedman &amp; Co., were taken away from the place in the fall of 1880. Mrs. Buhl did not have a special horse and buggy while I staid there. \u201d Witness was never on lot twelve after Gabardie left there. Gabardie did not keep a horse or buggy. \u00a1No horses were kept on the premises, except on lot eleven.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b751-4\">Bobert Bornefeld, administrator of Buhl\u2019s estate, called for Kauffman &amp; Bunge, testified, that he knew Buhl well\u2014they were friends\u2014 intimate\u2014in the service of the same firm. Buhl bought lot eleven about the time he went into partnership with Freedman in horse trading. They intended to do a large business. Witness frequently heard the talk between them. The lot (eleven) was bought especially because they wanted to go into the horse-trading business, and the stable was put up for that purpose. The lot was bought principally for the purpose of keeping horses there, brought from New Orleans and the west, and the stable was used for that purpose until the business proved unprofitable, and Buhl dissolved the partnership, in the fall of 1880. The horses were sold, and nothing was kept there from that time but Buhl\u2019s one horse. Buhl had only one horse himself until the summer of 1881, when he bought a horse for Mrs. Buhl, and another buggy. Before and after Freedman\u2019s horses left his place (in the fall of 1880) Buhl kept his own private horses and buggy in the stable on lot eleven. He bought a horse for himself just about the time he bought lot eleven, or while the stable was being erected, and later on bought a horse and buggy for his wife, and these were kept in his stable on that lot, from that time, until his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b751-5\">After the Freedman <em>&amp; </em>Co. business ceased, Buhl proposed to Gabardie to exchange lot eleven for thirty-three feet on the west side of lot twelve, so that Gabardie could move his cottage on the fifty-three feet made up of the remainder of lot twelve and lot thirteen, and Buhl could add thirty-three feet to the east of lot thirteen. Gabardie refused, and offered to sell the whole of lot twelve, with the cottage. Buhl then told Kauffman he could buy the place for $4,000, and he would buy it and fit it up if Kauffman would lend him $5,000. Kauffman made the loan, and the purchase was consummated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b751-6\">When the purchase was made, Buhl told witness he would move the cottage to lot eleven and rent rooms in it to witness and some one else, and if Mrs. Buhl\u2019s parents wanted to stay in Galveston, they could occupy rooms there. From the time the cottage was moved to lot eleven, and fitted for occupation, about July, 1881, to seven or eight months after Buhl\u2019s death, witness rented and occupied two rooms on the first floor, and Huber rented and occupied two rooms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>on that floor, save that Huber\u2019s rooms were, for the first two months, occupied by Mrs. Ruhl\u2019s parents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b752-4\">These four rooms were the front part of the cottage The back part of it was unoccupied, and the upper part was used for storing Mrs. Ruhl\u2019s furniture and bedding. One garret room was occupied by brothers of Mrs. Ruhl the whole time. \u201cThere were no servants there; but they might, or might not, have been there for a part of two summers when I was absent. I won\u2019t be positive that-they did not come there occasionally and sleep. I did not know of it if they did.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b752-5\">Ruhl and witness talked a great deal about these matters. Witness knew from what Ruhl said to him that it was his purpose in buying lot twelve to make it a part of his homestead. He had before that largely improved his residence, and wanted more ground for his children. There was no dispute that the estate of Ruhl was insolvent; nor was it controverted by the evidence that the four lots claimed by Mrs. Ruhl were of an aggregate value within the constitutional limitation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b752-6\">Kauffman <em>&amp; </em>Runge are not lien creditors of the estate; nor did any item of the indebtedness of Ruhl to them accrue prior to 1882.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b752-7\">On the trial of the issue between Mrs. Ruhl and Kauffman &amp; Runge, as to whether lot eleven, and improvements, were, at the time of Ruhl\u2019s death, a part of the homestead of himself and family, and should be set aside as such, Kauffman &amp; Runge offered in evidence a trust deed made by Ruhl and wife to the Citizens\u2019 Loan Co. Mrs. Ruhl objected to the introduction of the deed as irrelevant and inadmissible : 1, because it was a transaction between other parties; 2, because the evidence, before the court, tended to show, not only designation of the lot as part of the homestead long prior to the execution ot the trust deed, and its uses as such, but also the designation, occupation and use of it after the execution of the trust deed continuously to, and since, the death of Ruhl; and, as against such designation, uses and occupation after the trust deed was executed, that instrument was irrelevant and inadmissible as evidence of the limits of the homestead.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b752-10\">The objection was overruled and the deed admitted. The instrument recites, \u201cwe do here designate lots thirteen and fourteen, in block two hundred and fifty-four, and the improvements thereon situated, as our homestead.\u201d It is dated July 7, 1880 ; was signed and acknowledged by J. H. Ruhl and applicant, his wife, and filed for record on the twelfth of the same month.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b752-11\">The statement, by Julius Kauffman, of the nature of the lien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>claimed by him on lot twelve, block two hundred and fifty-four, and to which a general demurrer by Mrs. Buhl was sustained, in both the county and the district court, was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b753-4\">\u201cThat early in the month of January, 1881, at the special instance and request of J. H. Buhl, he agreed to advance and loan to him, J. TT. Buhl, the sum of $5,000, for the express purpose of enabling him to purchase lot number twelve, block two hundred and fifty-four, city of Galveston, and to remove therefrom and repair the tenement and appurtenances; that, thereupon, Buhl did negotiate the purchase at $4,000 cash, and your petitioner did, thereupon, advance and loan Buhl the sum of $4,000 wherewith to make the purchase; that the purchase was so made and the money so used by Buhl, and, thereupon, Buhl executed and delivered to petitioner his note for the $4,000; and the further sum of $1,000,' used in removal and repairs as aforesaid\u2014 the note being the same for $5,000 heretofore filed by him as a claim against the estate.

Mrs. Buhl was entitled to have set apart to her, in this proceeding, the homestead of the family as it existed within constitutional limits at the date of her husband\u2019s death, in 1882. What constituted the homestead at that date is the matter to be determined. Let it be conceded that lot eleven was bought in 1879 on speculation, or for business purposes distinct from any home use, and that it formed no part of the homestead in the years 1879 and 1880; yet, if it was afterward appropriated as part of the homestead and was so used and intended at the date of Buhl\u2019s death, the judgment below cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>The constitution does not limit the number of lots which may be embraced in the urban homestead, and it is not claimed that the four lots at any time transgressed the prescribed value. The issue is narrowed to one of use and intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Lots thirteen and fourteen were the original homestead. Lot eleven was purchased in 1879\u2014it was separated from lots thirteen and fourteen by lot twelve, which was purchased by Buhl in January, 1881. The four lots, all owned by Buhl, became thus, if we discard the imaginary lines dividing the several lots, a single tract of land bounded on two sides by streets, on a third side by an alley running through the middle of block two hundred and fifty-four, and on the fourth side by the outside line of lot eleven. The situation was thus decidedly favorable for extending to the outside boundaries the homestead limits. Whilst the constitution authorizes lots not contiguous to be united in one homestead, it would naturally require more distinct evidences of such destination in proportion to the inconvenience of using as parts of the same home lots remote from each other. There was nothing in the situation of these four lots to prevent their convenient use as parts of one-home; and an occupant of lots thirteen and fourteen, desiring to enlarge his seat, could do so only in the direction of lots eleven and twelve, without crossing a street or an alley. The purchase of lot twelve by the owner of lots eleven, thirteen and fourteen, solidifying the tract, was in line with and suggestive of an intention to use the whole as one homestead.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">The cottage on lot twelve, when it was purchased, was moved upon lot eleven. A garden was then located upon lot twelve. The fences within the boundaries of the entire tract were so arranged as to leave in the same yard the cottage on lot eleven and the main dwelling on lots thirteen and fourteen, and direct connection within the premises was established between the dwelling and the enclosure about the stable, on the rear end of lot eleven. In the stable and its enclosure were kept the family milch cow and calf, and the horses and vehicles used by the family. Lot eleven was thus appropriated to a strictly home use, with every indication of permanency in the arrangement, with nothing occurring after the purchase of lot twelve, suggestive of any other design than that indicated by the use.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">The actual use of a lot for the convenience of the family has always been regarded as the most satisfactory evidence of an intention to make it part of the homestead. In reported cases involving controversies over the intent, this best evidence of it did not generally exist, and the determination of the issue has been forced to other means. But even the positive and formal declaration of both husband and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>wife of a contrary intent, as has been held, are not sufficient to divest property, actually used as a homestead, of the homestead protection (Jacobs <em>v. </em>Hawkins, 63 Tex. 1), even when the declaration is made at the very time to which the issue is confined. Medlenka <em>v. </em>Downing, 59 Tex. 40. See also Wood <em>v. </em>Lyon, decided at this term. The use of a portion of lot eleven for a stable and cow-lot, from about January, 1880, until Ruhl\u2019s death, is not controverted; that this is a home use, making at least that portion of the lot exempt, cannot be denied', and the intent to incorporate the lot as part of the home is, in the interval stated, not contradicted by a single fact in the evidence, unless moving the cottage upon the front part of the lot is such fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">This cottage seems to be unusually large and costly for an outhouse. In the photographs sent up with the record, it has the appearance of a very respectable and comfortable dwelling. The erection of such an improvement upon what, may otherwise have been part of the homestead, would be strong proof of an intention permanently to appropriate the ground covered to independent uses. The addition to the main dwelling of the same structure, would be simply an enlargement of the mansion. The different motives ascribed to the different improvements arises from a consideration of what is usual and customary. It is not usual for one, who desires more house room, to erect an independent structure, and, hence, to such an act is ascribed some other motive. But what the motive is, is a matter of evidence, in every case. So, if Ruhl had erected this cottage on lot eleven, it would only have been <em>evidence, </em>itself open to explanation, contradictory of the other proof of an intention to make lot eleven a part of his homestead. But he made no such erection. The cottage was on lot twelve when that lot was purchased, and he was not required, in order to enable him to accomplish his design to make all four of the lots his homestead, to destroy the cottage, or sell it at a sacrifice, or remove it entirely from the premises. He had the right to remove it to any part of his homestead, where he could make it the most serviceable to his family. It was accordingly moved upon lot eleven, and there, during the life of Ruhl, it was applied to uses entirely consistent with the design to make lot eleven part of the enlarged homestead. This cottage, after its removal, occupied in part, part of the time, by Mrs. Ruhl\u2019s parents, in part by her brothers, in part by family servants, and in part by renters of particular rooms, is the single and, to our minds, clearly insufficient circumstance militating against the intent, otherwise abundantly manifested, of Ruhl to make of these lots one, and of that one his homestead. As presented here, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>judgment of the court below, refusing to set aside lot eleven, as part of the homestead, is practically unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">The demurrer to the claim, by Julius Kauffman, of a lien upon lot twelve was properly sustained. It was alleged that he had loaned to Buhl the money with which lot twelve was purchased, with a view to its being so used. The title was taken in Buhl\u2019s name, and the property intended for his benefit. There was no agreement for a lien, as in the case of Nichols <em>v. </em>Overacker (16 Kan. 64) and in all the cases cited in the note to sec. 338 of Thompson on Homesteads, &amp;c., and Kauffman and Buhl did not sustain to each other the relation of vendor and vendee. Malone <em>v. </em>Kauffman, 38 Tex. 455. See also Boehl <em>v. </em>Wadgymar, 54 Tex. 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The failure of the administrator to perfect his appeal to the district court did not deprive that court of full jurisdiction of the case on the appeal taken by Kauffman &amp; Bunge and Julius Kauffman, who were parties to the proceeding in the county court and authorized by statute to have its action revised by their appeal. R. S., art. 2200.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The only error in the judgment below is that with respect to lot eleven. For this, the judgment is reversed, and such judgment will be here rendered as ought have been entered in the court below: That lots eleven, twelve, thirteen and fourteen be set apart to Mrs. Buhl, as exempt from administration; that Julixxs Kauffman take nothing by his claim of lien on lot twelve; and that Kauffman &amp; Bunge and Julius Kaxiffman pay all the costs of this court and the coxirt below. It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Bevebsed and Bendebed.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">[Opinion delivered March 23, 1886.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
