The defendants\u2019 motion for new trial was overruled, and they gave notice of appeal. On December 17, 1885, the peremptory writ awarded, was issued. On December 26, the defendants filed their supersedeas appeal bond, which was approved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-4\">On January 7, 1886, the defendants presented and filed in this court a petition for injunction, to restrain the judge and the clerk of the district court from immediately executing the judgment appealed from. It was averred that neither the judge nor the clerk recognized that the appeal suspended the execution of the judgment, and its enforcement, in spite of the appeal, was seriously apprehended. On January 9, 1886, the judges of this court endorsed upon the petition a fiat, ordering the clerk to issue a notice to the judge and the clerk, requiring them to show cause, on the 22d instant, why the injunction prayed for should not be granted, and an order, in the meantime, restraimng them from executing the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-5\">The judge and the clerk filed answers, wMch show that nothing had been done or intended toward the execution of the judgment, since the appeal bond was filed. The case was submitted to the court on petition, exhibits, and answers.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b390-6\"><em>J. </em>G. <em>Cook, </em>for applicant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVg\">that a judgment of the district court, \u2022awarding a peremptory writ of mandamus, is superseded by an appeal to the supreme court, cited: R.

Griffin <em>v. </em>Wakelee, 42 Tex. 513. After the approval of such a bond, the district court, during the term, still has jurisdiction to modify or set aside the judgment appealed from, (Blum <em>v. </em>Wettermark, 58 Tex. 125; Garza <em>v. </em>Baker, 58 Tex. 487) but not to enforce such judgment. When the bond has been filed and approved, the complaining party has done, substantially, all required of him to give this court jurisdiction of the case, and this court may then, under the constitution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>to protect or enforce its jurisdiction, issue writs of injunction, etc. But until the appeal bond is filed and approved, the case, in no sense, is in this court, and the supreme court has no authority to interfere with the proceedings of the district court. It may be <em>error </em>for that court, when notice of appeal has been given, to have its judgment, executed within less than twenty days, but it is no infringement of the jurisdiction of this court. The error may be revised only on. appeal. The extraordinary writs may only be used in cases of which this court has acquired jurisdiction. They cannot be used to set aside orders made, or to correct results transpired, before the appeal bond, was given, Wells <em>v. </em>Littlefield, 62 Tex. 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Since the appeal bond was approved in this case, nothing has been done in furtherance of the suspended judgment, and the answers of the respondents show that they have not done, or contemplated doing, anything to prejudice the appellate jurisdiction, or to justify the apprehensions set forth in the petition. If the writ of <em>mandamus </em>has not been returned not executed, the defendant in the judgment can have it recalled by a writ of supersedeas. R. S., art. 1406.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">We think there is no occasion for an injunction, and the restraining order will be set aside, the application be refused, and the cause be dismissed at the cost of the applicants. It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Application Refused and Cause Dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">[Opinion delivered January 29, 1886.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
