Such decrees, although obtained by fraud, if the fraud does not go to the jurisdiction of the court making them, must stand, unless set aside by some proceeding appellate in its character, if this be sought in the district court.

Tried below before the Hon. Wm. H. Burkhart.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-12\">The appellants, Elizabeth V. Fisher and Martha D. Jones, the latter joined by her husband, A. L. Jones, claiming as devisees under the will of L. A. Hill, deceased, instituted this suit in the district court of Waller county against R. 0. Wood, executor of the will, and Mrs. R. J. Wood and one R. R. McDade, to set aside as fraudulent certain deeds to real estate made by R. C. Wood, as executor, to Mrs. R. J. Wood, and to declare a trust in favor of the plaintiffs in a portion of the land still held by her. Ho judgment was sought against McDade, who appeared to be an innocent purchaser for value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-13\">The amended original petition alleged that Mrs. L. A. Hill, by her will, duly probated in December, 1874, bequeathed her entire estate in equal portions to the plaintiffs, Elizabeth V. Fisher and Martha D. Jones, and the defendants, R. C. Wood and Mrs. R. J. Wood, and nominated R. G. Wood as the executor of the will; that the estate consisted of $6,000 in money, other personal property of the value of $800 and upwards, and two certain tracts of land, aggregating four hundred and thirty-eight acres, situated in Waller county and fully described in exhibit appended to the petition; that the will provided that the real estate should not be sold, but should be divided amongst the devisees, share and share alike; that on December 29, 1874, the defendant R. O. Wood was duly appointed by the probate court of Waller county executor of the will, and qualified as such; that the land was well improved, was reasonably worth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>the sum of $12,000, and was susceptible of an equitable division amongst the devisees in accordance with the provisions of the will, but that the executor, combining and confederating with his co-defendant, R. J. Wood, to cheat, wrong and defraud plaintiffs out of their interest in the real estate and to procure title thereto in himself and R. J. Wood, on May 12, 1875, procured, by fraudulent representations, from the probate court an order authorizing a private sale of the real estate for the purpose of partition, under which order the executor, on December 1, 1875, made a pretended sale and conveyance of the same to R. J. Wood at the price of $5,000, one-half cash and the balance on twelve months\u2019 credit, reciting in the deed the payment to him of $2,500 and the execution of Mrs. Wood\u2019s note for the remainder, and that the sale was afterwards duly confirmed by the probate court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-6\">The petition further alleges that the sale and conveyance, though nominally to Mrs. R. J. Wood only, were really made in trust for the executor and herself; that the cash payment of $2,500 was never in fact made, but that in lieu thereof Mrs. Wood, on March 17, 1876, reconveyed about one-half, or two hundred and sixty acres, of the land to the executor in his individual right; that on January 10,1878, R. O. Wood again conveyed this tract of two hundred and thirty acres to Mrs. Wood, and she afterwards conveyed the same to the defendant McDade, who claimed to be an innocent purchaser for value and without notice; that Mrs. Wood still retains the remainder of the land; that plaintiffs did not know or discover, and had no means of discovering, the fraudulent acts and purposes of the defendants, R. O. Wood and R. J. Wood, until about three months next before the commencement of this suit; that the plaintiffs have never received any money, property or other benefit from the sale of the land, and that the executor and the sureties on his bond are insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-7\">The plaintiffs conceding that McDade was a purchaser for value without notice, and alleging that the defendants, Mrs. Wood and the executor, are estopped to deny the validity of his title to the two hundred and thirty acres, seek to recover the remainder of the tract, the title of which is still in Mrs. Wood, and which is of less value than the two hundred and thirty acres conveyed to McDade, on the ground that the pretended sale to her by the executor was fraudulent, and that she holds the moiety in trust for the plaintiffs who have received no portion of the lands or its proceeds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-8\">Plaintiffs aver their willingness to recognize the conveyance to McDade, which the defendants are estopped to dispute, and pray for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>judgment canceling the title from B. G. Wood, as executor, to Mrs. B. J. Wood for all of the land conveyed to her, except that portion sold to McDade, both tracts being fully described in exhibits; that the tract be held to be assets of the estate of Mrs. Hill, and that title thereto be vested in the plaintiffs as their proper share of the real estate bequeathed to them by Mrs. Hill. There is also a prayer in the alternative that, should the court be of opinion that final distribution should be made in the probate court, such order be made as be necessary to give effect to the object of the suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-5\">R. C. Wood and R. J. Wood answered by general demurrer and. special exceptions, general denial, limitations of two and five years, laches, and estoppel and bar; that title to the land had been vested in R. J. Wood by decrees of the probate court of Waller county, nob vacated, but still subsisting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-6\">R. R. McDade answered by plea to the jurisdiction, that administration had been opened and was still pending in the probate court of Waller county upon the estate of L. A. Hill, under whose will plaintiffs claim title to the land in controversy, by general demurrer and special exceptions, general denial, and by special plea setting up the order of sale, the sale and the executor\u2019s report thereof, the confirmation of the sale by the probate court, and that he, the said McDade, was a purchaser in good faith, for valuable consideration and without notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-7\">The original petition of Mrs. Fisher was filed March 23, 1880, and the intervention of Mrs. Jones on March 14, 1881. Mrs. Jones, it appears, was a minor until January 19, 1879, when she married her co-plaintiff, A. L. Jones, and Mrs. Fisher was a married woman when the cause of action occurred, and continued so until January, 1879.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-8\">The defendants\u2019 general demurrer and special exceptions were-overruled. The cause was tried by the court, without the intervention of a jury. There is no statement of facts, but the judge\u2019s conclusions of fact and of law are in the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-9\">The court found, as conclusions of fact, that the allegations of the petition were substantially established, except as to the issue of fraud; that the charge of fraud against the executor, B. 0. Wood, was fully sustained by the evidence; that Mrs. B. J. Wood had actual notice of such facts as would have put a prudent person on inquiry as to the fraudulent purpose of B. C. Wood, and would have led a prudent or ordinarily intelligent person to its discovery, but that she had no actual knowledge of his fraudulent purpose, and he, by reason of her confiding disposition, inexperience in business matters, and implicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>confidence in him, was able to use her without her suspecting or understanding his purpose. The court further found that in the execution of his fraudulent purpose the executor, under the orders of sale and confirmation of the probate court, executed to Mrs. Wood a deed to the entire four hundred and thirty-eight acres of land described in the petition, which deed recited the payment of $2,500 in cash, and, in addition thereto, the execution of her note for $2,500, maturing twelve months thereafter; that no part of the cash payment mentioned in the deed was ever, in fact, paid by Mrs. Wood, but, in lieu thereof, she reconveyed to the executor, in his own right, one-half of the land, which half is the same land subsequently conveyed by her to the defendant, McDade; that the deferred payment for which Mrs. Wood executed her note to the executor had been paid by her to him; that the first deed from the executor to Mrs. Wood, by which he conveyed to her the entire four hundred and thirty-eight acres and her deed to him, reconveying two hundred and thirty acres thereof, though bearing different dates, were, in fact, contemporaneously executed, and that Mrs. Wood still held the remainder of the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-6\">All the deeds in question, it appears, had been duly recorded. 2sTo issue was made in the pleadings as; to the mental capacity or incapacity of Mrs. Wood.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-7\">Under the foregoing facts the court held, as conclusions of law, that the plaintiffs had not shown such participation on the part of Mrs. Wood in the fraud of the executor as to entitle them to recover against her, and also that the plaintiffs\u2019 suit was barred by limitation.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b225-8\"><em>Sayles &amp; Bassett, </em>for appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AV2\">that the fraudulent acts of the defendants, as alleged and proved, raised a constructive trust in favor of plaintiffs as to so much of the land as was still held by Mrs. Wood, cited: Hamblin <em>v. </em>Warnecke, 31 Tex., 91; McCoy <em>v. </em>Crawford, 9 Tex., 355 ; Neill <em>v. </em>Keese, 13 Tex., 187.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-9\">That actual notice to Mrs. Wood of such fact as would put a prudent person upon inquiry as to the fraudulent purpose of the executor, was such participation by her in the fraud as to entitle plaintiffs to set aside the transaction, they cited: Mills <em>v. </em>Howeth, 19 Tex., 257; Weisiger <em>v. </em>Chisholm, 28 Tex., 780; Bump on Fraud. Conv., 232, 233, 477.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-10\">That the district court had authority to enforce the trust, they cited: Rogers <em>v. </em>Kennard, 54 Tex., 36; Crain <em>v. </em>Crain, 17 Tex., 87; Smith <em>v. </em>Smith, 11 Tex., 102; Becton <em>v. </em>Alexander, 27 Tex., 659.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b225-11\">On limitations, they cited: Decordova <em>v. </em>Smith, 9 Tex., 129; De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Witt <em>v. </em>Miller, 9 Tex., 239; McCoy <em>v. </em>Crawford, 9.

To do this, it is not necessary to set aside the decrees of the probate court ordering and confirming the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">If, for the preservation of the rights of those interested in the estate, it was necessary to set aside the decrees of the probate court through which the sales were made, that could not be done by an original proceeding in the district court, for under the present constitution the district courts hav6 no original jurisdiction or control over the county courts. Franks <em>v. </em>Chapman,,50 Tex., 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">District courts, under the present constitution, as did they under the constitution of 1845, have original jurisdiction and general control over executors, administrators, guardians and minors, under such regulations as may be prescribed by the legislature. Const., art. 5, sec. 8; Const. 1845, art. 4, sec. 15. They have also, as courts of equity, the same power as under the former constitution, in so far as the question now before us is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">In Dobbin, admr., <em>v. </em>Bryan (5 Tex., 276), it was said: \u201cThe district courts have jurisdiction to investigate and arrest a fraudulent combination between an administrator and others confederating to injure those interested in the faithful administration of an estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">This jurisdiction was enforced under the tenth section of article four of the constitution of 1845, which, as before said, is no broader than is section'eight, article five, of the present constitution, in so far as the question before us is concerned. Newsom v. Chrisman, 9 Tex., 113; Smith <em>v. </em>Smith,. 11 Tex., 105; Crain <em>v. </em>Crain, 17 Tex., 85; Becton <em>v. </em>Alexander, 27 Tex., 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">The order to sell and the order confirming the sale were made by a court having jurisdiction to make them, and, although they may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>have been obtained through fraud not going to the jurisdiction of the court, they must stand until set aside by some proceeding appellate in its character, if this be sought in the district court. If, at the sale made, the executor, directly or indirectly, became the purchaser, for himself, or for himself and another, the sale might have been set aside by the probate court upon the application of persons interested in the estate.\u201d R. S., 2083; P. D., 5640.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The effect of such action by the probate court would be to set aside the order of confirmation and to revest the title, legal and equitable, in the persons in whom it vested as devisees or heirs at the death \"of the testator or intestate, subject, however, as before, to administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">In Rutherford <em>v. </em>Stamper (60 Tex., 450), it was held that a district court in an action of trespass to try title brought in the common form, with no averments which could invoke the equity powers of the court, could not set aside a sale made by an administrator at which he was indirectly the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">This would seem to be necessarily true; for, without the averment of such facts as will entitle a plaintiff to equitable relief, no such relief can be granted. It does not follow, however, from this, that upon proper averments a court of equity, while it leaves the legal title standing as directed to be made under the orders of the probate court, will not affect the fraudulent purchaser with a trust and compel him to hold the property as a trustee for those entitled to it. That a court of equity has this power there can be no question, and it matters not whether the fraud which calls it into operation occurred in procuring orders in probate through which sales were directed to be made and confirmed, or in the sales, or in the making of deeds in violation of the order of confirmation.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">That a court of equity, when the rights of <em>bona fide </em>purchasers have not intervened, would have the power to cancel a conveyance made by an executor in violation of the order of a probate court confirming a sale of land, when necessary for the protection of devisees, hires or creditors of an estate, we have no doubt; and this is so, notwithstanding a similar power may exist in the probate court. \u2022 The record shows that the appellants are entitled to relief as against all the defendants, except the defendant McDade, who is shown to be an innocent purchaser of the legal title, while under the decrees of the probate court it appeared to be in his vendee.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">The pleadings of the plaintiffs, in connection with those of the defendants, sufficiently show that they were laboring under disabilities such as would relieve them from the charge of laches ; and, besides, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>they show such facts and acts of the defendants as were calculated to induce them to believe that the sale was made to Mrs. Wood, and that she had paid one-half of the purchase money at the time the deed was delivered to her. The executor reported that she was the purchaser, and the court confirmed the sale to her, and the evidence tends strongly to show that the report of the executor was untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The deed recited the payment of one-half of the purchase money when no such sum, nor any other, was paid. The executor delivered it with this recital in it, and the vendee received it with a knowledge of its falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Such facts were calculated to lull inquiry by the plaintiffs, who allege that they did not discover the fraud until a short time before the suit was brought; and had they not been laboring under disabilities we are of the opinion that they plead and prove such facts as would entitle them to maintain this action. The plaintiffs are entitled to such relief, if it can be given, as will secure to them the interest in the estate of Mrs. Hill which she gave them by her will. The case as presented, however, does not enable us to know what decree will be necessary to accomplish that purpose, so far as it may be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">It does not appear what part of the estate of Mrs. Hill still remains in the hands of the executor; in fact, it does not appear whether the administration is still pending. It may be that the plaintiffs can recover the full share of the estate to which they are each entitled without resort to the land now held by Mrs. Wood. If so, as the purpose of the testatrix cannot now be carried out since a part of the land which she directed to be equally divided among the devisees has vested in McDade by- title which cannot be divested, the plaintiffs are entitled to receive the value of their respective shares. If this can be otherwise given, there is no necessity to disturb Mrs. Wood in her title to so much of the land as she holds; but, if this cannot be given, the plaintiffs are entitled to a decree which will subject the land now in the hands of Mrs. Wood to the payment of the shares of the estate of Mrs. Hill, to which they are entitled under the will, and for any balance not so paid the plaintiffs will have to look to the executor and his bondsmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">The court\u2019s finding of facts fixes such fraud on the defendants, other than McDade, as to entitle the plaintiffs to relief, and the conclusions of law based on them cannot, in any respect, be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">The judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded, that such inquiries may be made and such facts shown as will enable the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>to enter a decree which will, as far as may be done, protect all parties. \"Were we to render a decree here this might not be accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-22\">Reversed and Remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-23\">[Opinion delivered December 21, 1885.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
