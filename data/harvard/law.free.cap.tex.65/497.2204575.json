This interest was the only property or property rights possessed by L. At the same time B., who was fully apprised of L.\u2019s purpose, in pursuance of an agreement between them, and in order to give the transaction the appearance of a <em>bona fide </em>sale, executed to L. his promissory note for \u00a75,000, payable January 1, 1883, bearing eight per cent, interest, and expressing as its consideration a transfer of L.\u2019s interest in his deceased parents\u2019 estates. The deed from L. to B. recited the note, and was duly recorded in the records of deeds of Galveston county. It was distinctly understood, at the time, between L. and B. that no property was to pass by the conveyance; that the note was never to be enforced against B., and that D. was to incur no liability by reason of its execution. In 1882 the estates were partitioned amongst L. and the other legatees, and, shortly thereafter, the portion allotted to L., consisting of realty, was sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>under execution, to satisfy Walthew\u2019s claim, which had been reduced to judgment, Walthew becoming the purchaser. This property, which proved insufficient to satisfy Walthew\u2019s claim, was subsequently adjudged to him by decree of the district court. The note was in form negotiable, but was never endorsed. On May 25, 1880, L. having, in the meantime, lost the note, transferred and assigned his interest therein, by a separate writing, to his brother,, who, in like manner, transferred the lost note to S., for value. L.\u2019s brother is not shown to have paid value for the transfer to him.

B. Davis to Alfred N. Lewis, in consideration of property conveyed by the latter to the former with intent to defraud his creditors, and that this intent was known to all parties. They further show that Alfred N. Lewis, after the note was lost, but before its maturity, transferred his interest therein to Charles A. Lewis, who is not shown to have paid value therefor, and that he, after the maturity of the lost note, transferred it to the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">The court below properly held that, under the existing facts, the note was subject to any defense which could have been urged against it in the hands of the person to whom it was originally made payable. The note was negotiable in form, but was not transferred by endorsement, as is necessary to pass the legal title to such paper. It was not in the possession of the party to whom it was made payable, nor is it shown that the person to whom it was assigned before maturity ever paid value for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">It is well settled that, under such facts, it came into the ownership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>of the plaintiff subject to all defenses which the maker of it could urge against it, were it yet in the hands of Alfred H. Lewis, and that he stands charged with notice of the facts which attended its execution. Daniel on Neg. Insts., 741; Trust Co. <em>v. </em>National Bank, 101 U. S. 71; Allum <em>v. </em>Perry, 68 Me. 232; Bank <em>v. </em>Taylor, 100 Mass. 22; Foreman <em>v. </em>Beckwith, 73 Ind. 517; Beard <em>v. </em>Bedolph, 29 Wis. 142; Matteson <em>v. </em>Morris, 40 Mich. 55; Simpson <em>v. </em>Hall, 47 Conn. 417; Terry <em>v. </em>Allis, 16 Wis. 504; Boeka <em>v. </em>Nuella, 28 Mo. 180; Haskell <em>v. </em>Mitchell, 53 Me. 468; Hedges <em>v. </em>Sealy, 9 Barb. 214: Bissell <em>v. </em>Gowdy, 31 Conn. 49; Barlow <em>v. </em>Scott, 12 la. 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Such being the position of the plaintiffs, the court below held that those who represent the maker cannot now assert the illegality of the transaction. That as to them the note is to be deemed a valid instrument, and subject only to such defenses as could be urged against such an instrument in the hands of one holding only the equitable title thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">There are cases which hold that the maker of a note, given for the purchase money of property, which he knew the payee conveyed to him for the purpose of defrauding his creditors, cannot set up the fraudulent character of the transaction as a defense to the note. Amongst them are Carpenter <em>v. </em>McClure, 39 Vt. 9; Davis <em>v. </em>Mitchell, 34 Cal. 81; Dyer <em>v. </em>Horner, 39 Mass. 260; Sherk <em>v. </em>Endress, 3 W. &amp; S. 255; Springer <em>v. </em>Drosch, 32 Ind. 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">These decisions do not recognize any difference between contracts executed and executory, and are based on the language of the statutes declaratory of the illegality of conveyances made to defraud creditors, which, in most of the states, as here, only declare such contracts void as to creditors. Such statutory declaration does not, however, strip such a transaction of its fraudulent character, or give to it standing as a valid contract, which the courts will enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">\u201cThe proposition is universal that no action arises, in equity or at law, from an illegal contract; no suit can be maintained for its specific performance, or to recover the property agreed to be sold or delivered, or the money agreed to be paid, or damages for its violation. \u201d Pomeroy Eq., 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">As between the parties to such a contract, who are in equal fault, no right exists which a court of justice will enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">\u201cIf the contract has been voluntarily executed and performed, a court of equity will not, in the absence of controlling motives of public policy to the contrary, grant its aid by decreeing a recovery back of the money paid or the property delivered, or a cancellation of the conveyance or transfer. As long as the contract is executory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>it cannot be enforced in any kind of an action brought directly upon it. The illegality constitutes an absolute defense. \u2019 \u2019 Pomeroy Eq., 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">And this is so for reasons of public policy, and not from regard for the interest of either party to such a contract. That the contract may have been executed by one party, furnishes no reason why the other should be compelled to execute his part of it yet remaining executory. McCausland <em>v. </em>Ralston, 12 Nev. 195; Briggs <em>v. </em>Merrill, 58 Barb. 399, Nellis <em>v. </em>Clark, 4 Hill 428; s. c. 20, Wend. 24; Norris <em>v. </em>Norris, 9 Dana 318 ; Harvin <em>v. </em>Weeks, 11 Rich. 601; Harwood <em>v. </em>Knapper, 50 Mo. 456; Ager <em>v. </em>Duncan, 50 Cal. 327; Hamilton <em>v. </em>Scull, 25 Mo. 165; Walton <em>v. </em>Lusten, 49 Miss. 576; McClenny <em>v. </em>Floyd, 10 Tex. 166.</p>\n<p id=\"AN4\">Under the findings of fact, and the first conclusion of law reached by the court below, the judgment should have been for the defendants. The judgment will be reversed and here rendered\u2014that the plaintiff take nothing, that the defendants go hence without day and recover of the plaintiff all costs incurred in this court and in the court below. It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Reversed and Rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">[Opinion delivered February 16, 1886.]</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">[Chief Justice Willie did not sit in this cause.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
