Jurisdiction\u2014Appeal from justice\u2019s court\u2014Amount in controversy\u2014The law does not confine the right of appeal from the judgment of a justice\u2019s court to cases in which the judgment is greater than $20.00, but gives it, as well, in cases in which the amount in controversy exceeds that sum (R. S., arts, 1165, 1638), and where, in a suit in a justice\u2019s court, the matter in controversy is not only the amount which the plaintiff claims to be owing him by the defendant, but also the right to establish and foreclose a lien on property to satisfy the same, an appeal may be taken and prosecuted, if the property is of greater value than $20.00, although the judgment may be for a less amount.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b363-14\">2. Same\u2014The jurisdiction of the several courts is determined, in reference to certain classes of cases, by the value of the matter in controversy; but, in some instances, the word \u201camount\u201d is used instead of the word \u201c matter.\u201d These words, however, in the connection in which they are used in the constitution, and in arts. 1165 and 1638, R. S., have the same meaning.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b363-16\">3.

This suit was originally instituted in the justice\u2019s court, precinct Ho. 1, of Jefferson county, March 2, 1885, by George P. Smith, on an open account showing a balance of $14.00 due him, for labor performed in the building of a certain boat, against James Ingalls, Jr., as being individually liable therefor. Plaintiff also sought to foreclose his laborer\u2019s lien under article 3180, Revised Statutes, and for that purpose made the firm of Giles &amp; Sheppard, composed of M. C. Giles and G. B. Wells, parties defendant</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-19\">In the justice\u2019s court judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff, G. P. Smith, against James Ingalls, Jr., for the sum of $14.00, and, as against the firm of Giles &amp; Sheppard, a judgment foreclosing his laborer\u2019s lien, and for all costs of suit, and ordering that the boat be sold, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-20\">On April 27, 1885, the defendants, M. O. Giles and G. B. Wells, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>alleging their firm name to be Giles &amp; Sheppard, filed their petition for <em>certiorari </em>and supersedeas, setting out the above facts, and praying for removal of the cause from the justice\u2019s court to the district court of Jefferson county. On the same day, and in vacation, the district judge of the first judicial district, Hon. W. H. Ford, wrote his order on the back of the petition, commanding the clerk to issue the writ of <em>certiorari </em>and supersedeas, which was accordingly done. On May 11,1885, the plaintiff filed a motion in the district court, to strike out the petition and writ of <em>certiorari </em>in the cause, and also to strike the cause from the docket of the district court, on the following ground :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-5\">\u201cBecause it appears from the petition for certiorari, that the whole amount sued for, and for which judgment was entered in the court below, is only $14.00 and is under $20.00, this court having no jurisdiction to entertain either an appeal or writ of <em>certiorari </em>in this case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-6\">On May 19, 1885, the motion to dismiss came on to be heard, and was overruled by the court, to which ruling the plaintiff excepted, and, on the next day, the cause coming on to be heard, the court entered judgment in favor of plaintiff against James Ingalls, Jr., for the sum of $14.00 and all costs of suit, but further decreed that \u201cM. C. Giles and G. B. Wells go hence without day, and recover of plaintiff their costs in that behalf,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-7\">The property which the plaintiff sought to subject to the satisfaction of his debt, was shown on the trial to be worth $60.00.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-8\">The plaintiff assigned but one error as ground for reversal, which is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-9\">\u201cThe district court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss this cause on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to try the same, in this: that the petition for <em>certiorari </em>showed on its face that the amount involved in the suit, and for which judgment was rendered in the justice\u2019s court, was less than $20.00, to-wit., $14.00. Wherefore appellant asks that the judgment of the district court be reversed and the petition for <em>certiorari </em>be dismissed.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b364-10\"><em>Hal W.

Const., art. 5, sec. 22; Gen. Laws 1879. It is contended that, as the judgment in this case was for only $14.00, an appeal would not lie from the justice\u2019s court.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">This would be true if the sole matter in controversy was only that sum. This question was considered in the case of Brazoria county <em>v. </em>Calhoun, 61 Tex. 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">In that case it was held, that, although a judgment rendered in a justice\u2019s court was for a sum less than $20.00, an appeal could be taken and heard, if the matter in controversy exceeded in value $20.00. The reason for this ruling is given in that case, and conforms to the ruling made by the court of appeals, upon the same question.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">The law now in force does not confine the right to appeal to cases in which the judgment of the justice\u2019s court exceeds $20.00, but gives it when such may be the judgment, or when \u201cthe amount in controversy shall exceed\u201d that sum. R. S., 1165, 1638.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">The matter of controversy between the appellant and appellees was not the sum which the former claimed to be due to him by Ingalls, but the right to establish and foreclose a lien on the boat, which was claimed by appellees. This was shown to be of value greater than $20.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">In Marshall <em>v. </em>Taylor, 7 Tex. 235, it was held, that the matter in controversy was not only the debt, but also the security given for its payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">The jurisdiction of the several courts is determined, in reference to some classes of cases, by the value of the \u201cmatter in controversy;\u201d but in some instances the word \u201camount\u201d is used instead of the word \u201cmatter.\u201d It is believed, however, that the words in the connections in which they are so used in the constitution and in Bevised Statutes, arts. 1165, 1638, are used in the same sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-13\">Any other construction would lead to results evidently never contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-14\">As the value of the boat, on which the appellant sought to establish and foreclose a lien, was greater than $20.00, we are of the opinion that the district court had jurisdiction of the case, on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-15\">There is no assignment of error calling in question the correctness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>of the ruling of the district court in refusing to establish and foreclose a lien on the boat, and the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">[Opinion delivered January 26, 1886.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
