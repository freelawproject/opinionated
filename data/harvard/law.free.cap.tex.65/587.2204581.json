Heidenheimer\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-10\">On September 8, 1883, H. Kempner made and signed a deed in favor of Isaac Heidenheimer to all of the property mentioned in their memorandum of sale of that date, with full warranty of the title. This deed, with sundry papers relating to the title to the property, was handed to the attorney of Heidenheimer for examination, who made objection on the ground that there was then pending, in the district court of Galveston county, a suit involving the title to one of the several lots upon which the hotel was situated. On September 11, 1883, Kempner, having in the meantime duly acknowledged the deed for record, met Heidenheimer and his attorney in the offi.ce of the latter, when, after some discussion in relation to the pending suit affecting the title to one of the lots, and an offer on the part of Kempner to give bond in ten times the amount with such sureties as would be entirely acceptable to Heidenheimer, as a guaranty of the title, Heidenheimer tendered to him a check for $10,000 as the cash payment, and four promissory notes, each for $10,000. Kempner objected to the form of the notes, and Heidenheimer refused to give notes of different form; whereupon the conference ended, and the parties dispersed, Kempner taking with him the deed and Heidenheimer retaining his check and notes. The notes were in form non-negotiable, and this seems to have been Kempner\u2019s objection to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-11\">About a week thereafter, Kempner notified Heidenheimer that he would accept the check and notes previously tendered him, and would deliver the deed, but Heidenheimer refused to have anything further to do with the matter. Kempner was thereupon advised by his attorney that he had two remedies: a resale of the property and suit for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>breach of the contract, in the event of a deficit, or a suit for specific performance of the contract. Accordingly, on September 24, 1888, Kempner instituted suit in the district court of Galveston county, against Heidenheimer, for specific performance of the contract of September 8, 1883, and Heidenheimer appeared and defended, Kempner continuing to collect the rents of the property, which were $12, - 000 per annum, payable in equal monthly installments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-6\">On April 11,1884, Kempner dismissed his suit against Heidenheimer for specific performance, at his own costs, and on the following day he and M. Marx, who owned the other half interest, sold the entire property mentioned in the contract of sale between himself and Heidenheimer, to W. E. Hughes for $75,000, and executed to him a deed therefor. One-fifth of this amount was ready money, and the balance was payable, in equal installments, in one, two, three, four, five and six years, with interest at six per cent..</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-7\">It appears from the judge\u2019s conclusions of facts, that Kempner\u2019s half interest in the property was, on September 8, 1883, and for two or three months thereafter, worth in the market $50,000. He did not, after Heidenheimer\u2019s refusal to comply with the contract, advertise the property for sale or make use of any professional agency in his efforts to sell, nor did he, when about to sell to Hughes, notify Heidenheimer of that fact. On April 28,1884, this suit was instituted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-8\">The defendant answered by demurrer, general denial and by the following special plea: That the plaintiff, if he ever had any right to assert any claim for damages, arising out of the alleged contract and breach thereof, did elect not to assert such right, and did at once, after the alleged breach of contract, elect to assert and did assert and sue this defendant to enforce the specific performance of the contract, breach of which is now ^complained of, and claimed that the property belonged to defendant, and sought \u2018to collect the purchase money therefor as herein stated to have been done by suit in this honorable court, and the same was pending, undisposed of, on issue joined, when plaintiff sold and conveyed, as he states in his petition, the property previously alleged to have belonged to defendant. And, at the time of the alleged failure of defendant to accept and pay for the property, plaintiff notified him that the property had passed to him (defendant,) and that the same would be held out and treated and considered as his (defendants), and that plaintiff would require a specific performance of the alleged contract; and suit was at once instituted against defendant to enforce the contract, and the same was defended by defendant; wherefore plaintiff is estopped to claim damages by reason of the depreciation of the vajue of the property; because plaintiff had no right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>to dispose of the property as he did, except for his own account and to submit to the loss at his own election, and not for account of de iendant, as petition shows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b613-4\">The court overruled the defendant\u2019s demurrer, and, on the trial of the cause, which was without a jury, rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff for one dollar and costs of suit. The plaintiff excepted to the judgment, and has brought the case to this court by writ of error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b613-5\"><em>Davis &amp; Sayles, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afq\">on the measure of damages, cited: Sedg. on Damages, sec. 190, and cases cited: 2 Addison on Cont., sec. 528; Thompkins v.

This value may be fixed by a fair resale, after notice to the party, to be bound by the price as the value, within a reasonable time after the breach. What is a reasonable time is a question of fact, varied by the circumstances of each case. The lapse of snch period as would give room for fluctuations in the market in the ususal order of things, or of such as would authorize the inference that the vendor had elected not to adopt this means of fixing the measure of liability, would be unreasonable. 2 Suth. on Damages, 195, <em>et .seq. </em>To be bound by the price, the defendant should have notice of the sale. The sale is, in some sense, a sale of his property to pay his debt, and, to protect his interest, he is entitled to notice. Bowser v. Cessna, 62 Penn. St. 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">The sale to Hughes was made, without' notice to defendant, pri-' vately, seven months after the defendant\u2019s breach. We think the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>court below did. not err in holding that the defendant was not bound by that sale. In view of the time and manner of the sale, the price realized was not the fixed salable value of the property, but, with its attending circumstances, was merely evidence of such value, to be considered by the trial court in connection with the other evidence bearing upon the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Hot making such sale as was authorized by the defendant\u2019s breach, the plaintiff was only entitled to recover the difference between the market value at the date of defendant\u2019s breach and the price defendant had agreed to pay. It was the duty of the plaintiff to establish these factors in the measure of his damage. The only proof he offered of the market value was that, without advertisement or the use of any professional agency, whilst his suit for specific performance was pending, he sounded such men as he came in contact with, and realized, in the trade with Hughes, the earliest and best price that was possible. The property was not fairly upon the market. There was proof that at the time of the defendant\u2019s refusal to perform, the property was considered of greater value than $50,000. If there was no sufficient evidence that the market value at that time was not equal to the contract price, .there was none establishing a difference, or what the difference was. The plaintiff failed to make out his case for any greater recovery than that awarded in the judgment; and if we sat as a trial court, we cannot perceive in the testimony the supports for a different judgment than that rendered by the court below. The efforts made by plaintiff to sell the property, inconsistently with the objects of the suit then pending, and the sale to Hughes, if all the other testimony is discarded, do not show <em>prima </em>facie, or with any degree of certainty requisite to judicial action, that the market value was less than the contract price.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">There is no error in the record, and the judgment is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">[Opinion delivered March 5, 1886.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
