E. McClinton. The suit was ^prosecuted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>to judgment, attachment lien foreclosed, \u2018and the goods sold and proceeds of sale applied to the payment of the debt Harrison &amp; Eobertson were owing Mayer <em>&amp; </em>Kahn. The goods transferred and levied on was all the property Harrison <em>&amp; </em>Eobertson owned subject to execution. The consideration of the sale to McClinton was $300 due him by them, $29 they owed McClinton Bros., and $500 they owed T. A. Lambeth, and $100 they owed Eppstein, of Sherman, and a note for $494.19 that McClinton executed to Harrison &amp; Eobertson or order, due one day after date, dated June 10,1884, which was paid by McClinton to the payees September 10, 1884. He also paid Eppstein and Lambeth some months after the levy. On the day of the transfer Harrison <em>&amp; </em>Eobertson were indebted to parties around Cooper in small sums, and for attorneys\u2019 fees and court costs, besides the $803 due Mayer &amp; Kahn, $500 due Lambeth, $329 due the McClintons and $150 due Eppstein, in all $1,782. They sold oiit to McClinton at original cost, less carriage of the goods, and $25 off the billiard tables, McClinton buying by the original invoices. The most of the Mayer <em>&amp; </em>Kahn goods were in stock when McClinton purchased. Each of the invoices had the name of the purchaser, date of purchase and. terms printed or Avritten upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-6\">He brought suit against T.

The transaction which resulted in the transfer was single and indivisible, and must stand or fall as a whole. This is the view taken by the court below in the charge to the jury. The court directed the jury to find for the appellee the value of all the goods seized, if they should believe that he purchased them, <em>or any part of </em>them,, in good faith. The goods were paid for by appellee partly in a debt due appellee, partly in the assumption of other debts due by the vendors, and partly in a note made by appellee, payable to the order of the vendors. If the jury believed the transaction was fair and unimpeachable, in so far as by it honest debts of the vendors were paid, and fraudulent as to the part of the consideration received in the form of appellee\u2019s note, still it was their duty, under any fair interpretation of the charge, to find the verdict rendered. The rule is certainly the reverse of that given by the court. Bump, on Fraud. Conv., 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">The exception to the action of the court in refusing to admit testimony as to price realized at the sheriff\u2019s sale of the goods is not reserved in a proper bill, as it does not appear except from the questions what the appellant proposed to prove by the witness. Such testimony as the questions were calculated to elict was admissible. Black <em>v. </em>Sweeney, 63 Tex., 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-10\">The three special charges requested by appellant were properly refused. The case of Seeligson <em>v. </em>Brown 61 Tex., 182, does not support the radical doctrine contained in these charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">The other assignments of error need not be considered. For the error in the charge of the court already pointed out the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">Revebsed and Remanded.'</p>\n<p id=\"b132-13\">[Opinion delivered November 20, 1885.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
