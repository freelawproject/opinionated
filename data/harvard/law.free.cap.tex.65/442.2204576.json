The appellant appealed to the district court, and he was again removed, on the ground that he had misapplied and converted to his own use about $6,000 in United States bonds belonging to the trust estate. The deposed guardian now brings the caseto this court, and asks the reversal of the judgment of the district court, because, he says, the petition on which the proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>ing against Mm was had, was insufficient in law, and the judgment states no ground for his removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The statute authorizes the court, of its own motion, to make the order of removal\u2014it could have proceeded without any petition. The petition complained of may equal but it certainly is not worse than none. The third cause stated in the statute for the removal of a guardian is: \u201cWhen there is good cause to believe that he has misapplied * * property committed to his charge * The court states in the judgment that <em>he has misapplied </em>such property. If so, there is \u201cgood ground for believing\u201d that he has. But the appellant claims that this third ground in the statute applies only to the guardian of estates.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The statute makes no such distinction. The guardian of the person is necessarily entrusted with some portion of the ward\u2019s estate for current needs, and the misappropriation of such part unfits him for Ms office. B. S., art. 2615.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">We think the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">[Opimon delivered February 9, 1886, Chief Justice Willie not sitting.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
