Section 2(d) of Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1052(d), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The products upon which opposer and applicant use their respective marks are different. Applicant\u2019s mark is used on electronic apparatus for gauging and controlling the operation of machine tools. The apparatus is used on a single machine tool, and it consists of individual components all or part of which may be purchased and used, depending upon the degree of automation, and the extent of investment desired. Thus a purchaser may wish to buy only gauging apparatus to guide the manual operation of the machine tool, or he may wish to purchase control apparatus which is actuated by the gauging apparatus to provide a completely automatic operation of the machine tool.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">The nature of applicant\u2019s products is such that they are sold according to the needs and specifications of each individual purchaser. The purchasers of applicant\u2019s apparatus generally are technically skilled, at least in the operation of machine tools. While the cost of these products varies according to the complexity of the system involved, the price may be as much as several thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">Opposer\u2019s products are, primarily, mercury switches, which vary in construction, to be actuated by a variety of means including temperature, pressure, light, magnetic force, fluid level and the like. The evidence indicates that op-poser now has about twenty-five basic lines of controls, of which there are thousands of variations. These controls and switches are ordered by specification and vary in price which sometimes is as high as several hundred dollars. Although opposer\u2019s advertising indicates that all of its products contain mercury switches, the description of the goods in the registrations are not so limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">The goods to which applicant\u2019s and op-poser\u2019s marks are to be applied, as exemplified by the evidence of present use, represent two specialized lines of equipment. Applicant\u2019s product is electrically operated apparatus designed specifically to measure or guide, or both, the operation of a machine tool. Op-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>poser\u2019s products are highly specialized industrial switches designed to be actuated in various ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">However, while acknowledging the differences between the products, it seems clear that the goods are of such a nature that it would not be unreasonable to suppose that one manufacturer would have produced all of them. That being the case, the differences between the goods of the parties are not of determinative legal significance so far as the present issue is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">While the parties do not sell their goods to the same customers in all eases, their markets overlap to a significant degree. Therefore, for the purposes of determining the issues here presented, we shall consider it on the presumption that there will be common purchasers of MERCONTROLS and MICROtrols. Such purchasers are likely to be engineers or skilled artisans who in the purchase of the products will order the particular product required to meet precise specifications required by the particular use to which the device is to be put. Frequently considerable expense will be involved in the purchase. We find, therefore, that the purchasers of applicant\u2019s and op-poser\u2019s products will be discriminating purchasers. National Motor Bearing Co., Inc. v. James-Pond-Clark, 266 F.2d 799, 46 CCPA 877, 882.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">What, then, is likely to be the response of such purchasers to the marks here in issue? Applicant\u2019s mark is the obvious combination of the word \u201cmicro\u201d with the last syllable of \u201ccontrol.\u201d Thus, it describes the hoped-for operation of applicant\u2019s product. While we follow the rule that trademarks should not be dissected, but should be dealt with as a whole, that doctrine does not blind the court to those parts of the whole which will be immediately recognized by every English-speaking person in the market place. Sealy, Inc. v. Simmons Co., 265 F.2d 934, 46 CCPA 857, 862. The word \u201cmicro\u201d though derived from the Greek and once used chiefly by scientists, has almost become a household word in our age of precision technology to indicate small measurements. The suffix \u201ctrol\u201d is the same as the suffix of the descriptive word \u201ccontrol.\u201d We think, therefore, the word MICROtroI, would suggest to a machinist, or to an engineer working in these areas, the meaning of a control operated to \u201cmicro\u201d tolerances.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Opposer relies upon three marks, the first of which is MERCOID. This mark consists of the prefix MERC as in mercury, and the suffix \u201cOID\u201d meaning \u201clike\u201d or \u201crelated to.\u201d As applied to op-poser\u2019s goods, the mark MERCOID is but slightly suggestive. The second of op-poser\u2019s marks is MERCOID CONTROL in the globe design, and the third is the obvious contraction of the second, namely : MERCONTROL. In these cases, the prefix \u201cmere\u201d in each instance appears to have its origin in the mercury switches which opposer features in its advertising as a part of its controls. It seems to us likely, therefore, that the purchaser will associate the prefix\u2019 of opposer\u2019s marks with the word mercury and that as such it is a distinctive association quite different from the likely association with the prefix \u201cmicro\u201d of applicant\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">As between MERCOID and MICRO-troI, there is no similarity. They neither look alike, sound alike nor evoke similar mental associations. The same is true-of the MERCOID CONTROL mark and MICROtroI. There remains MERCON-TROL which bears a closer visual and auricular similarity to MICROtroI.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">However, for the reasons previously set. out in detail we do not believe that it is likely the potential purchasers of the-products of these parties will be confused as to the origin of those products by such tenuous similarities between marks, which are so obviously different.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">We therefore affirm the decision of the-Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b243-24\">.
