United States Senior District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, designated to participate <em>in place of Judge O\u2019OONNELL, </em>pursuant to provisions of Section 294(d), Title 28 UJ3.C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AXn\">RICH, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b653-19\">Application was made by appellee to register \u201cTechnograph\u201d on the Principal Register as a trademark for \u201cPencils, leads and lead-holders,\u201d based on Swiss registration No. 150752 of 14 April 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-20\">Appellant opposed the registration on the basis of ownership of Reg. No. 375,022 of Feb. 6, 1940, \u201cTeehnicrayon\u201d for \u201cpencils of all kinds\u201d and Reg. No. 558,728, May 13, 1952, \u201cTeehniflex\u201d for \u201ccolored pencils,\u201d and also asserted that Reg. No. 613,177, Sept. 27,1955, \u201cRapido-graph\u201d for \u201cball-point pens, fountain pens, mechanical pencils,\u201d issued to Koh-I-Noor Pencil Company, Inc., was \u201cowned by opposer\u2019s related company.\u201d Opposer alleged confusing similarity of the mark sought to be registered to the above registered marks and damage through likelihood of confusion of the purchasing public.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-21\">No testimony was taken but a stipulation of facts was filed on behalf of op-poser containing, inter alia, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-22\">\u201c3. Opposer, L. &amp; C. Hardtmuth, Inc., and Koh-I-Noor Pencil Company, Inc., (a corporation organized under the laws of the State of New York), are related companies in that they both have substantially the same stockholders; have the same Directors and officers; and occupy the same premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-23\">The stipulation also states that op-poser, Hardtmuth, acquired an exclusive license on February 7, 1957, from Technicolor Corporation (formerly Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation) owner of Reg. No. 346,321 of May 18, 1937 and Reg. No. 658,522 of Feb. 18, 1958 \u201cfor the trademark \u2018Technicolor\u2019 in respect of pencils,\u201d authorizing it to use that mark for pencils and related goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, in dismissing the opposition, held (123 USPQ 546) that notwithstanding the stipulation, Koh-I-Noor was not a \u201crelated company\u201d within the meaning of the trademark act and that use by one company would not inure to the benefit of the other, and restricted the issue to opposer\u2019s \u201cTechnicrayon\u201d and \u201cTech-niflex\u201d registered marks and the likelihood of confusion with respect thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">While opposer raised all issues by its reasons of appeal, its brief presents but one issue, stated thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">\u201cDoes the trademark Technograph so resemble Technicrayon or Techni-fiex, when used with the identical goods, namely pencils, as to be likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Since no other issue is argued in the brief, we shall regard all others as abandoned and confine our discussion accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Applicant admits identity of goods, at least in part, and opposer\u2019s priority. It argues that the marks, considered as a whole as they must be, do not look alike, sound alike, or have the same meaning. Opposer, of course, says there is similarity of sound, appearance, and meaning. Discussion of these points would be futile except that mention should perhaps be made of opposer\u2019s argument based on meaning to the effect that \u201cgraph\u201d is, in one sense, a combining form indicative of writing and that a crayon is a writing instrument. This argument apparently failed to impress the board and it does not much impress us. People standing at counters selecting pencils are not likely to be pondering such semantic niceties.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">Opposer makes one point not mentioned by the board, though probably taken into account by it, namely, that pencils are cheap and bought by all kinds of people. We must proceed on that assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">The board, after coming to a conclusion as to what the final issue must be was very brief in deciding it and stating its reasons. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-11\">\u201cConsidering the nature of the marks when applied to the goods, it is concluded that the resemblance is not such as to cause confusion, mistake or deception with resultant damage to opposer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">With the more precise statutory question in our minds as to whether there is a <em>likelihood </em>of confusion, we are of the opinion that the resemblance in the marks is such that if they were to be used on similar pencils there would be such likelihood.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-13\">Whatever may be said about the right hand ends of the marks, there is substantial identity in the left hand ends. \u201cTechni-\u201d or \u201cTechno-\u201d appears to be quite arbitrary as applied to pencils and there is but an insignificant difference between the tw\u00f3 forms. It seems to us to be the striking or conspicuous or dominant portion of all of the marks as well as the portion of greatest trademark significance. \u201cCrayon,\u201d at least, is purely descriptive. Additionally we have here the circumstance that opposer has two \u201cTechni-\u201d marks for pencils and \u201cTech-nograph\u201d pencils might be thought to be an addition to the line.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-14\">Applicant is the newcomer by admission and must bear the burden of staying clear of opposer\u2019s.established rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-15\">The decision dismissing the opposition is <em>reversed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-16\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-17\">KIRKPATRICK, Senior District Judge, dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
