Counts 1 and 2 related to sales and concealment and transportation on April 9, 1959, and counts 3 and 4 related to receiving and concealing heroin and marijuana on April 17, 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-21\">The Government\u2019s proof in respect to counts 3 and 4 included the introduction in evidence against the appellant of narcotic drugs seized on April 17, 1959 at appellant\u2019s home at the time of his arrest. Claiming that the arrest and entry into his home was in violation of his constitutional rights, the appellant prior to trial moved to suppress the evidence thus seized. His motion was denied and the narcotics thus obtained were introduced at his trial. These exhibits had <em>nothing </em>to do with the proof of the Government on counts 1 and 2. He was found guilty on all four counts and received prison sentences on each count, all such sentences being for the same period of time and to run concurrently. Upon this appeal appellant\u2019s contention is error in failing to suppress the evidence mentioned, and the receipt of same at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-22\">Since the claimed error in no manner affects appellant\u2019s conviction under the first two counts, it is plain that he has no standing to assert errors which at best could only affect counts 3 and 4. Sinclair v. United States, 279 U.S. 263, 299, 49 S.Ct. 268, 73 L.Ed. 692; Winger v. United States, 9 Cir., 233 F.2d 440; King v. United States, 9 Cir., 279 F.2d 342, 344. Appellant asserts that the error in receiving the physical evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>in support of the charges under counts 3 and 4 may have had an adverse effect upon the jury, in arriving at their verdict upon counts 1 and 2. There is no authority for that position. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
