If we find upon reading the record that the evidence on behalf of the Secretary demanded findings of fact that there had been violations, then it is our plain duty to reverse the judgment for a correction of the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Even though we arrive at a conclusion, however, that the evidence demands a finding that violations occurred, it does not follow, as a matter of course, that we should order an injunction to issue. The Secretary recognizes this, but insists that this is a case in which the court should coerce the discretion of the trial judge. See Mitchell v. Hausman, 5 Cir., 261 F.2d 778, 780; Mitchell v. Blanchard, 5 Cir., 272 F.2d 574; and Mitchell v. Strickland Transp. Co., 5 Cir., 267 F.2d 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Dealing first with the fact issue, we are forced to the conclusion that there were several clear violations of the minimum wage or overtime pay provisions of the Act. It was not disputed that the appellee paid the two Grant brothers a monthly salary regardless of the number of hours worked. Moreover, it was not disputed that one of the employees worked more than 75 hours a week for $300 a month flat salary. The minimum salary for <em>four weeks </em>at 75 hours a week would be $370.00 \u2014 for a 30-day month it would run to approximately $400 at the minimum rate. See Walling v. A. H. Belo Corp., 316 U.S. 624, 62 S.Ct. 1223, 86 L.Ed. 1716.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-16\">Another employee testified that he had trouble upon submitting his first time sheet because Thompson said he wouldn\u2019t settle for over twelve hours a round trip.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This was not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-17\">As to those items, it seems clear that there were direct violations of the wage provisions of the law. The findings of the court that there were no violations amounts to giving the appellee clear sailing to continue the practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-18\">A further fact should have been, but was not, made the basis of positive findings by the court. It was testified that several employees who were paid only at the end of the month (even those who were paid hourly wages received only one monthly payment) were in need of advances. Advances were made by the wife of Thompson\u2019s brother. The brother was an employee of Thompson\u2019s and helped him operate his many businesses. For each dollar of advance made <em>there was deducted </em>from the pay <em>by Thompson </em>at the end of the month 10 cents on the dollar <em>for </em>whatever <em>period </em>was covered by the advance \u2014 an annual rate of a minimum of 120%. The pay from which this deduction was taken was at the statutory minimum of $1.00 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-19\">The trial court made no findings as to whether the deduction <em>by the employer </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>of this illegal rate of interest amounted to a withholding of part of the statutory-minimum wages, although the facts as to the loans were undisputed. See Walling v. Peavy-Wilson Lumber Co., D.C. W.D.La., 49 F.Supp. 846, 890.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Finally, as to the findings of facts, the trial court failed to make findings as to the keeping of the records prescribed by the regulations. It seems undisputed that no proper records were kept, since there was no daily record of hours worked. The Secretary is entitled to have a finding of the court on this matter as well. Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., 328 U.S. 680, 687, 66 S.Ct. 1187, 90 L.Ed. 1515.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The need for specific findings of fact and a determination that those which are illegal are in violation of the Act is demonstrated by this record. It was shown that the defendant had a record of several past investigations resulting in findings of deficiencies. Evidence of others was tendered but refused admission in evidence because not within the statutory period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Now unless the court makes specific findings, the respondent can feel free to continue all the allegedly illegal practices which have been the subject of this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">While we fully recognize that the first decision as to the issuing of .an injunction is for the trial judge to make, Mitchell v. Hodges Contracting Co., 5 Cir., 238 F.2d 380; Walling v. Florida Hardware Co., 5 Cir., 142 F.2d 444, we have not hesitated to hold in a clear case that the denial of injunctive relief was error. Mitchell v. Hausman, supra; Mitchell v. Blanchard, supra; Mitchell v. Strickland Transp. Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Here we think the trial court should first make the proper findings and permit the introduction of such legal evidence as the parties may consider appropriate, touching on the prior record of the respondent\u2019s compliance, and then in light of the principles announced in the decided cases, make its determination as to the granting or withholding of an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">The judgment is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\">.

And what happened when you submitted it? A. Well, he said it had too many hours, and he wouldn\u2019t settle for over twelve hours a round trip. He said if I kept it under twelve hours I wouldn\u2019t have any trouble.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-21\">\u201cQ. Were you told that? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-22\">\u201cQ. Who told you? A. Mr. Thompson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-23\">\u201cQ. He told you that you wouldn\u2019t be paid for over twelve hours? A. That\u2019s right.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b477-9\">. The trial court should have received evidence of any such investigations in connection with its duty to determine whether to grant an injunction. This is the only purpose for which the Secretary sought to introduce this evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
