Assisting in the unloading at the time was an employee of Publishers\u2019 who was using an overhead traveling crane to lift the tanks from the truck. In the operation of that crane one of the tanks swung against Christian, injuring him. Christian sued Publishers\u2019 and its employee for injuries alleged to have been caused by their negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-13\">It is conceded that any liability on the part of Publishers\u2019 was covered under either policy. Not only would such liability come within the policy of appellee Peerless which had promised to pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured should become obligated to pay by reason of liability imposed by law because of bodily injury, but wholly apart from the Peerless liability the Travelers\u2019 policy covered this liability also.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-15\">Travelers\u2019 policy provided that \u201cuse of an automobile includes the loading and unloading thereof\u201d. It also contained a definition of persons insured under the policy as follows: \u201cWith respect to insurance for bodily injury liability * * * the unqualified word \u2018insured\u2019 includes the named insured and also includes any person while using an owned automobile or a hired automobile and any person or organization legally responsible for the use thereof, provided the actual use of the automobile is by the named insured or with his permission. * * * \u201d An \u201cowned automobile\u201d was defined as an automobile owned by the named insured and \u201cautomobile\u201d was defined as including any land motor vehicle or trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-16\">The policy contained a further provision which while not at this stage insisted upon as determinative of liability, has another significance which will presently appear. That further provision is found in the statement that: \u201cThis policy does not apply: (f) under Coverage A [bodily injury] to any obligation for which the insured or any carrier as his insurer may be held liable under any workmen\u2019s compensation, unemployment compensation or disability benefits law, or under any similar law. (g) under Coverage A, except with respect to liability assumed by the insured under a conti\u2019aet as defined herein, to bodily injury or sickness, disease or death of any employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of his employment by the insured. * * <em>&gt;9</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-18\">At the' trial Travelers argued that clauses (f) and (g), supra, operated to eliminate any coverage on its part for the accident mentioned here since Christian was an employee of the named insured, St. Johns. But such contention has been abandoned and is not made upon this appeal. It therefore appears that the basis of Travelers\u2019 responsibility stems from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>the fact that Publishers\u2019 employee in unloading the St. Johns\u2019 truck was using the same and since it was thus using it with the permission of the \u201cnamed insured\u201d, Publishers\u2019 was included under the above quoted definition of persons insured under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">The court below held not only that Travelers\u2019 policy furnished coverage but under the facts of this case that coverage was \u201cprimary\u201d, and that the policy of Peerless was merely \u201cexcess\u201d insurance above all other applicable insurance; Peerless had defended the action brought by Christian against Publishers\u2019 in an Oregon court after first tendering the defense to Travelers. It settled the action with Christian by payment to him. The court held that Peerless was now entitled to judgment against Travelers for the amount paid on the settlement together with its costs and attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in connection therewith.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">On this appeal the appellant\u2019s first contention is that it did not become liable for the defense of the action by Christian or for settlement of his claim because of a failure to give it notice of the accident as required by its policy. The policy provision here referred to was as follows: \u201cWhen an accident occurs written notice shall be given by or on behalf of the insured * * * as soon as practicable. Such notice shall contain particulars sufficient to identify the insured and also reasonably obtainable information respecting the time, place and circumstances of the accident, the names and addresses of the injured and of available witnesses.\u201d The trial court found that notice to Travelers was given \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d, and that the requirements of this condition of the policy had been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The evidence shows that shortly after the accident which occurred on June 19, 1957, one Ross, an employee of a concern known as \u201cIndustrial Claims Service\u201d, which did the adjusting for Peerless, began an investigation of the accident. He knew nothing about the Travelers\u2019 policy and it did not then occur to him that there might be coverage in any other policy. Shortly before July 22, 1957, Ross sent a preliminary report of the accident to the underwriters for Peerless in San Francisco. Under date of July 22, 1957, they wrote to Industrial Claims Service acknowledging the report and stating: \u201cWe are curious to know if you have considered that this loss may actually be under the automobile policy for the truck owned by the St. Johns Motor Express, under the loading and unloading provisions of the policy.\u201d They suggested that Ross\u2019 concern \u201clook into this matter very carefully.\u201d Ross called St. Johns and inquired of the person in charge there the name of the company which had insured the St. Johns truck and learned that it was Travelers. He also learned the name of the agent who had written the policy for Travelers. He called him inquiring about \u201cthe matter of the accident and who I should report it to and about their claims department\u201d, and it was suggested that he contact the claims manager of Travelers, one Johnson. Ross called Johnson, gave him a brief summary of what had occurred at the time of the accident, of how it happened, and inquired about the benefits and coverage under their policy for a loading operation. Ross also mentioned that he understood that the insured man was covered under State Workmen\u2019s Compensation. He was told by Johnson that Travelers\u2019 policy would not apply under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">Ross accepted that statement and did nothing more about notifying Travelers and no formal written notice was given to Travelers until the following March 20, 1958. At that time Industrial Claims Service wrote to Travelers giving the circumstances, date and particulars of the accident to Christian and stating their understanding that Travelers\u2019 policy covered and would be primary coverage inasmuch as Publishers\u2019 was an additional insured under the Travelers\u2019 policy. The letter stated that on behalf of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>Publishers\u2019 and Peerless, \u201cwe are tendering this case to you\u201d. At that time no action had been filed by Christian but the letter informed Travelers the name of the Attorney representing Christian. Christian\u2019s action against Publishers\u2019 was filed approximately five months later on August 27, 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">The record does not show the exact date on which Ross made his inquiry of Johnson about Travelers\u2019 coverage. Ross testified that he talked to Johnson about the same time that he had talked to the representative of St. Johns inquiring about the name of the latter\u2019s insurance company. Hence it can be inferred that substantially immediately following the inquiry of St. Johns, Ross had his conversation with Mr. Johnson. The representative of St. Johns, with whom Ross talked, was asked when the inquiry was made of him as to whether St. Johns had a policy of insurance, and he replied that he could not give the date other than to say that \u201cIt was probably in July or August. It was sometime within the next couple of months after the accident.\u201d Two months after the accident would be August 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">It will be noted that we are considering here two different periods which elapsed. The first is the period from the date of the accident, June 19, to the date of the telephone call. The inquiry is whether at the date of such call, perhaps as late as August 19, so much time had elapsed as to release Travelers for want of notice up to that time. The condition as to notice above quoted states the notice shall be given \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d. The parties here concede that the trial court was correct in stating that the requirement meant that notice should be given \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">In view of the fact that neither Ross, the adjustor, nor Publishers\u2019, knew initially that the Travelers\u2019 policy existed, and that the first time either of them was alerted to the fact that there might be such a policy was when Ross received from the underwriters at San Francisco their letter of July 22, 1957, it would appear to follow that failure to give notice prior to that time would be altogether excusable and the whole question as to this period remains whether or not the delay beginning July 22, 1957, to the following August 19 (assuming the telephone call was that late), would be more than a reasonable time under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">We think that it is not permitted to us to reject the finding of fact of the trial court which in substance amounted to a finding that there was not here an unreasonable delay; and that on the other hand, the telephone call to Johnson referred to came within a reasonable time. At that time we must agree Travelers\u2019 obligation had not been terminated. Of course both Ross and the representatives of Publishers\u2019 might have known that since St. Johns was a certified public carrier it must have been required to furnish liability insurance. But we agree with the trial judge that this does not render invalid the finding of the court that the date of the telephone call must have come within what under the circumstances was a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">The next period of time involved is the further period from the date of the telephone call to Johnson to March 20, 1958, when a formal written notice was given. Plainly enough, so far as Ross was concerned he accepted at face value Johnson\u2019s statement that Travelers\u2019 policy did not cover this accident because the injured party was an employee of the named insured in Travelers\u2019 policy and he was covered under Workmen\u2019s Compensation. Now apparently the appellant argues that Ross should not have accepted that assurance of Mr. Johnson but should have looked the matter up for himself.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Johnson was Chief Claim Agent for Travelers and had been with the company for 22 years. It is not important whether this argument comes with good grace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>from Travelers; what is important is that this assurance of non-coverage is a circumstance attending this period of delay, a circumstance which bears upon the reasonableness of the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Also to be considered is the fact that at the time in question it was not altogether certain that Johnson was not right and that the clause previously quoted to the effect that the policy did not apply to the injury to an employee of the insured did not bar recovery against Travelers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As a matter of fact that very question was the subject of extensive litigation then pending in the courts of Oregon which finally resulted in that court\u2019s decision in September, 1960, in Cimarron Insurance Co. v. Travelers Insurance Co., Or., 355 P.2d 742. The Cimarron company contended that under facts similar to those present here, where the negligence was not that of the \u201cnamed insured\u201d, the employee of a trucking company was excluded from that company\u2019s policy coverage because of a clause similar to those referred to by Johnson, (clauses (f) and (g), quoted above) in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Only after the decision of the Supreme Court of Oregon on September 28, 1960, was it established that the injury to the employee was within the coverage of the truck company\u2019s policy since the exclusion clause of the policy which denied liability for an injury to \u201cany employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of his employment by the insured\u201d did not apply in that case since the injured man was not an employee of the person who was an \u201cinsured\u201d under an omnibus clause. It was only then that Travelers conceded that the same rule must be applied to its policy here.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">We are of the opinion therefore that when the trial judge held that it was reasonable for the adjusters for Peerless and for Publishers\u2019 to take Johnson at his word and to pursue the matter no further, his finding in this respect could not be said to be clearly erroneous and that the record justifies the finding of fact that due notice was given which means that notice was given within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">What is reasonable depends upon the surrounding circumstances and the outstanding circumstance here is the very difficulty and indefiniteness of the legal problem that the adjuster had to answer before he could be alerted to the possibility of there being coverage under the Travelers\u2019 policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">Appellant argues that the question whether the requirement of notice was satisfied does not under the facts of this case present a question of fact but rather one of law. It is said that before the telephone call to Johnson several weeks elapsed and that this court is as able to calculate what that time was as was the trial court; and that whether Travelers\u2019 responsibility under the policy had then terminated can be determined by this court as well as by the trial court since we do not deal here with the question of- credibility of any witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">We think that the problem of reasonable time is like the problem of reasonable care \u2014 a question of fact, although it involves the drawing of inferences from other facts. The \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d rule of United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746; \u201capplies also to the factual inferences from undisputed basic facts.\u201d Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Duberstein, 363 U.S. 278, 291, 80 S.Ct. 1190, 1200, 4 L.Ed.2d 1218. See Greene-Haldeman v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 282 F.2d 884, 890, (concurring opinion). Even where the basic facts are stipulated, this court has held that findings of fact by the trial court might not be disturbed on appeal. Randall Foundation, Inc. v. Riddell, 9 Cir., 244 F.2d 803, 805; Azevedo v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 246 F.2d 196, 197. Cf. Lassiter v. Guy F. Atkinson Co., 9 Cir., 176 F.2d 984, 993, 21 A.L.R.2d 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-11\">Another significant reason why the lapse of time between the date of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>the telephone call to Johnson and the actual written notice to Travelers cannot operate to bar recovery here is found in the common rule, applicable to all insurance, that if an insurer denies liability to the insured on grounds other than those relating to defects in the notice, compliance with the requirements as to notice and proof of loss will be deemed waived.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Such is the established rule in the state of Oregon. Ringo v. Automobile Ins. Co., 143 Or. 420, 22 P.2d 887, 889. Eaid v. National Casualty Co., 122 Or. 547, 259 P. 902, 906.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">We hold therefore that the trial court did not err in holding that the defense of want or insufficiency of notice was not available to the appellant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">This brings us to the question whether the trial court was correct in holding that Travelers\u2019 policy afforded the primary coverage for the accident involved in this case; that Peerless\u2019 policy was excess insurance, and that Peerless was entitled to recover its expenditures in settling and defending the action brought against Publishers\u2019. The answer to this must be determined by an examination of the provisions of the respective policies relating to \u201cother insurance\u201d. The \u201cother insurance\u201d clause of Peerless\u2019 policy provides as follows: \u201cIf the insured has other insurance against the loss covered by this policy, the company shall not be liable under this policy for a greater proportion of such loss than the applicable limits of liability stated in the declarations bear to the total applicable limit of liability of all valid and collectible insurance against such loss; provided, however, that the insurance under this policy shall be excess insurance with respect to loss against which the named insured has other insurance disclosed to the company as in effect on the effective date of this policy and upon the basis of which the premium for the insurance under this policy is modified, but in such event the insurance under this policy shall apply only in the amount by which the applicable limit of liability stated in the declarations exceeds the applicable limit of liability of such other insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">\u201cWith respect to any valid and collectible insurance covering automobiles not owned by or registered in the name of the named insured and which extends to the benefit of the named insured, the insurance under this policy shall be excess insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">The significant portion of this provision is found in the last paragraph quoted above. It will be recalled that this is a provision of the Peerless policy and that the \u201cnamed insured\u201d under that policy is Publishers\u2019. The meaning of this last paragraph therefore is as follows: \u201cWith respect to any valid and collectible insurance (Travelers\u2019 policy) covering automobiles (the St. Johns\u2019 truck) not \u25a0 owned by or registered in the name of the named insured (Publishers\u2019) and which extends to the benefit of the named insured (Publishers\u2019) the insurance under this policy shall be excess insurance.\u201d The meaning of this obviously is that since the insurance of Travelers covered an automobile which was not owned by Publishers, the insurance under the Peerless policy was to be deemed excess. The policy limits per person under Travelers was $100,000. Since the amount here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>involved is .much less than that, if this provision of the Peerless policy is given effect, it means that Peerless was responsible for no amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The \u201cother insurance\u201d clause of the Travelers\u2019 policy is quite similar. It provides: \u201cIf the insured has other insurance against a loss covered by this policy the company shall not be liable under this policy for a greater proportion of such loss than the applicable limit of liability stated in the declarations bears to the total applicable limit of liability of all valid and collectible insurance against such loss; provided, however, the insurance under this policy with respect to loss arising out of the maintenance or use of any hired automobile insured on a cost of hire basis or the use of any non-owned automobile shall be excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">It should be noted that the last portion of that paragraph recites that Travelers\u2019 insurance shall be excess when there has been a loss arising out of the use of a \u201cnon-owned automobile\u201d which loss is covered \u201cby other valid and collectible insurance.\u201d But the vehicle referred to in this Travelers\u2019 policy is not a \u201cnon-owned automobile\u201d and in view of the provisions we have noted above as contained in the Peerless policy, that policy did not provide in respect to this loss \u201cother valid and collectible insurance.\u201d For this reason the Travelers\u2019 insurance is not excess.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">However the first portion of the quoted clause down to the semicolon requires consideration here. That is the provision that if the insured has other insurance Travelers shall not be liable for more than its stated proportion of the loss, that is to say, pro rata, based on the applicable limit of liability of all \u201cvalid and collectible insurance.\u201d What we have then is one policy (Peerless) which describes its liability as \u201cexcess\u201d and another policy (Travelers\u2019) which provides that it shall be liable only \u201cpro rata\u201d based on the limits of liability of all \u201cvalid and collectible insurance^\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">This sort of contest between the issuers of two such policies, one providing that its coverage is \u201cexcess\u201d and the other providing that its insurance pays \u201cpro rata\u201d, has arisen in a substantial number of cases in jurisdictions elsewhere. Many of these cases are cited in Citizens Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 6 Cir., 273 F.2d 189. There the court said (at page 193): \u201cThe foregoing authorities represent the overwhelming majority view that when an excess clause in one automobile liability insurance policy conflicts with another \u2018other insurance\u2019 clause, and more particularly a \u2018pro-rata\u2019 clause, in a second policy, the excess clause controls and is to be given its full effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">The reasoning upon which such a conclusion is reached, as noted in that case, is substantially as follows: When one policy contains an adequate \u201cexcess\u201d insurance clause it cannot be considered to be other \u201cvalid and collectible insurance against such loss\u201d. Hence there is nothing on which the pro rata clause of the other policy may operate. In Citizens Mutual, supra, the Liberty Mutual policy contained an applicable excess clause which the court says was \u201cthe only liability to which appellee was subject.\u201d The Citizens Mutual policy was the one which contained the pro rata clause. Since the Liberty Mutual policy was excess the court noted that \u201cThe Currie Co. did not have \u2018other insurance against the loss\u2019 covered by the Citizens Mutual policy, as the only other insurance it had did not become effective until the exhaustion of the Citizens Mutual policy limits. For that reason the pro-rata clause of the Citizens Mutual policy did not apply and it was liable to the full extent of its policy limits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">If similar reasoning were followed here, we would say that Travelers pro rata provision did not come into effect because Travelers had a policy limit of $100,000 which exceeded the amount of the loss in this particular case, and since Peerless\u2019 insurance would not be \u201cvalid and collectible insurance\u201d until that policy limit were exhausted, there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>\"other insurance\u201d as to which the pro rata provision could be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Another respectable authority which adopts a similar line of reasoning and reaches a similar conclusion is American Automobile Ins. Co. v. Republic Indem. Co., 52 Cal.2d 507, 341 P.2d 675. We think that it cannot be said that those decisions are without logical basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Plainly the trial court adopted that view of this case in holding that Travelers was .liable for the entire loss. However, a few weeks after the trial court had filed its opinion in this case, the Supreme Court of Oregon handed down its decision in Lamb-Weston, Inc. v. Oregon Automobile Insurance Co., 219 Or. 110, 341 P.2d 110. That also was a case in which two automobile insurance companies, one referred to by the court as the St. Paul and the other referred to as the Oregon Company were contesting as in this case their respective responsibilities for the liability incurred in an automobile accident.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Lamb-Weston had been using a truck leased from one Shafer. St. Paul had issued its policy to Lamb-Weston as the named insured. The Oregon Company had issued its policy against liability for property damage to Shafer. This policy contained an omnibus clause which operated to extend coverage to any person using the truck with Shafer\u2019s permission. The St. Paul policy contained the following provision: \u201cIf the insured\u2019s liability under this policy is covered by any other valid and collectible insurance, then this policy shall act as excess insurance over and above such other insurance.\u201d In that respect the St. Paul policy resembled the Peerless policy here. The Oregon policy contained a provision' similar to the pro rata clause of Travelers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">The Oregon court held that the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in these two policies were repugnant to each other; that they must both be ignored, and that the loss must be prorated. In arriving at that conclusion the court reviewed many cases from other states which adopted various approaches to the solution of this sort of question and then turned to the decision of this court in Oregon Auto. Ins. Co. v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 195 F.2d 958, from which it quoted at considerable length and with approval. That was a case where each policy provided that under the circumstances there present, it should be excess only. It was held the policies were in this respect \u201cmutually repugnant\u201d and hence these \u201cexcess\u201d provisions must be disregarded.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-14\">The Oregon court, adopting a similar approach to the facts of its case, which it thought involved a direct conflict between the clauses of the respective policies, said:</p>\n<p id=\"b803-15\"><em>\u201cIt </em>is, therefore, at once apparent from a consideration of the above policy pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>visions that each company by its \u2018other insurance\u2019 clause seeks to limit its liability if other insurance is available to pay a part or all of an insured\u2019s loss. This is demonstrated by the fact that St. Paul provides that its policy can only be treated as \u2018excess insurance over and above\u2019 other \u2018valid and collectible insurance,\u2019 and the Oregon policy can be treated only as paying a proportionate share if there is other \u2018valid and collectible insurance\u2019 against such loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">\u201cIt is also clear that as between the companies themselves no determination of whether or not there is other valid and collectible insurance can be established without first deciding which company is primarily and which secondarily liable, for St. Paul says it will pay only the excess after the limits of the Oregon policy are exhausted, and Oregon says, since there is other insurance, it will pay only a proportionate share of the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">\u201cThus, in such a situation, the court is faced with determining which company shall be considered primarily liable, or treating the \u2018other insurance\u2019 clause in each insurer\u2019s policy as so repugnant that they must both be ignored, and apply the rule that the loss shall be equally prorated between them.\u201d Upon rehearing the court held that the loss instead of being equally divided should be prorated on the basis of the coverage furnished by the two policies. Lamb-Weston, Inc. v. Oregon Automobile Ins. Co., 346 P.2d 643. See, also, General Accident, Fire &amp; Life Assur. Corp. v. Continental Casualty Co., 9 Cir., 287 F.2d 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Since of course we are governed by the Oregon law in this case, the Lamb-Weston case, supra, of whose decision the district court did not have the advantage, is necessarily controlling here. Accordingly, the judgment of the court below must be modified by reducing the recovery of Peerless to a percentage of the total loss paid by it. The Peerless policy provided limits of $250,000 for bodily injury to one person; Travelers\u2019 policy provided $100,000. Travelers should pay that proportion of the total loss which $100,000 bears to $350,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The case is remanded to the district court with directions to modify the judgment by reducing the amount of recovery accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-9\">. By supplemental complaint Peerless added to its original prayer for declaratory relief, \u2022 one for money judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b799-11\">. Johnson testified that he had no recollection whatever of any such telephone call, but it was within the competence of the trial judge to find, as he did, that this conversation occurred,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b800-12\">. And in the court below Travelers still contended that it had this defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b801-10\">. See Couch on Insurance, 2nd Ed., \u00a7 26.305: \u201cIf the insurer denies liability to the insured on grounds other than the sufficiency, lateness, or absence of notice or proof of loss, compliance with the requirements as to notice and proof of loss are waived, for the insurer having raised one objection or certain objections is deemed to have raised all that exist, and good faith prohibits it from thereafter raising any others. To illustrate, if the insurer has denied liability on the policy on the ground that it has been canceled it waives the failure to comply with the requirement of written notice and proofs of loss and waives any defect in the proof which has been delivered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-13\">The author cites in this section numerous decisions illustrating that rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b801-14\">. This rule was stated and recognized in the recent case of Grau v. Northwest Mutual Insurance Co., Or., 350 P.2d 1082, 1084, where other Oregon cases are cited. The rule itself is not applied because of special facts of that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b803-8\">. The suit against the Oregon Company was brought by both the insured, Lamb-Weston, and St. Paul, as Lamb-Weston had settled with the property damage claimant with funds borrowed from St. Paul.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b803-9\">. 341 P.2d 110, 114: \u201c* * * if the insured has other insurance against a loss covered by this policy the Company shall not be liable under this policy for a greater proportion of such loss than the applicable limit of liability stated in the declarations bears to the total applicable limit of all valid and collectible insurance against such loss * * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b803-11\">. In that case both policies had \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses. These considered together were in direct conflict in that if the provisions of both policies were given full effect neither insurer would be liable. The United States Fidelity issued a policy on the driver\u2019s own car with extended coverage to borrowed cars but its other insurance clause provided that it would be excess as to any automobile not named. Under this clause United States Fidelity policy was excess as to this accident. Oregon Insurance had issued a policy to the owner of the borrowed vehicle; its \u201cother insurance\u201d clause made it excess as to drivers other than the named insured. This made the Oregon Insurance company\u2019s policy excess also. This court faced the necessity of dealing with this \u201cunintended absurdity\u201d and reached the only possible conclusion that these other insurance provisions were mutually repugnant and should be disregarded, and the liability was prorated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
