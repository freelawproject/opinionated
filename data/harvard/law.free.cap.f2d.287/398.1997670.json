The district court entered decrees in accordance with a full opinion reported as Navegacion Castro Riva v. The M.S. Nordholm, D.C.E.D.La.1959, 178 F.Supp. 736. The appellant-owner of the Theogennitor does not take issue with the essential findings of fact made by the district court, but does take exception to the district court\u2019s statement that, \u201cthe petitioner in limitation has made no effort whatever to show that the officers of the Theogennitor were licensed under law of any nation, including Panama, nor have the laws of any nation, including Panama, been introduced to show that officers of vessels flying the flag thereof need not be licensed.\u201d 178 F.Supp. at page 741. The appellant excepts also to the implication that the Theogennitor fell within the class of \u201cold and underpowered, shadowy-owned tramps, flying the flag of any nation, and manned by the flotsam of the world.\u201d 178 F.Supp. at page 742. In affirming the decrees, it is not necessary for us to approve the statement and reference to which the appellant excepts.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">We do not agree with the appellant\u2019s apprehension that the district court\u2019s opinion will furnish pilots with \u201cauthority to attempt dangerous overtakings at night simply because their vessel possesses high speed,\u201d nor with the other vigorously argued criticisms of the conclusions reached by the district court. To the contrary, after careful consideration, we agree not only with the findings but also with the ably reasoned conclusions of the district court, and with its decision. The decrees are therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b453-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
