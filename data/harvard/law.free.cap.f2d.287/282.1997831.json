The motion is granted, and the supplemental brief has been considered by the Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-29\">We reject without discussion the point raised in the supplement to appellee\u2019s brief. It brings to our attention certain correspondence between the attorneys for the parties. This correspondence was not before the lower court and is not contained in the record of this appeal. It deals largely with facts which appellee Malone claims demonstrate that the present action is barred by limitations. The action was decided by the court below upon the face of the complaint filed by appellants and the motion to dismiss filed by appellee below, along with the United States.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That is all which was before the court below and which was involved in this appeal' and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>we decline to consider the matters discussed in the supplemental brief of ap-pellee Malone, as such a possible defense on the part of appellee was not before the court below and is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">We pass over without discussion as having been sufficiently dealt with in our opinion three points made in the petition for rehearing,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and we confine this opinion to a response to the argument presented in Point IY of the petition for rehearing in which it is claimed that \u201cThe majority opinion is based upon an erroneous premise as to Georgia law.\u201d We do this in part because of the statement in our opinion: \u201cIt is manifest from the Georgia statutes quoted and referred to, as well as the decisions cited, that the common law action of ejectment in Georgia involves possession alone, that the only process issuable to the victor is a writ of possession, together with damages, and that \u2018the writ of possession shall not issue against third persons not known in the suit on which such writ of possession is founded, * * * \u2019 \u201d. [284 F.2d 98.]</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">That statement in the opinion meant, of course, that the common law action of ejectment in Georgia, as sought to be invoked and applied by the appellants in this case, involves possession alone. The quoted statement was followed by our statement in the opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">\u201cThe sole question presented, therefore, is one of law: is appellee Malone, under the admitted facts, \u00e9ntitled to have the action against him dismissed solely on the ground that he is protected by the asserted sovereign immunity of the United States?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-15\">That is an accurate statement of what was tried before the court below, what was decided by that court, and what was argued before us in the original presentation of this case. No contention was made that the action of ejectment here involved differed from the action of ejectment dealt with in United States v. Lee, 1882, 106 U.S. 196, 1 S.Ct. 240, 27 L.Ed. 171, and we made no effort to analyze the statutes and decisions of Georgia to demonstrate that the action of ejectment before the lower court and before us was identical in character and scope with the action involved in Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-16\"> The fact is that Ejectment, as dealt with in Title 33 of the Code of Georgia Annotated, is a comprehensive and flexible remedy. Assuming that, under the Georgia decisions relied upon by appellee in its petition for rehearing<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, the remedy by ejectment has been expanded so as to permit suits to try title to land, there is nothing in any decision we have found which limits the remedy to such a class of actions. Many provisions of the statute reject the thought that the common law action of ejectment, an action at law, has been converted into-an exclusively equitable action to quiet title to land, or even to try title.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>The opinion rendered by the court below, appearing in the record and now reported in 186 F.Supp. 407, 408, shows that its judgment dismissing the action was predicated upon the petition of ap-pellee Malone alone, stating: \u201cPlaintiff frankly concedes that he cannot maintain this action against the United States itself;\u201d and the decision was rendered in favor of Malone solely on the basis that, in possessing the land, he was acting as agent of the United States, which had not consented to be sued. While the petition for rehearing and the briefs filed in support thereof are somewhat confused, the real contention presented is that the United States was an indispensable party and that the action ought to have been dismissed by the court below on the ground that the suit could not proceed without bringing the United States in.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">One of the cases chiefly relied upon to sustain that position is our recent decision in Stewart v. United States, 5 Cir., 1957, 242 F.2d 49. We do not think that appellee\u2019s position is sound. Stewart involved an action seeking to quiet title generally against all the world.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We held that, in such an action, the United States, through whom the others were claiming title, was an indispensable party, basing our holding largely on our prior cases of Hudson v. Newell, 5 Cir., 1949, 172 F.2d 848, and cases cited, and Mackintosh v. Marks\u2019 Estate, 5 Cir., 1955, 225 F.2d 211. We stated the general rule concerning indispensable parties to be: <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\">\u201cIt is well settled under the decisions of this Court that no decree can be entered affecting the title to property or cancelling any cloud thereon unless all of the parties interested in the title or in the particular cloud and who will be directly affected by any judgment that may be rendered are properly before the Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">In Hudson v. Newell we reversed the action of the lower court in dismissing a suit to quiet title generally to certain lands, as provided by Mississippi statutes, using this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-11\">\u201cIf they can prove the land and oil are theirs we see no reason why they should not have judgment for them against those sued; possible claimants not in court would not of course be bound by the result. If such claimants\u2019 title is shown as a defense their interests can be saved from the decree. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-12\">\u201cWe therefore hold that while the full relief prayed cannot be given with only the parties before the court a limited relief can be, and the suits should be retained to en-quire into it.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">In Mackintosh, we cited Hudson supra, as authority and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-14\">\u201cPlaintiffs are entitled to any relief which the facts justify even though that relief has not been asked and that theory has not been advanced in the pleadings. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\u201cThe first reason is that the rights of the royalty owners would continue to exist irrespective of the outcome of the present suit. The royalty owners who deraign their title from the appellants are protected under their warranty of title, both express and implied. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-4\">\u201c * * * The power of a court of equity so to mold its decree as to do complete justice between the parties without adversely affecting those not before the court is exceedingly broad and elastic. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">\u201c * * * the court should retain jurisdiction and limit any relief granted to such as can be given without prejudice to the absent parties.\u201d 225 F.2d at pages 214-215.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Certainly, under these decisions, the United States was not an indispensable party here. It had been eliminated in effect by consent. It is difficult to discern what relief was sought against the United States by the common law complaint in ejectment in the John Doe proceeding. Taking the averments of that complaint, as supplemented by the statement of the court below that plaintiffs (appellants) conceded that the suit against the United States could not be maintained as true, we think it is clear that, under Lee, a judgment can be entered by the court below which will grant appellants some relief without adversely affecting the interests of the United States. In fact, this was in effect conceded by the appellee in the original brief.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Several times in the petition for rehearing, the appellee claims that title was put in issue by the denial of appellants\u2019 title by appellees. Of course, there was no responsive pleading at all, and the averments of the complaint must be taken as true in passing upon the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">The petition for rehearing is</p>\n<p id=\"AK3\">Denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-14\"><em>. </em>The United States, which had entered its appearance and joined in Malone\u2019s motion to dismiss, has not joined in the petition for rehearing. The judgment entered pursuant to the opinion heretofore rendered in this case approved the judgment of the court below in dismissing the action insofar as the United States was concerned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b337-30\">. The court below dealt with certain admissions which had been made in pretrial hearings. No question was raised as to whether these were properly before the court on the motion to dismiss, so that we raise no question, but have considered the admissions as included in the written opinion of the court below as being properly before the Court upon the motion to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b338-8\">. That our opinion I \u201cregresses to the discredited view that whether a suit is against the United States is determined by its presence as a formal party defendant;\u201d and that our opinion II is in conflict with the decisions of the Supreme Court, and III of this circuit and other circuits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b338-9\">.

E.G., \u00a7 103 of the chapter vests the right to maintain the action in a single joint tenant or other person claiming only a part interest in the lands involved without joining any other person with him, with the proviso that the judgment shall \u201cnot affect the rights of those interested in such lands or tenements who-are not parties to the suit.\u201d \u00a7 114 gives the plaintiff the right to make the true claimant defendant and to bind him by the judgment. \u00a7 115 confers the right in the plaintiff to make a previous war-rantor of title to the land a codefendant. \u00a7 120 gives the right to the plaintiff to-have a writ of possession against the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>fendant, including a money judgment for mesne profits.
