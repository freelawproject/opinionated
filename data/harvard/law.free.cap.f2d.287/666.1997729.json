The only ground in support of the appellant\u2019s motion for bill of particulars was that the information requested was sought to prevent surprise. We think the court\u2019s refusal to grant the motion was within his discretionary power.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>As to the sufficiency of the evidence, it appears that the car had been stolen from Miami, Florida. It was found in Waycross, Georgia, some 600 miles distant. It was first seen there on a day when appellant arrived there saying that he had hitchhiked from Miami. His finger prints were found in the automobile and he was seen several times in the vicinity of the automobile before being arrested. In the absence of any explanation as to why he had ever been in the automobile with which he had no possible legal connection, we conclude that this evidence was sufficient to justify a finding of guilt. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"AiZ\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
