The validity and sufficiency of the indictments will be sustained on authority of Smith v. United States, 5 Cir., 241 F.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-28\">Other questions argued on the appeals were considered and found to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-29\">It is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed that the judgment of the District Court in each case be and it is hereby affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
