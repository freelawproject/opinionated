What happened was that the spouse of the decedent paid that amount to the executors and on the same day the executors paid it to the decedent\u2019s wife. The Tax Court held that the $5,500 did not pass from the decedent to his spouse and does not so qualify.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-23\">There is no dispute as to the facts and we affirm the decision of the Tax Court upon facts stipulated and found by the Tax Court and upon the legal conclusions announced by that court. 33 T.C. 361, 1959.
