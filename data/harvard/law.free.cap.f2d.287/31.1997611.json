The appellant complains of the District Court\u2019s action, contending that since the statute of limitations has run on thirteen of the years in question, the District Director had failed to establish sufficient grounds for inquiry or production of the records. Admittedly, however, the existence of fraud in any of the subject years would remove the statutory bar <footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, and a bona fide suspicion of fraud justifies the investigation of the appropriate records.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-27\">We are well aware of the conflict among the several circuits relative to the showing of suspected fraud required from the Internal Revenue Service in such cases <footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, but we do not find it necessary to make a choice of criteria at this time. Here, the District Judge made a finding that there was probable cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>to suspect fraud in connection with the income tax returns filed by the taxpayer for the years in question. This finding was based on evidence of variance in profit and inventory figures shown on the tax returns as compared to reports filed with a banking institution; activities of agents of the taxpayer in removing reports from the bank\u2019s files as well as evidence of improper personal expense items paid by the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Since the issue of fraud was actually tried before the District Court<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and there was substantial evidence to support his finding, the judgment below is</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-18\">. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7604.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b85-19\">. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7602.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b85-20\">.
