BROWN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b490-18\">As this ease percolates to us, it is but a bare shadow of its former self in the trial court. There it was a multi-party, multi-count indictment against Roe individually, the corporation, Stratoray Oil Company, Inc. of which Roe was President, and another, an advertising writer. At the heart of this case as the jury heard the evidence for many, many days was a high-pitched, hard-sell extravagant solicitation campaign to sell through the mail to thousands of persons over the United States oil leases on small tracts in Texas and Utah. Counts 1 through 7 charged each with violation of the Securities Act of 1933, Title 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 77q (a) (1), by the use of the mails to defraud in the sale of securities. Counts 8 through 14 charged each with mail fraud under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1341 in connection with the sale of the same interests. Counts 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19, which alone remain, charged illegal sale and delivery of securities through the use of the mails without a prior registration with the SEC as required by 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 77e(a) (1) and (2). Count 20 charged a conspiracy under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371 to violate all of the laws forming the basis of Counts 1 through 19. The advertising writer was acquitted on all counts. Roe, individually, was acquitted on all fraud counts (1 through 14 and 20). The Court entered a like judgment of acquittal as to Stratoray, the corporation. But Roe and Stratoray were each found guilty under Counts 15 through 19. This means that as we review these convictions, we are not, at this stage, permitted to read into any of the transactions any moral overtones of fraud. We must regard them in the posture of nonfraudulent violations of the registration requirements of the Securities Act. What the jury washed out thus has immediate relevance in our approach. It also highlights the prejudicial effect of the error we find in the Court\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-19\">For reasons v/e later point out, we conclude that the case must be reversed and remanded for error in the Court\u2019s charge. But since the case ought not to be retried if these facts, if credited by a jury, do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>not constitute a federal crime, we think it essential that we first discuss the basic contention of the appellants. In a nutshell it is simply this. The sale of the entire (%ths) mineral lease in a specific piece of property does not constitute the sale of a \u201csecurity\u201d under the Act. Consequently, since the registration statement is required only as to \u201ca security,\u201d there was no violation of this Act.</p>\n<p id=\"AIm3\">On the surface there is a good deal to this position. The mailed advertising solicitation material, extravagantly optimistic as it was, offered to the prospects mineral leases only. In the numerous sales effected through this means, that is all that was sold and delivered. There was not, therefore, any sale, offer of sale, or delivery of a \u201cfractional undivided interest in oil, gas, or other mineral rights\u201d as the definitive section of the Act sets forth. Nor did such oil leases fit within any other specifically itemized interests.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If they are to come within the term \u201csecurity\u201d they must do so as an \u201cinvestment contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">At this late date we do not think that there can be any real doubt that offerings of oil leases in this fashion may amount to an \u201cinvestment contract.\u201d This was the heading specifically recognized for such transactions by S. E. C. v. C. M. Joiner Leasing Corp., 1943, 320 U.S. 344, 64 S.Ct. 120, 88 L.Ed. 88, as it reversed this Court\u2019s holding that these were sales, not of a security, but an interest in property, real or personal. Because it would be out of keeping with the remedial object of this legislation reflecting a long current of like enactments in the various states, that case also rejected any construction of the Act on the basis of handy Latin aphorisms that would exclude from coverage mineral interests other than those specifically enumerated as \u201cfractional undivided interest in oil, gas, or other mineral rights.\u201d 320 U.S. at page 350, 64 S.Ct. at page 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">Of course it takes something more than a mere \u201coffering [of] naked leasehold rights,\u201d 320 U.S. at page 348, 64 S.Ct. at page 122, or, in a different situation, the mere fee ownership of a piece of land, Blackwell v. Bentsen, 5 Cir., 1953, 203 F.2d 690, certiorari dismissed 347 U.S. 925, 74 S.Ct. 528, 98 L.Ed. 1078. Regarded as relevant and sufficient by Joiner were these factors. The \u201ceconomic inducements of the proposed and promised exploration well\u201d; submitting a proposition to prospects to sell them \u201cdocuments which offered the purchaser a chance, without undue delay or additional cost, of sharing in discovery values which might follow a current exploration enterprise\u201d; the \u201cexploration enterprise was woven into [the] leaseholds, in both an economic and a legal sense.\u201d 320 U.S. at page 348, 64 S.Ct. at page 122. Irrelevant, on the other hand, and at least not decisive are other factors such as the nature, real or personal, of the property formally conveyed, or the fact that to appraise its character examination of facts beyond the face of the instrument may be required. For Joiner likewise stated, \u201cThe test rather is what character the instrument is given in commerce by the terms of the offer, the plan of distribution, and the economic inducements held out to the prospect. In the enforcement of an act such as this it is not inappropriate that promoters\u2019 offerings be judged as being what they were represented to be.\u201d 320 U.S. at pages 352-353, 64 S.Ct. at page 124. While it is nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>essary in any case under the Act to prove \u201cthat documents being sold were securities under the Act\u201d which sometimes \u201cmight be done by proving the document itself,\u201d in \u201cothers proof must go outside the instruments itself as we do here.\u201d 320 U.S. at page 355, 64 S.Ct. at page 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">All of this was spelled out with more positiveness in S. E. C. v. W. J. Howey Co., 1946, 328 U.S. 293, 298, 66 S.Ct. 1100, 1102, 90 L.Ed. 1244. \u201cForm\u201d, that case announces, is to be \u201cdisregarded for substance and emphasis\u201d is to be \u201cplaced upon economic realities.\u201d Following the pattern of state legislation so well known to Congress, the Court declared that \u201can investment contract for purposes of the Securities Act means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party, it being immaterial whether the shares in the enterprise are evidenced by formal certificates or by nominal interests in the physical assets employed in the enterprise.\u201d 328 U.S. at pages 298-299, 66 S.Ct. at page 1103. Expressed somewhat differently, the \u201ctest is whether the scheme involves an investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others.\u201d 328 U.S. at page 301, 66 S.Ct. at page 1104.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Certainly the facts of this record more than satisfy the Joiner-Howey standard. These sales pitches were more than mere extravagance of the wildest optimism.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Each of them was based upon the economic significance of an existing or proposed test well. It was, so the offering letters stated, these test wells in Utah and in Texas which would suddenly\u2014 indeed overnight \u2014 give to these small-patch leases sold for as little as $10 an acre a value in excess of $1,000 per acre. Wealth, the blurbs continued, would come to these retired school teachers, cobblers, nurserymen, and others, from the stampede of oil men rushing into the area in a mad scramble to buy leases once the-test wells were brought in. This wealth, so it was spelled out in terms which the gullible, young and old, could understand, would come from sales of the leases at these fabulously increased prices together with overriding royalties in future production reserved in such transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">In summarizing the hundreds of pages, of these exuberant solicitation letters in this fashion, we do not mean to slip obliquely into moral judgments which, at the outset, we emphasized were no longer in the case. We may, as did the Supreme-Court in Joiner,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> credit all of these as. being made in the best of faith and, indeed, with a substantial factual basis. The significance of them is not in their-extravagance nor even their possibly misleading nature. They are significant because, taken at face value, they offer to the prospective purchaser a chance to-reap great rewards \u2014 indeed get rich quick \u2014 -not out of the operation of these-leases by the purchasers, but solely because of activities of persons other than the purchasers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number> The economic inducement, the allure of this stream of liquid gold, as one letter described it, was the spectacular increase in values of the leases without anything but a patient gullibility upon the part of beguiled purchasers. The promoters were selling a chance to make a great deal of money from activities which were then, or would shortly be, carried on by persons other than the purchasers. In that setting it mattered not whether the test wells were to be drilled by the sellers, or by third persons either under, or independent of, their control.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> What the purchasers were told was that after they acquired these pieces of property (leases), the activity and energies and expenditures of others \u2014 the backers of the test wells \u2014 would produce earnings on the investment. That is enough. Price v. United States, 5 Cir., 1953, 200 F.2d 652, 654. All of this is reviewed extensively in the opinion of Chief Judge Murrah for the 10th Circuit in Woodward v. Wright, 1959, 266 F.2d 108, 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">In addition, considering that Roe was the president and dominating character of Stratoray through whom Stratoray alone acted for much of the period involved, this record warrants a holding that each had, directly or indirectly, made substantial contributions toward the test wells. In the Texas area it was a contribution of a section of leases to the driller of the well. In Utah it was a substantial payment of cash through the instrument of another corporation dominat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>ed and later wholly owned by Roe. More than that, the sales letters openly boasted that the locations of the test wells had been fixed by Roe through the use of his \u201cgamma ray scintillator unit.\u201d That was, so he boasted, followed by continued supervision and \u201csitting on\u201d the wells either in person or through geologists selected by him. And, for good measure, the lure of profits through the scintillator was dramatized by the promise that if the particular leases then offered were purchased, those purchasers would be entitled later on to participate in \u201cpyramid priority rights\u201d to purchase \u201ca series of leases selected by [Roe] on the basis of electronic scintillation unit gamma radiation anomaly findings * * <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Thus we determine that, as a matter of law, the evidence of these transactions, if credited, would constitute the sale or delivery of an \u201cinvestment contract,\u201d hence a \u201csecurity\u201d thereby requiring registration with the SEC. But the if in \u201cif credited\u201d is a big one. By its very nature, it is the peculiar facts of the setting which turns the offer from a mere sale of property into a sale of a security. That means that the trier of fact, here a jury, must determine the issue. More than that, this being a criminal case in contrast to the more common injunction proceeding or damage suit under the Act, two principles inescapably apply. First, in Mr. Justice Jackson\u2019s words \u201cin a civil action * * * a preponderance of the evidence will establish the case; * * * in a criminal case, [the evidence must] meet the stricter requirement of satisfying the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 320 U.S. 344, 355, 64 S.Ct. 120, 125. Second, and here more decisive, no fact, not even an undisputed fact, may be determined by the Judge. The plea of not guilty puts all in issue, even the most patent truths. In our federal system, the Trial Court may never instruct a verdict either in whole or in part.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America v. United States, 1947, 330 U.S. 395, 408, 67 S.Ct. 775, 91 L.Ed. 973; Christoffel v. United States, 1949, 338 U.S. 84, 89, 69 S.Ct. 1447, 93 L.Ed. 1826; Brooks v. United States, 5 Cir., 1957, 240 F.2d 905; Hamilton v. United States, 5 Cir., 1955, 221 F.2d 611, 615; Schwachter v. United States, 6 Cir., 1956, 237 F.2d 640, 644; United States v. Gollin, 3 Cir., 1947, 166 F.2d 123, 126, certiorari denied 333 U.S. 875, 68 S.Ct. 905, 92 L.Ed. 1151.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">And yet, that is substantially what the Trial Judge did here on the crucial issue of whether these were investment contracts. He instructed them flatly and without equivocation that they were.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>This was no mere permissible expression of his opinion on what the evidence showed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For he translated this into positive action that if <em>\u201cthe </em>investment contracts\u201d were \u201coffered for sale\u201d by defendants \u201cthese defendants did engage in the sale of securities within the meaning of the Federal Securities Law.\u201d Neither as to the fraud counts covered by Instruction 3 nor as to the non-registration counts (covered by Instruction 4 and 5) did the Court ever submit the question whether these were investment contracts within the legal definition stated by the Court. As to the counts on which the jury returned a verdict of guilty (15-19), all that was submitted was whether the defendants (1) used the mails to sell or deliver and (2) whether a securities registration was in effect. The subject of the sale or registration impliedly incorporated within these two issues was, of course, \u201csecurities namely, investment contracts.\u201d But as to this the Court had already given precise directions in unmistakable terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">On such a crucial matter, particularly in a long dramatic trial, the greater part of which was preoccupied with phases involving claimed misrepresentation and active fraud growing out of these flamboyant high pressure sales letters \u2014 and on which the jury was not moved to convict \u2014 it was essential that full and plain instructions be given. In clear and understandable language the Judge should have told the jury that to convict it must first find that, within the definition of an investment contract given by the Court, these transactions were an investment contract. Only then, did sale through the mail without registration become a federal crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Constructed as this charge was, the Court\u2019s instruction, note 8, supra, was not, as suggested by the Government, a mere declaration that the indictment was sufficient. That was a matter of no concern to the jury, and the lawyers from the long agony of the trial were already conscious that that was so. The Court had passed the point in his charge of describing the indictments and was here translating instructions into definitive action by the jury depending upon its resolution of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">In the face of objections stated with precision and clarity complaining of the charge as a partial direction of a verdict of guilty and a failure to submit to the jury a crucial issue, the Court was obliged to take corrective steps so that the jury would clearly understand that it had three, not two, issues for decision. The failure to do this was a substantial and harmful error.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">The appellant also asserts that the Court erred in not giving an appropriate instruction on \u201cwillfully\u201d as it is used in the Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> They contend that \u201cwillfully\u201d as used connotes a consciousness that the law was being violated, i. e., done with an evil purpose. They assert that this is required under such cases as United States v. Kemble, 3 Cir., 1952, 197 F.2d 316; Hargrove v. United States, 5 Cir., 1933, 67 F.2d 820, 90 A.L.R. 1276; Bloch v. United States, 9 Cir., 1955, 221 F.2d 786. To these might well be added: St. Johns-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>bury Trucking Co. v. United States, 1 Cir., 1955, 220 F.2d 393; Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. v. United States, 1952, 342 U.S. 337, 72 S.Ct. 329, 96 L.Ed. 367; Automatic Canteen Co. of America v. F.T.C., 1953, 346 U.S. 61, 73 S.Ct. 1017, 97 L.Ed. 1454. The Government, on the other hand, insists that this is but another instance of a public welfare <em>malum prohibitum </em>statute requiring only that the actor intentionally, i. e., not accidentally, negligently, etc., do the act which the statute condemns, the law thereafter imputing the \u201cwillful\u201d intention to do all that which is the natural consequence of such an act. The Government rests on the principles expressed in some leading eases <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and cites a number of others applying such principles to regulatory statutory schemes analogous to the Securities Act.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And it points to two cases under the Securities Act so holding<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and others implying as much.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">We agree, however, with the Government that this point was not adequately reserved by appropriate objections, and the circumstances do not call for our taking notice of it as plain error. We think resolution of that problem under this Act \u2014 nearly always a difficult decision \u2014 should await a proper presentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">The remaining exceptions to the charge-are without any validity.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The other complaints we regard either as inconsequential or not likely to recur.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-7\">. \u201cWhen used in this subchapter, unless the context otherwise requires- \u2014 \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">\u201c(1) the term \u2018security\u2019 means any note, stock, treasury stock, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement, collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment contract, voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, fractional undivided interest in oil, gas, or other mineral rights, or, in general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a \u2018security,\u2019 or any certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, guarantee of, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing.\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 77b as amended June 1934.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"atb-dedup-0\">. Between March 10, 1956, and April 17, 1957, over 54,504 copies of various sales pitch letters were mailed for Stratoray under Hoe\u2019s signature by a letter-mailing service. The mailing lists were maintained by the letter-mailing service or by Roe or his associates, some of them running to as high as 10,000 names. The lists wore the names and addresses of persons unknown to the user. Each list had its own peculiar designation, such as \u201cthe Louie White List,\u201d the \u201cNew York List,\u201d the \u201cUtah List,\u201d the \u201cCrader List,\u201d the \u201cNew List,\u201d the \u201cNevada List.\u201d The \u201cBuyers List\u201d and the \u201cHot List\u201d apparently included those who had already purchased at least one list. These prospects were importuned by telegrams as well. The promotional campaign was highly successful as income from the sale of leases to the small parcels ran about $233,000 during 1956 alone. By about November 1956, Roe- and Stratoray had \u201croughly 1,000 investors\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b492-12\">.

On the contrary, with the immoderation characteristic of these ghost-written sales letters, the emphasis by Roe and Stratoray was on how much money had to be spent and how much valuable, large, heavy equipment had to be furnished by those drilling, or about to drill, the exploratory test wells. A reasonably prudent-imprudent, prospective purchaser was certainly entitled to infer that the promised bonanza would come to him without any like expenditure on his part. Indeed, the idea of a cobbler from North Carolina going to Utah to develop his 40-acre lease as a means of reaping his reward is so preposterous that not even the sales letters came close to implying that.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b493-6\">.

Loss, Securities Regulation, 1955 supp. p. 149, as much as says so. \u201cMr. Justice Jackson\u2019s statement that \u2018The exploration enterprise was woven into these leaseholds, in both an economic and a legal sense,\u201d would seem to apply equally in principle whether the exploration is being done under the seller\u2019s control or by a third person.\u201d Discussing this same problem, Bloomen-thal, SEC Aspects of Oil and Gas Financing, 7 Wyo.L.J. 49, 55 (1953), points out that \u201cfrom the standpoint of the investor it makes little difference whether the promoter points to a well being drilled by him or whether he points to a well being drilled by someone else. In both instances the purchaser of oil and gas leases in order to make an informed investment must have available pertinent geological information.\u201d Written in 1953 this author could not have read the Roe letters created in 1958. But without our suggesting that Roe\u2019s action was taken articulately in the light of Joiner, what the author describes is almost a paraphrase of this record. \u201cThere are unfortunately at the present time a number of promoters who, aware of the implications of the Joiner case, are offering oil and gas leases on small specifically described tracts and in connection with such sales point to wells being drilled or to be drilled by someone else in the area. As a rule very flamboyant literature featuring vague and general statements and 'predictions of future developments carefully drawn so as to make criminal prosecution under the mail fraud statute difficult if not impossible, is used in connection with such offerings. * * See also Meer, Oil Finance and The Securities Laws, 29 Texas L.Rev. 885, 888 (1951).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b494-5\">.

The definition of a \u201csecurity\u201d applicable to all such counts was stated in Instruction 3 but was applicable to Instruction 4 ancl 5 covering the nonregistration counts (15-19) as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">\u201cA \u2018security\u2019 is defined in the Federal Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77(b) (1) to include among other things an investment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">\u201cYou are instructed that assignments of oil and gas leases coupled with collateral agreements, promises and undertakings that wells would be and were being drilled in the vicinity of tracts of land on which such oil and gas lease assignments are offered for sale to test and prove the oil and gas productivity of the area surrounding said wells to be drilled, including the tracts of land covered by said lease assignments offered for sale are investment contracts and are, therefore, a security within the meaning of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">\u201cSince it is clear that the investment contracts described in the first count of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>this indictment come within the definition of the term \u2018security\u2019 as set forth in the Federal Securities Act, I instruct you that if you find and believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the investment contracts were offered for sale or sold by these defendants that these defendants did engage in the sale of securities within the meaning of the Federal Securities Law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b495-7\">. The charge did not contain an instruction in the traditional language making it clear that expressions of opinion by the Judge on the evidence were in no way binding upon the jury as the sole trier of the facts. This is asserted as an independent ground of error as is the failure to give an instruction about the possible self-interest of Government witnesses. We need not pass on these complaints as such.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b495-13\">. \u201cAny person who <em>ivillfutty </em>violates any of the provisions of this subchapter, or the rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission under authority thereof * * * shall upon conviction be fined not more than $5,0C0 or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.\u201d Emphasis added. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 77x.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b496-4\">.
