It was his contention that this count of the indictment failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute any cause of action against him and failed to charge any crime punishable under the laws of the United States. The motion was denied by the district court, and Beavers appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\">Count two of the indictment alleges as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-12\"><em>\u201cCount Two: </em>That on or about April 30, 1957, in the County of El Dorado, within the Northern Division of the Northern District of California, and within the jurisdiction of this Court, the defendants, James Allison, Lavon Bonner Starks, and Claude Delbert Beavers, made a sugar mash fit for distillation for the production of alcohol on certain premises not duly authorized according to law. (26 U.S.C., 5216 a 1)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az6\">Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5216(a) (1), referred to in this count, reads in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b882-14\">\u201cNo mash, wort or wash, fit for distillation or for the production of spirits or alcohol, shall be made or fermented in any building or on any premises other than a distillery duly authorized according to law * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-15\">Beavers argues that the words \u201cnot duly authorized according to law,\u201d as used in count two, are insufficient to allege criminal conduct punishable under the laws of the United States \u201cbecause nowhere is it alleged what law the conduct alleged was unauthorized by or in what respect such conduct was contrary to such law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b882-16\">For the reasons stated in the memorandum and order of the district judge, entered on May 20, 1960, United States v. Allison, 191 F.Supp. 443, we are of the opinion that appellant\u2019s contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
