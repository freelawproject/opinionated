Involved is the construction to be given certain sections of Federal Marketing Order No. 27 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Order 27) as they existed during the period of June 1954 to March 1955, when Order 27 only regulated the handling of milk in the New York Milk Marketing Area (Marketing Area) .<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Newark Milk, a New Jersey corporation, operated pool plants<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> at Canisteo and Oquaga, New York, respectively, and also operated a non-pool plant at \"Newark, New Jersey. It received milk at its pool plants in the State of New York from producers and shipped it to its non-pool plant in Newark, New Jersey in the form of cream, milk and skim milk. There it was processed, packaged and distributed to its custom-. ers. The Newark plant was not licensed to sell, distribute, or otherwise deliver milk in the Marketing Area from its non-pool plant in Newark.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">From June 1954 through March 1955, Newark Milk shipped 473,088 pounds of skim milk from its pool plants in New York to its non-pool plant in Newark. It is not disputed that all of this milk was received at the non-pool plant in Newark. The Market Administrator conducted an audit of the records of the non-pool plant in Newark which while indicating the receipt of the skim milk in Newark did not disclose what ultimate disposition or utilization had been made of large quantities of it. Thereupon the Market Administrator charged Newark Milk with the differential on the 473,088 pounds of skim milk pursuant to \u00a7 927.44 of Order 27. It was billed for $8,054.72 which it paid to the producer-settlement fund. Following the payment of the above sum Newark Milk petitioned the Secretary under \u00a7 8c (15) (A) of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1937, 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 608c(15) (A) (Act) complaining that Order 27 was improperly applied and requesting the return of the payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-12\">A hearing was held before an Examiner as a result of which he issued a report recommending the dismissal of the petition. To this report exceptions were filed and a further hearing was held before the Judicial Officer of the Department of Agriculture who denied the petition. Newark Milk then sued for a review in the United States District Court of New Jersey under \u00a7 8e(15) (B) of the Act, 7 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 608c(15) (B). The Secretary and Newark Milk each moved for summary judgment. As indicated heretofore the court granted the motion of the Secretary and found that the order of the Market Administrator was \u201cin accordance with law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-14\">The two sections of Order 27 basically involved here are \u00a7\u00a7 927.44 and 927.31. Section 927.44 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-15\">\u201cSee. 927.44 Fluid skim differential. For skim milk derived from Class II or Class III milk which skim milk enters the marketing area in the form of milk, fluid skim milk * * * or cultured milk drinks and there utilized or disposed of [in one of such forms], <em>cmd for aU other skim milk derived from Class II or Class III milk which is not established to have been otherwise utilized or disposed of, the handler shall pay a fluid skim dif</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number><em>ferential </em>* * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Section 927.31 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">\u201cSec. 927.31 Burden of proof. In establishing the classification of milk received from producers, <em>the burden rests upon the handler who received the milk from producers </em>to show that the milk should not be classified as Class 1-A, and that <em>the skim milk in Class II and Class III should not be subject to the fluid skim differential </em>* * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">Newark Milk submits that it fully-complied with the above sections when the records at its pool plants and non-pool plant established that the skim milk had been shipped and received at its non-pool plant in Newark which, at the time, was outside the Marketing Area. In other words, it contends that \u00a7\u00a7 927.44 and 927.31 did not require it to establish the ultimate utilization or disposition of the skim milk outside the Marketing Area.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">In general, Order 27 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> seeks to achieve a fair division of the more profitable fluid milk market among all producers in the Marketing Area thereby eliminating the disorganizing effect of cutthroat competition. United States v. Rock Royal Co-operative, Inc., 1939, 307 U.S. 533, 59 S.Ct. 993, 83 L.Ed. 1446; Elm Spring Farm v. United States, 1 Cir., 1942, 127 F.2d 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-15\">Section 927.44 is the means of fulfilling this goal as far as fluid skim milk is concerned. It requires pool handlers to make payments to the producer-settlement fund for the fluid skim milk which they send into the Marketing Area or <em>for which they do not otherwise account. </em>As argued by the Secretary, when fluid skim milk enters the Marketing Area and no differential is paid with respect to it, the purpose of \u00a7 927.44 is frustrated regardless of whether entry into the area is from a pool plant or a non-pool plant. In either event if no differential is paid the benefit to the producers covered by Order 27, gained from the more lucrative fluid milk market is lost since the uniform price is, of necessity, lowered.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-16\">In view of the above it would appear clear that the words \u201cotherwise utilized or disposed of\u201d as they appear in \u00a7 927.44 mean ultimate utilization or disposition outside the Marketing Area. It is only by such construction that the purpose of the section can be fulfilled. See Hogansburg Milk Co. v. Jones, 6 Agri. Dec. 1036 (1946); United States v. Ridgeland, D.C.W.D.Wis.1942, 47 F.Supp. 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Newark Milk contends that while Order 27 distinguished milk, skim milk and fluid skim milk, as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 927.105, 927.106 and 927.107,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the agency officials and the District Court failed to observe the distinctions. The charge is not substantiated. On the contrary, as will appear later, no confusion occurred in the application of the relevant sections of Order 27 to skim milk, the only product involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Newark Milk contends that the Market Administrator erred in applying to it the requirements of \u00a7 927.54 <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which provide for verification of reports by audit of the \u201chandler or person upon whose disposition of milk such handler claims classification.\u201d because that section refers to milk and not to skim milk. It urges that \u00a7 927.54 was adopted to enable the Market Administrator to \u201cfollow through any classification which is made under \u00a7 927.33\u201d,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> wherein it is provided that the handler at the pool plant who receives milk from producers may elect to have a classification made at the pool plant or at the non-pool plant to which the milk has been shipped. In the latter event the advantage of a lower classification may be had. Since no classification of milk is here involved Newark Milk concludes that \u00a7 927.54 casts no duty upon it to keep records at its non-pool plant for verification by the Market Administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-12\">Section 927.54 does not compel the recipient non-pool plant to keep records. But this fact cannot detract from the duty imposed on the pool plant handler by \u00a7\u00a7 927.31 and 927.44 to establish the ultimate utilization or disposition of skim milk outside the Marketing Area. Furthermore \u00a7 927.54 provides specifically for the verification of the records of the pool plant handler. Indeed, in the instant case, the Secretary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>does not argue that \u00a7 927.54 required Newark Milk to keep records at its non-pool plant to show that no fluid skim milk differential was due but does submit, and we agree, that the keeping of such records could have been relied on in satisfying the burden of the pool plant operation of Newark Milk.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Newark Milk also contends that to require it to show the ultimate disposition or utilization of the skim milk would shift the burden of proof from the pool plant handler, i. e., the handler who received the milk from producers. The contention is without merit. Section 927.31 places the burden on the pool plant handler of proving that the fluid skim milk differential is not applicable. That is where it remains. The fact that the burden may be satisfied from the records of the non-pool plant does not shift the burden of proof to the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Newark Milk next refers to an instruction in a form provided by the Market Administrator entitled \u201cPool Plant Report\u201d (Form MA-1, Rev. 3154), which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-8\">\u201c2. Fluid Skim Differential</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-9\">\u201cOn the line for fluid skim differential insert the total skim pounds which enters the marketing area in the form of milk, fluid skim milk, or in the form of cultured or flavored milk drinks containing less than 3.0 percent or more than 5.0 percent of butterfat, and all skim milk which is not accounted for in some product leaving or on hand at this plant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">Newark Milk contends that the instruction is in accordance with its interpretation of \u00a7 927.44 and that it fully complied with the instruction when it reported that it had shipped the skim milk to its non-pool plant outside the Marketing Area. This contention cannot prevail. The quoted instruction does not negate the clearly imposed duty set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 927.31 and 927.44. Were we to accept this contention fluid skim milk could eventually enter the Marketing Area with no differential being paid with respect to it. As to this Newark Milk counters by noting that any handler in the Marketing Area who received the skim milk would be required by \u00a7 927.31 to establish its source or pay a high rate to the producer-settlement fund. However, the fact that \u00a7 927.31 provides the Administrator with another method of checking on fluid skim milk which enters the Marketing Area does not detract from the duty imposed by \u00a7\u00a7 927.31 and 927.44. Nor does the further argument by Newark Milk that it was not licensed to distribute the milk in New York from its Newark plant and therefore the skim milk in question was not likely to have been disposed of in the Marketing Area, relieve it of its burden to prove ultimate utilization or disposition outside the Marketing Area.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-15\">Newark Milk submits further that for a considerable time prior to the period between June 1954 and March 1955, its records were kept in the same manner as during the time in question. The Market Administrator audited the records then and did not charge a differential for skim milk even though the records of the non-pool plant at Newark did not show the complete disposition of the skim milk. It concedes that the prior failure to charge the differential does not work an estoppel against the Market Administrator to apply the differential here. It does, however, contend that the prior failure indicates that the Market Administrator interpreted \u00a7\u00a7 927.31 and 927.44 as it seeks to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>them construed now. The record affords no evidence as to why the Market Administrator did not impose the differential in the past. Hence the contention is purely speculative. Moreover, the clear provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 927.31 and 927.44 together with their obvious purpose cannot be avoided by what may have been prior administrative lapses.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Finally Newark Milk relies on a decision of the Secretary, Issue No. 9,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> filed December 14, 1953, after public hearings on proposals to amend Order 27 by, among other things, extending the applicability of the differential rate to skim milk in fluid forms outside of the marketing area. It is claimed that this decision \u201ccompletely negates the contention of the Market Administrator that plaintiff [Newark Milk] had to show the utilization outside the Marketing Area * * * [or] the utilization of the skim milk in dispute at Newark, New Jersey.\u201d because it makes clear that disposition at the pool plant was determinative with respect to \u00a7 927.44. There is no design here to apply the fluid skim milk differential \u201cto fluid skim utilization outside the marketing area\u201d as mentioned by the Secretary in the last paragraph of his statement. If anything that paragraph indicates that the burden would remain on the pool plant handler absent the application of the differential to skim milk utilized or disposed of outside the Marketing Area.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">In view of the above we hold that \u00a7\u00a7 927.31 and 927.44 required Newark Milk to establish the ultimate disposition or utilization of the skim milk in question outside the Marketing Area and that it did not satisfy that burden when it established that the skim milk was received at its non-pool plant in Newark.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">The determination of the Market Administrator that the fluid skim milk differential was applicable in this case, under \u00a7\u00a7 927.31 and 927.44 of Order 27, as upheld by the Secretary of Agriculture and the District Court, was in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">Hence the summary judgment of the District Court in favor of the appellee, the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States of America, and the order denying the motion of the appellant, Newark Milk and Cream Company, for summary judgment, will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-6\">.

In brief Order 27 operates in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-13\">Basically milk is classified into three categories according to its uses. Class I is comprised of fluid milk; Class II consists of milk used to produce cream and Class IH, of milk used to produce manufactured products, i. e., butter, cheese, etc. The Market Administrator computes the value of milk used by each pool handler by multiplying the quantity of milk he uses in each class by the class price and adding the results. The values for all handlers are then combined into one total. That amount is decreased or increased by certain subtractions or additions. The result is divided by the total quantity of milk that is priced pursuant to the regulatory program. The figure thus obtained is the basic or uniform price which must be paid to producers for their milk. Thus all producers receive a uniform price irrespective of tbe use to which their milk is put.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-19\">Each handler whose own total use value of milk for a particular delivery period, i. e., a calendar month, is greater than his total payments at the uniform price is required to pay the difference into an equalization or producer-settlement fund. Each handler whose own total value of milk is less than his total payments to producers at uniform price is entitled to withdraw the amount of the difference from the equalization or producer-settlement fund. Thus a composite or uniform price is effectuated by means of the equalization or producer-settlement fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-20\">For a more detailed discussion see United States v.

Modifications of the hearing notice proposal were presented at the hearing including a proposal not to apply the fluid skim differential to skim milk disposed of to food processing plants within the marketing area or under some circumstances to skim milk not shown to have been disposed of outside the marketing area for other than fluid purposes.
