The resin and hardener are separated from each other by a rupturable inner wall which separates the compartments. When the product is to be used, the inner wall is broken and the resin and hardener are mixed together. After mixing, the bag is opened and the mixture is removed therefrom. The mixture cures within a few minutes into a solidified resin having electrical insulating properties. This two-part plastic film package is said to prevent errors in measurement of the resin and hardener at the time of mixture as well as preventing premature contact of these materials. It is designed to provide an easy way to mix and dispense the material and is particularly useful for providing electrical insulation or vapor barrier seals for electrical cables during field installation or repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Applicant uses its mark \u201cUni-Pac\u201d for a unitary package containing a dry charged storage battery of the wet cell type and separate plastic bottles which contain the sulphuric acid so that the electrolyte can be added at the time of purchase to the previously dry charged cells of the battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">It is opposer\u2019s position that the plastic bottles of electrolyte in applicant\u2019s packaged battery unit are similar to its two-compartment plastic bags in that both are plastic, both are used for packaging a premeasured amount of liquid and both are disposable after being emptied of their liquid contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">At the outset we are required to examine the present record to determine what, if any, factors are here present which were not before us in Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Company v. Sprague Electric Company, 1960, 279 P. 2d 281, 283, 47 CCPA 1067, and which involve the nature of opposer\u2019s mark. In the Sprague case we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-10\">\u201c \u2018Unipak\u2019 is used by appellant to identify and describe its container, not the source of its resins. Without exception, the many advertisements and other exhibits that appellant introduced in evidence show that \u2018Unipak\u2019 modifies the container in which the resins are packaged, and that the resins themselves are identified by the mark \u2018Scotchcast.\u2019 *****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-11\">\u201cIt is apparent that appellant is endeavoring to condition the purchasing public to recognize \u2018Scotch-cast\u2019 as the identifying mark of its resins and \u2018Unipak\u2019 as the type of container used for them. We are not convinced that MMM\u2019s registered \u2018Unipak\u2019 mark has been so used that it has acquired trademark significance with respect to the epoxy resins of its manufacture. And, although appellant sells various products to the electrical industry, we find nothing of record which satisfies us that those in that industry are, or will be led to associate appellant\u2019s \u2018Unipak\u2019 mark with any of its products other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>its plastic bags. As such, MMM\u2019s \u2018Unipak\u2019 mark must be considered solely in the light of that for which it was registered, i. e., \u2018Plastic bags used for resinous material having principal usage in electrical insulating and connecting.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Applicant here, as did appellee in the Sprague case, contends that opposer\u2019s mark is used for a plastic bag and that this fact is not changed by the recital in the registration of a usage for such a bag. Opposer took testimony by which it sought to establish that its trademark is not limited in the manner we found it to be in the Sprague case and to show that the mark is used by its customers to refer to the \u201cfast cure\u201d resin in the two-part plastic bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">We do not think the testimony supports opposer\u2019s position. Its own witness, Bollmeier, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">\u201cQ107. Does Minnesota Mining\u2019s trade-mark \u2018Unipak\u2019 have a similar use? That is, does it go to describe more than just the container? A. No, it does not. In no ease do we use the trade-mark \u2018Unipak\u2019 to describe anything other than the two compartment package introduced in Exhibits 4, 5, and 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">\u201cQ108. Does the trade, as you are familiar with it apply the word \u2018Unipak\u2019 to other than the plastic bag of Minnesota Mining? A. No. Our action has been such as to prevent or oppose such usage, because the Unipak container of Scotchcast Resin No. 4 enjoys usage as an individual and separate item in addition to its inclusion in splicing kits which we manufacture and sell under another trade-mark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">\u201cQ109. Have you ever heard any customers of Minnesota Mining refer to these splicing kits as Unipak splicing kits ? A. No, I have not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-9\">\u201cQUO. It is possible that such usage has occurred and not come to your attention? A. It is possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-10\">\u201cQlll. But as far as you know, the Minnesota Mining trade-mark \u2018Unipak\u2019 applies only to the plastic container? A. That is correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">In the light of this testimony, we are unable to agree with the position in op-poser\u2019s brief in discussing the differences between the present case and the Sprague case, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-13\">\u201cThe evidence in this case is also different with respect to the use of appellant\u2019s trade-mark in connection with its product. Here the record clearly shows that appellant\u2019s trademark \u2018Unipak\u2019 is associated with only one member of a \u2018family\u2019 of nineteen different \u2018Scotchcast\u2019 Brand resins, and that it is only this one particular unique resin product which is ordered and referred to by purchasers only by the term \u2018Unipak\u2019. The record shows that appellant\u2019s purchasers do not use the trade-mark \u2018Unipak\u2019 to designate only the type of container in which resin No. 4 is sold. The purchasers and users of this unique product of appellant, a resin within a plastic container, know and specify that product as a \u2018Unipak\u2019, and this well-known trade-mark has become very valuable to appellant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">We find, therefore, that here, as in the Sprague case, opposer\u2019s mark \u201cUnipak\u201d is applied to the two-part plastic bags in which it sells one of its \u201cScotchcast\u201d brand resins.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-15\">We pass now to a consideration of whether applicant\u2019s use of its mark \u201cUni-Pac\u201d on its unitary package containing a storage battery and plastic bottles of electrolyte will be likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception of purchasers as to source or origin of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-16\"> We found in the Sprague case, that the mark \u201cUnipak,\u201d \u201cis so highly suggestive of unit packaging as to be almost descriptive and is therefore not a strong origin indicator.\u201d This is also true here. Opposer and applicant each use the marks in issue as secondary trademarks suggestive of the unit packaging of their goods on which their pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>mary trademarks are used. Under such conditions of use purchasers will not attribute much significance to either op-poser\u2019s or applicant\u2019s mark as indicating the source or origin of those goods. In any event, we do not think applicant\u2019s use of its mark on its storage battery assemblies would lead purchasers to think they had the same source as opposer\u2019s plastic bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">We therefore affirm the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b248-29\">.
