Under the court\u2019s charge the jury was directed to find for the plaintiff if the defendant had been negligent or if it had failed to keep its locomotives in the safe condition required by the Boiler Inspection Act. Defendant now appeals on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of negligence under the FELA and that the FBI A does not impose liability for dangerous conditions created by the temporary presence of foreign matter on its locomotives.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-25\">We conclude that there was sufficient evidence to justify submission of the case to the jury on the issue of negligence. By his own testimony the yard conductor, on discovering plaintiff lying unconscious on the engine platform, noticed that sand and oil were present on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>the front end of the deck. Plaintiff testified that he saw sand in the area, and the fireman testified that he saw sand there in making his routine check of the engine prior to the accident. On this record the jury could find that the railroad, through its employees, either knew or should have known that a dangerously slippery condition existed in the area where plaintiff would pass in the course of his duties. Unless there is a complete absence of probative facts to support the conclusion reached, the jury verdict must stand. Korte v. New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., 2 Cir., 191 F.2d 86, 88, certiorari denied New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co. v. Korte, 342 U.S. 868, 72 S.Ct. 108, 96 L.Ed. 652; Schilling v. Delaware &amp; H. R. Corp., 2 Cir., 114 F.2d 69, 71. The sustained efforts of the Supreme Court majority to preserve the integrity of the jury system, over vigorous dissent that the time taken with these cases was not well spent, show that this verdict is not to be upset. See, e. g., Rogers v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., 352 U.S. 500, 524, 559, 77 S.Ct. 443, 1 L.Ed.2d 493; Gibson v. Thompson, 355 U.S. 18, 78 S.Ct. 2, 2 L.Ed.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Defendant\u2019s second contention is that the FBIA, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 23, imposes liability only for mechanical or structural defects, and not for dangerous conditions caused by the temporary presence of foreign matter. But the statute itself contains no such limitation, and instead requires all locomotives and their parts and appurtenances to be \u201cin proper condition and safe to operate * * * without unnecessary peril to life or limb.\u201d Furthermore, the Supreme Court expressly rejected such a narrow reading of \u00a7 23 in Lilly v. Grand Trunk Western R. Co., 317 U.S. 481, 487-488, 63 S.Ct. 347, 352, 87 L.Ed. 411.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">In the Lilly case the plaintiff had suffered injuries in a fall from the top of a locomotive tender which had become icy in violation of a rule of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Sustaining a jury verdict for plaintiff the Supreme Court said: \u201cThe use of a tender, upon whose top an employee must go in the course of his duties, which is covered with ice seems to us to involve \u2018unnecessary peril to life or limb\u2019- \u2014 enough so as to permit a jury to find that the Boiler Inspection Act has been violated.\u201d 317 U.S. 481, 486, 63 S.Ct. 347, 351. So the use of an engine whose surface has been made slippery by sand and oil may similarly be found by a jury to involve \u201cunnecessary peril to life or limb\u201d in violation of the FBIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">Defendant contends that the Lilly case authorizes recovery for nonstructural or nonmechanical defects only where the dangerous condition results from a violation of an ICC rule. In Lilly the Court, after rejecting the argument that \u00a7 23 did not extend to such defects, referred to certain of the early cases denying liability on which the defendant here also relies,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and stated that \u201c[wjhatever else may be said about the cases relied upon by respondent, they are sufficiently distinguishable in that they either did not involve or did not consider Rule 153 or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>any comparable regulation.\u201d Id., 317 U.S. at page 488, 63 S.Ct. at page 352. But the Court also stated that the jury could have found a violation of \u00a7 23 in the absence of such a rule. Id., 317 U.S. at pages 486, 489, 63 S.Ct. at pages 351, 352. The requirement of safe equipment is set by the statute, not by the rule.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While the Commission has the power to give more definite content to this standard in specific instances by rules, the failure of the Commission so to act does not relieve a carrier of its obligation to meet the statutory requirement of safe equipment as it may be reasonably interpreted by a jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If the Commission had enacted a rule requiring engine platforms to be kept clear of slippery substances, clearly the jury could have concluded that an engine platform made slippery by sand and oil was in an unsafe condition within the meaning of \u00a7 23. The absence of such a rule, which would only be declaratory of common sense, can make no difference to the jury\u2019s right to reach such a conclusion. It would be indeed an anomaly to require enforcement of a Congressional mandate for safe railroad equipment to depend upon the action or nonaction of an administrative agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">We find no persuasive authority since the Lilly case to support the narrow construction of \u00a7 23 for which defendant contends. Defendant relies on Rauden-bush v. Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co., 3 Cir., 160 F.2d 363, where the Third Circuit, distinguishing Lilly as relying on a Commission rule, held that the requirement of \u201csecure sill steps\u201d in 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 11 referred only to mechanical and structural defects, and was not applicable where an employee fell on newly fallen snow. But the applicability of \u00a7 23, which had been ruled out of the case by the district court, was not considered on appeal. Furthermore, in a later opinion by the Third Circuit in Terek v. Conemaugh &amp; Black Lick R. Co., 3 Cir., 231 F.2d 564, 567, where plaintiff alleged but failed to prove that he fell on a slippery foreign substance, the court accepted without dispute plaintiff\u2019s contention that \u201cthe defendant railroad would be responsible [under \u00a7 23] for injury caused by a foreign' substance on the floor of its locomotive regardless of fault.\u201d In that case, as in Delevie v. Reading Co., 3 Cir., 176 F.2d 496, interrogatories were submitted to the jury inquiring whether a slippery foreign substance had made footing unsafe \u2014 a factor suggesting that trial courts in the Third Circuit consider such substances as creating liability under \u00a7 23. Defendant also relies on Camp v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 251 Ala. 184, 36 So.2d 331, which refused to find liability under \u00a7 23 where there was doubt that the fall was caused by grease as alleged and where the grease may well have come from plaintiff\u2019s own shoes. Even that case, however, recognized that the Act would be violated if a locomotive were made unsafe \u201cbecause of the presence of dangerous objects or foreign matter.\u201d 251 Ala. 184, 36 So.2d 331, 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">We think the sounder view is represented by cases holding that dangerous conditions caused by foreign substances give rise to liability under \u00a7 23. In Minehart v. Southern Pac. Co., 136 Cal.App.2d 486, 288 P.2d 999, liability under \u00a7 23 was imposed on the authority of Lilly for a locomotive ladder made greasy by oil. In Zumwalt v. Gardner, 8 Cir., 160 F.2d 298, 304, the jury was permitted to find for the plaintiff if it concluded that dirt was present in the equipment controlling the brakes. In Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Sweat, 5 Cir., 183 F.2d 27, \u00a7 23 was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>violated when a piece of waste in the water tank caused a boiler explosion. In Tisneros v. Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry., 7 Cir., 197 F.2d 466, certiorari denied 344 U.S. 885, 73 S.Ct. 184, 97 L.Ed. 685, the trial court concluded that an icy condition of steps and grab irons could be \u201can unnecessary peril to life or limb\u201d under \u00a7 23, but the court of appeals reversed on another ground without ruling on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">It is clear that a permanently slippery surface would constitute unsafe equipment under 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 23. Bolan v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., 2 Cir., 167 F.2d 934; Louisville &amp; N. R. Co. v. Botts, 8 Cir., 173 F.2d 164. For the reasons stated, we do not think the statute authorizes a different result simply because the dangerous condition is created by the presence of grease and oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-5\">. \u201cFrom various cases denying recovery under the Act respondent attempts to extract a general rule that the Act covers only defects in construction or mechanical operation and affords no protection against the presence of dangerous objects or foreign matter. But there is no warrant in the language of the Act for construing it so narrowly, or for denying the Commission power to remedy shortcomings, other than purely mechanical defects, which may make operation unsafe. The Act without limitation speaks of equipment \u2018in proper condition and safe to operate * * * without unneeessary peril to life or limb.\u2019 Conditions other than mechanical imperfections can plainly render equipment unsafe to operate without unnecessary peril to life or limb.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b449-12\">.

In the light of Lilly v. Grand Trunk Western R. Co., 1943, 317 U.S. 481, 487-488, 63 S.Ct. 347, 87 L.Ed. 411, the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury with reference to plaintiff\u2019s claim of defendant\u2019s liability to him under the Boiler Inspection Act, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 23 was not erroneous. Until that decision is clarified a trial court is justified in charging the jury that the presence of any unstable foreign substance on the exterior of a locomotive, irrespective of how the substance came to be there, conclusively establishes that the railroad, as when a defective boiler explodes, has negligently violated its duty to its employees of providing them with safe places in which to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">Like Judge FRIENDLY, I arrive at this result with great reluctance, and if I did not consider ourselves bound by the language in Lilly v. Grand Trunk Western R. Co., supra, I would reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b451-10\">FRIENDLY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A5T\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">The language of the Boiler Inspection Act, 36 Stat. 913, \u00a7 2 (1911), 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 23, does not suggest to me a Congressional purpose to impose on railroads an absolute duty to keep the surfaces of locomotives and tenders as free from foreign matter at all times, as an operating room before surgery. If the Act does this, I see no way of limiting the requirement to such substances as oil and grease; it must extend also to substances as unavoidable in railroad operation as snow and ice. Such a construction means that railroads face an inevitable conflict between the duty thus imposed, carrying the sanction of a $250 penalty for \u201ceach and every such violation,\u201d 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 34, as well as of liability to employees, and their duty to render reasonable service to passengers and shippers; if the New Haven chose to regard the former as paramount, there would, I fear, be many occasions during the New England winter when we would be bereft of the presence of our colleagues from Connecticut and Vermont. Neither does anything in the legislative history of the Act afford the slightest basis for such a construction ; indeed, it points rather in the opposite direction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If I were free to ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>ercise my own judgment, I should therefore wholly agree with the interpretation given by this Court in Ford v. New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford R. Co., 2 Cir., 1931, 54 F.2d 342, where we affirmed the dismissal of a complaint based on the theory that the mere presence of a foreign substance violated the Safety Appliance and Boiler Inspection Acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Against this we now have Lilly v. Grand Trunk Western R. Co., 1943, 317 U.S. 481, 487-488, 63 S.Ct. 347, 87 L.Ed. 411. That opinion seems to me to shift rather uneasily between the extreme position urged by the plaintiff and embodied in the judge\u2019s instruction here, and a narrower holding based on Interstate Commerce Commission Rule 153. If that decision were our own, I would limit it to the latter ground, see Urie v. Thompson, 1949, 337 U.S. 163, 191, 69 S.Ct. 1018, 93 L.Ed. 1282, believing that any incongruity in having the standard of liability differ according as a practice with respect to locomotives and tenders was or was not required by a rule of the Interstate Commerce Commission was less undesirable than having the standard differ as between the locomotive and tender on the one hand and rolling stock covered by the Safety Appliance Act on the other, see Raudenbush v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co., 3 Cir., 1947, 160 F.2d 363, or as between railroad power plants and those of competitive carriers by land and air who are subject to a liability to their employees that is absolute but limited. However, when the precedent is a decision of the Supreme Court, our handling must be more literal; despite my own belief that the result goes beyond any purpose signified by Congress, I think the interpretive scale comes down slightly on the side that the Lilly opinion went all the way Judge CLARK says. I concur for affirmance solely on that ground; for if the charge with respect to the Boiler Inspection Act was in error, a new trial would be required despite the correctness of the instruction and the adequacy of the evidence under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, United New York and New Jersey Sandy Hook Pilots Ass\u2019n v. Halecki, 1959, 358 U.S. 613, 619, 79 S.Ct. 517, 3 L.Ed.2d 541.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-12\">. The initial debate on the floor of the House indicated that the legislators were primarily concerned with boiler explosions. Representative Mann, chairman of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, which reported the bill, said \u201cIt is the belief of all people concerned, both the railroads and the employees, that the passage of this bill will materially result in the lessening of boiler explosions.\u201d 46 Cong.Rec. 2071 (1911). Representative Robinson spoke of accidents caused by \u201cdefective boilers,\u201d id. at 2072, and Representative Peters of explosions, steam pressure, and the need to inspect boilers from the inside, id. at 2074.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">The broadening of the Act in 1915 was recommended by the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce in a one-page <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>report, S.Rep., 63rd Cong., 3d Sess., No. 1068, which said only:</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u201cThis measure provides for the inspection of the entire locomotive.
