During the period from October 1, 1955, through September 30, 1958, it manufactured and sold receivers, fixed-tuned receivers, power supply units, converters, and speakers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Each article is in a separate cabinet and is sold primarily as amateur radio equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-18\">Section 4141 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4141, imposes a tax upon certain radio equipment. Morrow\u2019s contention is that it does not impose any tax on the equipment which it manufactures. The statute reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b557-19\">\u201cThere is hereby imposed upon the sale by the manufacturer, producer, or importer of the following articles (including in each case parts or accessories therefor sold on or in connection with the sale thereof), a tax equivalent to 10 percent of the price for which so sold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-20\">\u201cRadio receiving sets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-21\">\u201cAutomobile radio receiving sets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-22\">\u201cTelevision receiving sets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-23\">\u201cAutomobile television receiving sets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-24\">\u201cPhonographs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-25\">\u201cCombinations of any of the foregoing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-26\">\u201cRadio and television components.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-27\">\u201cPhonograph records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-28\">Except in the case of radio and television components and phonograph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>records, the tax imposed by this section shall apply only to articles of the entertainment type.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Section 4142 supplements Section 4141 by providing a definition of radio and television components:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">\u201cAs used in section 4141, the term \u2018radio and television components\u2019 means chassis, cabinets, tubes, speakers, amplifiers, power supply units, antennae of the \u2018built-in\u2019 type, and phonograph mechanisms, which are suitable for use on or in connection with, or as component parts of any of the articles enumerated in section 4141, whether or not primarily adapted for such use.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Morrow brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon in an effort to recover $1,658.03 in excise taxes allegedly erroneously paid to the government. The United States denied that the taxes were erroneously paid and in addition counterclaimed for $10,533.60 allegedly due and owing to the government in unpaid taxes. All of the amounts involved were excise taxes assessed under the provisions of \u00a7 4141. The district court found in favor of the government on both contentions, and it is from this decision that the appellant brings this appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">The district court found that the articles in question were not of the \u201centertainment type;\u201d that they were components as defined by the statute and therefore taxable; and that the amount of the tax had been collected from the purchasers so that under the provisions of \u00a7 6416 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 6416, Morrow is not entitled to recover the amounts from the government.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-14\">In the first brief filed by Morrow in this appeal, it was contended that the units which Morrow manufactures are not sold as radio components, but rather that they are sold as complete radio receiving sets within the meaning of \u00a7 4141. If the contention is sound, the articles would not be subject to tax since the statute places a tax only on \u201ccomponents\u201d when the articles manufactured are not of the \u201centertainment type.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The essence of this argument is that though none of the <em>units </em>is a complete radio receiving set, they are sold in groups that are complete radio receiving sets. The district judge found that this was not the case, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence. The record shows that the parts were not sold together in groups which formed radio receiving sets since (1) the purchasers from Morrow would order individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>units rather than operating sets;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (2) that certain of the parts manufactured by Morrow could be used with parts manufactured by other manufacturers in order to form radio receiving sets;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (3) that there are a number of ways in which the parts manufactured by Morrow can be combined in order to form radio receiving sets.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore the trial judge was correct in holding that Morrow was a manufacturer of components within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 4141 and 4142.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">In the second brief that it filed on this appeal, Morrow abandoned this argument and admitted that the radio parts are \u201ccomponents\u201d as the statute defines them. However, it is now contended that the components are not \u201ctaxable components\u201d under the definition set forth in \u00a7 4142 of the statute. This section provides that in order to be taxable the components must be \u201csuitable for use on or in connection with, or as component parts of, any of the articles enumerated in section 4141, whether or not primarily adapted for such use.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Morrow now argues that the parts manufactured are not suitable for use as component parts of a radio receiving set, for they can not be joined together in a single cabinet in order to form a self-contained radio receiving set. This argument presupposes that the radio receiving sets referred to by the statute must be contained in a single cabinet. We do not feel that an examination of the present statute and its predecessors supports the position that Morrow advances. In so deciding we accept the fact that the parts which Morrow manufactures can not be combined together within a single cabinet, or at least are not suitable to be so combined.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-19\">The first statute to impose a tax on radio receiving apparatus was passed in 1932.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The text of that statute reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-20\">\u201cThere is hereby imposed upon the following articles, sold by the manufacturer, producer, or importer, a tax equivalent to 5 per centum of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>price for which so sold: Chassis, cabinets, tubes, reproducing units, power packs, and phonograph mechanisms, suitable for use in connection with or as part of radio receiving sets or combination radio and phonograph sets (including in each case parts or accessories therefor sold on or in connection therewith or with the sale thereof), and records for phonographs. A sale of any two or more of the above articles shall, for the purpose of this section, be considered a sale of each separately.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">The statute set forth above makes the tax applicable only to components, but neither the statute itself nor any regulations promulgated thereunder says that to be taxable the components must be capable of being used as parts of radio receiving sets contained within a single cabinet. The wording of the statute set out above corresponds very closely to the definition of components that is set out in \u00a7 4142 of the present statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">In 1941 the taxing statute was amended and by expressly including radio receiving sets came closer to the form of the statute that is now under consideration :<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">\u201cThere shall be imposed upon the following articles (including in each case, except in the case of musical instruments, parts or accessories therefor sold on or in connection with the sale thereof) sold by the manufacturer, producer, or importer a tax equivalent to 10 per centum of the price for which sold:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">\u201c(a) Radio receiving sets, automobile radio receiving sets, combination radio and phonograph sets, and phonographs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-12\">\u201c(b) Chassis, cabinets, tubes, reproducing units, power packs, antennae of the \u2018built-in\u2019 type, and phonograph mechanisms, which are suitable for use on or in connection with, or as component parts of, any of the articles enumerated in subsection (a), whether or not primarily adapted for such use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-13\">\u201c(c) Phonograph records.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-14\">\u201c(d) Musical instruments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-15\">The major change that the 1941 act made was the addition of the term \u201cradio receiving sets.\u201d Subsection (b), as quoted above, retains the tax on components that was imposed by the 1932 act, and the use of terms similar to those used in the 1932 act would indicate that the Congress intended that this subsection retain the same scope that it enjoyed under the 1932 act. There is no suggestion that the components must be suitable for use on or with or as parts of radio sets contained in a single cabinet.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-16\">Section 4142 of the present code defines taxable components in almost exactly the same language that was used in the 1941 act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This would indicate that the Congress again intended to allow the same scope of taxation that had been encouraged by the earlier acts. There is nothing in the statute set forth in the 1954 code to suggest that the Congress intended to redefine taxable components to mean only those components that may be used as parts of radio sets that are contained in a single cabinet. There is nothing to suggest that the 1955 amendment to \u00a7 4141 was intended to effectuate such a change.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>This being the reasonable interpretation of the statute, we feel that the judgment of the district court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">In view of this holding it becomes unnecessary to decide whether Morrow is also barred from recovery by \u00a7 6416,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> for we would reach that question only if we determined that the components manufactured by Morrow were not taxable under \u00a7 4141. The appellant contends that the district court was in error in holding that the burden of proof was upon Morrow to show that the burden of the tax had not been passed on to the purchaser of the radio equipment. We expressly refrain from passing on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-14\">. The receivers are the Falcon (Exhibit 9-A) and the MBR-5 (Exhibit 9-B). Both are designed to receive transmissions on the five amateur bands, and in addition the Falcon is designed to receive transmissions on the standard broadcast band. Neither of these units is designed as a complete radio receiving set, and neither will operate unless connected to a power supply unit, an antenna and a speaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-15\">The fixed-tuned receiver is the FTR (Exhibit 9-0) and is designed to receive transmissions only on a single wave length. Like the receivers, it will not operate unless connected to a power supply unit, an antenna and a speaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-16\">The power supply units are the RAP 250-S (Exhibit 9-D) and the RVP (Exhibit 9-E). The RAP 250-S is designed to convert commercial voltages into voltages usable with radio receivers, and it also has a built-in speaker. The RVP converts voltages from automobile batteries into voltages usable with radio receivers. Neither one is a complete radio receiving apparatus.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-30\">The converters, namely, the 5BR, 5BR-2, 5BRLN and 5-BRF (the 5-BRF is in evidence as Exhibit 9-F), are designed for use with fixed-tuned receivers but also may be hooked into a standard broadcast receiver to make a combination shortwave and standard broadcast receiving set. It is incapable of producing, sound by itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-31\">The speaker (Exhibit 9-G) is conceded to be a taxable component as it is capable of being used as a part of any radio receiving set.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b558-7\">. The last sentence of this section was enacted by the 84th Congress and became effective on September 1, 1955 (Pub.L. No. 367, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., Aug. 11, 1955). The statute was restored to its original form by the Excise Tax Technical Changes Act of 1958, 72 Stat. 1275. The restoration became effective on January 1, 1959.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b558-9\">.

Yes, we sell them separately.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b559-7\">.

Taken separately, really none of them do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-13\">\u201cQ. Which of those, if any, in combination would constitute a radio receiving set within your definition? A. Well, there are several possible orientations. I would say that the radio receivers of Type -A or -B plus one of the power supply units which would be -D or -E, plus a speaker. Now, I might say that there are several permutations among this group. That is, power supply unit Type -D has a speaker attached to it; therefore, I could use -A and -D or -B and -D and have a radio receiving set * * *_\u00bb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-22\">There is one more combination that would be possible, if you want this much detail. Type -F, which I think is the converter unit, plus Type -O, the receiver, plus either of the power supplies, and again if we use power supply -D we do not need an external speaker. If we use power supply -E, we do need an external speaker.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b559-23\">.
