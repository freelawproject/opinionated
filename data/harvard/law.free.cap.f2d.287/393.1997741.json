The subject of the appeal is an order of the District Judge denying the motion of the appellant, Frank Guy, to vacate his sentence under Section 2255, Title 28 U.S.C. The motion was denied without a hearing, for the reason that, \u201cthe files and records conclusively show that the defendant is entitled to no relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-24\">The appeal was submitted to the Court upon briefs on behalf of the appellant, the brief and appendix of the appellee, and oral arguments of counsel for the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-25\">Upon consideration of the issues presented by the appeal, we conclude that the motion raised questions of fact which-could only be determined by a hearing in open court, at which the defendant-appellant is entitled to be heard.
