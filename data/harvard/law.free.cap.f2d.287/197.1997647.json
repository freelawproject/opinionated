United States Senior District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, designated to participate <em>in place of Judge O\u2019Connell, </em>pursuant to provisions of Section 294(d), Title 28 U.S.C.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b251-23\">RICH, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b251-24\">Waldes Kohinoor, Inc. applied on December 6, 1957, for registration of \u201cQAF\u201d on the Principal Register as a trademark for \u201cfasteners of the bolt and nut type,\u201d claiming use since June 1, 1957. (Application Ser. No. 41,955.) Registration was successfully opposed by Illinois Tool Works and applicant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-26\">The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board found (123 U.S.P.Q. 550) that op-poser was a prior user of \u201cQ Fasteners\u201d on a \u201cline\u201d of quick-acting cowl fasteners of a rotary operated type, selling three types under the designations \u201cQ-l,\u201d \u201cQ-2,\u201d and \u201cQ-4\u201d and in addition was using the notation \u201cQR\u201d to identify quick-releasing attaching devices. \u201cQ-Fasteners\u201d was registered to opposer on December 24, 1957, Reg. No. 655,979, after appellant filed but before the filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>of the opposition. The board concluded that \u201cpurchasers are likely to assume that applicant\u2019s \u2018QAF\u2019 fasteners are additional products in opposer\u2019s line of \u2018Q Fasteners\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The board also expressed the opinion that \u201cthere is nothing in the record which would tend to indicate that in the trade and to purchasers generally it [the notation \u201cQ Fasteners\u201d] has any significance other than as an indication of origin for opposer\u2019s fasteners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">To set the record straight, opposer\u2019s evidence shows that it <em>features </em>in its line of \u201cQuick Fasteners,\u201d which is the cover title on its catalog, which cover also is headed by the registered trademark \u201cFastex,\u201d not \"Q-l,\u201d \u201cQ-2\u201d and \u201cQ-4\u201d as stated by the board, but \u201cQ Fastener-One,\u201d \u201cQ Fastener-Two\u201d and \u201cQ Fastener-Four.\u201d These designations, involving a special typographical design, are used as page headings throughout the catalog, on the various sections thereof, along with the running head <em>\u201cFastex </em>Quick Fasteners.\u201d In the catalog text reference is made to \u201cFastex Q-One\u201d fasteners, \u201cFastex Q-Two\u201d and \u201cFastex Q-Four\u201d and <em>occasionally </em>the numerical designations are used, as mentioned by the board, both with and without \u201cFas-tex.\u201d The board\u2019s statement of the facts is therefore an oversimplification.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Opposer put in evidence the December 25, 1958, issue of \u201cMachine Design\u201d containing a special \u201cDesign Guide\u201d section on 67 commercial \u201cQuick-Operating Fasteners\u201d (pages 85-100). Under the heading \u201cRotary-Operated Types\u201d there appear, among over thirty other fasteners, appellant\u2019s \u201cQAF\u201d followed by op-poser\u2019s \u201cQ-Four,\u201d \u201cQ-One,\u201d \u201cQR\u201d and \u201cQ-Two.\u201d The juxtaposition of applicant\u2019s and opposer\u2019s marks is due, incidentally, to an alphabetical arrangement and the next item after opposer\u2019s four fasteners is the \u201cQuick-Lock\u201d of a third party. This evidence also serves to make it clear that appellant and op-poser are competitors in the same business. The record shows also that they have the same classes of customers.</p>\n<p id=\"A87\">\u201cQuick Fasteners,\u201d which is the generic name in this field, appear to get their name from the fact that many of them are locked or released by a quarter or 90\u00b0 turn. \u201cQ\u201d, being the initial letter of the descriptive word \u201cquick,\u201d does not appear to be entirely arbitrary when applied to such goods. Opposer\u2019s catalogs on \u201cQR\u201d fasteners demonstrate the source of that designation by printing under it, with an asterisk reference to \u201cQR,\u201d the words \u201c \u2019Quick Release Fastener,\" printing the initial letters we have emphasized in a lighter color than the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">We will not speculate as to what, if any, meaning is to be attached to appellant\u2019s \u201cQAF\u201d mark beyond quoting the words 'which appear on the specimen label attached to the application which are, \u201cRotary, quick acting, high strength fastener.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">The uses by the opposer referred to above are all in catalogs. Opposer put two price lists in evidence, one headed \u201cFastex* Q-2 Quick Fasteners *TM,\u201d the first asterisk being footnoted with a reference to \u201cT.M. Reg. U.S. Pat Off.\u201d The second is headed \u201cNet Prices Fastex Q-One* Fasteners (\u2019Trademark).\u201d Both lists are dated October 16, 1958, and bear the name \u201cFastex Division, Illinois Tool Works.\u201d The only evidence of use on the goods themselves is a 2%\" by 4\" card with \u201cFastex\u201d on it in large letters under a list of 7 products with check boxes. The second item in the list of products is \u201cQ Fasteners TM.\u201d The testimony shows that these cards were put in with shipments of fasteners and checked as to the name of the goods. The heading on the card is \u201cTesting Samples Of:\u201d and on the back is a list of patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">The registration opposer relies on here is for a mark consisting of a large letter \u201cQ\u201d in double outline with the word \u201cfasteners\u201d in much smaller type superposed so that the letters \u201cfas\" appear inside the \u201cQ\u201d with the remaining letters extending over and beyond to the right. Pursuant to statute, Sec. 6 of the Lan-ham Act (15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1056), the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>\u201cfasteners\u201d is disclaimed apart from the mark as shown. \u201cFasteners\u201d is of course completely descriptive of the goods and by itself is devoid of trademark significance. The expression \u201cQ Fasteners\u201d as used in the exhibits involves a typographical design entirely different from that of the registration but equally distinctive. Invariably what is emphasized as being the trademark is the complete expression \u201cQ Fastener\u201d and not the letter \u201cQ\u201d alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The sole issue is likelihood of confusion under section 2(d) of the statute and since the goods of the parties for the purposes of this case must be deemed to be the same, the decision turns on the effect of the parties\u2019 marks on purchasers \u2014 whether they will be likely to confuse or deceive or mislead those purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Opposer\u2019s brief sets down in ordinary type \u201cQAF fasteners\u201d and \u201cQ Fasteners\u201d in juxtaposition and then argues that they differ by only two letters, look alike, and sound alike. However, when we compare opposer\u2019s registration and actual uses with what appellant seeks to register, namely \u201cQAF,\u201d opposer\u2019s argument is depleted of most of its force.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">It is not disputed that these quick-operating or quick-releasing fasteners are sold to the automotive, aircraft, military and similar industrial users for incorporation in their products. In other words they are bought by engineers and technically sophisticated purchasing agents from catalogs, according to specifications, or through sales engineers and with the advice and assistance of such persons as opposer\u2019s witness, O. Jules Poupitch, a development engineer who spent 30% of his time in sales, who testified :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-9\">\u201cXQ68. All of these companies, electric, auto, aircraft, appliance that use Q-l, Q-2 or Q-4 fasteners are original equipment manufacturers, aren\u2019t they? A. Predominantly so, I would think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-10\">\u201cXQ69. And your advertising and publicity and sales efforts are all directed at original equipment manufacturers, is that correct? A. It is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-11\">\u201cXQ70. And from your experience they are very careful about what they order to put into their articles of production, is that correct? A. Those that are successful I think are very careful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">\u25a0 Taking into account the differences between appellant\u2019s mark \u201cQAF\u201d and the marks registered or used by opposer, the nature of the goods and their market, the necessary competence and discrimination of the people who purchase them, and the obvious relation between the letter \u201cQ\u201d and the common descriptive word \u201cquick\u201d actually used in connection with these fasteners in the trade, we believe that there is no likelihood of confusion within the meaning of the trademark statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">Opposer logically contends that the best evidence of likelihood of confusion is actual confusion and makes a feeble effort to persuade us there has been actual confusion. The totality of the evidence relied on is in the cross-examination of opposer\u2019s witness Poupitch as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-14\">\u201cXQ93. Have you ever heard of anyone asking for a Q fastener when he wanted a QAF fastener? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-15\">\u201cXQ94. And do you' have any records of any such thing? A. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvK\">Opposer\u2019s counsel did not follow up on this line of examination or attempt to offer any other proof of confusion. Moreover, we think the foregoing testimony is of little weight when read with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-16\">\u201cXQ45. You see no orders? A. I don\u2019t see the order. That is an administrative part of the business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-18\">\u201cXQ46. Then you don\u2019t know how these people order these fasteners, is that correct? A. They must order them by catalog number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-19\">\u201cXQ47. But you don\u2019t know that? A. No, not specifically. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-20\">\u201cXQ48. And you don\u2019t know what names they use, then, either, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>do you? A. Oh, yes, that I know. Oftentimes an order comes in and asks for a Q fastener without details. Then we have to explain to them, \u201cWhat Q fastener do you want? What type?\u201d Or this or that. In other words, the name Q has become pretty well known.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-4\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-5\">\u201cXQ55. When a person, a purchasing agent, chooses a Q fastener, or, let us say, Q-l fastener, he is aware of the differences between that and the Q-2 fastener, isn\u2019t he? A. Invariably, they are familiar with the difference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">\u201cXQ56. And also with the differences between that and the Q-4 fastener, is that right ? A. That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">\u201cXQ57. And the difference between that and the QR fastener, is that right? A. I would think so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">It seems to us that this testimony is not consistent with the board\u2019s view that the record contains nothing to indicate that opposer\u2019s notation \u201cQ Fasteners\u201d has no significance except to designate origin. \u201cFasteners\u201d is purely descriptive and assuming that \u201cQ\u201d does indicate origin, it clearly functions in addition, together with a number, as a type designation wherein \u201cQ\u201d comes very close to being an obvious abbreviation of the descriptive word \u201cquick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">Under the above indicated market conditions we see no likelihood of purchaser confusion, deception, or mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"Amj\">The decision below is <em>reversed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A4K\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
