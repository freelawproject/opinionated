After being conditionally released from the aforesaid penitentiary, the petitioner was arrested and recommitted for a parole violation occurring more than 180 days before the expiration of his maximum term upon a warrant issued within the 180-day period. The trial court held that underHhe provisions of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4164,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Parole Board did not have jurisdiction to issue a warrant and retake a conditionally released prisoner after the expiration of his maximum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>term less 180 days. Under similar facts, we held to the contrary in Taylor v. Godwin, 10 Cir., 284 F.2d 116, and Taylor v. Portwood, 10 Cir., 284 F.2d 952.</p>\n<p id=\"AXf\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-14\">. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4164 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-15\">\u201cA prisoner having served Ms term or terms less good-time deductions shall, upon release, be deemed as if released on parole until the expiration of the maximum term or terms for which he was sentenced less one hundred and eighty days.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
