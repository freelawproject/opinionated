Lawson, 347 U.S. 334, 336, 74 S.Ct. 555, 557, 98 L.Ed. 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Here the decedent continued to furnish support for Beatrice and he treated her as an object of his concern, even though he had technically deserted her. The fact that she found other fleeting but impermanent domestic attachments did not prevent her from meeting the requirement of the Act which, as construed by the Supreme Court, is \u201cthat she must continue to live as the deserted wife of the (decedent).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
