Appellant, who seeks to be released from St. Elizabeths Hospital, appeals from the judgment of the District Court denying his petition. The court found that Curry had been validly committed pursuant to Section 301(d) of Title 24, D.C.Code (Supp. VIII, 1960); that he is presently suffering from an abnormal mental condition, and would be dangerous to himself and others if released; and that the respondent hospital superintendent was not arbitrary or capricious in recommending that release be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Appellant was indicted in 1957 for assault and mayhem. He was examined at St. Elizabeths Hospital, by order of the District Court, and found mentally incompetent to stand trial. After some 13 months at St. Elizabeths, he was found competent to assist his counsel, and was tried in the District Court. At the trial, the defense of insanity was the only one raised. The defendant\u2019s counsel, retained by him, called two psychiatrists who had examined him at the hospital. Both testified that <em>he had a chronic brain </em>syndrome, as well as a psychosis. The Government had no medical evidence to offer. It put on the stand the two complaining witnesses, who had been brutally attacked and grieviously injured,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a policeman. These three said Curry had appeared \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201crational\u201d on the day of the offense. The jury found Curry guilty. Appellant\u2019s counsel then moved for judgment of acquittal by reason of insanity, notwithstanding the verdict. After a hearing, the trial judge denied the motion, but <em>sua sponte </em>granted leave to appeal in forma pauperis. Appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of three to ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">On appeal to this court (our No. 14,902), appellant's retained counsel, who had represented him at the trial, filed a brief raising only two points: first, that the judge had erred in telling the jury, in his charge, that appellant had been found competent to stand trial;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> second, that the judge had erred in refusing to grant appellant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict of acquittal by reason of insanity. The brief concluded with a prayer that this court \u201creverse the conviction and remand the case to the U. S. District Court with instructions to enter a verdict of \u2018Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity.\u2019 \"</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">The Government thereupon filed a confession of error as to the first point, and asked the court to remand the case for a new trial. Appellant\u2019s retained counsel then filed a document urging the court to rule on the second point raised on appeal, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">\u201cIf, as appellant urges, the Court erred in failing to enter a judgment of acquittal n. o. v., he is entitled to have this Court remedy this error now; he should not be forced to undergo another trial unless and until the instant Court finds that the Government sustained its burden of proving his sanity as required under the decisions of this Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">Another pleading was then filed by the Government, concluding that \u201can instruction to the lower court to enter a judgment of acquittal by reason of insanity would be an appropriate means of securing to appellant the relief he requests.\u201d A reply was filed by appellant\u2019s counsel, stating that \u201cappellant entirely concurs\u201d in the Government\u2019s proposal, and joins in the Government\u2019s request that \u201cthe matter be remanded with instructions to <em>enter a </em>judgment of acquittal by reason of insanity.\u201d This court, on March 17, 1959, entered an order in conformity with the parties\u2019 joint motion. On April 13, 1959, the District Court entered an\u2019 order committing Curry to St. Elizabeths Hospital, pursuant to Section 301 of Title 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">On February 15, 1960, Curry filed a petition in the .District Court, alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>that he was illegally confined in St. Eliza-beths, and asking the court to appoint an attorney to represent him. The court appointed Mr. Charles W. Halleck as counsel. A hearing was held on March 2, on the petition and respondent\u2019s answer. Curry appeared and testified, saying, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\">\u201cQ. Did there come a time when you were sent over to St. Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">\u201cQ. And was that because, to your knowledge, because of some action taken by the Court of Appeals ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">\u201cQ. Mr. Curry, today are you insane, or [of] unsound mind, or do you suffer from any abnormal mental condition? A. No, sir, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">\u201cQ.. Now, one other thing, Mr. Curry. At the time the' Court of Appeals returned this case, is it your understanding that they returned the case to the District Court in such fashion that you were committed to St. Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital or confined in St. Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital? \u25a0 A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">\u201cQ. Now, were you advised, before that occurred, that you could have had an entirely new trial in which you might have been entirely acquitted of the charges? A. , No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">\u201cQ. Did you make any choice between a new trial in which you could \u2022 have been entirely acquitted of the charges and the action. which was taken, namely, sending-you over to St. Elizabeth\u2019s Hospital? A. No, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">Curry also testified that when he had first been sent to St. Elizabeths (to determine his capacity to stand trial) he had told a series of falsehoods to the psychiatrists, concerning alleged headaches and hallucinations, in an effort to \u201cbug out,\u201d i. e., establish his insanity defense. The Government introduced medical testimony to the effect that Curry was still suffering from a brain defect, though his psychosis was considered to be in remission, and that he would be dangerous to himself and others if released. Instances of Curry\u2019s violence to others at the hospital were described,</p>\n<p id=\"b193-15\">On this appeal, appellant\u2019s present counsel attacks the District Court\u2019s order, denying relief, on several scores. He urges that Curry\u2019s confinement was not in compliance with Section 24-301, and hence is illegal; that the section is unconstitutional in its application to Curry\u2019s case; and that Curry proved, to the extent possible to one in his circumstances, that he has no mental abnormality justifying his continued confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-16\">We do not discount the weight and seriousness of these arguments. However, the general question of the constitutionality of Section 24-301 has been decided favorably to the validity of the statute. Ragsdale v. Overholser, 1960, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 308, 281 F.2d 943; Overholser v. Russell, 1960, 108 U.S.App.D.C. 400, 283 F.2d 195. And we find nothing in the present case that would remove appellant from the scope of those decisions. The circumstances of Curry\u2019s commitment were, of course, unusual. But this is not a case in which it can be said that Curry has been coim. mitted to .St. Elizabeths by reason- of. the acts of his attorney rather than his own. acts. He was present in the trial court when the defense-of insanity was raised; .present.when the psychiatrists testified as his witnesses, in the way he desired them ,to testify; and present when his counsel urged the court, to direct a verdict of acquittal by reason of insanity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Having thus elected to make himself a member of 'that \u201cexceptional\u2019 class\u201d of persons who seek verdicts of not guilty by reason of insanity, see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Overholser v. Leach, 1958, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 289, 257 F.2d 667, certiorari denied, 1959, 359 U.S. 1013, 79 S.Ct. 1152, 3 L.Ed.2d 1038, he cannot now be heard to complain of the statutory consequences of his election. The question whether the District Court erred in denying his prayer for direction of such a verdict was the principal question raised on appeal to this court. Appellant\u2019s counsel filed a brief making a strong case that error had been committed, and urged this court to rectify it by directing the trial court to enter a judgment of acquittal by reason of insanity. The Government agreed. The resulting judgment stands as a final judgment. No direct attack upon it is possible. The collateral attack now being made rests on appellant\u2019s statement that he was not informed that a possible alternative to his commitment was to ask for a new trial. But that was not a meaningful alternative. The testimony was clear that appellant had committed the acts charged in the indictment. At a second trial his only possible defense would be insanity. Any chance that a jury would after a second trial acquit him completely and put him on the street was minuscule. By this court\u2019s order Curry was given exactly what he had asked the District Court to give him, namely, a judgment of acquittal by reason of insanity. Our order was a valid exercise of our authority. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 (1958); Douglas v. United States, 1956, 99 U.S.App.D.C. 232, 239 F.2d 52; Isaac v. United States, 1960, 109 U.S.App.D.C. -, 284 F.2d 168; Calloway v. United States, 1959, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 141, 270 F.2d 334; Wright v. United States, 1957, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 36, 250 F.2d 4; Fielding v. United States, 1957, 102 U.S.App.D.C. 167, 251 F.2d 878. We hold, therefore, that Curry was validly committed under Section 24-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Curry is entitled, of course, to challenge his confinement in the instant habeas corpus proceeding, and to establish (if he can) his present eligibility for release, under the conditions laid down by the statute. Cf. Overholser v. Leach, supra. Appellant, an indigent, argues that he is handicapped in this regard by not having available to him private psychiatrists to testify as to his present mental condition. We recognized this difficulty and dealt with it, in De Marcos v. Overholser, 78 U.S.App.D.C. 131, 137 F.2d 698, certiorari denied, 1943, 320 U.S. 785, 64 S.Ct. 157, 88 L.Ed. 472, and Overholser v. De Marcos, 80 U.S.App.D.C. 91, 149 F.2d 23, certiorari denied, 1945, 325 U.S. 889, 65 S.Ct. 1579, 89 L.Ed. 2002. In these cases, we said that \u201can inmate of St. Elizabeths Hospital petitioning for habeas corpus might demand the expert testimony of members of the Commission on Mental Health, or that the court on its own motion might require it. This gives any inmate of St. Elizabeths the protection of a diagnosis by independent experts.\u201d See 80 U.S.App.D.C. at page 93, 149 F.2d at page 25. We think this relief is available to all indigent inmates of the hospital, including those committed under Section 24-301<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> No such relief, however, was requested in this case. And we do not think the record here justifies action on our part directing the District Court to reopen the proceedings to permit it to be sought. Curry received due process of law. The doctors who testified at the habeas corpus proceedings were among those whom he had called as witnesses in his own behalf at his trial. They were thoroughly familiar with his history and his behavior at the hospital. Their conclusions were clear and positive as to Curry\u2019s present condition and the probability of his being dangerous if released. Able cross-examination sought to cast doubt on the validity of their conclusions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>But the doubt is not sufficient to justify us in setting aside the findings of the District Judge, who heard their testimony and accepted their conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed, without prejudice to a second habeas corpus proceeding, brought after a reasonable period of time has elapsed, see Stewart v. Over-holser, 1950, 87 U.S.App.D.C. 402, 186 F.2d 339, at which testimony of the sort described in the De Marcos cases may be received.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-7\">. One of the victims was totally blinded in one eye, partially blinded in the other, and facially scarred. The other victim received facial scars.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b192-13\">. Citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244 (1958), and Taylor v.

At sentencing, when the judge called upon Curry to speak, he replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-13\">\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to say, Your Honor. I would like <em>to go to </em>the hospital. I feel I am still sick and the hospital helps me a whole <em>lot. I </em>would like to go back and I would like to go there if I have to do time. I would like to do it there.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b194-6\">. The petitioning inmate who seeks such relief must, of course, voluntarily submit to such examination or examinations by the Mental Health Commission as it deems necessary. In exceptional cases, it may be that the court can order him to submit. Cf. De Marcos v. Overholser, supra 78 U.S.App.D.C. at page 133, 137 F.2d at page 700. Non-indigent inmates, if good cause is shown, should also be entitled to relief under De Marcos.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
