His discharge from that position was upheld by the Civil Service Commission. It is agreed that the statute authorized his discharge only to \u201cpromote the efficiency of the service.\u201d Veterans\u2019 Preference Act of 1944 \u00a7 14, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-24\">Appellant contends that a \u201csatisfactory\u201d rating received subsequent to the charged acts of insubordination demonstrates that his discharge did not satisfy the statutory criterion. But we have held that \u201cthough an employee\u2019s ordinary over-all performance of duties throughout the rating period may be rated as satisfactory he may still be guilty of conduct in connection with the execution of his official duties * * * which would justify dismissal * * * in the interest of promoting the efficiency of the service.\u201d Thomas v. Ward, 1955, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 302, 304, 225 F.2d 953, 955, certiorari denied 1956, 350 U.S. 958, 76 S.Ct. 348, 100 L.Ed. 833. See also Jones v. Hobby, 1955, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 53, 223 F.2d 345.
