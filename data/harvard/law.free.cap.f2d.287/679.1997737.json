Buckeye Steamship Company, 183 F.Supp. 644, held that there is no requirement of nationwide uniformity in connection with the commerce clause, such as exists in respect of duties, imposts and excise taxes, Currin v. Wallace, 306 U.S. 1, 13-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>14, 59 S.Ct. 379, 83 L.Ed. 441; that Congess in enacting legislation has the power to classify, in the exercise of which it has a broad discretion, and that it is for Congress and not the courts to balance the advantages and disadvantages of the classification which it makes, Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483, 487, 75 S.Ct. 461, 99 L.Ed. 563; and that in enacting the legislation under attack Congress had before it adequate factual data upon which to base its decision as to the need and desirability of legislation; and that it did not act arbitrarily or without rational basis in making the requirement applicable only to tugs on the Great Lakes. Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., 306 U.S. 583, 594, 59 S.Ct. 744, 83 L.Ed. 1001; Detroit Bank v. United States, 317 U.S. 329, 338, 63 S.Ct. 297, 87 L.Ed. 304; N. L. R. B. v.
