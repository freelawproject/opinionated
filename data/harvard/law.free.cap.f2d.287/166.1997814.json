He correctly says that the solution of this controversy can best be found by deciding where the collision took place between the motor car and the truck. He fixed it \u201cat a point some 40 feet east thereof\u201d: i. e. 40 feet \u201ceast of the west boundary of the northbound lane of Third Avenue.\u201d If so, the truck had very nearly passed across the northbound lane whose width is 63 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-20\">The plaintiff claims to have proved contributory negligence because the truck driver did not see the motor car coming up the north lane, which must have been in plain sight had he looked to the right after he passed the \u201cstop signal,\u201d and before he had himself entered the north lane. That is true, but it does not necessarily prove that the postal truck was at fault. The case falls within \u00a7 1142 of the New York Vehicle and Traffic Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 71 which sets the duty of a driver \u201capproaching a stop sign,\u201d as the driver of the postal truck had done. He is to \u201cyield the right of way to any vehicle which has entered the intersection from another highway or which is approaching so closely on said highway as to constitute an immediate hazard, but said driver having so yielded may proceed.\u201d With this section we are to read \u00a7 1140(b): \u201cWhen two vehicles enter an intersection from different highways at approximately the same time the driver * * * on the left shall yield the right of way to the vehicle on the right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-21\">In the case at bar the only testimony was that the speed of the postal truck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>was not over five miles an hour while crossing the north lane of Third Avenue, and that the speed of the motor car was over twenty-five miles an hour. As we have said, the truck had crossed 40 of the 63 feet of the north lane. If so, it follows that when the two cars came within sight of each other the motor car was moving four or five times as fast as the truck and was not an \u201cimmediate ha2;ard.\u201d The truck\u2019s driver having stopped at the sign was entitled to \u201cproceed.\u201d Plainly \u00a7 1140(b) did not apply for the two cars could not have entered the \u201cintersection from different highways at approximately the same time,\u201d and the motor car should have yielded the right of way to the postal truck which had already \u201centered the intersection.\u201d \u00a7 1140(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
