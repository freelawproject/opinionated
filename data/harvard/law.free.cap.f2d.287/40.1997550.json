The decision of the Tax Court is reported at 33 T.C. 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-25\">We believe that the cases here involved are controlled by the teachings in Knetsch v. United States, 364 U.S. 361, 81 S.Ct. 132, 5 L.Ed.2d 128, decided November 14, 1960. In Knetsch the Supreme Court examined the transaction between Knetsch and the insurance company in order to determine whether it created an \u201cindebtedness\u201d within the meaning of Section 23(b), or whether, as the trial court found, it was a sham. Following such examination the Supreme Court stated at page 366 of 364 U.S., at page 135 of 81 S.Ct., \u201cFor it is patent that there was nothing of substance to be realized by Knetsch from this trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>action beyond a tax deduction.\u201d On the whole record before us in these cases, it is likewise patent to us that from the transactions between the petitioners and the brokerage firm with which they dealt that there was nothing of substance to be realized by petitioners beyond tax deductions. Accordingly the decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-16\">. Internal Revenue Code of 1939:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-17\">\u201cSec. 23.
