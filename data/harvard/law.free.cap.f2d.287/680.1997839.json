After a full hearing the District Judge over-ruled this motion and appellant complains of that action and raises for the first time the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-24\">We are unable to say, as a matter of law, that the evidence was not sufficient to support the verdict of the jury or that the District Judge abused his discretion in over-ruling the appellant\u2019s motion. Hence, this judgment should be and is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
