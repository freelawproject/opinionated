During that period, the Gatlins employed between 70 and 100 men. About half of the lumber which they produced was shipped in interstate commerce. It is stipulated that their employees were covered by the Act except for the employees who were claimed by the Gatlins to be excluded by the forestry exemption of the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The appellants\u2019 claims of error fall into three classes:</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">1. That the district court erred in law and in fact in finding employees Mack Lee, A. N. (Ab) Bell and Ollie Jones to be forestry employees within the meaning of Section 213(a) (15),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that, accordingly, the total number of forestry employees was always within the statutory limit for the application of the forestry exemption;</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">2. That the district court committed errors of fact concerning violations (a) as to laborers at the planer and sawmill, (b) as to the lumber stackers, and (c) as to the \u201ckey\u201d salaried employees;</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">3. That appellants\u2019 operations and violations are not of such a nature as to warrant the issuance of an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">The Forestry Exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"Agp\">Appellants\u2019 principal contention is that Mack Lee, A. N. (Ab) Bell and Ollie Jones were not employed in \u201cforestry or lumbering operations\u201d within the meaning of Section 213(a) (15).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Excluding those three- employees, it is agreed that during 26 of the 52 pay periods involved, there were 11 forestry employees, and during 22 of such pay periods there were 10 such employees. During the remaining 4 of such pay periods, the number of such employees, including those three, did not exceed the statutory limit of twelve.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-19\">The district court found \u201cthat the duties performed by Mack Lee, Ollie Jones, and A. N. (Ab) Bell make it necessary to include those employees in the total of the employees engaged in the defendants\u2019 forestry or lumbering operations.\u201d Lee and Bell did much the same work. They checked the activities of the logging crews who were employees of two small sawmills which cut timber for the Gatlins in DeSoto National Forest. Lee and Bell were there to make sure \u201cthat the lumber, that the trees they are cutting are getting to them, and the lumber getting on to Mr. Gatlin.\u201d Mr. Lee also supervised the cutting of pulpwood by independent contractors on the Government land. Lee testified on this phase of his work as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-20\">\u201cQ. You make a list of all the pulpwood that leaves the National forest? A. Well, I don\u2019t make a list, I just kind of keep up with the load.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-21\">\u201cQ. Well, that is to be sure that the pulpwood that leaves there gets to .the place it is supposed to go? A. Where it is supposed to go.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>As to Bell, one of the Gatlin sons testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">\u201cHe supervises some of the cutting of the little mills, sort of in the same line as Mr. Lee, and he also keeps a check on pulpwood that leaves the woods to see that we get credit on it, goes to the right places, and any errands or anything that is to be done either from the mill, why, he makes contact from the mill to the little mills, carries word back and forth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Ollie Jones testified that all that he had seen Bell do was to check on pulpwood.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Ollie Jones was a Deputy Sheriff and had been elected Constable of Beat 4 in Wayne County, Mississippi. The Gatlins hired him shortly after that election. His principal duties were to patrol the Gatlin lands<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to arrest trespassers, to prevent thefts of timber and lumber, and to protect against forest fires.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Since the employers admit violation of the Act unless they are included in the exemption, the burden is on them to show that they are plainly and unmistakably within its terms and spirit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The restriction of the exemption to employers who employ not exceeding twelve employees in forestry or lumbering operations was intended to make it applicable only to the small <em>migratory </em>lumber milling operations peculiar to the Southeast \u2014 called \u201cpeckerwood mills.\u201d \u201cThey cut scrap timber that would not be economical for the larger mills to cut * * *. Many of them go out and hire farm boys in the immediate vicinity of the mill * * *. It is an added source of income to these <em>small-farm people. They are the type of sawmill whi.ch is covered by the exemption.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The language of the exemption should be construed, so far as it reasonably can be, to carry out that intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-15\">The legislative history makes it quite clear that forest operations up to the time the logs or products enter the sawmill, processing plant, or transportation terminal are encompassed by the language of the exemption.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Here, the rationale was that such work can be performed only under favorable weather conditions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The terms of the exemption are carefully phrased to carry out the intention expressed by the legislative history. The employees included within the exemption are those \u201cemployed in (1) planting or tending trees, (2) cruising, surveying or felling timber, or (3) in preparing or transporting logs or other forestry products to the mill, processing plant, railroad, or other transportation terminal\u201d (parenthetical numbers supplied). The nouns \u201ctrees,\u201d \u201ctimber,\u201d \u201clogs,\u201d \u201cother forestry products,\u201d trace the life of the tree from its inception to its end and one step toward its conversion into lumber or paper. The verbs correspondingly follow the tree\u2019s growth and use. Most of the terms are so clear as not to require discussion. Pulpwood is, of course, a \u201cforestry product,\u201d indeed, the most usual one other than logs. We agree with the appellants that the word \u201ccruise\u201d as used in forestry operations means \u201cto inspect forest land for the purpose of estimating the quantity of timber it will yield,\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that Ollie Jones was not engaged in \u201ccruising\u201d the timber. Appellants would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>have us restrict \u201ctend\u201d to a dictionary illustration of \u201cto cultivate or foster, as a plant.\u201d So restricted, \u201ctending\u201d would be almost meaningless in this exemption, for forest trees are not \u201ccultivated\u201d or \u201cfostered\u201d except for an extremely rare pruning. Even a cultivated plant, however, requires protection from insects, depredators and trespassers; and forest trees especially must be protected against trespassers, thieves, and fire. The broader definition of \u201ctend\u201d as \u201cto apply oneself to the care of; to look after; to guard; to watch over\u201d appears to us to be the usual and ordinary sense of \u201ctend\u201d as applied to forest trees, and the sense in which the word is here employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Clearly, substantial parts of the activities of Lee and Bell were in the \u201cpreparing\u201d and \u201ctransporting\u201d of logs and of pulpwood to the mill, processing plant or terminal. Ollie Jones\u2019 activities were encompassed by the terminology \u201ctending trees.\u201d His relation to the \u201ctending\u201d of trees is much less tenuous than that which the towboat cooks had to the transportation of logs in Woods Lumber Co. v. Tobin, 6 Cir., 1952, 199 F.2d 445, affirming per curiam 20 CCH Labor Cases, Para. 66, 640 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">We conclude that appellants have not brought themselves \u201cplainly and unmistakably\u201d within the exemption provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Claimed Errors of Fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">As to the claimed errors of fact concerning violations (a) as to laborers at the planer and sawmill, the district court found: \u201cthat during the two-year period from August, 1955, to the time this action was filed in September of 1957, in over 125 instances these defendants failed to pay their employees, pursuant to the overtime provisions of the Act, for hours worked in a workweek in excess of 40 hours. Instead, they paid overtime wages only for time worked in excess of 80 hours in a two-week period. As a matter of fact, such appears to have been the policy consistently followed in defendants\u2019 operation. Such practice invariably resulted in employees failing to receive the proper wages for their overtime work.\u201d The evidence sustains that finding. So much is practically conceded in appellants\u2019 brief, but the conduct is minimized as mere \u201ctechnical violations of the Act.\u201d We do not agree. Clearly, whether so intended or not, the two-week basis operated to the advantage of the Gatlins in those periods in which the employee worked more than 40 hours in one week and less than 40 hours in the other week. The evidence showed that the two-week basis for computing overtime was used as late as the summer of 1959, nearly two years after this action had been instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">As to (b), the lumber stackers, the district court found: \u201cthat these defendants compensated their stackers on a piece-rate basis only; this basis generally referred to by the witnesses as payment by the truck. These defendants did not commence to keep accurate hours of their lumber stackers until sometime in 1958. Lumber stackers generally worked five or five and one-half days per week with an average workweek of approximately 45 hours and were never paid anything in excess of the contract rate of $5.50 per truck. No \u2018regular rate\u2019 of pay for these employees was established or converted to an hourly rate.\u201d The evidence sustains that finding, though the practice had been corrected in advance of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">As to (c), the \u201ckey\u201d salaried employees, the district court found: \u201cthat the defendants\u2019 millwright, whose duties consisted of keeping up the sawmill, insofar as its mechanical operation was concerned, ordinarily worked 45 hours per week and occasionally worked in excess of that by working on Sundays. He received only a straight salary of $45 per week. Defendants\u2019 payroll records, however, reflected that he consistently worked 8 hours a day, 5 days each week. The oral testimony concerning the actual hours the millwright worked was corroborated by defendants\u2019 time-book records, which reflected that he, in certain instances, worked up to 90 and in one instance up to 102 hours during certain two-week payroll periods. Such a practice was also generally true with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>planing machine repairman and the machinist.\u201d The evidence sustains this finding. Appellants are not helped by their reference to Walling v. A. H. Belo Corporation, 1942, 316 U.S. 624, 62 S.Ct. 1223, 86 L.Ed. 1716.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Here there is no evidence that the employer and employees had agreed on a \u201cspecific overtime rate of one and one-half times the regular rate.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We need inquire no further since this essential element of a valid \u201cBelo\u201d contract is missing in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Propriety of Injunctive Relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The district court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">\u201cIn considering whether or not such practices and violations on the part of these defendants necessitate the issuance of an injunction, the evidence reflects that there have been at least three investigations by the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor of the defendants\u2019 operations. Upon at least one previous occasion, in 1954 or early in 1955, these defendants were advised that they were violating the overtime and record-keeping provisions of the Act and agreed to correct the violations at that time. The defendants\u2019 violations as herein set out have been persistent and continuous, and it is the conclusion of this Court that such persistent and continuing violations make it necessary and appropriate for this Court to enjoin these defendants from further violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. See Lenroot v. Kemp [5 Cir.], 153 F.2d 153, Mitchell v. Raines [5 Cir.], 238 F.2d 186, and Mitchell v. Hausman [5 Cir.], 261 F.2d 778.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Clearly, it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to grant an injunction. Mitchell v. Hausman, 5 Cir,, 1958, 261 F.2d 778; Mitchell v. Blanchard, 5 Cir., 1959, 272 F.2d 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The judgment was right, and it is</p>\n<p id=\"AYi\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b131-12\">.
