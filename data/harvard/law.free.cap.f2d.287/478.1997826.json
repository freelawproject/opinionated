He appeals from the judgment denying the relief prayed for in his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">The alleged infringing work is a television production entitled A Sound Of Different Drummers televised by Columbia Broadcasting System on October 3, 1957. Columbia together with Robert Alan Aurthur, who wrote the television script, and Martin Manulis, who produced it, were named defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">The appellant will be hereinafter referred to as plaintiff and appellees as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">Bradbury appeals, specifying as error the findings and conclusions that the script entitled A Sound Of Different Drummers was original; that Aurthur did not have access to Bradbury\u2019s copyrighted works prior to the telecast; that Aurthur did not copy from Bradbury\u2019s works; and that there is no similarity in the literary expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">At the outset of his opinion, 174 F.Supp. 733, 734, the trial Judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALK\">\u201cIt is Bradbury\u2019s claim that the play lifted, in whole or part, materials from two of his books duly copyrighted, \u2018The Fireman\u2019 published in \u2018Galaxy\u2019, a Science Fiction magazine, in- February, 1951, and later expanded into a copyrighted book called \u2018Fahrenheit 451\u2019, published in 1953. In both instances, the Copyright Act was fully complied with (17 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1-22) and the copyrights are now owned by Bradbury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-12\">\u201cWe state at the outset that the attorneys for the defendant agree with the court and concede that the material was copyrightable and fulfilled the legal requirements of originality. The problems to resolve are access and infringement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-14\">Access.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-15\">Both plaintiff and defendants agree that in the copyright field access means not merely the opportunity to have read or known the contents of a work, it means actual reading or knowledge thereof. Harold Lloyd Corporation v. Witwer, 9 Cir., 65 F.2d 1, 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-16\">From the evidence it is apparent that the defendants, Columbia and Aurthur, had knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s copyrighted1 works prior to the writing or telecast of A Sound Of Different Drummers. Bradbury testified that in 1952 he entered into a written agreement with Columbia with respect to the television rights to The Fireman and Exhibit 3 was identified and received as an executed copy of said written contract. This testimony is not contradicted and an inference therefrom cannot be avoided that as early as 1952 defendant Columbia had actual' knowledge of the contents of plaintiff\u2019s, works.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-17\">Defendant Aurthur testified that he had been a free-lance writer since 1947 and was employed during the spring of 1955 at the National Broadcasting Company as associate producer of the Philco Television Playhouse, and that his duties-were mainly in the area of working with writers in terms of developing scripts under the supervision of Gordon Duff, producer, and that his relation with Duff was of five or six years\u2019 duration. Aur-thur testified that he gave first consideration to the plaintiff\u2019s work, Fahrenheit 451, when a Mr. Wolfe came into his office in early April of 1955. Wolfe told him that he thought there was materia! in the book, Fahrenheit 451, that perhaps-television was prepared to accept.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-18\">After some discussion, Aurthur and Wolfe interviewed Gordon Duff and Aurthur explained to Duff what Wolfe \u201cwanted to do,\u201d to which Duff replied, \u201cWell, let me read the book.\u201d It is apparent that the book referred to in the discussion was Fahrenheit 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Following this discussion and under date of April 22, 1955, Aurthur addressed a letter to Don Congdon, Bradbury\u2019s agent. After dispatching this letter to Congdon, Bradbury had telephone conversations with Congdon relative to television rights to Fahrenheit 451. Aur-thur testified that Duff had decided to produce for television Fahrenheit 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Bearing on this question of whether Aurthur had read or had knowledge of plaintiff\u2019s works, he testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">\u201cQ. Well, had you discussed with Mr. Duff the matter of producing Fahrenheit 451 on the program on which you and Mr. Duff were partners? A. Yes. There was one discussion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">\u201cQ. Did you know anything about the story of 451 ? A. I knew about the book burning of the future, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">\u201cQ. Who told you that? A. Bernie Wolfe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">\u201cQ. Had you read any reviews or synopses of 451? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-9\">\u201cQ. Well, what did Wolfe tell you about the story of 451? Tell us what Wolfe told you? A. That it was a book about book burning in the future. You see, we had never discussed the story. We discussed his desire to do a.show. The discussion of the story never came about, because it was never a point at which I came in contact with Wolfe in relation to the story.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-10\">\u201cThe Court: But the subject matter of the story was discussed because you just said \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-11\">\u201cThe Witness: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-12\">\u201cThe Court: Something about book burning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-14\">\u201cThe Witness: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-15\">\u201cThe Court: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-16\">\u201cQ. By Mr. Marks: And in no greater detail ? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-17\">\u201cQ. Now, in May of 1955, did you .and Duff inform Wolfe that you \u2022could get the TV rights to the .Fahrenheit book, if he wanted it? A. I am not sure whether we did, or whether he heard personally from Don Congdon, because he was also Congdon\u2019s client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-19\">\u201cQ. And in May of 1955, did you tell Wolfe that you and Duff were very much interested in putting on Fahrenheit 451? A. The subject involved Gordon Duff\u2019s doubts that we had enough money, or enough facilities to do a science fiction story.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-20\">\u201cQ. By Mr. Marks: At the meeting that I just described with members of the technical staff, Mr. Aurthur, do you remember that you and Mr. Duff at that time indicated that Fahrenheit 451 might make an excellent opening program for the fall series, which you were then contemplating? A. Mr. Duff made the decision to enter into negotiations for Fahrenheit 451. And I acted as agent in this case on the phone calls. I don\u2019t recall the exact statement you called. There may have been such talk, there may have been a statement relating to the fact that 1984 the previous fall had been Studio One\u2019s opening show. That might have been what that discussion was about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-21\">&lt;&lt;q. * * * Did you suggest to Mr. Wolfe that he prepare an outline setting forth the various technical problems involved in the television adaptation of Fahrenheit 451 ? A. No, sir, Mr. Duff recounted that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-22\">\u201cQ. I would like to have this outline marked at this time for identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-23\">\u201cThe Court: It may be marked for identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-24\">\u201cThe Clerk: Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 17 marked for identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-25\">* * -s * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-26\">\u201cQ. By Mr. Marks: Well, let\u2019s get back to the conference with Mr. Wolfe, Mr. Duff and these technical assistants of yours, and yourself, Mr. Aurthur, for a moment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>\u201cI have handed you what has been marked for identification as Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 17, which appears to me, I believe, to be an outline of the technical problems I mentioned before. A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">\u201cQ. And I ask you, is that a copy of the outline that was made by Wolfe, pursuant to the results of this conference with yourself and Duff, and these other technical assistants ? A. I don\u2019t know. I would imagine so, yes, sir. But specifically, I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">\u201cQ. Well, does it appear to you that it\u2014 A. It would appear to be what it says it is, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">\u201cMr. Marks: All right. May I offer that in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">\u201cThe Court: It may be received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-9\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-10\">\u201cQ. By Mr. Marks: Now, I believe that in connection with your interrogatories, Mr. Aurthur, you indicated that the story of Fahrenheit 451 had been told to you, as I recall, in general terms. A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-11\">\u201cQ. And would you tell us what you mean by \u2018in general terms\u2019 ? A. Would you mind reading exactly what I said, so I will know exactly what I said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-12\">\u201cQ. Yes, indeed. A. Because I don\u2019t know if I used the word \u2018total\u2019 or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-13\">\u201cQ. * * * I will read the interrogatory and the answer. The interrogatory is: \u2018Did anyone ever tell you the story of plaintiff\u2019s works or describe plaintiff\u2019s said works to you?\u2019 A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-14\">\u201cQ. And your reply is: \u2018No, but Bernard Wolfe had told me about Fahrenheit 451 in general terms.\u2019 A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-15\">\u201cQ. And now, I say what were those general terms that you speak of, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-16\">[Then an exchange of remarks by the Court with the witness.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-19\">\u201cQ. By Mr. Marks: In other words, you have already testified as much as you are able to testify with respect to how much of this story was related to you? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-20\">\u201cQ. And no more? A. That\u2019s right, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-21\">\u201cQ. Now, over all the period that these negotiations were going on, and that these conferences with respect to technical problems were going on, you never read the book? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-22\">\u201cQ. You never read the book? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-24\">\u201cQ. Or any reviews or synopses of it? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-25\">\u201cQ. Yet you were considering putting this on a top line program? A. Mr. Marks, I have already explained that my only concern was of the television play. I was in rehearsal with my own show. I was considering perhaps ten or twelve other shows at the same time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-27\">\u201cQ. Well, did you consider that you had any responsibility for reading this property? A. No, sir. Mr. Duff read the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-28\">\u201cQ. Well, did you discuss it with Mr. Duff? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-29\">\u201cQ. Never? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-30\">\u201cQ. And he was your partner? A. Yes sir, he was the boss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-32\">If Aurthur is to be understood as having testified that he had not read or had knowledge of The Fireman or Fahrenheit 451 prior to the production of the teleplay, such testimony, when considered with similarities between Fahrenheit 451 and the teleplay, is unworthy of belief. Here we have not only direct evidence of access but we find similarities from which access and copying may be inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-33\">The evidence of access by the defendant Aurthur to plaintiff\u2019s works, considered with noteworthy similarities in defendants\u2019 production, A Sound Of Different Drummers, is strong and persuasive evidence of copying which requires the defendants to counter with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>strong convincing and persuasive evidence to the contrary. Overman v. Loes-ser, 9 Cir., 205 F.2d 521, 523. Defendants have not countered the effect of the evidence of access and similarities with strong convincing and persuasive evidence. They have merely denied copying.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Similarities, Copying and Infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">After testifying that he had viewed the film of A Sound Of Different Drummers, Bradbury narrated, on direct examination, twenty-two claimed similarities, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">1. \u201cThe bookburners are called \u2018Firemen\u2019 in plaintiff\u2019s works and are called \u2018Bookmen\u2019 in defendants\u2019 production. They are both regimented government employees whose function is to go out and burn and destroy books.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">2. \u201cThe opening scene in The Fireman is one in the firehouse with an alarm turned in and the Firemen rushing off in response. At the scene of the alarm, they confront an old woman, ask for her books, find them and, when she refuses to leave her kerosene-filled house, prepare to kill her; whereupon, she strikes a match and explodes the house and herself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-8\">\u201cIn defendants\u2019 teleplay the story opens at the residence of the two Bookmen who are summoned by an alarm to investigate some readers. The Bookmen rush in to an apartment house, find an old man and an old woman, ask for the books, find the books and destroy the old man and the old woman on the spot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-9\">\u201cBoth in the teleplay and The Fireman reference is made to having burned an old man\u2019s place the night before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"afb-dedup-0\">3. \u201cIn the third scene of defendants\u2019 teleplay, the Bookman, returning to headquarters, meets the \u2018different\u2019 or \u2018unorthodox\u2019 girl who provokes him into new ways of thinking about life and his work by her unorthodox approach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-12\">\u201cIn plaintiff\u2019s work Fahrenheit 451, the Fireman meets a \u2018different\u2019 girl, one with unorthodox ideas, outside his house on return from a burning job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-13\">\u201cIn each, the \u2018different\u2019 girl influences and motivates the leading character and the development of the plot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-14\">4. \u201cIn plaintiff\u2019s works the Fireman, the leading character, steals a book behind the backs of other Firemen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-15\">\u201cIn defendants\u2019 teleplay, the \u2018girl\u2019 steals a book behind the backs of Bookmen and then influences the leading character to read the illegal book.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-16\">5. \u201cIn plaintiff\u2019s works, the Fireman comes home to find his wife sodden with narcotics and a thimble-sized radio tamped in her ear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-17\">\u201cIn defendants\u2019 teleplay the Book-man comes home to find his roommate, sodden with narcotics, a thimble-sized radio tamped in his ear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-18\">6. \u201cIn plaintiff\u2019s works the \u2018unorthodox\u2019 girl asks the Fireman whether he ever read any of the books he burns, and the reply is that it is against the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-19\">\u201cA similar question and a similar reply is made in defendants\u2019 production.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-20\">7. \u201cIn Fahrenheit 451, the Fireman has trouble talking to his wife, because she is constantly watching various diversions on the wall-to-wall television.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-21\">\u201cSimilarly, in defendants\u2019 production, the Bookman has trouble talking to his roommate because he is constantly watching various sporting activities on the wall-to-wall television.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-22\">8. \u201cIn plaintiff\u2019s works a definite point is made about the lack of pedestrians, and that \u2018taking a walk\u2019 is almost subversive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-23\">\u201cIn defendants\u2019 production this subject is also discussed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>9. \u201cIn plaintiff\u2019s works the \u2018unorthodox\u2019 girl is fascinated by nature and the outdoors and tells the Fireman that she loves the rain, et cetera.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">\u201cSimilarly in defendants\u2019 teleplay the \u2018unorthodox\u2019 girl takes the Book-man out of the city and into nature and speaks in similar terms about their life and this world beyond society and they are even caught in the rain, and the reactions to rain are the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">10. \u201cIn plaintiff\u2019s works the Fireman reveals to his wife that he has been stealing books to read.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">\u201cIn defendants\u2019 production the \u2018unorthodox\u2019 girl reveals that she has stolen books to read.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">\u201cThis episode, both in plaintiff\u2019s works and in defendants\u2019 production, ends the same way, with the Fireman or Bookman reading the forbidden book.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-10\">11. \u201cIn Fahrenheit 451, one of the first books shown by the Fireman to his wife is The Holy Bible. In defendants' production, the first book shown the Bookman by the \u2018unorthodox\u2019 girl is The Holy Bible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-11\">12. \u201cThe opening of Part Two, Fahrenheit 451 and the opening of the Third Act of defendants\u2019 production are substantially the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-12\">\u201cIn one, the Fireman reads to his wife from the forbidden books, and in the other the Bookman reads to the \u2018unorthodox\u2019 girl from forbidden books; and it appears that the reading has gone on for some time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-13\">13. \u201cIn plaintiff\u2019s works, the Fireman goes to an old man to get him to help organize classes in thinking and reading, and to find some way to preserve books. They agree to find a way to print books and organize some underground group of readers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-14\">\u201cIn defendants\u2019 production, the \u2018unorthodox\u2019 girl leads the Bookman to an underground group that already exists, dedicated to reading and preserving the books.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-15\">\u201cIn both plaintiff\u2019s works and defendants\u2019 production members of the underground group memorize and quote from portions of great books.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-16\">14. \u201cIn plaintiff\u2019s works, the Fireman rather than go out on another raid reports himself sick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-17\">\u201cIn defendants\u2019 production, similarly, the Bookman rather than go out on another raid reports himself sick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-18\">15. \u201cIn Fahrenheit 451, the Fireman is lectured by a superior about books and society and is told that the superior has read a few books and they say nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-19\">\u201cSimilarly, in defendants\u2019 production, the Bookman\u2019s superior admits to having read a few books and says that there is nothing to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-20\">16. \u201cIn Fahrenheit 451, the old man refers to the solid, unmoving majority as the most dangerous enemy to truth and freedom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-21\">\u201cIn defendants\u2019 teleplay there is a similar reference to the \u2018compact majority\u2019 and their danger to mankind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-22\">17. \u201cIn Fahrenheit 451, the Fireman\u2019s superior explains the adverse effect of some families upon children and that the home environment can undo a lot they try to do at school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-23\">\u201cSimilarly, in defendants\u2019 script, emphasis is against the family, and there is reference to the effect that families are dangerous and can ruin children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-24\">18. \u201cIn Fahrenheit 451, the Fireman, in ignorance of where he is going, is taken to burn his own house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-25\">\u201cIn defendants\u2019 teleplay, the Book-man, in ignorance of where he is going, is taken to kill his own friends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-26\">19. \u201cIn Fahrenheit 451, the Fireman, after the murder of the Fire-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>chief, flees with his books and escapes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\">\u201cIn defendants\u2019 production, the Bookman starts to flee with his books and the \u2018unorthodox\u2019 girl, is knocked down and captured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">20. \u201cBoth in plaintiff\u2019s works and defendants\u2019 production, we see the organized underground consisting of Readers and Memorizers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">21. \u201cThe relationship between various characters is very similar both in plaintiff\u2019s works and in defendants\u2019 production, as, for example, the relationship between the Fireman and his superior on the one hand, and the Bookman and his superior on the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">22. \u201cIn both the plaintiff\u2019s works and defendants\u2019 production, the intimacy of personal relationship is used for the same purpose. For example, in the plaintiff\u2019s works it is the hero\u2019s wife who informs on him to the authorities. In the defendants\u2019 production it is the hero\u2019s roommate who informs on him to the authorities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">No contention is made by defendants that the above recited similarities do not exist and it is apparent that an ordinary person or observer, after reading The Fireman, Fahrenheit 451, and seeing the picture A Sound of Different Drummers, would note similarities as we did which would bring about a belief that A Sound Of Different Drummers is a dramatization or adaptation of Fahrenheit 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">The incidents and their sequence that make up the action and develop the story in each of the works are too similar to be coincidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">The similarities here, like those dealt with by Judge Knox in Simonton v. Gordon, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 12 F.2d 116, 123, could not have occurred without access to plaintiff\u2019s works. It is inexplicable that without access to the plaintiff\u2019s book that Aurthur would have incorporated into his play such a number of similar and parallel incidents, episodes and scenes. As in the Simonton case, the difference existing between the novel and the play are no more than Aurthur believed necessary in order to adapt plaintiff\u2019s story to the limitations of the television screen.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">We must keep in mind, in addition to the similarities, that we have uncon-troverted testimony in this record of Aurthur\u2019s interest in plaintiff\u2019s works, of his activities looking to a television adaptation, and the fact of Columbia\u2019s option to take Bradbury\u2019s novel. All this, when considered with the similarities, meets head-on and overwhelms the denial of Aurthur that he had read or knew of the contents of plaintiff\u2019s works before the television production.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">In Dam v. Kirk La Shelle Co., 2 Cir., 175 F. 902, 907, 41 L.R.A.,N.S., 1002, in dealing with a situation such as we have here, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-14\">\u201cIt is impossible to make a play out of a story \u2014 to represent a narrative by dialogue and action \u2014 without making changes, and a playwright who appropriates the theme of another\u2019s story cannot, in our opinion, escape the charge of infringement by adding to or slightly varying his incidents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-15\">\u201cIt is undoubtedly true, as claimed by the defendant, that an author cannot by a suggestion obtain exclusive control of a field of thought upon a particular subject. If the playwright in this case without the use of the story, and working independently, had constructed a play embracing its central idea, it may well be that he would not have infringed the copyright of the story. But a comparison of the play with the story shows conclusively in many unimportant details that Armstrong read the story and used it as the basis of his play. It is practically impossible that the similarities were coincidences. Other testimony is to the same effect. In our opinion the playwright deliberately appropriated the story and dramatized it. THE STATUTE GIVING AUTHORS OF COPYRIGHTED WORKS THE EX<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>CLUSIVE RIGHT TO DRAMATIZE THEM MUST RECEIVE A REASONABLY LIBERAL APPLICATION OR IT WILL BE WHOLLY INEFFECTIVE. [Emphasis ours.] As we have just pointed out, the adaptation of a story to the stage must necessitate changes and additions. New short stories could be transformed into dramatic compositions without the addition of many new incidents. Unless the copyright statute is broad enough to cover any adaptation which contains the plot or theme of the story, it is wholly ineffective. If Armstrong by what he did, did not infringe the dramatic rights of this story, it is difficult to see what he could have done which would have infringed them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">A comparison of Bradbury\u2019s story with the play shows in many important and unimportant details as well that Aurthur actually read the story or had knowledge thereof before and during the writing and production of the teleplay.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">An ordinary person, after reading plaintiff's works and viewing the teleplay, might well believe that Aurthur had copied plaintiff\u2019s works. The similarities which here exist are novel in Bradbury\u2019s story; they are strange and unusual. Defendants not only copied the theme and ideas of Bradbury\u2019s copyrighted work but also its expression. The copyright of a story covers what is new and novel in it. There are similarities existing between plaintiff\u2019s copyrighted works and defendant Aurthur\u2019s play, which upon an analysis, would be found to be novel in the story and of such a nature as to be within the protection of the copyright statutes. Harold Lloyd Corporation v. Witwer, 9 Cir., 65 F.2d 1, 18, 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Many of the incidents, sequence of events, development and interplay of the characters are the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Fair use may permit copying of theme or ideas of copyrighted work but not its expression. Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corporation, 2 Cir., 81 F.2d 49, 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">To constitute an invasion of copyright it is not necessary that the whole of a work should be copied, nor even a large portion of it in form or substance, but that, if so much is taken that the value of the original is sensibly diminished, or the labors of the original author are substantially, to an injurious extent, appropriated by another, that is sufficient to constitute an infringement. The test of infringement is whether the work is recognizable by an ordinary observer as having been taken from the copyrighted source. Slight differences and variations will not serve as a defense. The means of expressing an idea is subject to copyright protection and where one uses his own method or way of expressing his idea, as Bradbury has done, such adornment constitutes a protectible work. Universal Pictures Co. v. Harold Lloyd Corporation, 9 Cir., 162 F.2d 354, 361, 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">It is not established by the evidence that Martin Manulis participated in the writing of the script of Aurthur\u2019s teleplay nor did he have access to either The Fireman or Fahrenheit 451 prior to the broadcast. There is no evidence tending to show that he had knowledge of the plaintiff\u2019s works. He testified that prior to rehearsal, in response to a telephone query from someone at an executive level at Columbia, that he postponed operations awaiting advice from the broadcasting company\u2019s legal department on this question of similarity, and was advised to go ahead with the show by a member of the company\u2019s legal department. No liability on his part is disclosed in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">Columbia, in October 1957, broadcast A Sound Of Different Drummers over its facilities on its production Playhouse 90. Being chargeable with notice and knowledge of the facts known to the defendant Robert Alan Aurthur, it is liable to plaintiff for infringement of his copyrighted works. Universal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Pictures Co. v. Harold Lloyd Corporation, 9 Cir., 162 F.2d 354, 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Defendants Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. and Robert Alan Aurthur, in producing A Sound Of Different Drummers, did knowingly and wilfully copy from protectible material contained in plaintiff\u2019s copyrighted works and did so without his \u2022 knowledge or consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The Court\u2019s findings that the teleplay, A Sound Of Different Drummers, was original; that Robert Alan Aurthur did not have access to either The Fireman or Fahrenheit 451 prior to said broadcast; that defendant Robert Alan Aur-thur did not copy either The Fireman or Fahrenheit 451; and that there is no similarity in the literary expression between plaintiff\u2019s said works and the teleplay A Sound Of Different Drummers, are, and each of them is, clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The judgment is reversed as to defendants Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. and Robert Alan Aurthur; and affirmed as to Martin Manulis; and the action is remanded to the trial court with directions to determine the issue of damages and to enter judgment as prayed for in plaintiff\u2019s complaint in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants, Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. and Robert Alan Aurthur, with costs including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b540-7\">BARNES, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AIW\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">My colleagues first substitute their conclusion for that of the trial judge as to which witnesses are or are not worthy of belief, and secondly, it appears to me they bolster their conclusion by uncritically parroting the appellant\u2019s position that there exist twenty-two alleged similarities from which, my colleagues say, this court <em>must infer </em>both access and copying.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">I have believed a trial judge who personally has had the opportunity to observe the conduct and demeanor of the various witnesses was in a better position than an appellate judge to determine who was telling the truth. This Circuit has gone a long way to preserve the integrity of this principle. Ly Shew v. Dulles, 9 Cir., 1954, 219 F.2d 413, 416, and cases cited in note 12; Mar Gong v. Brownell, 9 Cir., 1954, 209 F.2d 448, 449; N.L.R.B. v. Howell Chevrolet Co., 9 Cir., 1953, 204 F.2d 79, 86, affirmed 346 U.S. 482, 74 S. Ct. 214, 98 L.Ed. 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">The majority say that \u201ca comparison of Bradbury\u2019s story with the play shows in many important and unimportant details as well that Aurthur actually read the story or had knowledge thereof before and during the writing and production of the teleplay.\u201d If this were recited in an affidavit, I suspect my colleagues would say it was purely conclusionary \u2014 - that no facts had been stated. And in the majority opinion none of these \u201cimportant and unimportant details\u201d are specifically pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">The majority state that: \u201cAn ordinary person, after reading plaintiff\u2019s works and viewing the teleplay, might well believe that Aurthur had copied plaintiff\u2019s works.\u201d This ordinary judge did not, nor did the able trial judge below. The latter is no stranger to this segment of the law, holding an acknowledged national reputation as an authority on plagiarism.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-14\">Having come to a factual conclusion directly contrary to the trier of facts below, and without any considered analysis of those facts, the majority here cite as authority five cases: Dam v. Kirk La Shelle Co., 2 Cir., 1910, 175 F. 902, 907, 41 L.R.A..N.S., 1002; Simonton v. Gordon, D.C.S.D.N.Y.1925, 12 F.2d 116; Harold Lloyd Corporation v. Witwer, 9 Cir., 1933, 65 F.2d 1, 18, 23; Sheldon v. Metro Goldwyn Pictures Corp., 2 Cir., 1936, 81 F.2d 49, 54; Universal Pictures Co. v. Harold Lloyd Corp., 9 Cir., 1947, 162 F.2d 354, 361, 363. These cases all represent good law, but do not require a reversal here, on the facts as I see them.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-15\">In Dam v. Kirk La Shelle Co., supra, the court was not (as the majority opinion correctly states) \u201cdealing with a situation such as we have here.\u201d In Dam, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>the court thought it \u201cunnecessary to review the evidence in detail with respect to the question of infringement. The Circuit Court has carefully compared the story with the play, and we agree with its [the district court\u2019s] conclusion that the play is a dramatization of the story. * * * [T]he theme of the story is the theme of the play * * * \u201d [175 F. 907], Thus, in Dam the appellate court was agreeing with the trial court there had been infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">In Simonton v. Gordon, supra, a district court case, an able judge (Judge Knox) goes into an extremely detailed factual analysis of \u201cWhite Cargo,\u201d alleged to have been taken from \u201cHell's Playground.\u201d He quotes incidents, scenes, and episodes, even similarities of language, and \u201cparaphrases.\u201d After the careful seven page analysis (out of the eight pages of the opinion), Judge Knox opines: \u201cThe foregoing list of similarities might be extended indefinitely.\u201d [12 F.2d 123], This case to me constitutes no authority for the action taken by the majority herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Similarly, the forty-eight page opinion in Harold Lloyd Corporation v. Wit-wer, supra, carefully analyzes and compares the similarities in theme, incident, scene and episodes. It <em>affirms </em>the judgment of infringement ordered below.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">In Sheldon v. Metro Goldwyn Pictures Corp., supra, Judge Learned Hand did reverse a judgment on nonplagiarism below, but only after spending six of the six and one-half pages in the opinion in a careful listing of the many similarities between \u201cLetty Lynton,\u201d \u201cDishonored Lady,\u201d and the story, in the public domain, of Madeleine Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">In Universal Pictures Co. v. Harold Lloyd Corp., supra, again, the court below awarded damages for plagiarism, and this court noting the \u201cadvantages\u201d that trial court had in having the witnesses before it, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Thus, in but one of the five cases cited in the majority opinion (Sheldon v. Metro Goldwyn Pictures Corp., supra) has an appellate court reversed the factual determination made below. And that, by an analysis that is comparable, not to the majority decision herein, but to the detailed analysis made in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">But desiring to avoid the error I believe my colleagues make, I desire to point out some of the reasons why I cannot \u201cbuy\u201d the appellant\u2019s alleged similarities.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">It seems to me that the fundamental thesis of protest against a heavily organized society, and its thought-controlling government, is as old as literature. Ideas are not subject to copyright, but manners of expression are. I have examined the twenty-two \u201csimilarities\u201d urged by appellant. I do not find similarity of expression, as distinguished from similarity in basic ideas, in any more than two of the suggested twenty-two similarities. For example, in item 1, the bookburners are called \u201cfiremen\u201d in appellant\u2019s work; \u201cbookmen\u201d in appellee\u2019s production. This is a <em>difference </em>in detail and in manner of expression, not a similarity in expression. The destruction of books, the destruction of learning, the destruction of written knowledge, is but a reference to history, whether it be to the Middle Ages or to Hitler\u2019s Germany. In item 3, meeting the \u201cdifferent\u201d or \u201cunorthodox\u201d girl is not a similarity in incident or sequence of events, or in development or interplay in the characters. The basic idea of an unorthodox female character is again as old as literature, and having that girl motivate or influence leading characters in the development of the plot is no more than the love interest essential to most all, if not all, plays or motion pictures. Further, she is an evanescent and immaterial character in the book, but not in the television play. With respect to item 4, stealing behind someone\u2019s back is not new. Stealing has to be behind the back of somebody, unless the culprit wishes to invite capture. Stealing a book is certainly not new in any story dealing with books, and the influence of the girl on the leading character to read the illegal book did not constitute a difference in events and sequence. Many other incidents seem to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>me to be merely fortuitous circumstance. I admit that item 2, where an alarm opens the scene, well might be considered a \u201csimilar incident,\u201d but from there on the incidents change completely; the characters are different; the results are different \u2014 one being a murder and the other suicide. One might say that in item 7, the inability to communicate with the wife in the one case, and with the roommate in the other, having developed from the interest of each in wall-to-wall television, is a similar incident. But from my limited reading, this has been commented upon before and is part of \u201c1984\u201d, among other works. Item 11 (that among books shown is the Holy Bible), seems to me not unusual. It would be difficult to dramatically discuss the burning of all books without making a reference to the Great Book. Item 13 shows <em>differences, </em>not similarities. In item 12, as I remember the facts, there is still another difference. The fireman reads to his wife who was an uninspired and unsympathetic listener; the book-man reads to <em>the girl who is an inspired </em>and sympathetic listener. The setting of the leading man reading to a companion is the same, and that <em>is </em>a similarity, but there it ends. The sequence is different. I could go on \u2014 for example, similarities numbers 21 and 22, cited by the majority, mean nothing to me.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">In summary, I believe the majority opinion adopts the appellant\u2019s argument hook, line and sinker, in the twenty-two similarities urged by appellant and in the long summary of characters, sequence and incidents. I do not feel that the labored \u201cdissection\u201d made by appellant\u2019s counsel (with such catch-phrases as \u201cinverse fireman,\u201d etc.) can supersede a viewer\u2019s general over-all impression. As I understand it, it is the over-all impression to the viewer that controls, as we said the test is in this circuit in Harold Lloyd Corporation v. Witwer, supra, 65 F.2d at page 28. I think that the emphasis in Bradbury\u2019s work was on science and fiction (and specifically upon a mechanical hound with a hypodermic needle in its snout). In \u201cA Sound of Different Drummers\u201d the emphasis was upon the individuals\u2019 moral and intellectual revolt against a subjugated society. The opinion below details the fundamental differences in the two works. 174 F.Supp. 733 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">To repeat, I do not think we grant any trial judge the full measure of his authority as a trier of fact on the issue of similarities when we rule as a matter of law he was in error, where there exists no real similarity of scenes and episodes, no startling examples of peculiarly phrased sentences, no paraphrase of text. To say that the trial judge erred when weighing what he found, against the expressed denial of Aurthur (that he had read and knew of the contents of appellant\u2019s work), seems to me to be an unjustified derogation of the trial court\u2019s rights. I find no such great number of similarities to indicate to me that it would be impossible for the limited number of admitted similarities to have been coincidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Therefore, while not necessarily adopting all of Judge Yankwich\u2019s opinion, I would be content to rely upon it generally, and certainly would affirm the judgment below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
