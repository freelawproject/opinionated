The real estate which was subject to the mortgage had never been the property of the lumber company. It had been conveyed by one Raudabaugh to Roy J. Dewey, and the mortgage was executed by Dewey to one David C. Dunn to secure a promissory note of $6,000 of even date with the mortgage, and the note and mortgage were transferred and assigned by Dunn to the plaintiff in error, the First National Bank of Wapakoneta. In its answer and cross-petition in the case the bank alleged the\u2019 facts necessary to constitute it a <em>bona fide </em>holder of the notes and mortgage. The cause was appealed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>circuit court where it was tried and the rights, of the parties determined upon an agreed statement of facts as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-5\">\u201cThat the defendant, the South Side Lumber Company, is and was a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Ohio with a capital stock of $20,000.00, and at all the times mentioned in the petition said capital stock was fully paid;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-6\">\u201cThat the said defendant, David C. Dunn, was at said times the owner of $6,700 worth of said capital stock and that said Roy J. Dewey was the owner of $200 worth of said stock, and that, on or about the 15th day of September, 1904, the said The South Side Lumber Company was the owner of a large amount of lumber and other merchandise to the value of about $23,000; that at about said date the said corporation negotiated a sale of said lumber and merchandise to one Joshua R. Raudabaugh for about the price of $23,000; that the said D. C. Dunn was not favorable to said sale unless the said corporation would purchase from him $6000, of his said capital stock at an agreed price of $6000, and the balance of his said capital stock of $700 he transferred to W. W. Leighton for an agreed consideration as between themselves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-7\">\u201cThat on the 8th day of September, 1904, the said negotiations for said sale and for the retirement of said stock having, been in progress from on or about the said 8th day of September, IQ04, the Board of Directors of said The South Side Lumber Company passed the following resolution or motion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>\u2018That part of lot 1722 which is accepted from Joshua R.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARE\">The present case concedes that the relief sought by the trustee would have been properly granted but for the rights of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number><em>bona fide </em>holder which attached to the interests of the plaintiff in error. This because of the fact that the mere surrender by Dunn of his stock in an insolvent corporation did not constitute a sufficient consideration to sustain either the deed to Dewey or his subsequent mortgage to Dunn. The question we have to determine is, may the invalidity of the mortgage be asserted against the bank which received it with the note which it secured, before due, for a full consideration contemporaneously advanced by it, and without either actual or constructive notice of the circumstances attending the execution of either the deed or the mortgage? The principal, if not the only, reliance of the circuit court for the affirmative answer which it gave to that question is <em>Baily </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>14 Ohio St., 396. Much care has been taken by this court, and by the courts of two other states which have followed <em>Baily </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>to limit its authority to the precise point which it decided.. In any view which may be taken of the case, it is an obvious departure from the doctrine generally recognized by the courts of the country. This was clearly demonstrated in <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Longan, </em>16 Wall., 275. Although the case, when reviewed in the later adjudications of this <em>court, </em>has been recognized as establishing a rule of property, care has always been taken to limit it to that conservative function. It has not been thought necessary or advisable to give such extended operation to its doctrine as would widen the divergence between the decisions of this court and those of other states and the federal courts with reference to related subjects. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Renewed attention to the precise conclusion there reached is necessary to the end that it may be distinguished from the conclusion which it is said to require in the present case. If the syllabus of that case is read in the light of the well known rulo of this court that it states the points decided, the relevant proposition of the syllabus, the fourth in number, will plainly suggest the needed limitation: \u201cThe transfer of a negotiable promissory note, secured by mortgage on real estate, to a <em>bona fide </em>indorsee, does not entitle the holder to foreclose the mortgage, when it appears that both note and mortgage were obtained by fraud.\u201d The point decided was that a note and mortgage to secure it having been obtained by fraud, the maker may interpose that defense against the mortgage in the hands of a <em>bona fide </em>indorsee, although he may not interpose it against the note. Obviously no other question could have been decided for no other was presented. In the present case, the question is whether against such <em>bona fide </em>holder there may be asserted a latent equity in favor of persons who are not parties to the mortgage and as to whom the record contains no disclosure whatever. An affirmative answer to that question derives no support whatever from <em>Baily </em>v. <em>Smith. </em>Notwithstanding all that was there said, cases of this character are determined by the familiar rule that a mortgage is an incident to a negotiable note which it secures, and is subject to no equity which may not be asserted against the holder of the note. If it should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>conceded that one in the position of the plaintiff in error might, consistently with the principles of law, be required to ascertain, before purchasing, whether the mortgagor has a defense against a suit to foreclose his equity of redemption, it would not follow that he should be held to inquire of mankind with respect to l\u00e1tent equities. In support of the view here , suggested the cases are numerous and uniform. Types of them are: <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>50 Ohio St., 167; <em>Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Lynde, </em>55 Ohio St., 23; and <em>Humble </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>160 Ill., 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Reference to the statement of facts in the present case shows that the plaintiff in error not only received the note by indorsement from Dunn, but that it received a formal assignment indorsed upon the mortgage and that the same was duly entered of record. In view of this fact counsel for plaintiff in. error insists that the amendment of 1888 to Section 4135, Revised Statutes, vested in the bank a legal title to the mortgagee\u2019s interest in the property, and that the point actually decided in <em>Baily </em>v. <em>Smith </em>is now inconsistent with the statute. It will be prudent to defer a decision of the question suggested until it shall receive from counsel and the court the more careful consideration which it is likely to receive in a case requiring it to be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Without attaching any importance whatever to the amendment of the statute, it seems clear that the judgment of the circuit court was erroneous and that upon the agreed statement of facts upon which the case was submitted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>judgment should be in favor of the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and judgment for plaintiff in error.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b222-7\">Price, Crew, Summers, Spear and Davis, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
