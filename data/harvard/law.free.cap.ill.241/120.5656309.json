Deeds\u2014what is a sufficient delivery to pass title. Deeds executed contemporaneously with a will which refers to the deeds as having been executed to the grantor\u2019s sons and delivered to a notary to be delivered to the sons at the grantor\u2019s death, and which are accepted by the grantees when manual possession is given to them by the notary after the grantor\u2019s death, are well delivered and pass title, where there is nothing to show the grantor intended to retain any control o^er the deeds after delivering them to the notary, though he kept possession of the lands until his death.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b120-10\" pgmap=\"120\">2. SamE-t-w/kz\u00ed does not tend to show that grantor intended to retain control over deeds. Proof that the grantor, at the time he executed a will and certain deeds to his sons, destroyed an earlier will and similar deeds which he had left in the possession of the notary who drew them, does not indicate that the grantor intended to retain control over the second deeds, which he left with the notary to be delivered to the grantees at the grantor\u2019s death, there being no proof as to what arrangement was made with the notary when the earlier deeds were left in his possession.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b120-11\" pgmap=\"120\">3. Same\u2014what declaration by grantor is not inconsistent with delivery of deeds to third person. The fact that the grantor, after executing certain deeds to his sons and delivering them to the notary who drew them, to be delivered to the grantees at the grantor\u2019s death, made the statement, \u201cNone of my folks shall have any of my property while I live; I am going to be boss,\u201d is not inconsistent with the theory that the grantor had parted with all control over the deeds, since the grantees could exercise no .acts of ownership over the property until they received their deeds after the grantor\u2019s death.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b121-4\" pgmap=\"121\">4. Same\u2014fact that the notary would, have given deeds hack to grantor is not material. The fact that the notary to whom deeds were delivered by the grantor to be delivered to the grantees at the grantor\u2019s death, testifies that he would have given the deeds back to the grantor if he had wanted them, as he felt that the grantor had a right to control his property, shows merely the view of the witness, and does not tend to show the grantor did not intend to part with all control over the deeds.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-5\" pgmap=\"121\">Writ or Error to the Circuit Court of St. Clair county; the Hon. Charles T. Moore, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-6\" pgmap=\"121\">On April 7, 1908, Mary Callerand and Josephine Boisseau filed their bill in the circuit court of St. Clair county against Baptiste Piot, Emile Piot and others for the partition of certain lands in that county of which John Baptiste Piot was alleged to have been the owner at the time of his death, and to have certain deeds executed by the deceased purporting to convey said lands canceled and set aside as clouds upon the title thereto. The lands of which partition was sought were the lands which were apparently conveyed by the deeds attacked by the bill. Answers and replications were filed and the cause was referred to a master to take the testimony and report the same to the court. Upon a hearing on that report the court entered a decree granting the prayer of the bill, and to review that decree Baptiste Piot and Emile Piot have sued out a writ of error from this court.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-7\" pgmap=\"121(102) 122(131)\">John Baptiste Piot died at East St. Louis, Illinois, on September 24, 1907, leaving a will, in and by which he disposed of all his property, unless the land involved in this suit should be determined to be intestate property not conveyed by the deeds \"above mentioned. He left surviving him as his only heirs, Mary Callerand, Josephine Boisseau and Justine Ward, his daughters; Baptiste Piot and Emile Piot, his sons, and Adele Renard, a grandchild. The will was executed by the deceased at the office of Prosper J. Soucy, a notary public in the city of East St. Louis, on March 28, 1907, and at the same time Mr. Piot executed two deeds, one conveying lot 220 of the common fields of Cahokia, in St. Clair county, to Baptiste Piot, and the other conveying lot 210 of the common fields of Cahokia, and an additional tract of about ten acres, to Emile Piot. Each deed recited a consideration of one dollar and love and affection. The deed to Baptiste Piot contained the following statement: \u201cThis being the same land bequeathed by me to my son Baptiste Piot in my last will and testament.\u201d The deed to Emile Piot contained the same statement as to him. Each deed was an ordinary warranty deed, containing no reservation. The third and fourth clauses of the will-executed by the deceased are as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-5\" pgmap=\"122\">\u201cThird\u2014To my son Baptiste Piot I have executed deed and delivered same to P.

J. Soucy, of East St. Louis, to be \u25a0 delivered to him upon my death, for the following described property, to-wit: Lot two hundred and ten (210) of the common fields of Cahokia, and other, lands, description of which is contained in said above mentioned deed.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-7\" pgmap=\"122\">No other language is found in the will regarding any disposition of lands mentioned in the clauses above set out.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-8\" pgmap=\"122(105) 123(85)\">When the will and deeds had been executed by Mr. Piot he gave them to Mr. Soucy, who had prepared the instruments, and instructed him to destroy a will previously executed by him and two deeds which he had theretofore executed conveying the same lands to Baptiste and Emile Piot, all of which were then in Mr. Soucy\u2019s custody, and asked him to take charge of the instruments just executed and after his death to file the will for probate and deliver the deeds to his sons, Baptiste and Emile Piot. These instructions were all carried out by the notary, the will and deeds last executed remaining in his office, without the grantees knowing of their execution, until a few days after Mr. Plot\u2019s death, when the grantees were notified to come and get them. Pursuant to that notification they called at the office and each received and accepted the deed in which he. was named as grantee. Later the will was admitted to probate and the deeds were filed for record. Up until the time of his death Mr. Piot retained possession and control of the lands.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-5\" pgmap=\"123\">The decree of the circuit court was rendered on the theory there was no sufficient delivery of the deeds by Mr. Piot and that he died intestate as to the lands described in them.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-6\" pgmap=\"123\">It is contended by plaintiffs in error that the delivery was sufficient and that the deeds convey the title.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b123-7\" pgmap=\"123\">H.

Nor does the recital aid in establishing that there was a valid delivery of the deed so as to make it operative. Nor can a recital in the deed that the grantor had bequeathed the property by will make or aid a devise by will, when there is no such devise, or attempted devise or bequest, in such will. Noble v.

They accepted' the deeds when they received manual possession of them after the father\u2019s death. He executed the deeds and his will at the same time. At that time he left the deeds and the will with Prosper J. Soucy, the notary public who had drawn them, and who testified: \u201cWhen Mr. Piot delivered the will and the deeds to me he said he wanted me to keep them until his death and I should see that the will was spread of record and the deeds delivered to the boys; I was not to deliver the deeds until after his death; I kept them in my safe until after he died.\u201d This testimony, in so far as it shows Mr. Piot\u2019s purpose, finds strong corroboration in language of the will. The grantor never saw the deeds again and never thereafter attempted to exercise any control over them. Under these circumstances the deeds are effectual to convey title, (Thompson v. Calhoun, 216 Ill. 161, and cases there cited,) unless there is in the record proof which shows that the grantor, at the time he left the deeds with Mr. Soucy, had some intention other than that manifested \"by his acts and directions which have just been mentioned.</p> <p id=\"b126-7\" pgmap=\"126(60) 127(301)\">Defendants in error call attention to several matters in evidence which they regard as showing the grantor\u2019s intention to retain control and dominion over these deeds up' until the time of his death. In considering these matters we pass over any question in regard to the competency of the proof, as no objection of that character has been urged by plaintiffs in error. The record shows that the grantor several times, both before and after the execution of these deeds though not on the day on which they were executed, said to persons other than Mr. Soucy, \u201cNone of my folks shall have any of my property while I live; I am going to be boss.\u201d Such a statement is not inconsistent with the theory that the grantor reserved no control over the deeds after leaving them with the notary, for the reason that the sons could exercise no acts of ownership under the deeds until they received them, which was not to be until after the father\u2019s death. Prior to the time when he made this will and these deeds he had executed two wills, which had been drawn by Mr. Soucy. On the occasion of the execution of each of the earlier wills he also executed deeds to these two sons and at both of those times left the deeds and the will with Mr. Soucy. Afterwards he again took possession of the will and the deeds executed on each of the earlier occasions and destroyed them or had them destroyed, or otherwise made such disposition of them as that they no longer remained in the notary\u2019s possession. It is insisted that this is a circumstance which indicates that he reserved control over the deeds involved in this suit. The record does not disclose anything at all in regard to what was said by him to Mr. Soucy, or what arrangement was made between them on either occasion when earlier deeds were executed and left in the possession of the notary. The testimony as to the earlier transactions, therefore, is without significance in determining with what intention the last deeds were left with the notary.</p> <p id=\"b127-5\" pgmap=\"127(78) 128(44)\">Mr. Soucy testified in reference to the last two deeds: \u201cIf Piot had called for these deeds after he had delivered them to me and wanted them I certainly would have delivered them to him; I felt he had a right to control his property,\u201d\u2014and this is said to show that the grantor reserved control of the instruments. It shows rather the view of the witness in regard to the effect of the directions given him by Mr. Piot. That testimony is not of assistance in determining the intention evidenced by the language used by the grantor. We think it clear that when the grantor delivered these deeds to the notary he parted with all control over them.</p> <p id=\"b128-4\" pgmap=\"128\">The decree of the circuit court will be reversed and the cause will be remanded, with directions to dismiss the bill for want of equity.</p> <p id=\"b128-5\" pgmap=\"128\">Reversed and remanded, with directions.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
