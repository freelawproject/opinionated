Easements\u2014easements may be created by covenants or by agreements. Easements may be created by covenants or agreements as well as by grant, and in construing such instruments the court may look to the circumstances attending the transaction, to the situation of the parties, the state of the thing granted and tire object to be attained, in order to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b42-6\" pgmap=\"42\">2.

Same\u2014when signing petition to vacate street is am abandonment of party\u2019s rights. A lot owner who signs a petition for the vacation of a street shows his intention that the property may be used for private purposes, and, in effect, abandons any possible easement he may have in the use of a switch track in the vacated portion of such street, and his acts in relation thereto are binding upon his successors in title.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b42-8\" pgmap=\"42\">4. Same\u2014when property owners consenting to the vacation of a street are estopped to demand restoration of original conditions. Where property owners in a block consent to the vacation of a portion of a street and extensive improvements are erected upon the vacated portion in reliance upon such vacation, such property owners and their successors in title are estopped to demand that the original conditions be restored.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b42-9\" pgmap=\"42\">5. Same\u2014zvhen easement is appurtenant. Where the dominant and servient estates are clearly defined in an easement contract and the easement is beneficial to the dominant estate the easement is appurtenant and not in gross, and it is not necessary that the dominant and servient estates be contiguous or that the right of way granted shall terminate on the dominant estate.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b42-10\" pgmap=\"42\">6. Same\u2014easement created by a grantor in favor of lands retained is appurtenant. An easement created by a grantor in lands of his grantee in favor of lands retained by the grantor and beneficial thereto is appurtenant to the lands retained and is binding upon subsequent purchasers of the grantee\u2019s land.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b42-11\" pgmap=\"42(21) 43(53)\">7.

An agreement between grantor and grantee that the grantee will construct a switch track which \u201cmay be forever after used\u201d by the owners of other lots fronting on certain streets, creates a perpetual easement in the use o\u00ed such track, although it does not use the word \u201cheirs\u201d or any other words which would convey a fee at common law.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b43-3\" pgmap=\"43\">8.

Sam^E\u2014when an easement in favor of lots includes territory embraced in vacated street. Where a plat is not a statutory one and a street shown thereon has not been accepted by the public, a purchaser of an abutting lot takes title to the center of the street, and an easement created in favor of the lot while such condition exists attaches to the portion of the street belonging to the lot; and while subsequent public acceptance of the street charges the public easement upon the title of the property owner, yet when the street is thereafter regularly vacated the property owner is restored to a full enjoyment of his rights.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b43-5\" pgmap=\"43\">10. Same\u2014when lots have no rights under easement contract. Although a contract creating an easement in the use of a switch track may have been intended for the benefit of all the lots in a certain subdivision, no rights can be claimed in favor of the lots whose owners failed to contribute to the cost of constructing and maintaining the track.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b43-6\" pgmap=\"43\">11. Same\u2014when use of a switch track easement is excessive. Where the owner of lots having an easement in the use of a switch track constructs an electric plant so that it is partly upon such dominant lots and partly upon non-dominant lots, the switch track can be used only for the benefit of the dominant lots; and if the boilers are located on dominant land, but the turbines, to which the steam is piped and which operate the dynamos for generating electric current, are partly upon non-dominant land, the use of the switch track to convey coal for the boilers and ashes and cinders from the boilers is excessive.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b43-7\" pgmap=\"43\">12. Peats\u2014plat cannot be partly\u25a0 statutory and partly common law.

Farlin Q. Ball, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-3\" pgmap=\"44\">This was a petition filed by the appellant September 21, 1903, under the Burnt Records act, (Hurd\u2019s Stat. 1908, chap. 116, p. 1728,) to establish its title in fee simple to lot 82 (except the north twenty-five feet thereof) and lots 83 to 86, inclusive, in Greene\u2019s South Branch addition to Chicago, Cook county, Illinois, and to enjoin certain of appellees from using a switch track on said lots, the public records relating to which title were destroyed by the great fire in Chicago, October 8 and 9, 1871. The petition was thereafter amended, and after the issues were-finally joined on the pleadings the matter was referred to a special master in chancery, and on the report of his findings being made to the trial court a decree was entered therein, from which an appeal has been prosecuted to this court.</summary><summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-4\" pgmap=\"44\">No question is .raised as to the sufficiency of the pleadings, and as they are quite voluminous no attempt will be made to set them out. The conclusions of the master and the findings of the decree will be better understood after the principal facts in the record are stated.</summary><summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-5\" pgmap=\"44(197) 45(76)\">In 1856 the owners of a tract of land (in which are included the lots now in question) subdivided it under the title \u201cGreene\u2019s South Branch addition to Chicago,\u201d and caused a plat to be filed for record in the recorder\u2019s office of Cook county June 17, 1856. The plat was executed and acknowledged by certain of the owners by their attorneys in fact, and by other of the owners in person, before a justice of the peace in Cook county. William Greene and John F. Hance, who acknowledged the plat in person, were then owners, as equal tenants in common, in fee simple, of 35.64 acres in the central part of the. land covered by the plat, and some of the other parties who joined in the plat owned the west 20.24 acres and others the east part of the tract. The exact location of the lines dividing the Greene and Hance portion of the platted land from the other portions thereof is not clearly shown by the evidence, bat it is alleged in the petition, admitted by the answers and found by the master\u2019s report and decree, that the land owned by Greene and Hance at the time the plat was made and recorded included said lots 82 to 86, and it seems reasonably certain from the record that the portion owned by Greene and Hance also took in lots 87 to 93, inclusive, and the land south of the last named lot to the river. The portion of said plat of Greene\u2019s addition which appears necessary for an understanding of the issues involved is herewith given:</summary><summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-4\" pgmap=\"45\">[[Image here]]</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-3\" pgmap=\"46\">Of the land shown on the foregoing plat, lots 82 to 97, inclusive, and 33 to 39, inclusive, together with strips of land shown on the plat as Fisk street and Lumber street, between Allen\u2019s and Mason\u2019s canals, are involved in this controversy. At the time of the subdivision this property was a rough slough, with mudholes throughout, and the owners, shortly after making said plat, proceeded to dig the canals as shown, which were afterwards made navigable for heavily laden vessels. The first occupants of the land were Walker &amp; Cutting, who established a brickyard there and filled up a large part of the slough. In 1859 the owners of the property in question, (with the exception of Caleb Allen, who owned lots 94 to 103, inclusive, and probably other property,) in order to pool their interests, facilitate the handling of the property and acquire railroad and water communications, proceeded to organize the Chicago South Branch Dock Company under a special act of the General Assembly. This charter authorized the corporation to improve the lands therein described, (including the property in question,) build canals, construct railroads and otherwise manage and improve the territory. Its capital was $650,-000 and its duration limited to thirty years. Upon its incorporation the several owners of the lots here in question, with the exception of Caleb Allen, conveyed to it their respective holdings and took stock in the corporation in exchange therefor.</summary><summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-4\" pgmap=\"46(111) 47(109)\">February 28, 1865, the dock company, by deed, conveyed in fee to John S. Reed, Asa E. Cutler, John H. and George Witbeck, as tenants in common, the south half of lot 82 and lots 83, 84, 85 and 86 in Greene\u2019s addition, and at the same time and as a part of the same transaction, and as a part of the consideration therefor, a contract, hereinafter set out, was signed by the parties to the deed. On February 27, 1867, the dock company conveyed in fee, by warranty deed, to John S. Reed, Asa E. Cutler, John H. and Henry Witbeck, the south twenty-five feet of the north fifty feet of lot 82. Reed, Cutler, John H. and George Wit-beck thereafter conveyed all their interests in said lots 82 to 86, inclusive, to Henry Witbeck. The latter died testate April 12, 1891, while a resident of Cook county, Illinois, where his will was probated, devising to his son, John H. Witbeck, in fee simple, said lots 82 to 86, inclusive. The* title to said lots 82 to 86, inclusive, remained in said John H. Witbeck until July 5, 1903, when, by warranty deed, on that date he conveyed them to appellant, subject to the railroad rights in the north twenty-five feet of said lot 82.</summary><summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-4\" pgmap=\"47\">These lots, as we have stated, were first occupied by Walker &amp; Cutting as a brickyard, early in 1866. The brickyard was thereafter removed and the lots taken possession of by Reed, Cutler, John H. and George Witbeck, who composed the firm of Cutler, Witbeck &amp; Co., and occupied them until about 1868 as a lumber yard. In the latter year the Henry Witbeck Company succeeded to the business of Cutler, Witbeck &amp; Co., and continued in the lumber business on the premises until May, 1894. In the last named year John H. Witbeck, the then owner, leased the lots to Arthur Gurley &amp; Co., lumber dealers, who occupied them until October, 1901, when they sub-let them to Deacon &amp; Co., lumber dealers, for a term expiring April 30, 1904, and Deacon &amp; Co. continued in possession to that .time. Upon the conveyance of said lots by John H. Witbeck to appellant, in 1903, Deacon &amp; Co. attorned to that company until they surrendered possession of the lease of their lots, and the lots have since been in the possession of appellant.</summary><summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-5\" pgmap=\"47(88) 48(127)\">By deed dated October 1, 1865, the dock company, then being the owner of lots 87, 88 and 89 and the north half of lot 90, conveyed the same to Jacob and Henry Beidler. September 21, 1865, the company deeded the south half of lot 90, all of lot*93 and the south half of lot 92 to Jacob and Henry Beidler. September 23, 1865, William Greene, then owner of the north half of lot 92, conveyed the same in fee to Jacob and Henry Beidler. By sundry conveyances through William Greene, John F. Hance and Jasper Fisk, lot 91 was conveyed on September 21, 1865, to Jacob and \u25a0 Henry Beidler. Thereafter, by conveyances and inheritance, Augustus F. Beidler, son of Jacob Beidler, became the owner in fee of said lots 87 to 93, inclusive, and by deed dated October 25, 1901, conveyed the same in fee to Louis A. Seeberger, who by deed of the same date conveyed said lots to the Commonwealth Electric Company. All of said lots 87 to 93, inclusive, were occupied for the lumber business by various firms from 1865 until the property passed into the possession of the Commonwealth Electric Company, in 1902. The occupancies of the various firms need not be set out in detail.</summary><summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-3\" pgmap=\"48\">By sundry conveyances from William Greene, John F. Hance and Henry G. Miller, Jacob Beidler and Henry Beidler obtained title to said lots 36 to 39, inclusive, January 5, 1866, and these lots afterwards became the property of Augustus F. Beidler, and by him were conveyed,' through Seeberger, to the Commonwealth Electric Company, October 25, 1901. These lots were occupied by various films engaged in the lumber business from 1866 to 1902, when they came into the possession of the Commonwealth Electric Company. By sundry conveyances through William Greene, Richard J. Arnold and Amos Greene, lots 33, 34 and 35 were conveyed to Jacob Beidler by deed dated August 15, 1881, and thereafter by Augustus F. Beidler, through Seeberger, to the Commonwealth Electric Company October 25, 1901. These lots also were occupied by various firms in the lumber business from 1867 or 1868 down to 1901, when they were acquired by the Commonwealth Electric Company.</summary><summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-4\" pgmap=\"48(53) 49(115)\">At the time Greene\u2019s subdivision was made, in 1856, Caleb Allen appears to have been the owner of lots 94 to 103 and 104 and 105. Some time in 1856, the exact date not being clearly shown in the record, Allen conveyed these last two lots to the South Branch Dock Company, which corporation in 1868 re-conveyed them to Allen. By deed dated June 9, 1902, James Nowell, trustee under the will of Caleb Allen, conveyed lots 94 to 97 to Louis A. Seeberger, and the latter, by deed dated June 9, 1902, conveyed the same to the Commonwealth Electric Company. January 30, 1904, James Nowell, as such trustee, conveyed lots 98 to 105, inclusive, to Louis A. Seeberger, and the latter on the same date conveyed them to the Commonwealth Electric Company. Most, if not all, of. these last named lots were occupied by the various corporations in the lumber btisiness from 1868 until they were taken possession of by the Commonwealth Electric Company.</summary><summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-4\" pgmap=\"49(239) 50(99)\">In 1868 all of the land south of Twenty-second street, in the vicinity of the land in question, was used for lumber yards, and if is now known as the lumber district. Throughout this district switch tracks run from the main railroad lines through side streets, and curved switches, similar to the one involved in this case, are provided for in deeds of property in the district similarly situated with reference to the railroad. March 15, 1864, an agreement in writing was entered into between the Chicago South Branch Dock Company and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad Company by which the dock company conveyed to the railroad company certain lands, and the right to use perpetually the strip of land twenty-five feet in width from the north side of Greene\u2019s South Branch addition fo Chicago, within the lands of the dock company, for railroad purposes. The railroad company, on its part, agreed to put i\"n and maintain at suitable points on said tract so conveyed, switches and frogs, to connect with each railroad track which might thereafter be put down in each of the streets running north and south through said South Branch addition, and agreed that it would permit the dock company, or other owners of property in said addition, to connect with said railroad, subject to the condition that all tracks to be put down in said streets should be constructed and maintained at the expense of the dock company or the persons constructing the same. About 1860 the Burlington Railroad Company began the construction of a track along the north twenty-five feet of the lands in Greene\u2019s South Branch addition. A track was likewise built running east and west on Twenty-second street. February 28, 1865, the contract heretofore referred to was entered into between the Chicago South Branch Dock Company of the first part, and John S. Reed, Asa E. Cutler, John H.

The approximate location of the track is shown by the following plat:</summary><summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-2\" pgmap=\"53\">[[Image here]]</summary><summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-7\" pgmap=\"53(25) 54(340)\">in its original position up to this time. The proof is not clear as to how far south in Fisk street this track was built at that time, but it may be assumed from this record that it was extended in accordance with the terms of the agreement by the then owners of lots 82 to 86, as far south, at or near the center of Fisk street, as the south line of said lot 86. At any rate, the record shows that within a year after the construction of the curved track it was extended directly south, approximately along the center line of Fisk street, across Lumber street, to about sixty feet north of the river. Another extension branched from the east side of the main track last noted in Fisk street about opposite lot 86 and ran south in Fisk street to about opposite lot 89. From the westerly or main track in Fisk street, near lot 93, two branches ran off to the south-east for the use of occupants of that part of the land in question, and a third spur track ran from said main extension south-east to lot 36. These extensions remained until the South Branch Lumber Company came into possession of them, and then the two switch tracks which branched from the main track near lot 93 were discontinued, and later there was constructed a track from the main switch between lots 88 and 90, which ran south parallel with the main track to a point approximately sixty feet north of the river. This situation continued until 1898, when the Lord &amp; Bushnell Company located on some of the ground now owned by the Commonwealth Electric Company. The Lord &amp; Bushnell Company made some slight changes in the tracks at the southerly end, but preserved the same general situation until the Commonwealth Electric Company came into the possession of its lots as above set forth in 1902, and made certain changes in these tracks and built others. The tracks as changed and constructed, together with the buildings erected by, the said Commonwealth Electric Company, are shown with approximate accuracy by the following plat:</summary><summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-3\" pgmap=\"55\">[[Image here]]</summary><summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-4\" pgmap=\"55(58) 56(84)\">At or shortly after the construction of the curved track in question a spur was built which branched from the north side of the curved track near the entrance of the latter into lot 82 and proceeded west to a point just west of lot 82, as shown in plat 3 above. About 1875 a switch track ran south-easterly across lot 105, and thence curved toward the south and ran west of and parallel with Fisk street to a point not far from the river.

After the establishment of lumber yards in this district Fisk street to Lumber street was left open in part, but the adjoining occupants, to a greater or less extent, piled lumber in the street, leaving only room enough for teams to haul lumber back and forth. The street, however, was not graded or thrown up. The use of Fisk street for teaming purposes continued until the Commonwealth Electric Company took possession of its lots, in 1902. The use of Fisk street for piling lumber ceased in 1875, when the city authorities forbade the practice of obstructing the street. Lumber street was never thrown up or used as a street, and until the Commonwealth Company came, in 1902, was used by the adjoining occupants for piling- lumber. In May, 1902, the city of Chicago, by ordinance, vacated the part of Lumber street between Mason\u2019s canal and Allen\u2019s canal and the part of Fisk street between Lumber street and the north line of lot 97 extended. Such vacations were made upon petitions signed by adjacent property owners, one of which was signed by John H. Witbeck, who was then the owner of lots 82 to 86, inclusive.</summary><summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-5\" pgmap=\"56(53) 57(106)\">' In 1902 the Commonwealth Electric Company constructed a fence, beginning on the north line of lot 97 at its intersection with Allen\u2019s canal, thence running east to the east line of Fisk street, thence north three hundred feet to the north line of lot 87, and thence east to Mason\u2019s canal. It was a tight board fence, five feet or more in height. Within the lines of what was formerly Fisk street there were two gates, fastened with movable braces, providing openings for the two westerly railroad tracks on Fisk street. In constructing said fence said Commonwealth Company left an opening in the portion of the fence running north and south, near the north line of lot 87, for the switch track. The fence is now substantially in the condition described, with a barbed wire running along its top. The gate for the center track is kept closed, except when railroad cars or employees pass through.</summary><summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-3\" pgmap=\"57\">At the present time lot 82, except the north twenty-five feet thereof, and lots 83 to 86, are occupied by petitioner, which conducts thereon its business of box manufacturing, and the present improvements consist of a brick office building toward the east end of lot 82, and a frame shed north of the switches on lot 82 but projecting slightly into Fisk street.

The Commonwealth Electric Company is engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling electric current. The buildings placed on said lands by the said company and now occupied by it are as follows: The main building, which is of brick, two hundred and forty feet in its east to west measurement and two hundred and thirty feet from north to south. Its west line is nearly coincident with the west line of Fisk street vacated, and the building extends thence easterly, occupying a considerable portion of lots 92 and 91 and a small part of lot 90. Its location is shown on plat 3. Switch tracks enter the building as set forth thereon. Its north line js sixty-six feet south of the north line of lot 97 extended. The construction of the building was begun in June, 1902, and completed before May i, 1904. The building contains machinery for generating electricity. It is about eighty feet in height, with large smoke-stacks. The machinery is massive, and a considerable portion of it is located within the lines of Fisk street. Other improvements on the property of the Commonwealth Company consist bf a small gate-keeper\u2019s office, (a frame structure, one story high,) at the northwest comer of lot 88; a substantial brick building, approximately one hundred and fifty feet in length, occupying the eastern portion of lots 95 and 96; a long frame shed occupying a portion of lot 36 and Lumber street vacated, and a small frame structure on the north-west corner of lot 93,\u2014 all of which are shown on plat 3 above.</summary><summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A5I\" pgmap=\"58(246) 59(331)\">The exact character and position of the machinery is set forth in a stipulation filed by the parties to this litigation, substantially as follows: The actual manufacturing of electricity is carried on entirely within the large brick building. There is a brick wall extending north and south from the north to the south end of this building to its full height, the east face of which is six feet west of the east line of the vacated portion of Fisk street. The portions of this building east and west of the east face of the brick wall constitute one entire building and together constitute a part of the plant of the Commonwealth Electric Company, which is devoted exclusively to the business of manufacturing and distributing electricity. This plant consists of steam boilers for making steam used in the generation of electrical current, and steam turbines and generators for generating electricity by the use of the steam made in the boilers, and of other necessary equipment. All the steam boilers in this plant are located in that part of this building which is east of said brick wall, and the west end of each of these boilers is located 8.94 feet east of the west face of the brick wall. There are in that part of the building west of the brick wall ten steam turbines and electrical generators, arranged in a line from the north to the south end of that part of the building which is west of the brick wall, (which room is called the turbine room,) each of which turbines and generators is fixed upon a vertical shaft and constitutes a body of machinery which is of a cylindrical shape, about twenty-five feet high and sixteen feet in diameter at the base and narrowing to about twelve feet in diameter at the top. These turbines and generators are so located that the east half of each one of them is upon the east side and the west half on the west side of a line drawn through the center of Fisk street vacated. Running from the part of the building which is east of the brick wall are ten metal pipes, fourteen inches inside diameter, which run from the steam boilers through the brick wall into that part of the building west of the wall and there connect with the steam turbines, each of the pipes connecting the boiler to which it is attached with the corresponding turbine, said pipes being used for the purpose of conveying steam from the boilers to the turbines, for .the purpose of operating the turbines in the making of electricity in said plant. The portion of the building west of the wall is all one room, and along the east side of it, about fifteen feet from the ground floor, is a balcony five feet in width, extending along the entire east side of the turbine room, and opening upon this balcony are six doors in the brick wall at substantially equal intervals from the north to the south, which doors lead-onto the floor of the second story of that part of the large brick building which is east of the wall, and immediately below said six doors are six large double doors, which lead from the ground floor on the turbine room into that part of the building east of the brick wall, or the boiler room.</summary><summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-3\" pgmap=\"59(62) 60(177)\">The Commonwealth Company has used, and is using, the curved track across lots 82 to 85 in connection with the switch track constructed by it in 1902, branching from the curved track in Fisk street towards the east, opposite lot 85, and thence, with its branches, entering lots.,87 to 90, as shown on plat 3, almost exclusively for the purpose of carrying coal onto the lots owned by it lying east of Fisk street, into the part of the building east of the brick wall and wherein its boilers are located, to be used, and actually used by it, for producing steam in said boilers and for the purpose of carrying away the cinders and ashes remaining after the combustion of the coal. The company, in operating its plant, uses larg'e quantities of coal in the furnaces under these steam boilers. The steam made in the steam boilers from said coal is conducted from the boilers through said metal pipes to the steam turbines in the turbine room and there used in the turbines for the manufacture of electricity. These conditions,' with reference to the arrangement and operation of the plant, existed at the filing of the original petition, with the exception that at that time there were only four steam turbines and electric generators, with their connecting boilers, in the plant, while now there are ten turbines and generators, with their connecting boilers, therein.</summary><summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-3\" pgmap=\"60(197) 61(172)\">All the switching done over the curved track has been done by the Burlington railroad, with its locomotives. The east and west switch track has been used exclusively by the owners of lots 82 to 86, and the owners and occupants of said lots have never used the tracks south of the south line of lot 86, except that during the occupancy by the Henry Witbeck Company of lots south of lot 86 that company used a portion of the tracks opposite the lots it occupied, and veiy rarely at other periods lines of cars standing for the most part opposite lots 82 to 86 were pushed slightly south of the latter lot. From the first use of the property in question to approximately the year 1885 the curved track was used by the occupants of the several lumber yards for shipping their lumber out over the curved track to the Burlington road. During that period, and continuously since, that time, substantially all receipts of lumber by all of the occupants of yards on the property in question were by water, and cars coming in by the curved track were sent in empty, to be filled at the yards. During the period from 1868 to approximately 1885 the switching of these cars over the curved track was done partly in the day and partly at night, but after the year 1885 a change in the service was made, and from that time to the purchase of the property by the Commonwealth Company switching over the curved track was only during the night time, (except on Sundays, when it was done in the daytime,) and on rare occasions at other times during the day, seemingly by the special request of the occupants of the yards south of lot 85, and then by the consent of the owners of lots 82 to 86. At all times the cars were placed in numbers and at places to suit the convenience of the occupants of the different yards, and the curved track apparently was used by the various occupants of these j^ards for the cars to stand on while they were being loaded and unloaded with lumber.</summary><summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-3\" pgmap=\"61(209) 62(54)\">The use of the curved track by the Commonwealth Electric Company has been substantially as follows: During the time of the construction of its buildings the materials were delivered by cars over it. This use occurred during the day as well as during the night, and continued for the period of a year. The machinery for the buildings was likewise delivered in the same way. No proof of objections on the part of the owners or occupants of lots 82 to 86 was made. During the last named period Deacon &amp; Co. were in possession of lots 82 to 86, and upon one occasion a request was made of the Commonwealth Electric Company by that firm that the cars running to and from the Commonwealth plant or standing upon the tracks be so handled or placed as to enable them to load their cars without interruption. After the occupancy of the appellant company a request was made by that company of the Burlington road to place the Goodwillie cars upon the track south of their occupation, so that when the Commonwealth Company switched its cars through, the Goodwillie cars would not have to be removed entirely from the track in question. This request was not granted. Deacon &amp; Co. used the curved track within lots 82 to 85 during- the daytime to load and unload lumber. After the completion of its buildings, as heretofore set out, the Commonwealth Company used, and is using, as shown by the.stipulation between the parties heretofore set out, the curved track.</summary><summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-3\" pgmap=\"62(303) 63(362) 64(360)\">The special master made an exhaustive report to the superior court, setting forth the facts as stated above and his conclusions of law thereon, and the court, after a hearing, .entered a decree finding, among other things, that the deeds, conveyances and other instruments in writing in the chain of title of said D.

(Jones on Easements, secs. 104, 106.) Agreements imposing burdens upon one estate for the benefit of another must be strictly construed. (Eckhart v. Irons, 128 Ill. 568; Downen v. Rayburn, 214 id. 342.) Such agreements, however, creating easements must be so construed as to carry out the plain intent of the parties. (Field v. Leiter, 118 Ill. 17; Barber v. Allen, 212 id. 125.) In construing such instruments the court will look to the circumstances attending the transaction, the situation of the parties, the state of the thing granted and the object to be attained, to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties. (Kuecken v. Voltz, 110 Ill. 264.) Construing this contract in the light of these surroundings, it seems obvious that its object was to furnish an outlet for business to the Burlington road for the lots between Allen\u2019s and Mason\u2019s canals. Not only is this indicated by the agreement, but that conclusion is supported' by the terms of the contract entered into by the railroad company in 1864 with the owners of Greene\u2019s South Branch addition as to the right of property holders in said addition to build switches for business purposes from said property to said railroad. The proposition that all the lots between said Mason\u2019s and Allen\u2019s canals south of Twenty-second street were to be permitted to use the curved switch track provided for in said agreement is further strengthened by the addenda made a part of the agreement, which provides that the owners of lots ioi, 102 and 103 may use said curved track under certain conditions different from the conditions provided for the other lots in the main part of the agreement. Moreover, if there is any ambiguity as to the meaning of this contract, the practical construction placed thereon by the acts of the parties can be resorted to to determine the meaning of the grant. (Jones on Easements, sec. 389; Walker v. Illinois Central Railroad Co. 215 Ill. 610; McLean County Coal Co. v. City of Bloomington, 234 id. 90.) Such construction by the Beidlers and Witbecks shows that appellant\u2019s contention that only one track could be constructed south of the south line of lot 86 cannot be sustained, as several branch switches were constructed and in use south of that point for nearly forty years before these proceedings were started. It is obvious from the evidence in this record that the owners of lots 82 to 86 never claimed the right, under this agreement, to use the switches south of the south line of lot 86 from the time said agreement was executed until this controversy arose. Whatever doubt, therefore, there may have been under the original contract, this point must be held to be settled adversely to appellant\u2019s contention as to its present rights in said tracks south of the south line of lot 86: The fact that John H. Witbeck, who was the owner of lots 82 to 86 when said Fisk and Lumber streets were vacated by the city of Chicago, signed a petition requesting such vacation, shows clearly the intention of the then owner that the property might be used for private purposes and that any interest he might have therein was abandoned. His acts in relation thereto are binding upon his successors in title. ( Vogler v. Geiss, 51 Md. 407; King v. Murphy, 140 Mass. 254.) We cannot see how the vacation of Fisk and Lumber streets and the building of the fence across Fisk street, as heretofore set forth in the statement of the case, injuriously, affected appellant\u2019s rights. Since such vacation the Commonwealth Company has built extensive improvements in reliance thereon, and the property owners in the block who consented to the vacation, or their successors in title, are estopped from demanding that the original condition be restored. People v. Wieboldt, 233 Ill. 572.</p> <p id=\"b74-4\" pgmap=\"74\">Had the practice of doing all the switching on the said curved track during the night time, except Sundays, been followed from the time the contract was executed, or even for twenty years continuously, and been adverse, such practical construction of the agreement would have tended strongly to uphold appellant\u2019s contention that the court below was wrong in deciding that the Commonwealth Company had unrestricted rights to the said easement day and night, but the facts as shown in this record indicate that the doing of such switching at night continued less than twenty years and was permissive rather than adverse. We are therefore disposed to agree with the holding of the trial court that the parties to said easement agreement, and their successors and assigns, have the right to use said switch track in common, for the purpose of transferring railroad cars at all times back and forth between said railroad track and the lots in question.</p> <p id=\"b74-5\" pgmap=\"74(101) 75(60)\">The contention is made that the easement created by said contract of February 28, 1865, was in gross and not appurtenant. This easement satisfies all the requirements of an appurtenant easement. The servient and dominant estates are clearly defined in the contract. An easement will not be held to be in gross if it can fairly be held to be appurtenant. (Louisville and Nashville Railroad Co. v. Koelle, 104 Ill. 455; Kuecken v. Voltz, supra.) If the dominant estate is clearly indicated and the easement is beneficial to such estate then it is appurtenant, and it is not necessary that the dominant and servient estates should be contiguous or that the right of way should terminate, as claimed by appellant, on the dominant estate. (Jones on Easements, sec. 5; Horner v. Keene, 177 Ill. 390; Cady v. Springfield Water-works Co. 134 N. Y. 118.) We do not think Garrison v. Rudd, 19 Ill. 558, holds to the contrary.</p> <p id=\"b75-4\" pgmap=\"75(310) 76(11)\">It is further contended that section 13 of chapter 30, (Hurd\u2019s Stat. 1908, p. 491,) which provides that \u201cevery estate in lands which shall be granted, conveyed or devised, although other words heretofore necessary to transfer an estate of inheritance be not added, shall be deemed a fee simple estate of inheritance,\u201d etc., has no application to easements. As we understand the argument, it is that if a perpetual easement is to be granted, the word \u201cheirs,\u201d or some other word that would convey a fee under the common law, must be inserted, and that the word \u201cforever,\u201d as used in this agreement, does not answer that purpose. We think this question has been settled adversely to appellant\u2019s contention in Tinker v. Forbes, 136 Ill. 221, Horner v. Keene, supra, Oswald v. Wolf, 126 Ill. 542, and Barber v. Allen, supra. While the ruling of some courts is to the contrary, the weight of authority in this country agrees with the holdings of this court on this question. The dock company acquired a perpetual easement in the curved track across lots 82 to 86 as appurtenant to the lots owned by the dock company at the date of said easement contract,\u2014 that is, to lots 87, 88, 89, 90, 93 and the south half of lot 92. It is the settled law in this State that an easement created by a grantor in the lands of his grantee, in favor of the lands retained by the grantor and beneficial thereto, is appurtenant to the lands retained and binding on subsequent purchasers of the grantee\u2019s land. (Jones on Easements, sec. 392; Kuecken v. Voltz, supra; Horner v. Keene, supra.) Without question the authorities support the finding of the chancellor that the easement in said curved track under said agreement is appurtenant to said last named lots for the benefit of the present owner, the Commonwealth Electric Company.</p> <p id=\"b76-4\" pgmap=\"76\">Appellant further insists that no person not a party to the easement contract can take the grant of an easement under it; that the easement contract is necessarily between the parties to it, and that only the dock company, or some one in privity with it, can successfully maintain a suit at law or in equity against the parties of the second part to enforce the provisions of said easement agreement. The trial court agreed with this contention as to a suit at law, but held, in effect, that this is a proceeding in equity and governed by equitable rules of procedure, and that therefore equitable defenses will be sustained and equitable rights enforced herein. (Gage v. Caraher, 125 Ill. 447.) Parol contracts for easements have frequently been given effect by the courts under the rule laid down by Jones in his work on Easements, (sec. 83,) that a parol contract for an easement, which equity will regard as equivalent to a grant, must be \u201cmade for a valuable consideration and accompanied by acts of part performance unequivocally referable to the contract.\u201d It has been held in this State that where a person, for a valuable consideration, makes a promise to another for the benefit of a third person, such third person may maintain an action upon such promise; and it is not necessary in such case that there should be any consideration moving from the third person in whose favor the promise has been made. (Dean v. Walker, 107 Ill. 540; Webster v. Fleming, 178 id. 140; Ashelford v. Willis, 194 id. 492.) Courts of equity will enforce agreements creating easements and restrictions on lands when the intention of the parties is clear. Parker v. Nightingale, 6 Allen, 341; Hubbell v. Warren, 8 id. 173.</p> <p id=\"b76-5\" pgmap=\"76(45) 77(92)\">Without attempting to set, out the evidence in detail here, (it is referred to at some length in the statement of the case,) we think it is clear from this record that the owners of lots south of lot 86 served by the curved track paid to the owners of lots 82 to 86 eleven-fifteenths of the original cost of the section of the curved track, as provided for in said easement contract; that this payment and acceptance was without question referable to the contract, and that the cost of maintaining said curved switch track to the south line of said lot 86 was likewise paid by the owners of lots south of lot 86 served by the curved track, in accordance with the terms of said easement agreement, and also clearly referable to it.</p> <p id=\"b77-4\" pgmap=\"77\">Appellant insists that the payment made under the said original contract should have been in the proportion of eleven-sixteenths to five-sixteenths instead of eleven-fifteenths to four-fifteenths, as shown by this record, and that as the Witbeck Company only paid in the proportion of four instead of five lots, the first contribution as to the original cost of the curved track cannot be referable to this agreement but must have been made under some independent agreement. While the first payment tends to uphold in some measure this contention, we think the testimony of Augustus Beidler and other evidence' shows clearly that the payments, not only for the repair of the tracks but the original cost as provided for in such agreement, were made under this contract. Unless it was understood by the members of the Witbeck corporation and the Beidlers that such payments were being made under such contract, we can see no reason why the easement contract was restored by the then owners of the property and filed for record in 1874, after its destruction by the great fire in 1871.</p> <p id=\"b77-5\" pgmap=\"77(82) 78(135)\">We cannot sustain the claim of appellant that there can be no prescriptive rights as to some of the appurtenant lots because they were in the possession of tenants during the alleged prescriptive period. This claim is based on the argument that if the.property is in the possession of a tenant the owner is prevented from acquiring an easement therein by prescription. This argument is answered by the fact that John H. Witbeck, who was then the owner of the servient lots, was collecting from the owners of the dominant lots moneys on account of the switch track,\u2014and this during the time the tenants occupied the dominant lots. By reason of these payments and acquiescing in the user of the switch track by said appurtenant lots Witbeck waived all claim on this point. The evidence in this record shows conclusively that the owners of lots 87 to 93 and 33 to 39, inclusive, had been openly and notoriously using the said curved track for more than twenty years before this proceeding was instituted and in accordance with said easement agreement. The use of the curved track by said lots last mentioned being under the easement agreement and referable to it, the user must be held adverse. Schmidt v. Brown, 226 Ill. 590.</p> <p id=\"b78-3\" pgmap=\"78\">Appellant further contends that if it be assumed that the easement contract granted an easement for the benefit of any land fronting on Fisk or Lumber street, provided the owners accepted its conditions, such easement does not extend to the center of the street on which such lots abut. The determination of this question depends very largely on whether the plat of Greene\u2019s South Branch addition to Chicago conformed to the requirements of the statute in force at the time such plat was made. The record shows that the plat of the subdivision was executed and acknowledged by certain of the owners by their attorneys in fact. This was not in compliance with the statute. Blair v. Carr, 162 Ill. 362; Gosselin v. City of Chicago, 103 id. 623; Russell v. City of Lincoln, 200 id. 511.</p> <p id=\"b78-4\" pgmap=\"78(91) 79(222)\">It is argued, however, that Hance and Greene were the owners of all the property east of the center line of Fisk street at the time this plat was made and that they acknowledged the plat in person, and that therefore the plat as to the property they owned is a statutory plat, even though as to the other parts the owners did not comply with the statute,\u2014that is, part of the plat is statutory and part common law. We cannot assent to this proposition. The plat is an entirety. If any of the owners of property covered by the plat failed to comply with the statute it destroyed the validity of the entire plat as a statutory dedication. At the time the agreement was entered into, Fisk street had not been accepted by the public and the title of the abutting lot owners therefore extended to the center of the street. (Hamilton v. Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad Co. 124 Ill. 235.) Parties will be presumed to have contracted with reference to lots by their legal boundaries. Upon the acceptance of Fisk street by the public the public easement became a charg'e upon the title of the property owners. Such private rights, however, have remained, subject only to the right of passage and use by the public. It appears to be conceded that the vacation of these streets was in accordance with the law. Such vacation, therefore, destroyed the public easement and restored the parties to the full enjoyment of their private rights in said lots. Manifestly, the easement under said contract extended to the center of the street on which the appurtenant lots in question abutted,\u2014 that is, the easement extended to the center of Fisk and Lumber streets as to lots 87 to 93, inclusive, and lots 33 to 39, inclusive.</p> <p id=\"b79-4\" pgmap=\"79(155) 80(245)\">The trial court held that lots 94 to 97 were not shown by the record to have any rights in this easement contract. We think this holding was correct. At the time the easement agreement was executed and the deed given by the South Branch Dock Company to the Witbecks for said lots 82 to 86 Caleb Allen was the owner of lots 94 to 97. As has been stated, he did not purchase stock in said dock company. While it is clear that it was intended that all of the lots between Mason\u2019s and Allen\u2019s canals, including those owned by Allen, should have the benefit of the easement contract under the conditions provided therein, no proof is found in the record that the owners of lots 94 to 97 contributed in any way to the original cost of the curved track or towards its repair. While there is some slight evidence in the record that tends to show that some of the parties who occupied these lots, in connection with certain lots east of Fisk street, for lumber business used the curved track for the purpose of taking lumber to and from said lots 94 to 97, still this proof is very indefinite as to dates, length of time and amount of lumber moved. Indeed, the proof tends very strongly to show that said lots 94 to 97, inclusive, during most, if not all, of the time from the date when this contract was signed down to the time this controversy arose, used the switch track west of Fisk street, which curves south-easterly across said lot 105, for carrying materials between said Burlington road and the lots in question. It necessarily follows from what has been heretofore stated, that the right to use said curved switch- track under said agreement is not attached to the west half of the vacated portion of Fisk street originally included within said lots 94' to 97; and it also follows that the trial court was right in holding that the Commonwealth Company, its successors and assigns, are not entitled to maintain the existing connection between said curved switch track and the track constructed by said company in 1902, branching towards the west from the track in Fisk street opposite the dividing line between said lots 88 and 89, as shown on plat 3.</p> <p id=\"b80-4\" pgmap=\"80(134) 81(366)\">In view of the conclusions heretofore reached that certain lots are appurtenant or dominant to and certain other lots are non-appurtenant or non-dominant to said easement in the said switch track, one of the most serious and far-reaching questions in this record is whether the present use of said curved switch track by the Commonwealth Company is excessive. The master reported and' the court decreed that the easement was not appurtenant to the vacated portion of the west half of Fisk street,\u2014-that is, the land which had been a part of that street and was originally included in the eastern ends of said lots 94 to 97. The stipulation filed in this' case shows that the ten turbines and generators for supplying electricity in this plant are located on this vacated portion of Fisk street; that at least one-half of each turbine is west of the center line of Fisk street. The precise question thus presented has never been passed on by this court, nor, so far as we are advised, by any other court. Somewhat similar questions, however, have been considered. In Jones on Easements (sec. 32) that author states: \u201cAn easement cannot be extended or made to attach to land other than for the benefit of which it was created. It cannot be made to attach to other land which the owner of a dominant estate may subsequently acquire. * * * A land owner conveyed part of his land to a stone company, together with a right to construct a line of railway over the remaining part to connect the land granted with a public railroad. (Hoosier Stone Co. v. Malott, 130 Ind. 21.) It was held that this easement was appurtenant to the land granted, and the stone company had no right to permit its use by third persons to convey stone quarried on lands owned by them.\u201d Again, that author states (sec. 360) : \u201cOne having a right of way appurtenant to certain land cannot use it for the benefit of other land to which the right is not attached, although such other land is within the same enclosure with that to which the easement belongs. Except for this rule the burden upon the servient estate might be increased at the pleasure of the owner of the dominant estate. This rule is therefore applicable whether the way was created by grant, reservation, prescription or as a way of necessity. * * * The way is granted for the benefit of the particular land and its use is limited to such land. Its use cannot be extended to other land, nor can the way be converted into a public way without the consent of the owner of the servient estate. One having a right of way to his land blackacre over the land of another has no right to drive his cattle to blackacre and then to other land beyond it.\u201d Howell v. King, 1 Mod. 190.</p> <p id=\"b81-4\" pgmap=\"81(23) 82(59)\">A owned three lots, all of which were embraced in one pasture, and had the right to cross other land to go to one of these three lots. He crossed this other land and went to one of his lots not dominant to the easement for the purpose of salting sheep, and on his return was assaulted by the owner of the land subject to the easement. The court held that he was a trespasser. French v. Marstin, 32 N. H. 316.</p> <p id=\"b82-3\" pgmap=\"82\">A person had a right to go over certain land to reach a three-acre lot. Adjoining this lot he also owned a nine-acre lot, the two not being separated by any fence. Having mowed the grass on his two lots he proceeded to load the hay, each load containing hay cut from each of the lots. An action in trespass was sustained. The court held that he could only enter the other party\u2019s land to go to the three-acre lot. Davenport v. Lamson, 21 Pick. 72.</p> <p id=\"b82-4\" pgmap=\"82\">One Jenkins was the occupant of a field called \u201cnine-acre field\u201d and of two adjoining fields called \u201cParrott\u2019s land.\u201d The nine-acre field had a right of way over plaintiff\u2019s land to the public highway. Jenkins mowed all three fields and stacked all the hay, in good faith, on the nine-acre field, afterward selling it to the defendant, James, who carried it across plaintiff\u2019s land to the highway, which was the alleged trespass. It was held that this was not an excessive user of the right of way. Williams v. James, 2 L. R. C. P. 577.</p> <p id=\"b82-6\" pgmap=\"82(117) 83(59)\">A private carriage road had been established for many years as a means of reaching certain enclosures of meadow and woodland. Afterward Pinch and others acquired a portion of the premises, including the fee (subject to the easement) of the road, and erected thereon a large lunatic asylum. The defendant railway company acquired title to another portion of the premises and maintained thereon a cattle-pen, where large numbers of cattle were driven by' means of the road and were collected and were then driven over the road to the railroad for shipment. Plaintiffs objected on account of the noise. The court held that this was a lawful user on the part of the railway company, and that said company was not restricted to the user which existed at the time of the grant. Finch v. Great Western Railway Co. 5 L. R. Exch. 254. See, also, on this point, Reise v. Enos, 76 Wis. 634; Webber v. Vogel, 159 Pa. St. 235; Greene v. Canny, 137 Mass. 64; Albert v.

Some decisions of recent date have been handed down that are more closely in point than the authorities heretofore referred to. An easement was imposed on certain land in favor of a lot called therein for convenience the \u201cpink land,\u201d and afterwards a building was erected partly on said \u201cpink land\u201d and partly on adjoining premises called the \u201cwhite land,\u201d which was not subservient to the easement. It was desired to use the building for manufacturing purposes and to use this easement for hauling and freight traffic for the benefit of all the building. The court refused such use. Harris v. Flower, 74 L. J. Ch. 127.</p> <p id=\"b83-5\" pgmap=\"83\">An automobile garage was erected on two lots, one of which was entitled to an easement over an alley connecting with the streets. The automobiles from the garage, both that part situated on the land dominant to the easement and that part not on said land, passed in and out of the alley. The court held that the proprietor of the garage might use the alley as appurtenant to that part of the garage dominant to the easement but not as a means of ingress or egress to and from the other portion of the garage by means of the portion which was dominant. Diocese of Trenton v. Toman, 70 Atl. Rep. (N. J.) 606.</p> <p id=\"b83-6\" pgmap=\"83(47) 84(122)\">A partition deed embracing a number of lots contained a provision that a certain alley should \u201cbe forever left open as a means of ingress and egress for the advantage of all the property hereinbefore conveyed and partitioned.\u201d Afterward the Broad Exchange Company acquired title to one of said lots and to certain -other lots not included in said partition deed, and proceeded to erect on all of said lots a large office building, .designed for the accommodation of some seven thousand occupants. The heat and power plant was located on the premises dominant to the easement. The coal, ashes, paper and sweepings of the entire building were conveyed through the alley. The court issued an injunction against the owner of the building and its agents from using the easement until such time as the building should be so arranged as to permit the use of the easement for the advantage of the dominant tenement only. McCullough v. Broad Exchange Co. 101 N. Y. App. 566.</p> <p id=\"b84-3\" pgmap=\"84(243) 85(199)\">Counsel for the Commonwealth Company argue that as that company has so arrang-ed its entire plant that the part which contains the boilers is on the dominant estate the use of the easement is not excessive, as the company uses the switch track to the dominant estate for the purpose of transferring coal to the furnaces and boilers located on the dominant estate, where the coal is consumed, and the ashes and cinders are then hauled away from the dominant estate over the track. They argue that the steam plant is located next the dynamo plant, where electricity is generated, and that the dynamo plant cannot be considered appurtenant to the easement, under these circumstances, any more than it could if the steam had been piped under the river to turbine wheels on the south side of said river; that the relative location of the steam plant and the dynamo plant is immaterial; that the use of the easement in hauling freight over the switch is not only within the letter but within the spirit of the contract, and counsel insist that the only question presented is whether such use of the easement is within the terms of the grant,\u2014-is unlawful and excessive because adjacent property receives benefit therefrom. To support \u2022 their contention, counsel for the Commonwealth Company rely upon certain of the authorities heretofore cited, but especially upon the case of Simpson v. Godmanchester, L. R. App. (1897) 696. In that case the court had under consideration the use of an easement to prevent the flooding of dominant lands. This easement consisted in the right to open sluices for the purpose of protecting from inundation certain lands adjoining the river, and had been exercised for two hundred years in times of actual or threatened flood. A suit was brought to restrain the exercise of this right, and it was held by the court that the lands that had so exercised it in previous years could still continue to exercise it, even though by so doing other lands not dominant were benefited, holding that \u201cit is no objection to the exercise of a lawful right that it may indirectly benefit other persons or subjects which do not enjoy the same right.\u201d We think, however, the question in that case is clearly distinguishable from the one here presented. In that case no greater burden was imposed upon the servient estate, but here the burden imposed is increased and is in excess of the grant under the said easement agreement by the building being located partly on non-dominant estate, as herein set forth.</p> <p id=\"b85-4\" pgmap=\"85(157) 86(373) 87(18)\">Counsel for the Commonwealth Company insist that if the rule contended for by appellant be upheld, a steel plant could not use a switch to haul iron and coal for the manufacture of steel billets onto the dominant estate if the billets were subsequently to be rolled into rails on non-dominant lands; that a furniture factory could not use the switch in connection with the manufacture of furniture if the furniture was subsequently to be finished on non-dominant lands; that a car company could not manufacture car wheels on dominant property and use the easement if the wheels were to be subsequently attached to cars on non-dominant property. Under all these illustrations it is argued that other lands would receive the benefit of such use. If this argument were sustained then the Commonwealth Company could have constructed a very small part of its building, containing only the boilers, on the appurtenant lots and could have erected all the rest of the plant on non-dominant property, even though the plant covered acres of ground. No arbitrary or absolute rule can be laid down that will control in every case. The peculiar or special facts of each case must necessarily be taken into consideration in reaching a decision. As a general proposition, however, we think, if the entire plant is operated as a whole, that any integral, necessary or indispensable part of the entire plant cannot be situated on non-dominant estate. As we understand the question on this record, it is necessary for the creation of electricity not only that the boilers make the steam, but, as a part of the same creative act, the steam must be used in the turbine wheels to propel the generators, and the generators must at the same time be used for the purpose of generating electricity,-\u2014that is, the steam cannot be created as an independent factor. It cannot be tranferred to non-dominant estate, and thereafter, an appreciable period of time intervening, used, by a distinct and independent act, for generating electricity, the same as the billets of steel can be transferred from dominant to non-dominant estate and later on changed into the form of rails, or the same as car wheels manufactured on dominant estate can after-wards be transferred to non-dominant property to be used in making cars. The steam plant is not a part of this plant distinct and separate from that part of the plant which generates the electricity. The two are connected together and both are essential in the operation of the electrical plant. How can it be said that they are any more distinct parts of the same plant than that the brain and heart are distinct and each working independently of the rest of the human body? The generators and steam plant are both a part of one uniform and indivisible plant and process. These turbines and generators cannot be operated without the continuous support and application of the steam. Counsel for appellant well argue that this steam plant is no more independent of the rest of the plant than would a steam plant on dominant land in a flouring mill be from the shaft and machinery which grinds the grain on non-dominant land.</p> <p id=\"b87-3\" pgmap=\"87\">Counsel for the Commonwealth Company argue that the use of the switch by the non-dominant property is a reasonable one for the purposes of the dominant property, and that the Commonwealth Company erected its plant in good faith, without intending to subject the easement to a greater burden than was intended when the contract was originally entered into. We are inclined to think that this contention is sound to the extent of holding that the use of this unrestricted way is in good faith and reasonable in so far as the change of use is rendered necessary by using the dominant or appurtenant lots for their present use, instead of the former use of the curved switch track for lumber yards, but we do not think this rale of law can apply to its present use by the non-dominant lots. On principle and authority the holding of the trial court on this last point cannot be sustained. The entire plant of the Commonwealth Company, as shown on plat 3, both east and west of the center line of Fisk street, must be held to be one integral, indivisible and entire whole, and the use of the switch in hauling coal for this entire plant must be held to be an excessive user. The decree of the chancellor should have so found.</p> <p id=\"b87-4\" pgmap=\"87\">We are also disposed to hold that the trial court improperly decided that under this agreement the Commonwealth Company had the authority to connect the branch switch, as shown on said plat 3, opposite the middle part of said lot 85. Most favorably construed for the Commonwealth Company\u2019s contention, we do not think this easement contract by its terms was intended to allow more than one track north of the south line of said lot 86.</p> <p id=\"b87-5\" pgmap=\"87(42) 88(81)\">It is contended, however, that the construction placed upon this contract by the parties interested in years past permitted a branch or extra switch to be connected and built north of said south line of lot 86. The proof as to any switch being built north of said south line of said lot previous to 1902 is not at all clear or satisfactory. It is true, there is some evidence in the record that one switch track branched off from the main branch or switch at some point opposite lot 86, but just how far north of the south line of said lot no witness testified, though all the evidence is that no switch track ever branched off north of lot 86.</p> <p id=\"b88-4\" pgmap=\"88\">Counsel for the Commonwealth Company contend that, even if this state of facts be admitted, appellant not having raised this question until the amendment of its petition filed in 1908, it therefore waived its right to raise it. Even if John H. Witbeck stood by and permitted the construction of the switch track without objection, it cannot be held that the Commonwealth Company acted in ignorance of its rights, and no delay short of the statutory period will bar the relief contended for. Burrall v. American Tel. Co. 224 Ill. 266; Spalding v. Macomb and, Western Illinois Railway Co. 225 id. 585.</p> <p id=\"b88-5\" pgmap=\"88\">We think we have covered all the material points raised on this record. The facts are complicated and many of the questions difficult. We have been greatly aided in our study of the case by the well arranged and able briefs of counsel, together with the very complete statement of facts in the report of the special.master.</p> <p id=\"b88-6\" pgmap=\"88(103) 89(113)\">The decree of the superior court will be reversed and the cause remanded, with directions to re-enter the decree modified in accordance with this opinion, so as to enjoin and restrain the appellee the Commonwealth Electric Company, its officers, agents and employees, from using said easement over said curved switch track in connection with any lands which (as specified in this opinion) are not dominant to said easement; also to enjoin and restrain said company, its officers, agents and employees, from using the said easement over said curved switch track in connection with the building containing the generating plant, until such plant is so arranged as to permit the use of said easement for the advantage and benefit only of the lands that are dominant to it, without by the same act subjecting the easement to use in connection with non-dominant lands; also to enjoin and restrain said company, its officers, agents and employees, from the use of the switch track which branches off from the east of said main curved track opposite lot 85, unless and until said switch track is changed and re-built so as to connect with said main curved track not farther north than the south line of lot 86. In all other respects the decree will remain unchanged.</p> <p id=\"b89-5\" pgmap=\"89\">Reversed and remanded, with directions.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
