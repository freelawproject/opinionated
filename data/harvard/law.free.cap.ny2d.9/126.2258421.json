We find that the denial of the injunction and the dismissal of the complaint was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Appellant has since 1930 published monthly both \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>Modern Romances \u201d and \u201c Modern Screen \u201d. These two, along with a third magazine, currently \u201c Screen Stories \u201d, have been previously offered as a unit to advertisers as the \u201cModern Magazines \u201d and later as the Dell Modern Group. The third magazine has never had the word \u201c modern \u201d in its title. For the past 15 years the combined circulation of these three magazines has been approximately two and one-half million copies a month. \u20181 Modern Romances \u2019 \u2019 alone has exceeded one million copies a month, and its advertising revenue exceeds $800,000 annually.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">\u201cModern Romances\u201d was originally registered as a trade' mark in the United States Patent Office in 1932, and re-registered in 1954 under the Trade-Mark Act (Lanham Act) of 1946 (U. S. Code, tit. 15, \u00a7 1051 <em>et seq.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>In addition to the above three magazines appellant publishes approximately 18 distinct magazines, 38 comics and 14 pocket-size books a month, as well as 20 children\u2019s books each year. With only one or two exceptions each of the covers carries 1 \u2018 in the upper left-hand corner the distinctive and conspicuously placed <em>\u2018 </em>dell \u2019 insignia or symbol, consisting of the letters dell in a contrastingly colored box \u201d. This symbol was first adopted in 1943 and has since been used continuously in its advertising and letterheads, as well as on its publications, in order to identify them as appellant\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Over a period of 21 years since 1937 Dell spent approximately $2,320,000 to advertise and promote the Dell Modern Group, of which $1,140,000 was expended on <em>\u00a31 </em>Modern Romances \u2019 \u2019 alone. In promoting \u201c Modern Romances \u201d individually and as a member of the Dell Modern Group, Dell employed radio, television, newspapers, magazines and direct mail advertising. In 1948 a program entitled \u00a3 \u00a3 Modern Romances \u2019 \u2019 was initiated on radio, and later put on television.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Respondent, on the other hand, has since 1952 published various magazines including \u201cReal Secrets \u201d, \u201cReal War \u201d and \u201c Real Men\u201d. Early in 1958 respondent\u2019s executives decided to publish a companion magazine to Real Secrets, and initially selected the title \u201c Real Confessions \u201d in order to keep it in the Real Group. However, upon being informed that this title had been previously adopted by another publisher, the title \u201c Modern/CoNEESSiONS \u201d was chosen. It is conceded that \u201c [o]ne or more of the persons at defendant\u2019s editorial conference were aware of plaintiff\u2019s Modern Romances \u2019 \u2019. However, it is claimed <em>that11 </em>none saw any possible conflict, since historically the magazine field has had \u00a3 close \u2019 titles; that is competing titles containing one or more identical or nearly identical words in a composite title. For instance, \u00a3 Adventures for Men \u2019 and 1 Real Adventures \u2019 are published by competing publishers, as are <em>\u2018 </em>Movie Life \u2019 and <em>\u2018 </em>Movie Mirror \u2019; ' Confidential \u2019 and \u00a3 Confidential Detective \u2019; \u00a3 Man\u2019s Conquest \u2019 and ' Man\u2019s Smashing Stories \u2019; and \u00a3 Police Dragnet \u2019 and \u00a3 Police Gazette, \u2019 all of which are distributed by the <em>same national </em>distributor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Although additionally conceding that \u201c Modern/Confessions \u201d is generally classified in the same field (i.e., romance-confession) as \u201cModern Romances \u201d, respondent notes that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>the U. S. Patent Office records include approximately 61 publications whose registered titles contain the word 6 modern \u2019 including\" Modern Teen \u201d,\u00a3\u00a3 Modern Bride \u201d, Modern Miss 5 <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>Modern Photography \u201d, <em>\u201c </em>Modern Baby \u20195 and \u00a3 \u00a3 Modem Man \u201d, <em>none of which are published by the appellant or respondent. </em>Moreover, additional evidence of identical common words in competing magazines in the romance-confession field was thus indicated: \u201c True Story \u201d, \u00a3\u00a3 True Romance \u201d, \u00a3\u00a3 True Love \u201d and \u00a3\u00a3 True Experience \u201d published respectively since 1919,1923, 1924 and 1925 by Macfadden Publications, Inc.; \u00a3 6 True Confessions \u201d published since 1922 by Fawcett Publications; \u00a3&lt; True Secrets \u201d published by Official Magazine O\u2019orp.; \u00a3\u00a3 Real Romances \u201d and \u00a3\u00a3 Real Story \u201d published by Hillman; \u00a3&lt; Real Confessions \u2019 \u2019 published by Sterling.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Out of 26 magazine titles in the romance-confession field, 11 use the word \u201c romance \u201d, 5 use \u201c confessions \u201d, 5 use \u00a3\u00a3 story \u201d and 6 use \u00a3\u00a3 experience \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">In choosing the word \u00a3\u00a3 modern\u201d respondent\u2019s officers testified that they wanted a descriptive word which would also distinguish this magazine from the multitude of <em>confession </em>magazines.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The majority of the Justices of the Appellate Division found undisputed \u00a3 \u00a3 that all so-called \u00a3 romanee \u2019 and <em>\u2018 </em>confession \u2019 magazines, which cater primarily to the distaff side, share common characteristics. Most contain in their title a word such as <em>\u2018 </em>romance \u2019, <em>\u2018 </em>confession \u00a3 secrets \u2019 or \u00a3 experience. \u2019 The stories \u2014 which purport to be true \u2014 are actually fictional, are told in the first person, and deal with lurid accounts of sins, aberrations, mistakes, illicit loves, and marital infidelities. The covers of such magazines almost invariably feature the photographs or portraits of young and pretty girls as well as \u00a3 blurb \u2019 lines headlining the stories inside.\u201d On the other hand, the Appellate Division quite accurately noted that\u00a3\u00a3 Primarily, the logotype of \u00a3 Modern Confessions \u2019 in no way resembles that of <em>1 </em>Modern Romances. \u2019 Even a cursory examination of the exhibits shows that the two words of plaintiff\u2019s title are printed on the cover of plaintiff\u2019s magazine in letters of equal size, and on a single line. The words in defendant\u2019s title, however, are in italics, and the emphasis is on the word ' confessions.\u2019 \u00a3 Modern \u2019 is in the lower case type, and is located <em>above </em>the word \u00a3 Confessions\u2019\u2014which extends entirely across the cover.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>\u201c Moreover, plaintiff\u2019s magazine has the name dell printed in the upper left-hand corner. Another aspect of difference is the nature of the banner headlines on the respective magazines for the past five months. It is apparent that plaintiff in the form of its cover is seeking to broaden its reader base by appealing not just to the \u2018 confession \u2019 market, but to the general women\u2019s magazine market with such titles as: \u2018 Complete in this Issue: Chicken Cook Book \u2019; <em>\u2018 </em>There is a Perfect Hairdo For you on page 97 \u2019; <em>\u2018 </em>Save $20 on 20 Dinners etc. On the other hand, defendant\u2019s magazine makes no pretense at merchandising anything but so-called \u2018 confessions \u2019; with the upper headlines of its last five issues blazoning such titles as: <em>\u2018 </em>Invitations to Sex? \u2019; \u2018 Why Shouldn\u2019t He Wait For Me <em>\u2018 </em>Teen Girl on Sin Street \u2019; and \u2018 Afraid to Trust My Heart. \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u201cHence one need only pick up copies of the plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s magazines to see that their covers, their contents and even the texture of their paper are significantly different. The similarities are only those inherent in the nature of the product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Prior to the trial of this action six issues of respondent\u2019s magazine were published with an average net paid circulation of 130,000 copies per month, and net advertising revenue of $1,000 for each issue. \u201c Modern/Confessions \u201d has a sales price of 25 cents as distinguished from the price of 20 cents for \u201c Modern Romances \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The Appellate Division, finding for the respondent, ordered a reversal of findings of fact contained in the decision and opinion of the Supreme Court. In their view the evidence \u201c does not warrant a finding of a reasonable tendency to cause confusion \u201d. Defendant\u2019s magazine, they said, is clearly \u201cdistinguishable from plaintiff\u2019s, and cannot reasonably be mistaken for it.\u201d They found in addition that although the decision of the Supreme Court rested on a finding of unfair competition, and not on trademark infringement, it is apparent that a likelihood of confusion would be relevant to both claims; that \u201c [a]s already indicated, the record does not support a conclusion of a reasonable likelihood of confusion and that <em>the word \u201c modern </em>\u201d, as used in magazines in the romance-confession field, \u201c <em>is not a nondescriptive term which had acquired a secondary meaning to be protected by a court of </em>equity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>The weight of the evidence supports the prevailing opinion of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">It is fundamental that the substantive law of trade-marks is merely a portion of the broader law of unfair competition <em>(Hemmeter Cigar Co. </em>v. <em>Congress Cigar Co., </em>118 F. 2d 64); and that it is intended to discourage and restrain one from palming off his goods and/or their origin as the goods of another <em>(Triangle Pub. </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>65 F. Supp. 952, affd. 163 F. 2d 74). While we undoubtedly have jurisdiction over actions involving unfair competition, it is equally fundamental that, although Federal law may govern an action for infringement of a Federally registered trade-mark, we share jurisdiction over such actions with the Federal courts <em>(Brown &amp; Bigelow </em>v. <em>Remembrance Adv. Prods., </em>279 App. Div. 410, affd. 304 N. Y. 909).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">However, it has been noted that even a casual examination of the decisions will indicate that, aside from the broad and well-established principles, not only is precedent difficult to ascertain, but in many instances the decisions seem incompatible <em>(Telechron, Inc., </em>v. <em>Telicon Corp., </em>97 F. Supp. 131, affd. 198 F. 2d 903). Although this type of litigation has been said to present mixed questions of law and fact <em>(Palmer </em>v. <em>Gulf Pub. Co., </em>79 F. Supp. 731; <em>Fawcett Pub. </em>v. <em>Popular Mechanics Co., </em>80 F. 2d 194), the emphasis, and rightfully so, we believe, seems to have been placed upon the fact pattern of each situation. <em>(Telechron, Inc., </em>v. <em>Telicon Corp., supra; </em>see, also, <em>Hotel Syracuse </em>v. <em>Motel Syracuse, </em>309 N. Y. 831; <em>Eastern Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Eastern Eng. Co., </em>246 N. Y. 459.) Each case, whether dealing with unfair competition or trade-mark infringement or both, must be decided on its facts, and \u201c the reported cases are helpful to show the general principles to be applied in reaching a decision \u201d <em>(Palmer </em>v. <em>Gulf Pub. Co., supra, </em>p. 737).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">We proceed, therefore, to these general principles and their application in this particular situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">The Lanham Act (U. S. Code, tit. 15, \u00a7\u00a7 1051-1127) provides that: \u201cA certificate of registration * * * shall be prima facie evidence of the validity of the registration, registrant\u2019s ownership of the mark, and of registrant\u2019s exclusive right to use the mark in commerce in connection with the goods or services specified in the certificate\u201d (\u00a7 1057, subd. [b]). However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number><em>\u201c </em>\u2018 the mere registration of a trade-mark does not in itself confer any greater rights than existed at common law without registration. \u2019 # ** * \u2018 registration * * * confers only procedural advantages and does not enlarge the registrant\u2019s substantive rights. \u2019 \u201d <em>(Brown &amp; Bigelow </em>v. <em>B B Pen Co., </em>191 F. 2d 939, <em>942.) </em>Registration of a descriptive word does not prevent others from using the same word, or from registering a new mark which uses it, if the new mark has additional features <em>(Pure Oil Co. </em>v. <em>The Pep Boys\u2014Manny, Moe &amp; Jack, </em>128 F. 2d 34). <em>The test, as in unfair competition, is the likelihood of confusion, regardless of evidence of actual confusion. (Famous Sea Food House </em>v. <em>Skouras, </em>272 App. Div. 258; <em>T. A. Vulcan </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>139 N. Y. 364, 367; <em>Admiral Corp. </em>v. <em>Penco, Inc., </em>203 F. 2d 517, 520).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, if the resemblance is calculated to produce confusion as to identity and consequent damage, equity will enjoin the simulation <em>(American Foundries </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>269 U. S. 372; <em>Eastern Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Eastern Eng. Co., </em>246 <em>N. </em>Y. 459, <em>supra). </em>It is well established, however, that not all similarity will be enjoined. The law does not justify interference on behalf of ignorant or careless persons <em>(Corning Glass Works </em>v. <em>Corning Cut Glass Co., </em>197 N. Y. 173; <em>Buffalo Typewriter Exch. </em>v. <em>McGarl, </em>240 N. Y. 113; <em>Wholesale Serv. Supply Corp. </em>v. <em>Wholesale Bldg. Materials Corp., 304 N. </em>Y. 854; <em>Hotel Syracuse </em>v. <em>Motel Syracuse, supra). </em>It must be assumed that the public will use reasonable intelligence and discrimination <em>(Wholesale Serv. Supply Corp. </em>v. <em>Wholesale Bldg. Materials Corp., supra). </em>\u201cA court of equity should proceed in the exercise of its power with a wise and judicial discretion. In cases such as this it should be presumed that the public makes use of the senses of sight and hearing, and that it is possessed of a sufficient amount of intelligence to note the difference the senses convey. The court ought not to interfere with the freedom of conduct of trade and with general business competition. Its power to restrain should be reserved to prevent fraud and imposture from some real resemblance in the name and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>appearance of the publications.\u201d <em>(Munro </em>v. <em>Tousey, </em>129 N. Y. 38, 43.)</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">In our opinion neither the name, sound nor appearance of respondent\u2019s title or magazine is significantly similar so as to cause persons of average intelligence to be confused either as to their origin or identity. As the Appellate Division stated: \u201c Even a cursory examination \u201d reveals their distinction. \u201c The similarities are only those inherent in the nature of the product \u201d, and their duplication is not a proper subject of restraint. It is not all competition, <em>but only unfair competition, </em>which equity should enjoin <em>(Fawcett Pub. </em>v. <em>Popular Mechanics Co., </em>80 F. 2d 194, 197, <em>supra). </em>Registration of \u201cModern Romances \u201d affords appellant no additional privileges upon this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Although the Lanham Act \u201c put federal trade-mark law upon a new footing \u201d <em>(Johnson &amp; Son </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>175 F. 2d 176, 178, cert. denied 338 U. S. 860), the mere registration of descriptive or suggestive words would not automatically preclude their use by others when the evidence indicates a lack of secondary meaning. Unlike registration under the prior law, which limited validity to names which could meet the requirements of a technical trade-mark (i.e., an arbitrary or fanciful term having no meaning in relation to the goods in question), the Lanham Act now authorizes those common and generic terms which through continuous use have become identified with the origin of the goods. <em>(Brown </em>&amp; <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Remembrance Adv. Prods., </em>279 App. Div. 410, affd. 304 N. Y. 909, <em>supra.) </em>Although subdivision (e) of section 2 of the Lanham Act (U. S. Code, tit. 15, \u00a7 1052, subd. [e]) provides that the Patent Office shall refuse registration of a mark which is <em>11 </em>merely descriptive \u2019 \u2019, it further provides that nothing shall prevent the registration of a mark which has \u201c become distinctive of the applicant\u2019s goods \u201d (U. S. Code, tit. 15, \u00a7 1052, subd. [f]), or as it is commonly phrased \u2014 which has acquired a secondary meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Note, however, that while registration is prima facie evidence of validity (U. S. Code, tit. 15, \u00a7 1057, subd. [b]), the mark is still open to objection, as descriptive, until the provisions (which concededly have not been complied with) of section 15 (U. S. Code, tit. 15, \u00a7 1065; especially subd. [2]) have been met. <em>(Conde Nast Pub. </em>v. <em>Vogue School of Fashion Modelling, </em>105 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>F. Supp. 325.) Moreover, even if they had been complied with it would not preclude an objection here since the marks are not identical. The protection of the incontestability clause of the Lanham Act must be with regard to the use by another of <em>both terms, </em>unless one, in and of itself, is naturally identified with the registrant. This would not apply to the word 1 \u2018 modern \u2019 \u2019 alone. Appellant\u2019s magazine is \u201c known and called for by its full name \u201d <em>(Collegiate World Pub. Co. </em>v. <em>Du Pont Pub. Co., </em>14 F. 2d 158, 160). The word \u201c modern \u201d would not in and of itself in view of the numerous publications employing it (see <em>McGraw-Hill Pub. Co. </em>v. <em>American Aviation Assn., </em>117 F. 2d 293, 296) be distinctive of appellant alone. It certainly is not a coined term, and it is not used in a <em>completely arbitrary </em>manner. While possibly <em>not wholly descriptive, </em>it certainly is at least suggestive <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Although, as suggestive, it may still be a valid trade-mark, it does not here qualify since it has not become identified, in the minds of the public, with the origin of the goods <em>(Telechron, Inc., </em>v. <em>Telicon Corp., </em>97 F. Supp. 131, <em>supra). </em>It is not without significance that there are 61 registered publications employing this term in their titles. No one seeking Dell\u2019s \u201c.Modern Romances \u201d could reasonably be expected to get it by requesting and calling it by the single word \u201c modern \u201d. \u201c <em>[B]oth words of the title are of equal dignity and importance and they always have been used together without distinguishing </em>emphasis.'\u2019\u2019 <em>(Fawcett Pub. </em>v. <em>Popular Mechanics Co., </em>80 F. 2d 194, 198, supra; publisher of \u201c Popular Mechanics \u201d denied injunction to restrain use of word \u201c mechanics \u201d in title \u201c Modern Mechanics \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AVF\">While \u201cconfessions\u201d and \u201c romances \u201d convey much the same meaning, \u201c this is necessarily so because both are descrip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>tive of the articles to which they are applied.\u201d <em>(Collegiate World Pub. Co. </em>v. <em>Du Pont Pub. Co., supra, </em>p. 160; title \u201c College Humor \u201d and \u201c College Comics \u201d not sufficiently similar to warrant relief.) Both their sound and appearance are certainly distinct and their use with the common word \u201c modern \u201d does not drastically alter that distinction. Moreover, the manner in which they are employed amplifies the distinction. (See <em>Crowell Pub. Co. </em>v. <em>Italian Monthly Co., </em>28 F. 2d 613, 614; <em>Time, Inc., </em>v. <em>Motor Pub., </em>131 F. Supp. 846, 850, mod. 227 F. 2d 954.)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">In addition, the reading public of this class of magazine is more concerned with the intrinsic character of the magazines as exemplified by the \u201cblurb\u201d lines on their face (see <em>Gotham Music Serv. </em>v. <em>Denton &amp; Haskins Music Pub. Co., </em>259 N. Y. 86) than with the publisher <em>(Pocket Books </em>v. <em>Meyers, </em>292 N. Y. 58, 63). In order to establish a trade-mark it must be shown that \u201c <em>the primary significance of the term in the minds of the consuming public is not the product but the producer.\u201d (Kellogg Co. </em>v. <em>National Biscuit Co., </em>305 U. S. 111, 118, 119; italics supplied; <em>Brown &amp; Bigelow </em>v. <em>Remembrance Adv. Prods., </em>279 App. Div. 410, 413, affd. 304 N. Y. 909, <em>supra.) </em>Here if the public is interested in a Dell romance story, it will certainly have no difficulty in identifying the Dell symbol in the upper left-hand corner of the magazine cover. (See <em>Pocket Books </em>v. <em>Meyers, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The publishing field, as any other business, is within the ambit of judicial protection <em>(Munro </em>v. <em>Tousey, </em>129 N. Y. 38, 41, <em>supra). </em>However, it is recognized that \u2018 \u2018 the names of periodicals present problems not as common where other commercial goods or other intellectual property is concerned.\u201d (2 Mms, Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks [4th ed.], \u00a7 279, p. 928.) These names seldom are arbitrary or wholly fanciful and \u201c [e]ven those that are technical, common law trade-marks often are more or less suggestive.\u201d (2 Nims, Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks [4th ed.], \u00a7 279, p. 930.) This problem is compounded, and secondary meaning is difficult to establish, because of the repetitious use of similar titles by competing publishers. For example, in the <em>Collegiate World </em>case (14 F. 2d 158, 160, <em>supra), </em>in denying an injunction against the use of a similar descriptive title (i.e., \u201c College Humor \u201d \u2014 \u201c College Comics \u201d), the court noted that: \u2018 \u2018 Similarity in names of magazines dealing with the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>subject is not unusual, but on the contrary is quite common, such as Popular Science, Popular Mechanics; Outdoor Life, Outdoor Recreation; Field and Stream, Forest and Stream; Boy\u2019s Life, Boy\u2019s Magazine; Ladies Home Journal, People\u2019s Home Journal; Radio Doings, Radio Digest, Radio World, Radio Age, Radio Progress, Radio News, Radio Broadcast; Motor, The Motor, Motor Transport, Motor Record, Motor World, Motor Age, Motor Life; etc.\u201d (See, also, <em>Warner Pub. </em>v. <em>Popular Pub., </em>87 F. 2d 913, 914 [\u201c Ranch Romances \u201d, \u201c Rangeland Romances \u201d]; <em>McGraw-Hill Pub. Co. </em>v. <em>American Aviation Assn., </em>117 F. 2d 293, 296, supra; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Gulf Pub. Co., </em>79 F. Supp. 731, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Appellant\u2019s final claim that respondent deliberately imitated appellant\u2019s mark is an inference deduced merely from testimony by respondent\u2019s executives that they were aware of the success and reputation of \u201c Modern Romances \u201d. Even if the allegation is accurate, it is nonetheless apparent that the final product is not so simulative of appellant\u2019s magazine as to warrant relief by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Accordingly, the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Dye, Fttld, Froessel, Van Voorhis and Foster concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-6\">. The Federal statute defines trade-mark infringement as the use of \"Any * * * colorable imitation of any registered mark in connection with * * * any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely <em>to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers as to the source of origin of such goods or services\" </em>(U. S. Code, tit. 15, \u00a7 1114, subd. [1]; emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b168-7\">. \u201c Between the two extremes represented by the arbitrary or fanciful name, on the one hand which may be a trade-mark, and the word or phrase which is primarily descriptive of the article * * * \u2018lies a middle ground wherein terms of mingled qualities are found. It cannot be said that they are primarily descriptive or that they are purely arbitrary or fanciful without any indication of the nature of the goods which they denominate. Such terms, indeed, shed some light upon the characteristics of the goods, but so applied they involve an element of incongruity, and in order to be understood as descriptive, they must be taken in a <em>suggestive </em>or figurative sense through an effort of the imagination <em>on </em>the <em>part of </em>the observer.\u2019 \u201d (1 Rims, Unfair Competition and Trade-Marks [4th ed.], \u00a7 41, p. 168; emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
