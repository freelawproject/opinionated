The 1934 and 1943 revisions of mortality tables in their application to then existing members retiring in the future are valid under the New York City Teachers\u2019 Retirement Statute and the New York Constitution (art. V, \u00a7 7). <em>(Matter of Carroll </em>v. <em>Grumet, </em>281 App. Div. 35, 305 N. Y. 692; <em>Cashman v. Teachers\u2019 Retirement Bd., </em>193 Misc. 57, 275 App. Div. 908, 301 N.

Y. 574; <em>Martorano </em>v. <em>Capital Finance Corp., </em>289 N. Y. 21.) II. The Constitution (art. V, \u00a7 7) did not change the terms of the retirement statute or repeal the statutory reservation to the Retirement Board of the right to revise annuity benefit mortality tables as to existing members not yet retired, and did not grant to members of the system any right at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>retirement to mortality tables, other than the last revised tables in use at such time. <em>(Roddy </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>268 N.

V, \u00a7 7) protected the benefit formula \u201c stated \u201d in the statute from diminution by the legislative body but did not prevent the Retirement Board from carrying out its obligation under the existing statute. <em>(Cashman </em>v. <em>Teachers\u2019 Retirement Bd., </em>193 Misc. 57, 275 App. Div. 908, 301 N.

The pertinent sections of the Administrative Code relating to the Teachers Retirement System preclude the board from computing annuities based on less favorable mortality tables adopted after teachers enter the system. Such tables may only be applied to persons who enter the system thereafter. II. The constitutional amendment prohibits the reduction of a teacher\u2019s annuity through the adoption of a less favorable mortality table. <em>(Roddy </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>268 N.

Petitioners are members of the Teachers Retirement System which is administered by appellant board. They challenge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>legality of the board\u2019s method of calculating the annuity portion of the retirement allowance to which they and others similarly situated are or will be entitled. The case of <em>Birnbaum </em>v. <em>New York State Teachers Retirement System </em>(5 N Y 2d 1) is controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">We are in agreement with so much of the holding below as provides that the board may not calculate the retirement annuities due petitioners on the basis of the tables in effect at the time of their retirement. We are not in agreement, however, with so much of the orders appealed from as directs that the board calculate the retirement annuities to which petitioners are, or will be, entitled on the basis of the mortality tables in use at the time they entered the service. Special Term, apparently based on some language in our decision in <em>Birnbaum </em>v. <em>New York State Teachers Retirement System {supra), </em>held\u2014 beyond petitioners\u2019 prayer for relief\u2014that the tables in use when petitioners entered the service must be employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Changes in mortality tables, subsequent to the time when the <em>Birnbaum </em>petitioners joined the system, but before July 1,1940, were <em>not </em>brought to the attention of this court in that case. Our decision, therefore, did not consider the question of whether, in the event the mortality tables were revised between the date a member entered service and July 1, 1940, the constitutional amendment should be given retroactive effect, and thus nullify as to such a member the changes which had been made. This question must now be considered, since each of the present petitioners commenced service prior to 1931, and the mortality tables were thereafter revised both before and after the effective date of the amendment\u2014once in 1934 and again in 1943.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">In <em>Matter of Day </em>v. <em>Mruk </em>(307 N. Y. 349, 354) we noted that, while section 7 of article V was added to the Constitution in 1938, it was specifically provided that it was not to become effective until July 1, 1940. This postponement of 1% years was (307 N. Y., at p. 354) <em>\u201c </em>presumably to enable the State and its civil divisions to review their pension systems and to adjust, amend, modify or supplement the provisions of existing systems in the light of the fact that after such effective date such systems were no longer gratuitous, but by virtue of the new amendment became contracts and the members of pension systems thereby acquired vested interests which could not' thereafter be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>diminished or impaired. Excerpts from the proceedings of the Convention appear to bear out this conclusion.\u201d This view of the situation was quoted with approval in the <em>Birnbaum </em>decision (5 NY 2d 1, 12, <em>supra). </em>If the amendment was intended to have retroactive effect, there would have been no need for the postponement of its effective date (see <em>Matter of Kaufman, </em>158 Misc. 102, 106). Any changes made during that time could not have affected the rights of existing members, as their rights under such a construction would have been fixed on the day they entered the service.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">As was noted in <em>Birnbaum </em>v. <em>New York State Teachers Retirement System </em>(5 N Y 2d 1, 8-9, <em>supra), </em>and <em>Matter of Day </em>v. <em>Mruk </em>(307 N. Y. 349, 354, <em>supra), </em>prior to the effective date of the constitutional amendment members of pension and retirement systems had <em>no </em>vested interest therein until the right to retirement matured. The leading case <em>(Roddy </em>v. <em>Valentine, </em>268 N. Y. 228, 231) indicated that, whatever the legal nature of the member\u2019s interest was prior to his retirement, <em>\u201c </em>there seems to be no doubt that it is subject to change or even to revocation at the will of the Legislature \u2019 \u2019. It was this conclusion which the amendment was designed to overcome <em>(Birnbaum </em>v. <em>New York State Teachers Retirement System, </em>5 N Y 2d 1, 8, <em>supra). </em>Therefore, since a member\u2019s rights could be changed prior to the effective date of the amendment, and a period of time was expressly provided during which any further changes might be made, it seems clear that the amendment was intended to have only prospective, and not retroactive, effect. This view is in accord with the general rule of construction that statutes as well as constitutional provisions are to be construed as prospective only, unless a clear expression of intent to the contrary is found <em>(Matter of Container Co. </em>[Corsi], 298 N. Y. 277, 279; <em>Garzo </em>v. <em>Maid of Mist Steamboat Co., </em>303 N. Y. 516, 522; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fancher, </em>50 N. Y. 288, 291). We have examined the other arguments advanced by appellants, many of which were presented in the <em>Birnbaum </em>case <em>(supra), </em>but do not find that they have any merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Accordingly, the orders appealed from must be modified so as to provide for the recalculation of petitioners\u2019 retirement annuities on the basis of the actuarial values including tables of mortality in effect immediately prior to July 1,1940, with inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>est from the date of retirement, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Dye, Fuld, Van Voorhis, Burke and Foster concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">In each case: Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
