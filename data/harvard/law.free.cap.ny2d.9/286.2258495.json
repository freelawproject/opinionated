It is the appellant\u2019s contention that the trial judge committed reversible error in refusing to turn over to defense counsel, for cross-examination purposes, statements given some time .before the trial by three prosecution witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">One of the three, Basilio Otero, was an eyewitness to the robbery. He had been about to leave the restaurant when the appellant, gun in hand, ordered him to the rear of the shop and into the lavatory; at the same time, he saw the other two defendants (who had been with the appellant) push the proprietor toward the rear. From behind the closed door, he heard a shot and, after a few minutes, came out to find the robbers gone. The second witness was Josephine Rodriguez, a girl friend of one of the other defendants; it was she to whom the appellant gave his gun after the robbery, informing her that he and the others had held up a man in a restaurant, taken $75 from him and \u00a3\u00a3 shot him \u201d when he refused to give them more. The third witness was the appellant\u2019s own girl friend, Jane Thompson, and to her the appellant admitted the \u201c shooting \u201d, stating that \u201c we had three guns and we shot together \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">After each of these three witnesses had concluded his or her direct testimony, defense counsel requested that the witness\u2019 statements be turned over to them for possible use on cross-examination. Instead, the statements were submitted to the trial judge for his inspection. After reading each statement, he announced that he found some \u00a3\u00a3 variances \u201d between statement and testimony and told defense counsel that they might examine and use only those portions of the statement containing the variances. In other words, he refused the request that the entire statement be given to the defense so that counsel might \u201c determine for themselves \u201d whether any other portions would be helpful upon cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>When it appears that a witness for the prosecution has made a statement, to police, district attorney or grand jury, the attorney for the defendant, naturally enough, desires to see it in the hope that it may assist him to impeach and discredit that witness. The question then arises whether the statement should forthwith be delivered to the defense or whether it should be handed over only if it is found, on inspection by the court, to contain material at variance with the witness\u2019 testimony in court. The United States Supreme Court has held that a defendant \u201cis entitled to inspect\u201d any statement made by the Government\u2019s witness which bears on the subject matter of the - witness\u2019 testimony (see <em>Jencks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>353 U. S. 657, 667, 668), whereas in New York we have allowed the defendant to see and use the statement only if it contains matter which is inconsistent with the testimony given by the witness from the stand. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>262 N. Y. 140, 149; <em>People </em>v. <em>Schainuck, </em>286 N. Y. 161; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dales, </em>309 N. Y. 97; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bai, </em>7 N Y 2d 152, 155.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The procedure to be followed turns largely on policy considerations, and upon further study and reflection this court is persuaded that a right sense of justice entitles the defense to examine a witness\u2019 prior statement, whether or not it varies' from his testimony on the stand. As long as the statement \u00a1 relates to the subject matter of the witness\u2019 testimony and? contains nothing that must be kept confidential, defense counsel \u2022 should be allowed to determine for themselves the use to be made of it on cross-examination. (Cf. U. S. Code, tit. 18, \u00a7 3500.)</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">A pretrial statement of a witness for the prosecution is valuable not just as a source of contradictions with which to confront him and discredit his trial testimony. Even statements seemingly in harmony with such testimony may contain matter which will prove helpful on cross-examination. They may reflect a witness\u2019 bias, for instance, or otherwise supply the defendant with knowledge essential to the neutralization of the damaging testimony of the witness which might, perhaps, turn the scales in Ms favor. Shades of meaning, stress, additions, or omissions may be found which will place the witness\u2019 answers upon direct examination in an entirely different light. As the United States Supreme Court has so well observed, \u201c Flat contradiction between the witness\u2019 testimony and the version of the events given [previously] * * * is not the only test of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>inconsistency. The omission from the reports of facts related at the trial, or a contrast in emphasis upon the same facts, even a different order of treatment, are also relevant to the cross-examining process of testing the credibility of a witness\u2019 trial testimony. \u201d <em>(Jencks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>353 U. S. 657, 667, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Furthermore, omissions, contrasts and even contradictions, vital perhaps, for discrediting a witness, are certainly not as apparent to the impartial presiding judge as to single-minded counsel for the accus.ed; the latter is in a far better position to appraise the value of a witness\u2019 pretrial statements for impeachment purposes. Until his attorney has an opportunity to see the statement, it is asked, how can he effectively answer the trial judge\u2019s assertion that it contains nothing at variance with the testimony given or, at least, useful to him in his attempt to discredit such witness?</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">It is true that defense counsel will undoubtedly be in a position to cross-examine, at greater length than without such pretrial statements. But there is nothing wrong in this. It does not mean that the defense will be able to go on a tour of investigation seeking generally useful information. Our decision pre[supposes that the statement relates to the subject matter of the witness\u2019 testimony, that it is to be used for impeachment purposes only after direct examination and that the necessities of effective law enforcement do not require that the statement be kept secret or confidential. In any event, the extent of cross-examination is subject to control by the trial judge. In short, since \u201c the State has no interest in interposing any obstacle to the disclosure of the facts \u201d and since the <em>\u201c </em>defense should be given the benefit \u201d of any \u201c information that can legitimately tend to overthrow the case made for the prosecution, or to show that it is unworthy of credence \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>52 Mich. 569, 572, 573-574; <em>People </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>262 N. Y. 140, 150, <em>supra), </em>the defendant is entitled to see and use the entire statement. Otherwise, there is always a danger that something will be withheld from defense counsel which may assist him in impeaching the prosecution\u2019s witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">It is our conclusion, therefore, that the trial judge should have turned over to the defendant the requested statements in their entirety. In this instance, though, we deem it not amiss to consider whether the ruling which he made prejudiced the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>defendant, whether, in other words, there was a rational possibility that the jury would have reached a different verdict i'f the defense had been allowed the use of the witness\u2019 prior statements. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Kingston, </em>8 N Y 2d 384, 387; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>7 N Y 2d 142, 145; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mleczko, </em>298 N. Y. 153, 162-163.) We believe not. On the record before us, there can be no possible question of the appellant\u2019s guilt, even apart from the testimony of the witnesses whose statements had been requested and refused. Not only was there evidence of admission to friends before and after the fatal robbery, not only was there proof of a confession to the district attorney, not only was there evidence of flight, but there was ballistics testimony indicating that the lethal bullet had issued from the appellant\u2019s gun. And, of the utmost significance, examination of the prior statements discloses that the few variances contained in them were of a most inconsequential character.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">This court is exceeding slow to disregard error as harmless under section 542 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, particularly in a capital case. However, in the one before u\u00bb, we are as convinced as judges may ever be, in view of the overwhelming proof of guilt and the absence of any real inconsistency between prior statement and trial testimony, that the jury would not have decided the case differently even if defense counsel had had the use of the statements in question. In other words, it may not be said that any substantial right of the appellant was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s erroneous ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The judgment of conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-7\">. The jury found one of the appellant\u2019s codefendants guilty of murder in the first degree, with a recommendation that he be imprisoned for life (Penal Law, \u00a7 1045^a); his appeal is now pending in the Appellate Division. As to the other defendant, the jury failed to agree on a verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b323-7\">Froessbl, J. (concurring).</author>\n<p id=\"ADc\">I agree for affirmance, but not under section 542 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">For many years it has been the rule in this State \u201c that where a witness in a criminal case testifies to having made * * * a statement and the statement is in court and an inspection of it by the presiding judge reveals contradictory matter, <em>its use for cross-examination on the question of credibility </em>may and usually should be permitted \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>262 N. Y. 140, 149-150, emphasis supplied; see, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Schainuck, </em>286 N. Y. 161; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dales, </em>309 N. Y. 97, 102-103; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bai, </em>7 N Y 2d 152, 155).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>In <em>Walsh </em>we did not say that the prosecutor was required to turn over the entire statement. In <em>Schainuck </em>we recognized that the \u201c use \u201d of the statement was for the purpose of comparing the \u2018 \u2018 conflicting versions \u2019 \u2019, and spreading them both before the jury. It has thus been the invariable practice to give to a defendant access to the statement of a People\u2019s witness only insofar as it contains contradictory matter. Indeed there can be no doubt what we meant in the <em>Walsh </em>case for, as recently as..a little more than a year ago, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Bai (supra), </em>we stated that on the new trial a witness\u2019 statement, which conflicted in some respects with his testimony at the trial, \u201c might well be released <em>in part </em>to the defendant under <em>People </em>v. <em>Walsh </em>(262 N. Y. 140) \u201d (emphasis supplied). That is precisely what was done here.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">I see no.good reason why we should now change the longstanding <em>Walsh </em>rule, so that, as the majority hold, even \u201c statements seemingly in harmony with such [witness\u2019] testimony\u201d must be surrendered to defense counsel because they may somehow \u201cprove helpful on cross-examination \u201d. In a criminal action, the People have the burden of overcoming the presumption of innocence which rightfully belongs to a defendant and proving his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The courts have no right to add to the People\u2019s burden the necessity of giving defense counsel ammunition in a game of semantics.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">A defendant should of course be entitled to probe fully any contradictory matter, but oug\u2019ht not to be permitted to embark on a fishing expedition in the expectation of discovering subtle shades of meaning and immaterial variances in a prior statement of a witness, and skillfully playing on them before the jury. Such a practice would undoubtedly prolong trials and produce confusion, without in any way promoting the ends of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The rule as followed in New York State is a sound one and should not be abandoned. While we should always remember that a defendant\u2019s rights must be zealously safeguarded, we should not forget that the rights of the People of the State ought not be whittled away by judicial decision. The majority suggest that an impartial presiding Judge might not be alert to the latent possibilities of an item in a statement, and only the defense is adequately equipped to decide as to the effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>use of a witness\u2019 pretrial statement. We are not here concerned with a defense attorney\u2019s right to exploit a witness\u2019 pretrial statement except insofar as it affects the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial and the interests of justice. I refuse to concede that a Trial Judge is less able than a defendant\u2019s attorney to see to it that this right is accorded the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">Despite the majority\u2019s doubt about the capabilities of a Trial Judge, and their fear \u201cthat something will be withheld from defense counsel which may assist him in impeaching the prosecution\u2019s witness \u201d, it nevertheless votes to affirm the conviction in this capital case. It holds that we as appellate Judges may now examine the prior statements, and conclude that the variances they disclose are of such a trivial and inconsequential character that they may be disregarded. If we may, why may not the Trial Judge be given the same right in the first instance? Should he err, the appellate courts may correct him, as in any other case of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Since the rule enunciated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Walsh (supra), </em>and reaffirmed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Bai (supra), </em>is a sound one, which in nowise deprives defendant of a fair trial, we should not change it now. The court below faithfully followed the rule we laid down, and accordingly we should affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Van Voobhis and Foster concur with Judge Fuld ; Judge Froessel concurs for affirmance in a separate opinion in which Judges Dye and Burice concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Judgment of conviction affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
