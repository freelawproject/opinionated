A motion for judgment dismissing the complaint under rule 107 of the Rules of Civil Practice will not be granted unless it \u201c conclusively appears \u201d from the pleadings and affidavits that the claims have been released so that there is no triable issue of fact. <em>(Cordes </em>v. <em>California Ins.

The motion to dismiss is not supported by general condition No. 25. There is a factual issue whether, at the time of the making and acceptance of the final payment, Corhill\u2019s claims against Plants alleged in the amended complaint were \u201c previously made \u201d and \u201c still unsettled \u201d and, hence, whether they were waived under general condition No. 25 of the subcontract. <em>(Mokar Props.

Every issue presented is determinable, as a matter of law, so that no trial of issues of fact is required. <em>(Single </em>v. <em>Whitmore, </em>307 N. Y. 575; <em>Gans </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>214 N. Y. 326; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Bissell, </em>254 App. Div. 891.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b629-5\">Froessel, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ArS\">In this action by plaintiff for breaches of warranty and of a subcontract, defendant contractor moved to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint on the ground of release (Rules Civ. Prac., rule 107). The Appellate Division reversed Special Term\u2019s denial of the motion. The question presented on this appeal is whether on the record before us <em>11 </em>facts tending to obviate \u201d the \u201c objection \u201d have been shown <em>(id., </em>rule 108) <em>(Town of North Hempstead </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>235 App. Div. 708, affd. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>259 N. Y. 633; <em>Erbe </em>v. <em>Lincoln Rochester Trust Co., </em>2 A D 2d 247, 249, affd. 3 N Y 2d 842; <em>Zimmer </em>v. <em>Whiting-Buick, </em>274 App. Div. 967).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Defendant\u2019s claim of release is predicated in part upon a document captioned <em>\u201c </em>Release of Liens \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> executed by plaintiff, but more particularly upon general condition No. 25 of the subcontract providing in relevant part that the \u2018 \u2018 making and acceptance of the final payment shall constitute a waiver * * * of all claims by the Subcontractor, except those previously made and still unsettled \u2019 \u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">In our opinion, the \u201c Release of Liens \u201d document served to release liens and claims of liens of plaintiff subcontractor and nothing more. The reference elsewhere in the document to <em>\u201c </em>claims \u201d, upon which defendant relies, means claims by laborers, contractors and materialmen of plaintiff subcontractor with which it is chargeable, and not the claims of plaintiff subcontractor itself against defendant contractor. The document read as a whole and construed in the light of general condition No. 30<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the subcontract, pursuant to which it was drawn, tendered and executed, clearly compels this conclusion (see <em>Rentways, Inc., </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill Milk &amp; Cream Co., </em>308 N. Y. 342, 347; <em>Empire Props. Corp. </em>v. <em>Manufacturers Trust Co., </em>288 N. Y. 242, 248; <em>Matter of Marchant </em>v. <em>Mead-Morrison Mfg. Co., </em>252 N. Y. 284, 299; <em>Matter of Delaware County Elec. Co-op. </em>v. <em>City of New Fork, </em>304 N. Y. 196, 201).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>We note, moreover, that were we to sustain defendant\u2019s interpretation of this document the express provision in condition No. 25 preserving \u201c previously made \u201d and \u201c unsettled \u201d claims would be rendered entirely meaningless, and this we may not do. It is a cardinal rule of construction that a court should not \u201cadopt an interpretation\u201d which will operate to leave a \u201c provision of a contract * * * without force and effect \u201d <em>(Muzak Corp. </em>v. <em>Hotel Taft Corp., </em>1 N Y 2d 42, 46; <em>Fleischman </em>v. <em>Furgueson, </em>223 N. Y. 235, 239).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Turning then to condition No. 25, we think a question of fact is presented as to whether the claims at bar were \u201c previously made\u201d and \u201cunsettled\u201d at the time of final payment. The relevant portion of plaintiff\u2019s affidavit (by its president, Powers) in opposition to the motion avers in substance that, while the work under the subcontract was being performed\u2014prior, of course, to final payment\u2014and the claims which are the subject of this action arose, such as delay by defendant, for example, \u201c conferences were immediately had with the defendant\u2019s officers \u201d and plaintiff\u2019s \u201c <em>claims </em>\u201d were made known (emphasis supplied). Specific reference to conferences in September and October of 1957 and the specific complaints respecting said claims made on those occasions are given in the affidavit as examples. Plaintiff maintained in the affidavit that it was advised at those times by defendant to continue with the work and that adjustments would be made upon completion of the contract, but they never were. Final payment was made on January 28, 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Defendant\u2019s vice-president, in his reply affidavit below, after noting plaintiff\u2019s claims as just outlined, averred: \u201c There <em>were no unsettled </em>contractual claims made by plaintiff at the time of final payment under said subcontract\u201d (emphasis supplied); he had previously made the same assertion in his moving affidavit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, defendant now urges the absence of a factual dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">In this connection great stress is placed upon a letter written by plaintiff\u2019s then vice-president, one Stille (now deceased), to defendant, dated December 13,1957. It marked the initiation of a series of correspondence culminating in a letter by defendant dated November 3, 1958 to the owner, General Aniline and Film Corp., asking <em>it </em>to make good plaintiff\u2019s loss for reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>of equity and fairness, which the owner eventually refused to do. Admittedly, the 1957 letter on its face is solicitous and more indicative of \u201c a plea for relief from the contract \u201d than <em>\u201c </em>an assertion of claims under the contract \u2019 \u2019, as the Appellate Division put it. However, plaintiff maintained in its affidavit below that the tone and contents of the letter were suggested by defendant, and that plaintiff complied with defendant\u2019s request in that regard in order to help it in its efforts to have plaintiff\u2019s claims against it paid by the owner. A separate factual dispute is thus presented, in our opinion, as to the import of the letter itself as well as the subsequent correspondence. It is not resolved by the affidavits so as to justify summary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Accordingly, the judgment appealed from should be reversed; the motion under subdivision 6 of rule 107 denied, and defendant permitted to plead its defense in its answer; said answer to be served within 10 days after service of a copy of the order to be entered hereon, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Van Vooehis, Btjbice and Fosteb concur with Judge Fboessel ; Judges Dye and Fuld dissent and vote to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Judgment reversed, with costs, and matter remitted to Special Term for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-8\">.
