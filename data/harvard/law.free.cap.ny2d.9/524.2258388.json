The court at Special Term granted the application and annulled the regulation. The Appellate Division unanimously reversed and dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">A prominent feature of modern installment buying has been the growth of credit life insurance to pay off any balance remaining on a retail installment contract upon a buyer\u2019s death or disablement before the end of the contract term. Prior to 1958, the premium rates and policy forms for such credit life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>insurance were not subject to th\u00e9 approval of the Superintendent of Insurance as were those for accident or health insurance pursuant to section 154, subdivision 1, of the Insurance Law. As a result, premium rates for credit life insurance-\u2014which, under section 302, subdivision 6, of the Personal Property Law, may be charged against the buyer \u2014 were often excessive and there was a great variance in rates \u2018 \u2018 without apparent reason \u2019 \u2019 (Report of Joint Legislative Committee on Commerce and Economic Development, N. Y. Legis. Doc., 1958, No. 84, pp. 65-66, 75).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">It was to correct these abuses in the credit life insurance field that the Legislature in 1958 enacted the amendments to sections 154 and 204 of the Insurance Law here involved. As indicated above, subdivision 1 of' section 154 had required the filing of accident \"or health insurance policy forms and rates with the Superintendent and their approval by him. By the addition of subdivision 7 to that section, the same requirements were prescribed, in more forceful terms, for credit life insurance. Subdivision 7 recites that, \u201c Without limiting his other powers and duties under this section, the superintendent <em>shall not approve </em>any such forms or premium rates if such premium rates are unreasonable in relation to the benefits provided \u201d and authorizes the Superintendent \u201cfrom time to time\u201d to \u201c prescribe, in writing, official regulations \u201d dealing with credit insurance. Subdivision 1 (par. [c]) of section 204, which deals with group life insurance premium rates, was similarly amended and contains almost identical provisions for the Superintendent\u2019s approval of rates and his right to make occasional official regulations. The provisions with respect to written regulations are in accord with the general powers granted the Superintendent in section 21 of the Insurance Law \u2018 \u2018 to prescribe, in writing, official regulations, not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter \u201d, including regulations \u201ceffectuating any power, given to him\u201d thereunder (subd. [b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Pursuant to these statutory amendments, and after notice and an industry-wide hearing held on August 5,1958, the Superintendent promulgated Regulation 27A. In addition to general rules for filing and approval, subdivision A of section 7 of the regulation set forth premium rates, later referred to as \u201c standards \u201d for premium rates, based on studies by the Insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>anee Department, which, the section declares, \u201cwill he considered adequate and not unreasonable in relation to the benefits provided \u201d. It was chiefly because of these \u201c standards \u201d that the petitioners, in September, 1958, brought the present proceeding to annul the regulation, pointing out that the Superintendent had never set forth any such rates for regular life and accident or health insurance rates under subdivision 1 of section 154. They contended that the regulation thereby authorized the Superintendent to fix rates, a power never granted him under the statutes, and that the rates which he prescribed would force them to discriminate among policyholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">In December, 1958, more than three months after the hearing and probably as a result of the petitioners\u2019 proceeding, the Superintendent amended Regulation 27A by adding a new subdivision C to its section 7 to permit insurers to establish independently factors or conditions to justify higher rates than those suggested by the Superintendent in subdivision A of section 7. Thus, subdivision C provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">\u201c Nothing herein, however, shall preclude an insurer from filing for the approval of the Superintendent of Insurance rates or identifiable charges which exceed the standards in A and B, above, provided such insurer shall demonstrate to the Superintendent of Insurance that the filing conforms to the standards prescribed in subsection 7 of Section 154 of the Insurance Law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The new subdivision C still did not satisfy the petitioners. They filed a supplemental petition to annul Regulation 27A upon the same grounds as those previously advanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Before treating the issues raised by the petitioners, we note the Superintendent\u2019s argument that they are not entitled to maintain the present proceeding because, until they apply for approval of their rates, they are not aggrieved by the regulation. It is our view, however, that section 34 of the Insurance Law provides that any \u201c regulation \u201d as well as any order or decision of the Superintendent is subject to article 78 review. The statute does not require that only action taken in pursuance of a regulation may be reviewed, and we deem it clear that insurers obliged to comply with the regulation are entitled to question its validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">Section 154 (subd. 7) and section 204 (subd. 1, par. [c]) of the Insurance Law authorize the Superintendent to disap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>prove premium rates which are \u201cunreasonable in relation to the benefits provided\u201d and direct him to prescribe regulations for determining procedures and terms applicable to credit insurance policies. Whether or not this permits him to make or fix rates, it is well within his statutory powers to suggest reasonable ones (Beg. 27A, \u00a7 7, subd. A) as a sort of guide or \u201cbench mark \u201d for insurers, while affording them freedom to show that higher rates would not be unreasonable (\u00a7 7, subd. C). Certainly, there is no difference between the direction in section 154, subdivision 7, that the Superintendent \u2018 \u2018 shall not approve \u2019 \u2019 rates which are unreasonable in relation to benefits and the converse provision in section 7, subdivision C, that an insurer may obtain the Superintendent\u2019s \u201c approval\u201d upon demonstrating that its suggested rates, though not adhering to the \u201c standards \u201d proposed by the Insurance Department, do \u201c conform to the standards prescribed \u201d in section 154, subdivision 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The statutory command contained in the amendments to sections 154 and 204 that the Superintendent <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>shall not approve \u2019 \u2019 \u2018 \u2018 unreasonable \u2019 \u2019 credit insurance rates is an additional and more emphatic delegation of power than that found in section 154, subdivision 1, namely, that the Superintendent \u201c may disapprove \u201d rates filed by insurers. As Presiding Justice Bergax, writing for the Appellate Division, observed, \u2018 \u2018 the power to make wholly inoperative a premium rate proposed by an insurer is manifest; and while this in form may be a vetoing or negativing form of public power, it is clear that no effective or lawfully chargeable premium rate can come into existence without the affirmative act of the Superintendent.\u201d Indeed, the opinion continued, \u201c Whether the Superintendent makes rates, or allows rates which he approves to come into force, seems something of an exercise in semantics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">Instances in which this court has upheld special rules made pursuant to broad statutory powers granted administrative officials are numerous. (See, e.g., <em>Matter of Ross </em>v. <em>Macduff, </em>309 N. Y. 56; <em>Matter of Humphrey </em>v. <em>State Ins. Fund, </em>298 N. Y. 327, 331; <em>Matter of Marburg </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>286 N. Y. 202; see, also, <em>Gair </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>6 N Y 2d 97.) In the <em>Ross </em>case (309 N. Y. 56, <em>supra), </em>the court upheld and applied a \u201c point system \u201d adopted by the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to determine whether an operator was a \u201cpersistent violator\u201d within the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>the statute for purposes of license suspension or revocation. In <em>Ross </em>the point system was, in a sense, a statement in advance by an administrative agency of standards applied by it in passing upon the statutory standard for determining a \u20181 persistent violator \u2019 \u2019. Likewise, in the present case, the Superintendent\u2019s declaration of standards is simply a declaration in advance that certain rates are so plainly reasonable 1 \u00a3 in relation to the benefits provided\u201d (\u00a7 154, subd. 7) as to require no further detailed consideration by the Superintendent in the ordinary rate application.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">In point of fact, a standard announced in advance is often in aid of sound administration and the fair exercise of public power. In the case before us, it will afford an insurer a shortcut method of securing approval for premium rates. . (Cf., e.g., <em>Gair </em>v. Peck, 6 N Y 2d 97, <em>supra; Securities Comm. </em>v. <em>Chenery Corp., </em>318 U. S. 80, 92; 332 U. S. 194.) In the <em>Gair </em>case, for instance, this court upheld the rule promulgated by the Appellate Division fixing a sliding scale of attorneys\u2019 contingent fees deemed fair and reasonable and declaring that fees in excess of the scale would constitute \u00a3\u00a3 the exaction of unreasonable and unconscionable compensation \u201d (6 N Y 2d, at p. 101). This did not, though, preclude the grant of larger compensation in the event of <em>11 </em>extraordinary circumstances \u2019 \u2019 rendering the scale allowances inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The petitioners contend, however, that Regulation 27A, and in particular its subdivision C of section 7, shifts the burden of proof with respect to. reasonableness of rates from the Superintendent to the insurer. More specifically, they argue that, although it is up to the Superintendent, when he disapproves rates filed by the insurer, to show that they are unreasonable \u00a3\u00a3 in relation to the benefits provided \u201d (\u00a7 154, subd. 7), it is incumbent upon the insurer, by reason of subdivision 0, to <em>\u20181 </em>demonstrate \u2019 \u2019 that rates higher than those contained in the standards specified in subdivision A \u2018\u00a3 conform \u2019 \u2019 to the criterion laid down in section 154, subdivision 7. The point does not impress us. The fact is that, with or without the regulation, the insurer must establish by ordinary principles of administrative law that its filing should be approved, in other words, that such filing meets the statutory standards. Whether the Superintendent fails to \u00a3\u00a3 approve \u201d premium rates filed by an insurer or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>finds that the insurer has failed to \u20181 demonstrate \u2019 \u2019 that its proposed rates, higher than the suggested standards, are reasonable, the insurer must, in either ease, seek judicial review in order to annul the Superintendent\u2019s determination. In either event, the insurer has the burden, under familiar rules governing-administrative review, of demonstrating that the Superintendent did not base his determination on adequate proof. (See, e.g., <em>Matter of New York Compensation Ins. Rating Bd. </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Ins. of State of N. Y., </em>8 A D 2d 455, 459, affd. 8 N Y 2d 803; <em>Matter of Ebenstein </em>v. <em>Pink, </em>275 N. Y. 613.)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">In short, whether an insurer files its rates for approval or seeks to prove that the statutory conditions have been met, the requirement for obtaining such approval is the same. The premium rates must be not \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>unreasonable in relation to the benefits provided\u201d. Subdivision 0 of section 7 is only a restatement of the insurer\u2019s statutory responsibility and does not alter its obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The petitioners make a number of arguments addressed to the merits of subdivision A of section 7, contending that it is discriminatory, that it eliminates competition and that it contains arbitrary and unreasonable restrictions on coverage. Since, however, the insurer has the choice of proceeding under subdivision C, as to which none of these contentions is applicable, nothing- is to be gained by a detailed consideration of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Nor is there any substance to the petitioners\u2019 further argument that section 154 (subd. 7) and section 204 (subd. 1, par. [c]), as construed by the Appellate Division, contain no standards to guide the Superintendent in promulgating Regulation 27A and, consequently, effect an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power (N. Y. Const., art. Ill, \u00a7 1). The standards laid down in these statutes, that the premium rates approved, be not \u201c unreasonable-in relation to the benefits provided \u201d, are fully as specific and clear as other statutory standards which this court has upheld. (See, e.g., <em>Matter of Ross </em>v. <em>Macduff, </em>309 N. Y. 56, <em>supra </em>[\u201c habitual or persistent violation \u201d of the Vehicle and Traffic Law]; see, also, <em>Matter of Union Ins. Agency </em>v. <em>Hols, </em>1 A D 2d 945, motion for leave to appeal den. 1 N Y 2d 644 [\u201c untrustworthiness \u201d of an insurance agent]; <em>Matter of Bell </em>v. <em>Board of Regents, </em>295 N. Y. 101 [\u2018 \u2018 unprofessional conduct \u201d].) In view of the need for practicality and flexibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>in laying down standards in areas involving administrative detail and complexity (see, e.g., <em>Matter of City of Utica </em>v. <em>Water Pollution Control Bd., </em>5 N Y 2d 164, 169), it may not \"be said that the present standards are either so vague or otherwise inadequate as to amount to an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">The order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Chief Judge Desmond and Judges Dye, Froessel, Van Voorhis, Burke and Foster concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
