The information was insufficient as a matter of law to confer any jurisdiction on the Court of Special Sessions. <em>(Shappee </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>142 App. Div. 155; <em>People ex rel.

II. Whatever authority is conferred by section 74-b of the Vehicle and Traffic Law to the persons therein enumerated arises only in cases where a uniform traffic ticket has been served and, even then, is narrowly limited.

The information was properly sworn to before the deputy sergeant. II. Courts will reject the literal meaning of words to conserve the spirit and intent of an act over the mere letter. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>People, </em>47 N. Y. 330.) III. Any defect as to the verification of the information had been cured before objection was raised by defendant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nitzberg, </em>289 N. Y. 523; <em>Albrecht </em>v. <em>United States, </em>273 U.

The information was sworn to before a sergeant of the Sheriff\u2019s office who was not a notary public. He had no authority to administer the oath unless authorized by section 74-b (now \u00a7 208) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law. That section, however, authorizes him to take oaths only where \u201c a traffic summons has been served \u2019 \u2019. The People\u2019s witness, the arresting officer, flatly testified that no traffic summons had been served. Immediately after the establishment of this fact, defendant moved for a dismissal of the information. The motion should have been granted since the court had no jurisdiction <em>(People </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>3 N Y 2d 148, 151). We do not feel that we may \u201c reject the literal meaning\u201d of section 74-b as respondent suggests.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">The judgment of the County Court should be reversed, the judgment of conviction vacated, and the information dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Judges Fuld, Froessel, Yaw Yoorhis, Burke and Foster concur in <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion; Chief Judge Desmond and Judge Dye dissent and vote to affirm upon the ground that this was, at worst, an irregularity which could not affect jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Judgment reversed and the information dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
