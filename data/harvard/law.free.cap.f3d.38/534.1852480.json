At sentencing, the district court sentenced the appellee to a term of imprisonment for the section 2119 violation, but refused to sentence him for the section 924(c) offense; to do so, the court concluded, would constitute double jeopardy. The Government now appeals that decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">The Fifth Circuit, in a case decided earlier this year, <em>United States v. Singleton, </em>16 F.3d 1419 (1994), addressed the questions the Government\u2019s appeal presents: first, whether proof of a violation of section 2119 always establishes a violation of section 924(c), so that the two statutes fail the \u201csame elements\u201d test of <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932); and, second, whether Congress intended \u201cto impose cumulative punishments for violations of \u00a7 924(c) and all crimes of violence, including \u2018carjacking,\u2019 to satisfy the requirements of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\u201d <em>Singleton, </em>16 F.3d at 1429. The Fifth Circuit answered both questions in the affirmative: the statutes fail the same elements test, but Congress intended cumulative punishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-16\">We are persuaded by the <em>Singleton </em>court\u2019s analysis and the conclusions it reached and, accordingly, adopt them in full. The judgment of the district court with respect to the section 924(e) offense is therefore vacated and the case is remanded for sentencing on that count only. The district court\u2019s judgment is otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-17\">AFFIRMED, in part; VACATED and REMANDED, in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-12\">. The appellee cross appeals, contending that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of either offense. His appeal is meritless, as the evidence of guilt was overwhelming. We, therefore, affirm his convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
