JONES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b892-17\">Richard Rozzell (Rozzell) filed suit in state court alleging that Electronic Data Systems (EDS) terminated him in retaliation for pursuing rights under Article 8307c of the Texas Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. EDS removed the case to federal court alleging the action was a claim arising under section 510 of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and therefore satisfied federal question jurisdiction. Plaintiffs motion to remand the case to district court was denied and defendant won a bench trial held on the merits. Because we conclude that removal was improper, we must vacate the judgment and remand the case to state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-18\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b892-19\">In the bench trial, the district court judge made extensive findings of fact, only a few of which are relevant to this appeal. Rozzell was hired by EDS<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in November of 1985. Rozzell sustained an injury unrelated to work on March 11, 1990. As a result of the accident, Rozzell was unable to work until July 27, 1990. Rozzell returned to work in a limited capacity on July 30, 1990. On that date, Rozzell allegedly sustained an on the job injury preventing him from continuing further work. Shortly after the alleged injury, Rozzell filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim. Rozzell alleges that he was terminated as a result of filing such claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-20\">Rozzell filed a lawsuit alleging a single cause of action under section 8307c of the Texas Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> EDS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>removed the action to federal court on the grounds that the complaint contained a claim implicating ERISA. Specifically, EDS asserted that because Paragraph Eight of the complaint alleged that plaintiff was wrongfully terminated \u201cto willfully deprive plaintiff of the compensation and benefits of [his] job\u201d, plaintiff had implicated the provisions of ERISA. The district judge denied Rozzell\u2019s motion to remand based upon his findings that because determination of plaintiffs damages necessitated reference to the ERISA plan, plaintiffs claim was necessarily federal in character and that plaintiffs allegation states a claim under section 510 of ERISA. A claim that relates to an ERISA plan, as the court recognized, is removable from state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq. (1994 ed.), federally regulates employee benefit plans. ERISA is \u201ca comprehensive statute designed to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans.\u201d <em>Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, </em>463 U.S. 85, 90, 103 S.Ct. 2890, 2896, 77 L.Ed.2d 490 (1983), (citing <em>Nachman Corp. v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., </em>446 U.S. 359, 361-62, 100 S.Ct. 1723, 1726, 64 L.Ed.2d 354 (1980); <em>Alessi v. Rayhestos-Manhattan, Inc., </em>451 U.S. 504, 510, 101 S.Ct. 1895, 1899-1900, 68 L.Ed.2d 402 (1981)). Section 514(a) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a), expressly \u201csupersedes any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan\u201d covered by ERISA. This preemption clause has been interpreted to be \u201cdeliberately expansive ... to \u2018establish pension plan regulation as exclusively a federal concern.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, </em>498 U.S. 133, 138, 111 S.Ct. 478, 482, 112 L.Ed.2d 474 (1990) (citing <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, </em>481 U.S. 41, 46, 107 S.Ct. 1549, 1552, 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987) (quoting <em>Alessi, </em>451 U.S. at 523, 101 S.Ct. at 1906)).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">The central preemption determination is whether the state law<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> relied upon in the well-pleaded complaint \u201crelates to\u201d an employee benefit plan. <em>Ingersoll-Rand, </em>498 U.S. at 138, 111 S.Ct. at 482; <em>Cefalu v. B.F. Goodrich Co., </em>871 F.2d 1290, 1292 (5th Cir.1989). A state law \u201crelates to\u201d an employee benefit plan \u201cif it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\u201d <em>Shaw, </em>463 U.S. at 96-97, 103 S.Ct. at 2899-2900. Therefore, a state law may \u201crelate to\u201d an employee benefit plan even if the law is not designed to affect the plan or does so even in an indirect manner. <em>Pilot Life, </em>481 U.S. at 47,107 S.Ct. at 1552-53. Nevertheless, the reach of ERISA preemption is not limitless. <em>See, e.g., Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency &amp; Serv., Inc., </em>486 U.S. 825, 841, 108 S.Ct. 2182, 2191-92, 100 L.Ed.2d 836 (1988) (holding that ERISA did not preempt a State\u2019s general garnishment statute, even when applied to collect judgments against plan participants); <em>Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, </em>482 U.S. 1, 6, 107 S.Ct. 2211, 2214-15, 96 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987) (finding no ERISA preemption even though state law required payment of severance benefits because law did not require the establishment or maintenance of an ongoing plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">EDS\u2019s contention that Rozzell\u2019s claim is preempted by ERISA focusses on the use (or misuse) of one word in Rozzell\u2019s complaint. Although Rozzell\u2019s complaint alleges only one cause of action, retaliatory discharge in violation of section 8307c, he also includes a paragraph seeking punitive damages. In this paragraph, Rozzell alleges that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>EDS fired him in an attempt \u201cto willfully deprive [Rozzell] of the compensation and <em>benefits </em>of [his] job.... \u201d (emphasis added). EDS contends that this allegation brings the otherwise state law canse of action within the purview of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">EDS argued, and the district court agreed, that because computation of the plaintiff\u2019s damages necessitated reference to the ERISA plan, the claim was pre-empted. This erroneous argument finds its genesis in dicta in <em>Cefalu v. B.F. Goodrich Co., </em>871 F.2d 1290, 1294 (5th Cir.1989). In <em>Cefalu, </em>another ERISA preemption case, the plaintiff was employed by the defendant before purchasing a franchise from the defendant. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant breached an oral contract to continue his pension benefits at the same level when he became an independent franchisor as when he was an employee. <em>Cefalu </em>held that such a claim was preempted by ERISA and properly removable. In explaining that the lawsuit possessed the requisite relation to an employee benefit plan to justify preemption, the court noted that \u201c[t]o compute [plaintiffs] damages, the court must refer to the pension plan under which appellant was covered when, he worked for [defendant].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1294. This statement does not, and can not, mean that any lawsuit in which reference to a benefit plan is necessary to compute plaintiffs damages is preempted by ERISA and is removable to federal court. <em>See Burks, </em>8 F.3d at 306 (holding that \u201c[a] claim that unlawful termination resulted in loss of benefits is not preempted by ERISA\u201d). Therefore, removal on these grounds was improper.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">EDS also argued, and the district court agreed, that plaintiffs allegation that he was terminated in an attempt to deprive him of his benefits sufficiently implicated ERISA to warrant preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">Rozzell\u2019s complaint, however, alleges only one cause of action, that he was fired by EDS for filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim. Under the well-pleaded complaint rule, the court will look past the words in the complaint to the substance of the claim alleged. <em>See generally Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Constr. Laborers Vacation Trust for S. Cal., </em>463 U.S. 1, 103 S.Ct. 2841, 77 L.Ed.2d 420 (1983). Viewing Rozzell\u2019s complaint in this manner, it remains patently clear that the substance of his claim is limited to the state law retaliatory discharge cause of action. He included the word \u201cbenefits\u201d in his accusation of the requisite malice for punitive damages, not as a separate claim for relief. Rather, the allegation of lost \u201cbenefits\u201d related back to the retaliatory discharge in order to punctuate that wrongful conduct. Therefore, the substance of Rozzell\u2019s complaint alleges only one cause of action that is governed exclusively by state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">EDS urges this court to look to the recent case of <em>Burks v. Amerada Hess Corp., </em>8 F.3d 301 (5th Cir.1993) for guidance. <em>Burks </em>does not favor EDS. In <em>Burks, </em>the plaintiff was fired from his job shortly after filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim. Burks alleged various state law causes of action. Defendant removed the ease to federal court on the grounds of federal preemption. This court reversed the district 'court\u2019s remand of the case to state court, holding that plaintiffs complaint stated an ERISA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">In regard to benefits, Burks alleged that defendant\u2019s wrongful denial of benefits constituted an intentional infliction of emotional distress. We explained, \u201cThis is not a case in which the loss of benefits is merely an element in damages related to a claim for wrongful discharge. Burks\u2019s complaint expressly says that \u2014 independently of the wrongful discharge \u2014 his denial of benefits is illegal under state law.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 305. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>contrast, Rozzell makes no independent claim that denial of his benefits was illegal under state law. Rather, the loss of benefits is \u201cmerely an element in damages related to a claim for wrongful discharge.\u201d <em>Id. See also Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, </em>482 U.S. 1, 6, 107 S.Ct. 2211, 2214-15, 96 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987) (explaining that state law must relate to the plan, not merely the benefits for preemption to be appropriate). <em>Burks, </em>8 F.3d at 306. In sum, Rozzell\u2019s \u201cwell-pleaded complaint\u201d does not state a cause of action which \u201crelates to\u201d an employee benefit plan; removal on such basis was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">Based on this discussion, we need not reach Rozzell\u2019s alternate contention that because his claim under \u00a7 8307c \u201carises under\u201d state workers compensation law, it is not removable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1445(c) even if it were preempted by ERISA <em>See Jones v. Roadway Express, Inc., </em>931 F.2d 1086, 1091-92 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-1\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is vacated and remanded with instructions to remand this case back to state court and to undertake further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-2\">VACATED and REMANDED with INSTRUCTION TO REMAND TO STATE COURT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b892-10\">.
