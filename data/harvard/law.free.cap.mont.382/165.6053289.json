Father appeals the District Court\u2019s decision. We affirm, and address the following restated issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court err in terminating Father\u2019s parental rights ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\u00b63 The subject family consists of Father, the birth mother (Mother), and three minor children, ages seven, two and one, respectively, at the time of removal. Concerns were initially raised regarding this family in early 2013, when the Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS or Department) received anonymous reports about the parents using methamphetamines \u201cas often as they can get their hands on it,\u201d and reports of physical violence in front of the children. Stephanie Moran (Moran), a social worker, met with the oldest child, K.A., at school on March 7, 2013. K.A. appeared to be clean and adequately dressed, and spoke highly of his parents, but mentioned that the family had moved a lot and that his father had lost his job. Moran reviewed K.A.\u2019s school attendance record, and found that he had a significant number of absences and tardies. K.A. explained to Moran that his mother was not waking up in time to get K.A. off to school.</p>\n<p id=\"AZDX\">\u00b64 Moran again met with K.A. at school on March 26,2013, and K.A. told the case worker that he had not eaten breakfast that day because there was very little food in the home, and he wasn\u2019t sure he was going to eat dinner that night. K.A. also described physical violence between his parents, but denied that Father was physically violent towards him. During this interview, Moran noted with some concern that K.A.\u2019s clothes were dirty and that his shoes had no soles on them and appeared to be falling apart.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\u00b65 On the same day, Moran made contact with Mother. The family was living in a motel room at this point and Moran observed only ajar of peanut butter and a can of chili on top of the refrigerator, and only bottled water in the refrigerator. Mother told the case worker that the family was out of money and out of public assistance funds until after the first of the month. Later that day, Moran returned to the motel room to meet with both Mother and Father, and questioned both parents about reports of their drug use. Both parents admitted to using methamphetamine within the past two months, and Father admitted to current use of cannabis and alcohol. When Moran asked, both parents agreed to submit to a urinalysis (UA) test that afternoon. When neither parent showed up for the scheduled UA, Moran returned to the motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">\u00b66 No one answered the door when Moran knocked, although she knew the family was at home because she had seen K.A. arrive there from school, and she could hear the television and a baby crying from within the room. Fearing for the children\u2019s well-being, and due to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>lack of cooperation by the parents, Moran contacted law enforcement, who eventually forced open the door to the motel room. Once inside, Moran informed the parents that she was removing the children. Moran testified that Father became very upset, \u201cbouncing all over\u201d the motel room, yelling and screaming with his hands raised. Moran believed that Father\u2019s behaviors were consistent with being under the influence of methamphetamine. All three children sat on the bed next to their mother, crying. Backup law enforcement officers were called to the scene; at one point the officers pulled out their Tasers to prevent a physical altercation with Father when he stood on the bed. Moran and law enforcement removed the children from the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b67 The next day, Father had been arrested on a charge of disorderly conduct arising out of an incident separate from removal of the children, and was unavailable for a UA. Mother submitted to a UA that day and tested positive for cannabis, methamphetamine, and Ecstasy. On April 2,2013, DPHHS filed a petition seeking emergency protective authority, adjudication of the children as youth in need of care, and temporary legal custody. Attached to the petition was Moran\u2019s affidavit, which averred that Father and Mother did not have the resources to meet the basic needs of their children, that both parents were violent and aggressive, and that both parents were currently unable or unwilling to perform parental duties and responsibilities. The District Court promptly granted emergency protective custody, and an adjudicatory hearing was held on April 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u00b68 At the hearing, Moran provided testimony concerning the above facts to the District Court. She added that Mother had failed to appear for UAs on two separate occasions since the children were removed, but that Mother and Father had provided a UA on April 6, 2013, and both tests were negative for illegal substances. Father testified that he and Mother had never used drugs in front of the children, that he had never physically abused Mother or the children, and that at the time the children were removed, there had been food in the freezer in the motel room. However, the District Court found that both parents had failed to take drug tests when requested, failed to provide for the basic needs of the children, abused the children by using illegal drugs, specifically methamphetamine, neglected to have K.A. attend school regularly, and that returning the children to the home would place them in unreasonable risk of harm. The court adjudicated all children as youths in need of care, granted temporary legal custody to DPHHS, and ordered that treatment plans be developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\u00b69 On June 4, 2013, the District Court signed treatment plans for both Mother and Father, each of which stated a primary goal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>reunifying the children with their parents. At the time the plans were signed, Mother had engaged in initial services, but Father had not. The plan required Father to obtain a chemical dependency evaluation and follow all recommendations of that evaluation, and listed as a specific goal to maintain sobriety for \u201ca period of six months.\u201d In addition, the Treatment Plan required Father to obtain individual counseling to address mental health issues, to complete parenting and anger management classes, and to stay in regular contact with Moran.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b610 In early August 2013, DPHHS placed the children with Mother, who was then living with her parents, for a trial home visit. Since that date, the children have remained with Mother. In October 2013, DPHHS filed a petition to extend temporary legal custody of the children for another six months in order to allow the parents more time to complete their treatment plans. At that point, Father had completed in-patient treatment at Montana Chemical Dependency Center, but had not yet begun out-patient treatment, mental health counseling, or parenting and anger management classes. Upon a stipulation of all the parties, the District Court granted an order extending temporary legal custody for another six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u00b611 In April 2014, DPHHS again requested an extension of temporary legal custody, given developments in the case, and a hearing was held in May 2014. Moran testified that, although Father had completed his chemical dependency evaluation, was participating in classes again (after having stopped for a period of time), and had completed anger management and parenting classes, he had returned to using alcohol. He was arrested for fighting at a bar and creating a disturbance in April 2014, and had brought \u201cturmoil within the home.\u201d Father \u201cwent back to the home knowing that he had just been arrested,\u201d causing the District Court to express concerns about his drug and alcohol use and for the family\u2019s safety. Because Father and Mother were living together at this point with the children, Moran expressed concern about turmoil in the home and Mother\u2019s ability to display her protective capacity, concluding that DPHHS wanted additional time to monitor the family situation. Moran reported that Mother had made progress in her Treatment Plan, but that DPHHS still had some lingering concerns, specifically, that while Mother displayed that she was able to recognize threats to her and her children, a question remained about whether Mother was able to actually assert her protective role. The District Court granted DPHHS\u2019 petition, noting the family had made progress, but that DPHHS still had reason to be involved, especially in light of Father\u2019s recent setbacks in treatment. The results of Father\u2019s recent UA had not yet been returned, and Moran testified that if the UA was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>positive, the Department believed Father should live separately from the family. The District Court stated that Father had made a serious mistake in continuing to consume alcohol but that, before the Department could remove the children or either parent from the home, the court would conduct an emergency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u00b612 DPHHS received the results of Father\u2019s drug test on June 19, 2014, which indicated that he had been using alcohol, methamphetamine, and amphetamines. Days later, DPHHS filed an expedited motion requesting that the District Court order Father to move from the family residence. The District Court held a hearing on July 2 and Father testified that he had been taking cold medication at the time of the drug test, and had not used methamphetamine, to which the District Court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">I don\u2019t believe you. Point blank. I don\u2019t believe that you didn\u2019t use methamphetamines, I think you got up here and lied. I am just gonna say it point blank. I think that\u2019s what you did. The Court would have had a much easier time with being less restrictive if you had owned your actions, took responsibility and tried to do something to prevent it from happening again and that\u2019s not what I heard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Despite testimony that Father had already moved out of the house, the District Court ordered that Father live separately from the family until further order of the court, and that the visits between him and the children be supervised. The District Court also ordered that Mother begin work on a supplemental treatment plan, focusing on obtaining financial independence from Father, before the next hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\u00b613 A week later, on July 9, 2014, Father showed up at the family residence intoxicated. When Mother asked him to leave, he refused. Mother called police to remove Father from the premises, reporting that, while Father was not physically violent, she wanted him removed. Mother did not advise police that Father was there in violation of a court order. Father left the premises before police were able to make contact with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">\u00b614 Mother filed an objection to the supplemental treatment plan and a motion to dismiss the proceeding on August 18,2014. At a hearing in September 2014, the drug testing agency testified that it was having problems obtaining drug tests because Father was evading the testing. Testimony was also taken that Father had been unsuccessfully discharged from his out-patient chemical dependency treatment program, had failed to stay in contact with DPHHS, had failed to notify DPHHS of his address changes, and had stopped participating in his treatment plan at all. The District Court continued the restriction on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Father living in the family residence, and also took Mother\u2019s motion to dismiss under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b615 DPHHS filed its own motion to dismiss in November 2014. DPHHS\u2019 motion sought to dismiss the case as to both Mother and Father, but to place continuing restrictions on Father, specifically, prohibiting Father from unsupervised contact with his children until he had completed UA testing, mental health treatment, and chemical dependency treatment. DPHHS\u2019 motion stated that only Mother had met the \u201cminimum standards for appropriate parenting at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"APz\">\u00b616 Mother and Father responded by filing objections to any continuing restrictions upon Father and a joint motion to dismiss the proceeding as against both of them, relying on Mother\u2019s progress under her treatment plan. Mother and Father argued that \u201cmother has demonstrated she can adequately protect the children,\u201d \u201cthe children are safe,\u201d and \u201cit is therefore illogical to argue that additional restrictions are needed to protect the children.\u201d In its reply, DPHHS requested that, alternatively, if the District Court did not grant its motion to dismiss against Mother and impose restrictions upon Father, that the District Court grant DPHHS leave to pursue termination of Father\u2019s parental rights. Stating that it lacked authority to impose continuing restrictions upon the parties after dismissal, the District Court granted leave for DPHHS to petition the court for termination of Father\u2019s parental rights, which it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u00b617 The District Court conducted a hearing on the petition for termination of Father\u2019s parental rights in January 2015. Father was represented by counsel but did not attend the hearing. Moran testified to the Department\u2019s concerns with Father, including his unaddressed chemical dependency, including his positive testing for alcohol and methamphetamines, his lack of compliance with his court-ordered treatment plan, his complete disengagement from services, and his lack of any contact with the Department since September of 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"Azk\">\u00b618 In terminating Father\u2019s parental rights, the District Court found that Father had completed several treatment plan tasks, but that \u201cthe treatment plan has not been successful in addressing birth father\u2019s issues with chemical dependency and mental health which led to the children\u2019s removal in this matter.\u201d Also noting that Father \u201cstopped participating in Department services over seven months ago and failed to attend the hearing despite having notice,\u201d the District Court reasoned that Father\u2019s condition was \u201cunlikely to change within a reasonable time\u201d based on his unresolved chemical dependency and mental health issues, and that continuation of the parental relationship would likely result in continued abuse or neglect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>children, concluding that Father\u2019s behavior \u201cconvinces the Court that continuation of the parent-child legal relationship is not in the children\u2019s best interests.\u201d The District Court granted DPHHS\u2019 motion to dismiss with respect to Mother. Father appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b619 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights for an abuse of discretion. <em>In re E.Z.C., </em>2013 MT 123, \u00b6 19, 370 Mont. 116, 300 P.3d 1174 <em>(citing In re T.W.F., </em>2009 MT 207, \u00b6 17, 351 Mont. 233, 210 P.3d 174).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or in excess of the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice.

He argues the termination of his parental rights was not in the best interest of his children, and that the District Court erred by not dismissing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">\u00b623 Pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA, termination of the parent-child legal relationship may be ordered upon a finding that the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care, and 1) an appropriate treatment plan that has been approved by the court has not been complied with by the parent, or has not been successful; and 2) the conduct or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>condition of the parent rendering the parent unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\u00b624  Under this statute, Father first contests the adjudication of the children as youths in need of care (YINC). Section 41-3-102(34), MCA, defines a YINC as <em>\u201ca </em>youth who has been adjudicated or determined, after a hearing, to be or have been abused, neglected, or abandoned.\u201d Section 41-3-102(7)(a), MCA, further provides that \u201cchild abuse or neglect\u201d is defined as \u201c(i) actual physical or psychological harm to a child; (ii) substantial risk of physical or psychological harm to a child; or (iii) abandonment.\u201d We review a district court\u2019s conclusion of law for correctness. <em>See In re T.S., </em>\u00b6 21. The District Court found after the adjudication hearing that Mother had tested positively for methamphetamine, cannabis, and Ecstasy, both parents had failed to provide UAs upon request, both parents had admitted to using illegal drugs, the parents were failing to meet their children\u2019s basic needs, and that the parents were not ensuring that K.A. attended school on a regular basis. These findings were supported by substantial evidence and the children were properly adjudicated as YINC, as the District Court correctly noted several conditions that would have placed the children in substantial risk of physical or psychological harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u00b625 Regarding compliance with and successful completion of a treatment plan under \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f)(i), MCA, Moran testified at the termination hearing that, although Father completed in-patient chemical dependency treatment, he had been dismissed from outpatient chemical dependency treatment for lack of participation, thereafter tested positive for methamphetamines and alcohol, failed to maintain sobriety, and failed to complete his mental health tasks. There was substantial evidence to support the District Court\u2019s factual finding and conclusion of law that \u201cthe majority of his plan was not complied with\u201d and \u201chas not been successful.\u201d Indeed, Father concedes in his briefing that he did not complete his court-ordered plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\u00b626 Regarding whether Father\u2019s conduct or condition rendering him unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time, \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f)(ii), MCA, Moran testified that, \u201c[a]t this time the Department\u2019s been involved with these children for over 15 months. We have not seen behavioral changes from [Father]. So it\u2019s in the children\u2019s best interest for permanency.\u201d The Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) submitted a report to the District Court, stating, \u201cI regret that this action has to be taken with [Father]. I feel that the court has been given no choice but to terminate his rights.... [Father] is the one losing out by not complying to[] the rules and not completing his requirements.\u201d The record demonstrates that Father was engaging in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>the same kind of behaviors over a year after the treatment plan was implemented as he was when the children were originally removed from his care. At times he was blatantly resistant to the Department and with his treatment goals and, as the District Court found, deceptive about his behavior. As we have stated on multiple occasions, \u201c[W]e do not have a crystal ball to look into to make this determination, so it must, to some extent, be based on a person\u2019s past conduct.\u201d <em>In re M.A.E., </em>1999 MT 341, \u00b6 37, 297 Mont. 434, 991 P.2d 972 (citing <em>In re C.A.R., </em>214 Mont. 174, 187, 693 P.2d 1214, 1221 (1984)). The record of Father\u2019s behavior provides abundant support for the District Court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[t]he conduct or condition of birth father is unlikely to change within a reasonable time based on his unresolved mental health and chemical dependency issues.\u201d The District Court\u2019s conclusion that continuation of the parent child legal relationship will likely result in continued abuse or neglect was supported by the evidence of Father\u2019s conduct over the 15 months of the proceeding. Perhaps testimony crucial to establishing Father\u2019s potential to change his conduct within a reasonable time would have come from Father himself; however, he did not participate in the termination hearing. In terminating Father\u2019s parental rights, the District Court clearly did not abuse its discretion. \u201cA child\u2019s need for a permanent placement in a stable, loving home supercedes [sic] the right to parent a child.\u201d <em>In re Custody &amp; Parental Rights </em>of D.A., 2008 MT 247, \u00b6 21, 344 Mont. 513, 189 P.3d 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">\u00b627  Finally, Father contends that the District Court should have dismissed this case when \u201crequested to do so by the parents and by DPHHS.\u201d He argues that both Mother\u2019s motion to dismiss, and the parents\u2019 joint motion, met the statutory criteria for dismissal, as evidenced by DPHHS\u2019 own motion to dismiss. Section 41-3-424, MCA, provides, in pertinent part, that the court shall dismiss an abuse and neglect petition if all the following criteria are met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">(1) a child who has been placed in foster care is reunited with the child\u2019s parents and returned home; (2) the child remains in the home for a minimum of 6 months with no additional confirmed reports of child abuse or neglect; and (3) the department determines and informs the court that the issues that led to department intervention have been resolved and that no reason exists for further department intervention or monitoring.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Section 41-3-424, MCA. In its motion to dismiss, DPHHS expressed its continuing concerns regarding Father\u2019s issues that led to its original intervention with this family, asking either for restrictions to be placed on Father\u2019s visitation, or alternatively, that DPHHS be granted leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>to petition to terminate Father\u2019s parental rights. The District Court recognized these continuing concerns, and correctly denied the motions to dismiss for not satisfying the statutory criteria. The District Court ultimately granted DPHHS\u2019 motion as to Mother, but only in conjunction with terminating Father\u2019s parental rights, as that action resolved the need for further intervention with Father or for placement of restrictions upon his interaction with the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b628 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b196-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, SHEA, COTTER and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b196-6\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"Aa1\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\u00b629 I disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusions that the conduct or condition rendering Father unfit was unlikely to change within a reasonable time and that; therefore, continuation of the parent-child legal relationship will likely result in his children\u2019s continued abuse or neglect. Factors the trial court must consider in determining whether the conduct or condition rendering a parent unfit is \u201cunlikely to change within a reasonable time\u201d are found in \u00a7 41-3-609(2), MCA. They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">(a) emotional illness, mental illness, or mental deficiency of the parent of a duration or nature as to render the parent unlikely to care for the ongoing physical, mental, and emotional needs of the child within a reasonable time;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">(b) a history of violent behavior by the parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">(c) excessive use of intoxicating liquor or of a narcotic or dangerous drug that affects the parent\u2019s ability to care and provide for the child; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-11\">(d) present judicially ordered long-term confinement of the parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALq\">Overall, \u201cthe court shall give primary consideration to the physical, mental, and emotional conditions and needs of the child.\u201d Section 41-3-609(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-12\">\u00b630 The relevant factors the District Court must have considered in this case concern whether Father had a history of violent behavior, subsection (b), and whether Father\u2019s excessive use of alcohol or drugs affected his ability to care and provide for his children, subsection (c). Related to subsection (b), there were allegations of physical abuse, but no evidence of any specific instance of physical abuse concerning Father and Mother or the children. The first tip DPHHS received concerning the family alleged physical violence in front of the children; however, there was no evidence supporting that allegation. Both Mother and Father denied any physical abuse occurred between them or against the children. K. A. told Moran that Father had never hit him. Father was arrested twice for disorderly conduct and for being involved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>in a disturbance at a bar; however, those two events did not involve anyone in Father\u2019s family or occur within their presence. The record does not establish that Father has a history of violent behavior which will result in continued abuse or neglect of his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b631 Regarding subsection (c), there is evidence Father used drugs and alcohol; however, no evidence that the drug or alcohol use caused any specific danger to the children or was done in the children\u2019s presence. Review of the record indicates Father tested negative for all substances on April 6,2013. Father failed to attend several UAs. Father completed in-patient treatment at Montana Chemical Dependency Center on October 15,2013, and afterwards participated in, but did not complete, out-patient treatment. After removal, Father tested positive, on one occasion, for methamphetamine in a hair sample taken on June 13, 2014 and reported to DPHHS on June 19,2014. Father was intoxicated when Mother called the police to remove him from her and the children\u2019s home on July 9, 2014. Although there was one positive methamphetamine test and one instance of Father being intoxicated at the children\u2019s home, these instances are insufficient to clearly and convincingly establish that Father\u2019s use was \u201cexcessive\u201d or affected his \u201cability to care and provide\u201d for his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b632 Furthermore, in this case, there was evidence that continuation of the parent-child relationship was not likely to result in continued abuse or neglect because testimony indicated Mother had, over the course of the 18-month proceeding, developed an ability to protect her children. Mother complied with DPHHS recommendations in her Treatment Plan and learned to protect her children. Review of the record shows she demonstrated an ability to protect the children when she removed them from the home when she and Father argued or when Father was intoxicated. She asked Father to move out of the family home after his methamphetamine-positive hair test. She further demonstrated her ability and commitment to protect her children by calling the police when Father came to where she and the children were living, when he was not supposed to be there at all, and refused to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b633 Children have been in Mother\u2019s care since August 2013 without incident. Father is likely living with Mother and the children, in violation of the District Court\u2019s order, as he was served with notice of the termination hearing at the Mother and the children\u2019s home. Although we have recognized that a child\u2019s placement with one parent has no bearing on the parental rights of the other parent, <em>In re L.V-B, </em>\u00b6 19, placement with a parent who has demonstrated an ability to protect may be relevant to whether the child will likely be subjected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>continued abuse or neglect by the other parent. Had Mother been unable to demonstrate an ability to protect the children absent termination of Father\u2019s rights, then termination may have been appropriate to preserve at least one parent\u2019s relationship with the children. Here, there was not, in the first instance, clear and convincing evidence that continuation of Father\u2019s relationship with the children would result in continued abuse or neglect. The findirig that Mother was able to protect the children in the event of hostility or drug abuse on the part of Father should have further informed the trial court in its discretion regarding the termination of Father\u2019s parental rights. We recognize that these distinctions are difficult to observe given the complexity of family dynamics. Nevertheless, the court must always be guided by considerations of the best interests of the children, despite the unearned benefit which may be reaped by the parent unable to fully comply with the responsibilities and obligations of parenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\u00b634 Terminating a parent-child relationship \u201cdivests the child and the parents of all legal rights, powers, immunities, duties, and obligations with respect to each other ... except the right of the child to inherit from the parent.\u201d Section 41-3-611(1), MCA. One such divested obligation is that of support and education. Section 40-6-211, MCA. Here, Father\u2019s children were ages nine, four, and two at the time of termination. Terminating Father\u2019s parental rights also extinguished Father\u2019s obligation to provide for their support. The record establishes that Father is employed in the oil industry and capable of providing support to his children. Thus, Father\u2019s ability to provide support for up to sixteen years should have been a consideration in determining whether the children\u2019s best interests necessitated termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b635 Additionally, the record establishes Mother wanted her relationship with Father to continue and that the children had a \u201cstrong bond\u201d with Father. CASA and the children\u2019s attorney counseled against termination. DPHHS stated they wanted Father to have supervised visits with his children but could not achieve that result in the pending proceeding. Instead, DPHHS advocated for termination, even though Moran testified she otherwise did not think termination was in the children\u2019s best interests because Mother would not be able to receive child support from Father and the children have a strong relationship with Father.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u00b636 The District Court failed to appropriately give primary consideration to the needs of the children. There is insubstantial evidence that Father posed a risk or danger to his children or that continuation of their relationship would result in continued abuse or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>neglect. The District Court conceded at the end of the termination hearing that it did not know whether Father represented a danger at all, telling Mother, \u201cThe father of your children. They think he\u2019s a danger. And quite frankly, I\u2019m not certain if he is or not.\u201d If the District Court was uncertain whether Father posed a danger to his children, than its conclusion that continuation of the parent-child legal relationship would result in continued abuse or neglect was certainly not supported by clear and convincing evidence. The District Court\u2019s order terminating Father\u2019s parental rights should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
