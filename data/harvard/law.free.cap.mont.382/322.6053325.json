Houston, Kathy F. Arnoux, and Ethel Gentry (collectively Bergum) filed this action to quiet title in the Fourteenth Judicial District Court, Musselshell County, against Musselshell County. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The District Court granted judgment in favor of Musselshell County. Bergum appeals. Musselshell County cross-appeals from an order regarding attorney fees and costs. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-18\">\u00b62 Bergum and Musselshell County raise several issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>We conclude the following issues are determinative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">\n<em>1. Did the District court err in concluding that the statute of limitations in \u00a7 2214, RCM (1935), barred Bergum\u2019s quiet title action?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">\n<em>2. Did the District Court err in denying Musselshell County its attorney fees under \u00a7 25-7-105, MCA?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">\u00b63 The controversy in this case centers on the disputed ownership of subsurface mineral rights to coal-rich land located in Musselshell County (Subject Real Property).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Subject Real Property has a lengthy and intricate history of ownership. Beginning in 1873, the United States Congress approved appropriations of vacant coal lands of up to 160 acres, provided the applicant was at least twenty one years old, a United States citizen, and paid $10 per acre.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1908, both Lincoln Wescott and Annie Wescott received patents for adjacent parcels of 160 and 160.58 acres, for which they paid $1,600 and $1,605.80 respectively. Also in 1908, Lincoln Wescott conveyed his patented 160 acres to Annie Wescott. This combined 320.58 acres comprises the Subject Real Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">\u00b64 In 1935, Annie Wescott, now Annie Owen, conveyed the Subject Real Property to Charles Wilson. In 1936, county-assessed taxes on the Subj ect Real Property were not paid and the County Assessor listed the taxes as delinquent. The taxes remained delinquent until 1941 when Charles Wilson paid a portion of the taxes owed and redeemed the property. Critically, the Certificate of Redemption of Property Sold for Taxes, dated March 5, 1941, describes the Subject Real Property Charles Wilson redeemed and states \u201csurface rights only.\u201d From this point, the Subject Real Property\u2019s subsurface rights (Subsurface Rights) and surface rights (Surface Rights) are severed. On the same day Charles Wilson redeemed the \u201csurface rights only,\u201d he conveyed his interest in the Subject Real Property and other property to E.K. Woodley and E.C. Woodley.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">\u00b65 The Subsurface Rights were not redeemed in 1941. Subsequently, the unredeemed portion of the original tax delinquency, which began in 1936, remained delinquent until 1945 and was listed under Charles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Wilson\u2019s name. In 1945, Musselshell County applied for a tax deed. Affidavits of service, filed with both the Musselshell County Clerk and Recorder and the Treasurer\u2019s office, verify that the County provided notice of an impending tax sale by publication and registered mail. In 1946, Musselshell County held a tax sale where it purchased the Subsurface Rights for $251.32. The Treasurer of Musselshell County issued a tax deed to Musselshell County on February 5, 1946, for the Subject Real Property \u201cless surface which has been redeemed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b66 Regarding the Surface Rights after 1941, another tax delinquency occurred in 1945 and was listed under E.K. Woodley\u2019s name. Also in 1945, E.K. Woodley and E.C. Woodley conveyed their interest in the Subject Real Property and other property to Francis Brown, Murry Brown, and Jim Brown. Still in 1945, Jim Brown and Murry Brown conveyed their interests to Francis Brown. In 1950, Francis Brown conveyed his interest in the Subject Real Property to Roy Gentry and Ethel Gentry. In this conveyance, Francis Brown attempted to retain a fifty percent mineral interest in the Subject Real Property (Mineral Right of Entry).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u00b67 In 1955, Roy Gentry and Ethel Gentry filed an action to quiet title to the Subject Real Property. The title was quieted in their favor by decree recorded on January 6, 1956, but an exception was listed for Musselshell County\u2019s interest in the Subsurface Rights. The decree stated Roy Gentry and Ethel Gentry \u201care entitled to a decree of this Court quieting title as to said real estate\u201d except for \u201cthe interest of Musselshell County, Montana, in and to the minerals, including coal, pertaining to the [Subject Real Property], together with a right of entry on said lands.\u201d Francis Brown, who claimed to have maintained a Mineral Right of Entry in the Subject Real Property, was not named as a party in this quiet title proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">\u00b68 Finally, in 2007, Bergum initiated an action against Musselshell County to quiet title to the Subject Real Property as successor in interest to the Mineral Right of Entry Francis Brown purportedly retained when he transferred the Subject Real Property in 1950. Musselshell County and Bergum filed competing motions for summary judgment in 2012. On October, 3, 2012, the District Court held a hearing on the parties\u2019 respective motions for summary judgment. Over two years later, on December 19,2014, the District Court granted Musselshell County\u2019s motion for summary judgment. On April 13, 2015, the District Court entered an order awarding costs, but not attorney fees. On April 28, 2015, the District Court entered its judgment in favor of Musselshell County from which Bergum appeals. Musselshell County cross-appeals from the District Court\u2019s order regarding attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b69 A district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo. <em>Omimex Can., Ltd. v. State, </em>2015 MT 102, \u00b6 11, 378 Mont. 490, 346 P.3d 1125 (citation omitted). Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3). \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness.\u201d <em>Kiser v. Kiser, </em>2015 MT 315, \u00b6 7, 381 Mont. 368, 360 P.3d 1139 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b610 If legal authority exists for a district court to award attorney fees, then a district court\u2019s grant or denial of attorney fees is a discretionary ruling which we review for abuse of discretion. <em>Swapinski v. Lincoln Cnty., </em>2015 MT 275, \u00b6 8, 381 Mont. 138, 357 P.3d 329 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u00b611 <em>1. Did the District court err in concluding that the statute of limitations in \u00a7 2214, RCM (1935), barred Bergum\u2019s quiet title action?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AmT\">\u00b612 At the District Court level, Bergum challenged the sufficiency of the tax deed procedure used by Musselshell County to purchase the Subject Real Property\u2019s Subsurface Rights in 1946. The District Court, in its order granting Musselshell County summary judgment, concluded that \u201c[e]ven if a problem existed with respect to Musselshell County\u2019s tax deed procedure, the statute of limitations set forth in R.C.M. (1935) Section 2214 bars any claim by [Bergum] based on such problem(s).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">\u00b613 Bergum argues the District Court erred in applying \u00a7 2214, RCM (1935), to conclude her quiet title action was barred. Bergum claims that \u00a7 2214, RCM (1935), by its own language, does not apply for two alternative reasons; either because 1) \u201cno taxes were delinquent on said lands\u201d or 2) \u201credemption had been made from said tax sale.\u201d Section 2214, RCM (1935). Essentially, Bergum argues the taxes assessed on the Subject Real Property were unconstitutional and, because they were never legally assessed, could never have become delinquent. Alternatively, Bergum argues that allowing a taxpayer to redeem only a portion of tax-delinquent property is unconstitutional and, therefore, asserts that Charles Wilson\u2019s redemption of the property in 1941 effectively redeemed the entire Subject Real Property, not just the \u201csurface rights only.\u201d Under either alternative, Bergum maintains that \u00a7 2214, RCM (1935), does not apply or bar her quiet title action.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">\u00b614 In response, Musselshell County argues \u00a7 2214, RCM (1935), applies and bars Bergum\u2019s action because the taxes assessed on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Subject Real Property were constitutional at the time they were assessed under Article 12, Section 3, of the 1889 Montana Constitution, which required mining claims be taxed. Further, Musselshell County points to \u00a7 2211, RCM (1935), entitled \u201cRedemption from tax sales \u2014 piecemeal redemption\u201d as support for its proposition that piecemeal redemption was constitutional and statutorily authorized. The District Court agreed with Musselshell County and concluded \u00a7 2214, RCM (1935), barred Bergum\u2019s current quiet title action. We agree with the District Court and Musselshell County.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u00b615  The law applicable at the time the taxes were assessed and the sale occurred must be used to determine the validity of the taxes and the procedure used. <em>See Fariss v. Anaconda Copper Mining Co., </em>31 F. Supp. 571, 576 (D. Mont. 1940); <em>King v. Rosebud Cnty., </em>193 Mont. 268, 275, 631 P.2d 711, 715 (1981) (The court looked to statutes in force in 1939 to determine the validity of tax sale proceedings which occurred in 1939). Here, this Court will look to the constitution and statutes in force at the time the challenged assessments and tax sale occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"AbD\">\u00b616 Section 2214, RCM (1935), entitled \u201cOf what deed is evidence \u2014 actions concerning,\u201d provides that a duly acknowledged or proved deed is conclusive evidence of all other proceedings from the tax assessment up to the execution of the deed. Further it reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">[N]o action can be maintained to set aside or annul a tax deed or to assert a title hostile to a tax deed upon any ground whatever, whether on the ground that said deed, or any prior proceeding, was irregular or void, other than that the deed was void because no taxes were delinquent on said lands, or because redemption had been made from said tax sale, unless the action is commenced within one year from and after the date of the issuance of said tax deed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">Section 2214, RCM (1935). Section 2214, RCM (1935), sets out a one-year statute of limitations and outlines two exceptions to its application. The one-year limitations does not bar an action if the \u201cdeed was void because no taxes were delinquent on said lands,\u201d or \u201cbecause redemption had been made from said tax sale.\u201d Section 2214, RCM (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">\u00b617 In its order granting Musselshell County summary judgment, the District Court concluded that the 1946 deed was not void because the taxes assessed on the property and partial redemption of the \u201csurface rights only\u201d were proper. It follows that if the two exceptions to the statute of limitations do not apply, \u00a7 2214, RCM (1935), applies, and bars Bergum\u2019s claim. If the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the exceptions do not apply is correct, Bergum\u2019s predecessors in interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>had until February 5, 1947, or one year from the issuance of the tax deed to Musselshell County, to initiate an action to quiet title to the Subject Real Property\u2019s Subsurface Rights. Instead, Bergum initiated this action by filing a complaint to quiet title on April 4, 2007, or over 60 years after the deadline imposed by \u00a7 2214, RCM (1935). We review the District Court\u2019s conclusions that the exceptions of \u00a7 2214, RCM (1935), do not apply for correctness. We address their application in turn:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">\n<em>a. Exception 1: \u201cdeed was void because no taxes were delinquent on said lands\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u00b618 Bergum relies on <em>Northern Pacific Railway v. Musselshell County, </em>54 Mont. 96, 169 P. 53 (1917), to support her contention that the taxes Musselshell County assessed on the Subsurface Rights after the Surface Rights were redeemed, from 1941 to 1945, were unconstitutional and, therefore, void. Bergum contends <em>Northern Pacific Railway </em>supports her proposition that \u201ctaxation of an undeveloped mineral estate was unconstitutional.\u201d We disagree. Article 12, Section 3, of the 1889 Montana Constitution states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">All mines and mining claims, both placer and rock in place, containing or bearing gold, silver, copper, lead, coal or other valuable mineral deposits, after purchase thereof from the United States, shall be taxed at the price paid the United States therefor, unless the surface ground, or some part thereof, of such mine or claim, is used for other than mining purposes, and has a separate and independent value for such other purposes, in which case said surface ground, or any part thereof, so used for other than mining purposes, shall be taxed at its value for such other purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQ2U\">This constitutional provision was interpreted by the Court <em>in Northern Pacific Railway </em>and <em>Hinz v. Musselshell County, </em>82 Mont. 502, 267 P. 1113 (1928). It was interpreted again in <em>Superior Coal Co. v. Musselshell County, </em>98 Mont. 501, 41 P.2d 14 (1935), which, after discussing both <em>Northern Pacific Railway </em>and <em>Hinz, </em>held that \u201cone who has purchased a mining claim from the United States is estopped from denying that it is a mining claim.\u201d <em>Superior Coal Co., </em>98 Mont. at 514, 41 P.2d at 20. Further, \u201c[f]or the purpose of taxation, coal mining claims, lode mining claims and placer mining claims alike are governed by the provisions of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Superior Coal Co., </em>98 Mont. at 514, 41 P.2d at 20. The Court held that the taxable value of property is appropriately set by the constitution at the price paid for the property. <em>Superior Coal Co., </em>98 Mont, at 515, 41 P.2d at 20. The risk that the property is not as valuable as the patentee paid, or worthless, is immaterial to the constitutionality of this scheme of taxation. <em>Superior Coal Co., 98 </em>Mont. at 515, 41 P.2d at 20. Finally, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>concluded that the \u201csurface ground by itself is not taxed at any value; it is part of the mine; it is presumed that it has no value except for use in working the mine. When the surface ground of a mining claim, or some part thereof is used for some purpose other than mining, and the owner of the mining claim sells that surface ... he is still the owner of the mining claim; all he has sold is the newly created estate \u2018which in the eye of the law, is regarded as independent of the original estate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Superior Coal Co., </em>98 Mont. at 521, 41 P.2d at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u00b619 Here, Bergum does not dispute that Lincoln Wescott and Annie Wescott applied for and received coal patents for lands that now constitute the Subject Real Property. Applying Superior <em>Coal Co. </em>to the case at bar, Bergum is estopped from denying the Subject Real Property is a mining claim and can be taxed as such. Lincoln Wescott and Annie Wescott paid the United States a combined $3,205.80 for the Subject Real Property and the County Assessor gave it a taxable value of $3,207. <em>Superior Coal Co. </em>held that the taxable value should be set by what was paid for the mining claim and is constitutionally assessed on the minerals, even if undeveloped. Additionally if the surface of a mining claim is sold, it is legally separate, and may also be taxed. The taxes assessed on the Subsurface Rights from 1941 to 1945 were constitutional and valid. The validity of the taxes assessed disproves Bergum\u2019s argument that no taxes were delinquent. Instead, the taxes were validly assessed and delinquent because they were unpaid. The first exception to \u00a7 2214, RCM (1935), does not apply.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">\n<em>b. Exception 2: \u201credemption had been made from said tax sale.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-H\">\u00b620 Bergum argues that Musselshell County\u2019s practice, which allowed Charles Wilson to redeem only a portion of the Subject Real Property in 1941, was illegal. Bergum contends that Charles Wilson\u2019s redemption in 1941 was for the entire Subject Real Property, not just for the \u201csurface rights only,\u201d as the redemption document states. Bergum claims that the Subject Real Property was fully redeemed in 1941 and, as a result, the tax deed issued to Musselshell County in 1946 for the Subsurface Rights was invalid. A coal patent \u201ccarries with it the title to the surface included within the lines of the mining location, as well as to the land beneath the surface.\u201d <em>Hansard Mining, Inc. v. McLean, </em>2014 MT 199, \u00b6 20, 376 Mont. 48, 335 P.3d 711; <em>citing Deffeback v. Hawke, </em>115 U.S. 392, 406, 6 S. Ct. 95, 101 (1885). At the time Charles Wilson partially redeemed the Subject Real Property in 1941, \u00a7 2211 RCM (1935), entitled \u201cRedemption from tax sale \u2014 piecemeal redemption,\u201d explicitly authorized property owners to partially redeem their property from a tax sale. If the redeemer pays a portion of the tax owed, \u201cthe county treasurer shall apportion the tax for the portion sought to be redeemed.\u201d Section 2211, RCM (1935). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Also, <em>Superior Coal </em>Co., addressed and clarified that it is possible to divide mining claims and subsequently create two independent legal estates \u2014 one for the surface and one for the subsurface. <em>Superior Coal Co., </em>98 Mont. at 521, 41 P.2d at 23. Charles Wilson\u2019s redemption in 1941 stated that it was partial, for the \u201csurface rights only.\u201d Piecemeal redemption was specifically authorized. The second exception to \u00a7 2214, RCM (1935), does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b621  We conclude that the District Court correctly determined that neither exception to \u00a7 2214, RCM (1935), applied to Bergum\u2019s current quiet title action. Therefore, the District Court also correctly determined that the one-year statute of limitations of \u00a7 2214, RCM (1935), applied and barred Bergum\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u00b622 <em>2. Did the District Court err in denying Musselshell County its attorney fees under \u00a7 25-7-105, MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u00b623 On December 7,2011, Bergum offered five dollars in exchange for Musselshell County\u2019s consent to quiet title in her favor. On December 21, 2011, Musselshell County counter offered \u201ca one-pound lump of coal, suitable for placement in a Christmas stocking\u201d and to forgo recovery of its attorney fees and costs incurred during litigation in exchange for Bergum dismissing her action to quiet title. On appeal, Musselshell County contends that, under \u00a7 25-7-105, MCA, it was entitled to attorney fees, totaling $82,374, because of this counter offer. That statute reads, in pertinent parts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">1) At any time more than 60 days after service of the complaint and more than 30 days before the trial begins, any party may serve upon the adverse party a written offer to settle a claim for the money or property or to the effect specified in the offer.... <em>If the final judgment is less favorable to the offeree than the offer, the offeree shall pay the costs incurred by the offeror after the offer was made....</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">3) For the purposes of this section, <em>costs include reasonable attorney fees.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">4) This section applies only to an action or claim for which the amount contained in a pleading is $50,000 or less, exclusive of costs, interest, and service charges, and the action or claim:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-10\">a) arises from contract or breach of contract, other than a contract of insurance, bond, surety, or warranty; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-11\">b) involves real property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">Section 25-7-105, MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-13\">\u00b624 As an initial matter, the parties dispute whether Musselshell County\u2019s counter offer was a valid offer or whether it was more favorable to Bergum than the final judgment. Bergum argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Musselshell County\u2019s letter did not constitute a legitimate offer. Bergum also argues that a one-pound lump of coal, shared between Barbara Brown Bergum, Richard Brown, Jeannette Studer, Caroline Y. Houston, Kathy F. Arnoux, and Ethel Gentry is not a \u201cmore favorable\u201d result than the final judgment, which quieted title in Musselshell County\u2019s favor. In her briefing to this Court, Bergum claims that a one-pound lump of coal is worth $0.0058, and that she and the five other appellants would receive $0.000967 each. Bergum argues that offering six people half of a penny to share is not more favorable than the final judgment and should not be the basis for an award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\u00b625 We decline to address whether Musselshell County\u2019s offer was legitimate, as the District Court\u2019s decision did not rest upon these grounds. We nevertheless observe that the portion of Musselshell County\u2019s offer, relating to a one-pound lump of coal, strikes us as unprofessional and inconsistent with what we would expect from a public entity. Regardless of whether Musselshell County\u2019s offer was valid or a more favorable result to Bergum than the final judgment, \u00a7 25-7-105(4), MCA, only allows attorney fees if the amount contained in the pleading is $50,000 or less. Without considering the legitimacy of Musselshell County\u2019s offer, the District Court concluded that Musselshell County had \u201cfailed to establish that the value of the subject property is less than $50,000 as required by Mont. Codes [sic] Ann. \u00a7 25-7-105 (3) and (4).\u201d As proof of the amount contained in Bergum\u2019s complaint to quiet title to the Mineral Right of Entry in the Subject Real Property, Musselshell County offered a copy of a coal lease which had been executed on a parcel of land adjacent to the Subject Real Property. The District Court held that this evidence \u201cis, without more, insufficient to establish that the value of the entire subsurface estate is worth less than $50,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u00b626  Musselshell County argues the District Court erred by failing to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the value contained in Bergum\u2019s complaint is worth less than $50,000. Bergum counters that Musselshell County never requested the District Court hold a hearing. Musselshell County relies on several pages of its pleading entitled Response in Opposition to Motion to Have Memorandum of Costs Taxed and Reply in Support of Memorandum of Costs as evidence of its contention that \u201c[t]he necessity of a hearing was made known to the District Court.\u201d Upon review, that pleading notified the District Court that if attorney fees were awarded, a hearing would be required to determine whether the attorney fees were \u201creasonable.\u201d However, the District Court did not award attorney fees, thus, under Musselshell County\u2019s own reasoning, a hearing was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>required. We conclude that the District Court\u2019s failure to hold an evidentiary hearing on the amount in the complaint was not in error because Musselshell County did not request such a hearing. Instead, the District Court relied on evidence Musselshell County provided to conclude that it had failed to prove the amount contained in Bergum\u2019s complaint was less than $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\u00b627  Musselshell County introduced insufficient evidence to establish that the requirements of \u00a7 25-7-105(4), MCA, were met. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Musselshell County its attorney fees under \u00a7 25-7-105, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\u00b628 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b364-8\">JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-11\"> The legal description of the Subject Real Property is NW 1/4 W 1/2 SW 1/4, SE 1/4, SW 1/4, SW 1/4 SE 1/4 of Section 2, Township 6 North, Range 27 East P.M.M.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b356-12\"> <em>See </em>30 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 71 (LexisNexis, Lexis Advance through Pub.

(1935) bars the action because neither exception applies. I do not believe that it is necessary, however, to analyze the constitutionality of Musselshell County\u2019s actions in the 1940s in order to determine whether Bergum\u2019s claim is barred. As the Court notes, \u00a7 2214 provided in pertinent part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-12\">no action can be maintained to set aside or annul a tax deed ... upon any ground whatever, whether on the ground that said deed, or any prior proceeding, was irregular or void, other than that the deed was void because no taxes were delinquent on said lands, or because redemption had been made from said tax sale, unless the action is commenced within one year from and after the date of the issuance of said tax deed[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">\u00b631 Bergum claims advantage of the first exception on the ground that \u201cno taxes were delinquent\u201d on the property. But her allegation that the tax deed was void is premised on the County\u2019s allegedly unconstitutional action in retaining the mineral rights to the property when it was reclaimed in 1941. Bergum argues that the 1941 certificate of redemption could not legally convey to Wilson the \u201csurface rights only.\u201d Bergum\u2019s challenge is to the procedure by which the surface rights and mineral rights were severed and to the County\u2019s authority to tax the two interests separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-14\">\u00b632 The statute\u2019s reference to taxes not being delinquent on the property clearly allowed a property owner to challenge the taxing authority\u2019s determination that the property owner failed to pay assessments levied against the property. The property owner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>challenge to the legality of the assessments in the first place is not the same thing as a claim that the owner paid the taxes assessed. When interpreting the language of the statute, the Court \u201cis simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. Further, we recognize that \u201ccourts should avoid addressing constitutional issues whenever possible.\u201d <em>Sunburst Sch. Dist. No. 2 v. Texaco, </em>Inc., 2007 MT 183, \u00b6 62, 338 Mont. 259, 165 P.3d 1079. I would conclude that a taxpayer\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of a county\u2019s tax assessment is not within the first exception to \u00a7 2214, R.C.M. (1935). For the same reason, the second exception does not save Bergum\u2019s claims, which are premised on the alleged illegality of the County\u2019s action in allowing Wilson to redeem only the surface rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">\u00b633 I would therefore conclude that Bergum\u2019s claim is barred by the one-year limitation period without reaching the merits of Bergum\u2019s constitutional arguments about separate taxation of surface and mineral interests or redemption of surface rights only. \u201cWe may affirm a district court decision that is correct regardless of the district court\u2019s reasoning in reaching its decision.\u201d <em>PacifiCorp v. State, </em>2011 MT 93, \u00b6 54, 360 Mont. 259, 253 P.3d 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\u00b634 With respect to Issue Two, I agree that the denial of attorney\u2019s fees to the County was correct. In my view, the County\u2019s argument that it made a valid settlement offer for purposes of \u00a7 25-7-105, MCA, is disingenuous. Though the County casts its offer as a benefit to the Plaintiffs that simply was made with \u201cpoetic wrapping and literary allusion,\u201d no reasonable mind could conclude that the offer of a lump of coal made days before Christmas was a good faith settlement offer. I would conclude that in order to obtain the attorney\u2019s fee benefit afforded by the statute, a party must make a legitimate, good faith offer of settlement. The County\u2019s \u201coffer\u201d in this case does not by any measure meet that standard, and was especially in poor taste when coming from a public entity.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
