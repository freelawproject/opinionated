The District Court determined that a constructive trust should not be imposed on $2,306,103.13 of Roy Volk\u2019s life insurance proceeds for the benefit of his minor son, RBV, because Valerie Goeser was not unjustly enriched when she received Roy Volk\u2019s life insurance proceeds. We reverse the summary judgment and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">\u00b62 Appellant raises one issue on appeal, which we address as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AUF\">\u00b63 <em>Whether the District Court erred when it granted summary judgment to Valerie, and denied the imposition of a constructive trust on life insurance proceeds in favor of RBV, a minor child?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">\u00b64 Roy Volk was married to Pamela Dee Volk in April 1996. The couple had a son, RBV, in the fall of 2000. On June 25, 2010, Roy filed a Petition for Dissolution of Marriage in the Montana Eighth Judicial District Court. On the same day, as part of the dissolution proceeding, the District Court issued the statutorily-mandated Summons and Temporary Restraining Order. The divorce proceedings lasted over a year and a half, ending with the court\u2019s hearing and dissolution of the marriage on December 21, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">\u00b65 Roy and Pamela entered into a Marital Settlement Agreement (\u201cMSA\u201d) on December 20, 2011. Several agreements were included as part of the MSA including a \u201cFuture Instruments\u201d clause where Roy agreed \u201c[h]usband shall execute a will naming his son as beneficiary of his estate, giving all of his assets to his son.\u201d This clause included Roy\u2019s agreement to leave all of his assets to RBV through a will that would be executed as a \u201cfuture document.\u201d Attached to the MSA as exhibit A, was a list of assets and liabilities for each party where Roy indicated that \u201c[hjusband\u2019s New York Life insurance policy\u201d (Policy 936) was an asset. The MSA further provided that if either husband or wife failed to disclose an asset, \u201cthat finding is presented to be grounds for the Court, without taking into account the equitable division of the marital estate, to award the undisclosed asset to the opposing party ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>\u00b66 At the time of the divorce, Roy owned two term life insurance policies. The policies are New York Life Policy No. 46689799 (\u201cPolicy 799\u201d) with a benefit of $1,500,000; and New York Life Policy No. 76098936 (\u201cPolicy 936\u201d) with a benefit of $1,000,000. Policy 799 was not disclosed in the divorce; Pamela was the sole beneficiary, but she was not aware the policy existed. Roy disclosed Policy 936 in the divorce, and Pamela and Volk Sand and Gravel (Roy\u2019s business) were equal beneficiaries (50 percent to each) with a $200,000 collateral assignment to Stockman Bank. On July 15, 2010, while the restraining order was in effect, Roy changed the beneficiary designations on both policies and designated his sister, Valerie Goeser, as the new beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\u00b67 Roy also had a daughter, Saraya Roberson. In June of 2005, Roy and Saraya\u2019s mother, Serena C. Roberson, entered into a Child Support Agreement pertaining to Saraya. That agreement contained a provision requiring Roy, within 30 days of the court\u2019s Order approving the agreement, to purchase a life insurance policy of $100,000 naming Saraya as the owner and sole beneficiary. The Child Support Agreement was approved and adopted by the Montana Eighth Judicial District Court on July 28,2005. Roy never purchased the life insurance policy required by this Agreement, nor did Roy name Saraya as a beneficiary on any life insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">\u00b68 On April 30, 2012, just over four months after the divorce was final, Roy died unexpectedly at age 45. Roy did not have a will in place. Because Roy had changed his life insurance beneficiary designations in violation of the restraining order, Valerie received the life insurance proceeds from both policies in the total amount of $2,306,103.13. Valerie was shocked to learn upon Roy\u2019s death that she was the recipient of the two life insurance policies. Valerie invested the proceeds in a home and real property in Newport Beach, California.</p>\n<p id=\"Az_\">\u00b69 After Roy\u2019s death, Pamela discovered that Valerie received the life insurance proceeds from Policy 936, due to Roy\u2019s change of beneficiary during the divorce. Pamela wrote Valerie to inquire about the policy and notify her of RBV\u2019s equitable claim. Valerie did not respond to the inquiry and Pamela subsequently sent a subpoena duces tecum to New York Life to determine how the policy benefit was dispersed. At that time she discovered the existence of the second life insurance policy, Policy 799, with the $1,500,000 benefit. Pamela also determined through discovery that she was the beneficiary on Policy 799 until Roy changed it to Valerie on July 15, 2010, while the restraining order was in effect. The New York Life records confirmed that both policies were paid to Valerie.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">\u00b610 A probate was opened to settle Roy\u2019s estate. Pamela filed two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>creditor\u2019s claims in the probate on October 23, 2012. The first claim was on her behalf for payment Roy had agreed upon, and the second was on behalf of RBV for child support and health insurance costs totaling about $77,500. Roy\u2019s estate did not have sufficient funds to pay RBV\u2019s child support claim. On April 29, 2013, Pamela, on behalf of RBV, filed this action against Valerie and Roy Craig Volk\u2019s estate seeking a constructive trust over the insurance policy payouts for the benefit of RBV. The complaint named Saraya, as co-personal representative of Roy\u2019s estate, as a defendant. Pamela also filed two additional actions in April 2013 that are not part of this appeal: an action to reopen the dissolution for award of the policy proceeds due to violation of the restraining order, and another similar action to seek policy proceeds through the probate. While Valerie was notified of Pamela\u2019s equitable claim on RBV\u2019s behalf, she was not served in the dissolution or probate actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">\u00b611 Judge Neill of the Montana Eighth Judicial District presided over all three of the actions tied to this case: Roy and Pamela\u2019s dissolution, the probate of Roy\u2019s estate, and here, Pamela\u2019s claims requesting a constructive trust for RBV. The three actions have significant overlap regarding parties, claims, and the equities of the case. This appeal arises out of the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in Valerie\u2019s favor regarding Pamela\u2019s constructive trust claims for RBV.</p>\n<p id=\"A88\">\u00b612 Saraya filed a cross-appeal seeking imposition of a constructive trust for her benefit to fulfill the $100,000 liability. Subsequently, and by admission of both parties, Saraya and Pamela entered an agreement (\u201cOctober Agreement\u201d) under which Pamela would pay Saraya\u2019s claim from RBV\u2019s constructive trust if RBV prevails on his claims against Valerie.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">District Court Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">\u00b613 By May 2014, both parties moved for summary judgment. On May 16, 2014, Saraya sought leave from the District Court to file an Amended Answer and to assert cross-claims against Valerie. Several additional motions were made in the case, which were held in abeyance while the District Court considered the pending summary judgment motions. The District Court held hearings on both summary judgment motions. The court entered summary judgment in favor of Valerie on October 30, 2014. At that time the court also denied Saraya\u2019s motion for leave to amend. Pamela and RBV timely appealed on November 19, 2014. Saraya timely appealed on December 8, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">\u00b614 The District Court granted summary judgment to Valerie on all claims. The court concluded that even though Roy had changed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>beneficiary designation on both policies while the court\u2019s restraining order was still in effect, the case was different from this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Briese v. Mont. Pub. Employees Ret. Bd., </em>2012 MT 192, 366 Mont. 148, 285 P.3d 550, because Roy died after the divorce was final and the restraining order was lifted. The District Court reasoned the purpose of the restraining order is to maintain the status quo in regard to the parties\u2019 property so long as the dissolution action is pending \u2014 a purpose that terminates once the dissolution action is complete. The court further reasoned that once the restraining order was lifted, Roy would have been free to change the beneficiary at any time. The court found had he not changed the beneficiaries, Pamela still would have been removed as a beneficiary by operation of law under \u00a7 72-2-814, MCA. Under this analysis, the court concluded that equity did not require voiding Roy\u2019s changes to the beneficiaries because Roy made no further changes after the dissolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u00b615 The court rejected Pamela\u2019s argument that because Roy disclosed Policy 936 as an asset in the MSA he considered his insurance policies to be assets and therefore intended RBV to be the beneficiary. The court found, however, that neither the MSA nor the stipulated final parenting plan made any mention of life insurance policies and the MSA only required that Roy create a will and name RBV as the beneficiary of his estate (which Roy failed to do during the four months following the MSA). The court concluded that an insurance policy is a non-probate transfer and would pass outside of any will Roy had executed; thus, Roy\u2019s will would not have affected the insurance policies. Considering the intent of the parties and the language of the MSA, the court then concluded that the term \u201cassets\u201d clearly refers to Roy\u2019s testamentary estate, not specifically including the life insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\u00b616 The District Court also rejected Pamela\u2019s argument that she should be awarded the proceeds of the second, undisclosed policy. The court agreed with Pamela that Roy should have disclosed the policy as an asset in the marital estate. Still, the court did not award the proceeds to Pamela on the basis that the term life policy does not receive any value until the holder\u2019s death. The court reasoned that marital property is valued at the time of the divorce proceedings, and thus the court could not take into account the policy\u2019s $1.5 million proceeds because they materialized only after Roy died, months after the divorce was finalized. Therefore, Roy\u2019s nondisclosure of the second policy, even if a violation of the MSA, had no monetary effect on the value of the marital estate. The court concluded that the parties did not discuss insurance specifically in the MSA so it would be speculative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>for the court to say what effect the disclosure of the policy might have had on the parties\u2019 negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">\u00b617 Finally, the District Court rejected Pamela\u2019s contention that Valerie had been unjustly enriched and that a constructive trust must be imposed. Accordingly, the District Court declined to award summary judgment and equitable relief to Pamela.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\u00b618 We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, using the same M. R. Civ. P. 56 criteria used by the district court. <em>Albert v. City of Billings, </em>2012 MT 159, \u00b6 15, 365 Mont. 454, 282 P.3d 704. Summary judgment is appropriate when the moving party demonstrates both the absence of any genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Albert, </em>\u00b6 15. Once the moving party has met its burden, the non-moving party must present substantial evidence essential to one or more elements of the case to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Styren Farms, Inc. v. Roos, </em>2011 MT 299, \u00b6 10, 363 Mont. 41, 265 P.3d 1230. We further review a question of law to determine if the district court\u2019s legal conclusions are correct. <em>Palmer v. Bahm, </em>2006 MT 29, \u00b6 11, 331 Mont. 105, 128 P.3d 1031.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap9\">\u00b619 The standard of review governing proceedings in equity is codified at \u00a7 3-2-204(5), MCA, which directs the appellate court to review and determine questions of fact as well as questions of law. <em>Gitto v. Gitto, </em>239 Mont. 47, 50, 778 P.2d 906, 908 (1989). We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to ascertain whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Daines v. Knight, </em>269 Mont. 320, 324, 888 P.2d 904, 906 (1995). A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the trial court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the district court made a mistake. <em>Kovarik v. Kovarik, </em>1998 MT 33, \u00b6 20, 287 Mont. 350, 954 P.2d 1147.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">\u00b620 Section 40-4-101, MCA, provides that Montana\u2019s law concerning separation and dissolution of marriage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-10\">shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes, which are to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-11\">(1) strengthen and preserve the integrity of marriage and safeguard family relationships;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-12\">(2) <em>promote the amicable settlement of disputes </em>that have arisen between parties to a marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-13\">(3) <em>mitigate the potential harm to the spouses and their children </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number><em>caused by the process of legal dissolution of marriage', </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEc\">(4) <em>make reasonable provision for spouse and minor children during and after litigation </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Section 40-4-101, MCA (emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">\u00b621 In an effort to support these goals and promote a proper and amicable settlement, the District Court entered the statutorily-mandated restraining order in the dissolution proceeding, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIt\">Petitioner and Respondent are both hereby restrained as follows under the authority of \u00a7 40-4-121(3), MCA, 2009:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">3. Petitioner and Respondent are hereby restrained from cashing, borrowing against, canceling, transferring, disposing of, or changing the beneficiaries of any insurance or other coverage, including life, health, automobile, and disability coverage held for the benefit of a party or a child of a party for whom support may be ordered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">\u00b622 This Court previously addressed the issue of changing beneficiaries under a restraining order in our decision in <em>Briese, </em>The dispute in <em>Briese </em>surrounded a retirement benefit beneficiary change made by a Yellowstone County deputy sheriff after a \u00a7 40-4-121(3), MCA, restraining order had been issued in conjunction with his petition for dissolution of marriage. While the marital dissolution proceedings were still pending with the restraining order in place, and without consent of his wife or the court, Briese changed his retirement beneficiary designation from his wife Erene, to his two minor children. The change of beneficiary was discovered after Briese died in the line of duty, while the dissolution proceedings were pending. We determined the change of beneficiary was invalid because it was made in violation of the statutorily-mandated restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">\u00b623 We reasoned that \u201c[t]he purpose of the law requiring a temporary restraining order is clearly to maintain the status quo with respect to all property of the parties.\u201d <em>Briese, </em>\u00b6 25. We stated that this policy is in place to \u201c[mitigate] the potential harm to spouses and children caused by the dissolution process itself and ensure that reasonable provision is made for the spouse and children during the litigation.\u201d <em>Briese, </em>\u00b6 25. Further, we determined that \u201c[t]he plain language of subsection (b) is quite broad, restraining both parties from unilaterally \u2018changing the beneficiaries of <em>any </em>... coverage ... held for the benefit of a party.\u2019 \u201d <em>Briese </em>\u00b6 25 (quoting \u00a7 40-4-121(3)(b), MCA) (emphasis added). In plain terms, the restraining order serves as a protective umbrella over all marital assets while the parties negotiate an MSA or proceed with litigation. If agreement is reached on division of property, the parties\u2019 agreements are incorporated in the MSA, the new contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>between the parties. Then, with the MSA in place, the restraining order can be dissolved upon entry of the decree, and the MSA guides any further asset divisions and responsibilities of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\u00b624 As we determined in <em>Briese, </em>the remedy for restraining order violations in most cases is a \u201ccivil or criminal contempt action against the violator.\u201d <em>Briese, </em>\u00b6 38. This remedy was not available in <em>Briese </em>because, similar to this case, the violator was deceased. In <em>Briese, </em>we reviewed the approaches used by other jurisdictions to solve this problem. Of note was our recognition of the Michigan Supreme Court position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">It needs no citation that for violation of an injunction, a court, under its general powers, may order a return to the <em>status quo </em>.... Transfers of property in violation of an injunction are invalid and may be set aside ... and subsequent death of the injunction violator does not prevent the court from exercising such power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4s\"><em>Briese, </em>\u00b6 39 <em>(citing Webb v. Webb, </em>375 Mich. 624, 134 N.W.2d 673, 674-75 (Mich. 1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">\u00b625 In <em>Briese, </em>we determined that violation of a dissolution proceeding restraining order does not automatically void the beneficiary change. <em>Briese, </em>\u00b6 40. Nonetheless, we found that the courts, at a minimum, possess \u201cequitable power to order a return to the status quo when a party violating a temporary restraining order has died.\u201d <em>Briese, </em>\u00b6 41. We look to our precedent in <em>Briese </em>and to the statutes as we turn to the facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">Roy\u2019s Improper Change of Beneficiary on Policy 936</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">\u00b626 On appeal, Pamela argues that the District Court erred in this case and abused its discretion when it determined that the violation of the restraining order had no actual effect on the beneficiary change and that the equities were not in favor of a constructive trust for RBV. She further argues that equity requires the proceeds received by Valerie must be placed in a constructive trust for RBV. Pamela also asserts that Roy\u2019s June 25, 2010, violation of the restraining order cannot be excused by the District Court. She further contends that even though Roy changed the beneficiary designation to his sister Valerie, he did not intend his violation to control the ultimate disposition of his life insurance. Instead, she argues that the evidence demonstrates that Pamela and Roy always thought of Roy\u2019s life insurance as an asset and Roy intended to leave it, with all of his assets, to RBV. Pamela implies that Roy simply did not have his affairs in the order he would choose when he unexpectedly died and that if he had the opportunity, he would have set the affairs according to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>MSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">\u00b627 Valerie defends the District Court\u2019s equitable determination. She argues that because life insurance proceeds pass outside the testamentary estate, the life insurance contract was properly executed. She also contends that the MSA and Final Parenting Plan fail to mention any agreement or intention to name a particular beneficiary. She notes that Roy, during the four months before his death after the divorce, could have changed the beneficiary to any person of his choosing. Instead, he retained Valerie as the beneficiary on Policy 936, which should be considered his final intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\u00b628 Roy purchased Policy 936 on May 16, 2002, with a $665 down payment. The policy originally listed Volk Sand &amp; Gravel as the beneficiary. On August 9, 2002, Roy changed the original beneficiary with fifty-percent to Pamela and with the other fifty-percent to Volk Sand &amp; Gravel. Roy also included a \u201csecond beneficiary\u201d of \u201cEstate of Roy C. Volk.\u201d On August 22, 2002, Roy made a collateral assignment on the policy with Stockman Bank, \u201cup to $500,000\u201d which apparently, based upon the record, was valued at approximately $200,000 at the time of his death. During the dissolution, with the statutorily-mandated restraining order in place, Roy changed the beneficiary on this policy to his sister Valerie, as sole beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">\u00b629 Roy\u2019s beneficiary change resulted, upon his death, in the payment of this life insurance policy, less the Stockman Bank assignment, to his sister Valerie. If Roy had not changed the policy, his wife Pamela would have remained on the policy throughout the pendency of the divorce. As the District Court pointed out, upon finalizing the dissolution, Pamela would have been removed from the policy by operation of law pursuant to Montana\u2019s Uniform Probate Code, \u00a7 72-2-814(2)(a)(i), MCA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">(2) Except as to a retirement system established in Title 19 or as provided by the express terms of a governing instrument, a court order, or a contract relating to the division of the marital estate made between the divorced individuals before or after the marriage, divorce, or annulment, the divorce or annulment of a marriage:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-9\">(a) revokes any revocable:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-10\">(i) disposition or appointment of property made by <em>a </em>divorced individual to the individual\u2019s former spouse in a governing instrument and any disposition or appointment created by law or in a governing instrument to a relative of the divorced individual\u2019s former spouse;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">Under the statute \u201crevocable\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>\u201cRevocable,\u201d with respect to a disposition, appointment, provision, or nomination, means one under which the divorced individual, at the time of the divorce or annulment, was alone empowered, by law or under the governing instrument, to cancel the designation in favor of the individual\u2019s former spouse or former spouse\u2019s relative, whether or not the divorced individual was then empowered to designate the divorced individual in place of the individual\u2019s former spouse or in place of the former spouse\u2019s relative and whether or not the divorced individual then had the capacity to exercise the power.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Section 72-2-814(1)\u00a9, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The Official Comments to the statute provide further specificity regarding the types of revocable instruments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">The revisions expand the section to cover \u201cwill substitutes\u201d such as revocable inter-vivos trusts, life-insurance, and retirement-plan beneficiary designations, transfer-on-death accounts, and other revocable dispositions to the former spouse that the divorced individual established before the divorce (or annulment).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Tit. 72, Ch. 2, Mont. Code Ann., Annotations, Official Comments at 635 (2012) (see <em>also Thrivent Fin. v. Andronescu, </em>2013 MT 13, 368 Mont. 256, 300 P.3d 117).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">\u00b630 We determined in <em>Thrivent </em>that this revocation-upon-divorce statute operates at the time the \u201cgoverning instrument is given effect\u201d and the provision is to be treated as if the \u201cdivorced individual\u2019s former spouse (and relatives of the former spouse) disclaimed the revoked provisions[.]\u201d <em>Thrivent, </em>\u00b6 8. Or, more simply, when the divorce is final between the parties, any designation (such as a life insurance beneficiary) by the divorced individuals of their former spouse is automatically revoked upon divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">\u00b631 Turning to Roy\u2019s Policy 936, the effect of not removing Pamela as the beneficiary, or retaining the status quo, would have caused her share of the policy proceeds to pass to Roy\u2019s estate under \u00a7 72-2-814, MCA. Because Roy had no will, after the proceeds passed to the estate they subsequently would have passed to Roy\u2019s children in the probate by way of the intestacy statutes. Section 72-2-113, MCA. We note that in the MSA, the parties list Policy 936 as an asset. The MSA also indicates Roy\u2019s intent to name RBV as the beneficiary of his estate specifically indicating Roy will leave RBV all of his assets. The status quo prior to Roy\u2019s improper change \u2014 had the restraining order not been violated \u2014 would have accomplished that end.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">\u00b632 Here, Valerie argues the status quo was unaffected because the restraining order had already been lifted by the time Roy died, so there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>is no harm. The argument however, overlooks the statute\u2019s purpose to protect the status quo at the time the statutorily-mandated restraining order is entered. It is misdirected, in addition to being speculative, to say that Roy could or would have changed the beneficiary after the dissolution anyway, because the policy of the law is to preserve the status quo, protect the spouse and the children, and to promote an amicable settlement. In addition, the evidence indicated that Roy \u2014 not anticipating that he would die within months \u2014 did not have his affairs in order. Roy\u2019s disheveled affairs include failures to execute documents required in his parenting actions with both Pamela and his former partner, Serena. Ultimately, it is speculative of Valerie to argue that Roy would have changed the beneficiary to Valerie after the divorce \u2014 when it would have been legal to do so \u2014 particularly where both of his parenting agreements required him to ensure support for his children and he failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Roy\u2019s Failure to Disclose Policy 799 and Improper Change of Beneficiary</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u00b633 Roy purchased Policy 799 on February 14,2000, with a $924 down payment. Pamela Volk was the sole beneficiary from the inception of this policy until the couple\u2019s dissolution proceeding. During the dissolution, with the statutorily-mandated restraining order in place, Roy changed the beneficiary on this policy to his sister Valerie, as sole beneficiary. Pamela was never aware of the policy and he did not disclose the policy during the dissolution proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">\u00b634 In its determination regarding Policy 799, the District Court found that Roy failed to disclose the existence of the policy in the MSA, but determined this failure had no effect on the value of the marital estate because, as a term policy, it had no value until Roy died. The parties make numerous arguments regarding Roy\u2019s failure to disclose the policy. Pamela argues the District Court improperly relied on \u201cvalue\u201d in its equitable determination because she and Roy considered Roy\u2019s life insurance an asset. She argues that Roy violated Paragraph 20 of their MSA by not disclosing the policy, which is grounds for the court to award it to her, and that it should be placed in trust for RBV. Pamela claims that the failure to disclose the policy unfairly affected negotiations in the dissolution. Valerie argues that any failure to disclose property under \u00a7 40-4-253, MCA, provides only a presumption that the property can be awarded to the other party. She contends that the District Court properly exercised discretion in declining to re-open and change the settlement. Valerie also argues that the policy was never part of the estate, because the insurance passes outside the estate, and that resolution of the policy is solely a contract issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>\u00b635 The District Court concluded that Roy \u201clikely should have disclosed Policy 799 as an asset in the marital estate.\u201d The court noted that the restraining order statute, \u00a7 40-4-121, MCA, prohibiting beneficiary changes, bolsters this argument. The District Court found that the failure to disclose analysis is properly raised in a dissolution proceeding; nonetheless, the District Court possesses further authority under the contractual terms of the MSA to determine whether failure to disclose is grounds for award of the property or benefit to the other party. In the Order, the District Court determined that the policy had zero value at the time of the dissolution and, because there was no value in the policy, the court could not determine what impact disclosure might have had on the MSA. The court concluded, under this analysis, that any remedy would only be based on speculation of how proper disclosure may have changed the MSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\u00b636 However, we determine that whether the failure to disclose the policy is material to the settlement agreement is not the dispositive issue regarding Policy 799. The dispositive issue on Policy 799 is the improper change of beneficiary while the \u00a7 40-4-121(3), MCA, dissolution restraining order was in place. The point is not whether disclosure of the policy would have affected the parties\u2019 negotiations in the MSA; rather, the point is that had Roy not changed the beneficiary in violation of the restraining order, the status quo on the policy would have allowed the benefit to be passed to the existing beneficiary, Pamela, or \u2014 by operation of law \u2014 into Roy\u2019s estate under the same analysis as we have made in Policy 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">\u00b637 When Roy purchased these policies, and any time thereafter until he filed the dissolution, he was free to designate the beneficiary as he chose. When Roy filed the dissolution and the statutorily-mandated restraining order applied, Roy was no longer free to make those changes without the consent of the court and Pamela. Under \u00a7 40-4-12 l(3)(b), MCA, Roy was prohibited from changing his life insurance beneficiary during the marriage dissolution proceedings. When we made similar findings in <em>Briese, </em>we invalidated Briese\u2019s change of designation from his wife to his children, even though it did not affect the value or how the benefits were distributed, because \u00a7 40-4-121(3)(b), MCA, \u201cdoes not include any exceptions for changes to beneficiaries from spouse to protected child or vice versa <em>.\u2019\u2019Briese, </em>\u00b6 31. The statute operates the same in this case and there are clearly no exceptions in the statute allowing for a change of beneficiary from wife to sister or vice versa, or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\u00b638  In <em>Briese, </em>we determined that the courts possess \u201cequitable power to order a return to the status quo when a party violating a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>temporary restraining order has died.\u201d <em>Briese, </em>\u00b6 41. There is no dispute that Roy\u2019s changes of beneficiary were made while the statutorily-mandated restraining order was in place. Because Roy made improper changes to Policy 936 and Policy 799, those changes, in violation of the statute, are invalid and must be set aside. We conclude, as we did in <em>Briese, </em>that the District Court improperly interpreted the law regarding Roy\u2019s improper change of beneficiary. The statute supports a conclusion that transfers of property in violation of an injunction, like that in <em>Briese </em>and in this case, are invalid and should be set aside. Death of the restraining order violator does not prevent this Court from exercising that power. Accordingly, we conclude that Roy\u2019s improper changes to his beneficiary designations must be set aside and the designations returned to the status quo, as they were prior to the dissolution, in order to promote both the fairness and equity the statute is intended to provide and the agreements that Roy made to support his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Unjust Enrichment and Constructive Trust</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u00b639 Returning the parties to the status quo in this case would require return of the life insurance proceeds to the estate, a task that is complicated because the funds have been dispersed and invested in real property. Because Valerie received the proceeds under the express terms of the policies, the question arises whether she was unjustly enriched. If so, fashioning a remedy or return to the status quo by setting the judgment aside requires further action by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">\u00b640 Pamela brings her claim in this case, on behalf of RBV, under the theory of an alleged constructive trust. She argues that Valerie was unjustly enriched when she received the benefit of Roy\u2019s insurance policies, a result of the improper beneficiary changes. Pamela argues that the District Court erred in this case and abused its discretion when it determined that the restraining order violation had no actual effect on the beneficiary change and that the equities were not in favor of a constructive trust for RBV. Pamela argues that Roy\u2019s June 25, 2010 violation of the restraining order cannot be affirmed and excused by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">\u00b641 Valerie argues that the elements of unjust enrichment were not met and a constructive trust is improper in this case. Valerie contends that the violation of the restraining order is not relevant because after the dissolution, Roy could have changed the beneficiary to any person of his choice. Valerie also argues that the written agreements in the underlying divorce action, and life insurance contracts, control all of the issues in this case and that therefore, there is no equitable remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>because the issues are settled by contracts, where equity cannot apply.</p>\n<p id=\"AiX2\">\u00b642 In its Order, the District Court analyzed the three elements of unjust enrichment and sought to balance the equities. The District Court correctly concluded that the first two elements of unjust enrichment are met according to the facts of the case. First, a benefit was conferred on Valerie by her brother Roy when she received the life insurance proceeds as a result of the improper designation. Second, the facts demonstrate that Valerie, as the conferee, appreciated and possessed knowledge of the conferred benefit as she acknowledged receipt of both policies, and she acknowledged she used the money from her brother to set up a trust, TVG trust, to hold the funds and invest in real estate, specifically, the house where she resides. The central dispute in this case surrounds the third element, where the district court was required to weigh the facts and evidence to determine whether the retention of the benefit Valerie incurred created an inequitable and unjust result.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u00b643 In addressing this third element, the District Court weighed three separate arguments, and concluded: 1) Equity does not require voiding the beneficiary changes made by Roy in violation of the restraining order; 2) Roy\u2019s failure to execute a will and properly execute his part of the MSA does not support a finding that Valerie was unjustly enriched; and 3) the \u201cOctober Agreement\u201d between Pamela and Saraya had no bearing on Valerie\u2019s receipt of the insurance proceeds and does not bind Valerie to an unjust enrichment finding nor a constructive trust. After weighing the equities of these issues, the District Court refused to impose a constructive trust on the insurance proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\u00b644 This Court previously considered the law of unjust enrichment in the context of a constructive trust in <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe v. Roman Catholic Church, </em>2013 MT 24, 368 Mont. 330, 296 P.3d 450. There, we concluded a constructive trust, \u201cserves as a possible remedy to rectify the unjust enrichment of a party.\u201d <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">\u00b645  A constructive trust serves as a proper remedy to unjust enrichment. \u201cA constructive trust arises when a person holding title to property is subject to an equitable duty to convey it to another on the ground that the person holding title would be unjustly enriched if he were permitted to retain it.\u201d Section 72-38-123, MCA; (see <em>also N. Cheyenne Tribe, </em>\u00b6 30, <em>(citing In re Estate of McDermott, </em>2002 MT 164, \u00b6 25, 310 Mont. 435, 51 P.3d 486)) <em>{see generally </em>1 Dan B. Dobbs, <em>Dobbs Law of Remedies: Damages-Equity-Restitution </em>\u00a7 4.3(1), 587, \u00a7 4.3(2) (Pract. Treatise Series, 2d ed., West 1993)) [hereinafter <em>Law of </em>Remedies]. This Court has broad discretion afforded by the principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>of equity to impose a constructive trust despite lack of any wrongdoing by the person holding the property. <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe, </em>\u00b6 29, <em>(citing McDermott, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-26). The Court may simply declare a constructive trust to exist, \u201c[n]othing else is required.\u201d <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe, </em>\u00b6 32 <em>(citing Eckart v. Hubbard, </em>184 Mont. 320, 325, 602 P.2d 988, 991 (1979)). A claim for unjust enrichment, in the context of a constructive trust, requires proof of three elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-4\">(1) a benefit conferred upon a defendant by another; (2) an appreciation or knowledge of the benefit by the defendant; and (3) the acceptance or retention of the benefit by the defendant under such circumstances that would make it inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit without payment of its value.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-5\"><em>N. Cheyenne Tribe, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Unjust Enrichment</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">\u00b646 Here, Roy\u2019s actions set in motion the series of events changing the status quo in regard to his life insurance and the ultimate receipt of the benefit by his sister Valerie. Because this benefit went to Valerie, we apply the unjust enrichment factors to determine whether she was unjustly enriched. It is clear from the facts of the case that the first two elements of the test have been met: 1) a benefit has clearly been conferred upon Valerie through Roy\u2019s improper insurance beneficiary change; and 2) Valerie has knowledge of the benefit, acknowledging receipt of the funds and investing them in a home and real property.</p>\n<p id=\"A9_\">\u00b647 The third element of unjust enrichment and the circumstances created by Roy\u2019s actions during and after the dissolution proceeding require further analysis. Thus, we consider whether Valerie\u2019s acceptance and retention of the benefit from Roy, under these circumstances, makes it inequitable for Valerie to retain the benefit without payment of its value. The \u201ccircumstances\u201d in this case are a result of Roy\u2019s improper change of the beneficiary while the statutorily-mandated restraining order was in place. The final result of the circumstances is that Roy\u2019s estate is unable to pay claims to his children or provide for their future as was intended and promised under the MSA and the parenting agreement providing for Saraya. If Roy had not made this improper change, the circumstances would be much different. Pamela would have been removed as the beneficiary upon the dissolution of their marriage, and the life insurance proceeds, under \u00a7 72-2-814, MCA, would have diverted into the estate upon Roy\u2019s death, where it would have been distributed to Roy\u2019s children under the intestacy statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">\u00b648 While we did not consider unjust enrichment in the <em>Briese </em>case, we did conclude that the remedy for the improper beneficiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>designation was to set aside the change. Infiriese, even when the effect of changing the benefit did not alter the final beneficiary upon whom the benefit was bestowed, we set the change aside because violation of the statute invalidated Briese\u2019s change. Here, similarly, the violation requires the Court to set aside the improper change and restore the status quo. Because the improper change must be set aside, we view the subsequent circumstances created by the change \u2014 Valerie\u2019s receipt of the insurance proceeds \u2014 to be similarly improper because the benefits went to Valerie as a result of Roy\u2019s mistakes. Accordingly, we conclude that the third element of unjust enrichment has been met because Valerie is holding the life insurance proceeds, which she received as a result of Roy\u2019s improper change, \u201cunder such circumstances that in equity and good conscience [s]he ought not to retain it.\u201d <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Constructive Trust</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\u00b649 Because we conclude that Pamela, on REV\u2019S behalf, has established a claim showing that Valerie was unjustly enriched, we now consider the ramifications of the imposition of a constructive trust as a remedy for the unjust enrichment. \u201cA party\u2019s proof of unjust enrichment entitles it to restitution from the.other party \u2014 regardless of any wrongdoing on the part of the unjustly enriched party.\u201d <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe, </em>\u00b6 37 <em>(citing Lawrence v. Clepper, </em>263 Mont. 45, 53, 865 P.2d 1150, 1156 (1993)). As we stated in <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe, </em>\u201c[ujnjust enrichment serves as a unifying principle for a wide variety of equitable claims and... a court may order restitution to vindicate these types of equitable claims.\u201d <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe, </em>\u00b6 38, <em>(citing </em>Dobbs, <em>Law of Remedies </em>\u00a7 4.1(3), 564). The Court measures restitution for unjust enrichment \u201cby the defendant\u2019s gain.\u201dN. <em>Cheyenne Tribe, </em>\u00b6 38, <em>(citing </em>Dobbs, <em>Law of Remedies </em>\u00a7 4.1(1), 555). In the context of a constructive trust the plaintiff does not need to show deprivation of something to recover, \u201cit is sufficient that the defendant gained something that it should not be allowed to retain.\u201d <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe, </em>\u00b6 38 <em>(citing McDermott, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-26).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">\u00b650  \u201cA constructive trust arises when a person holding title to property is subject to an equitable duty to convey it to another on the ground that the person holding title would be unjustly enriched if he were permitted to retain it.\u201d <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe, </em>\u00b6 30 <em>(citing McDermott, </em>\u00b6 25 <em>(quoting </em>\u00a7 72-33-219, MCA)). In this instance, the elements of unjust enrichment have been met and we conclude that Valerie has been unjustly enriched. In turn, in order to work an equitable result, we find that though Valerie has done nothing wrong, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>she is holding title to property and subject to an equitable duty to convey it, or a portion thereof, to another on the ground that she would be unjustly enriched if she were permitted to retain it. <em>N. Cheyenne </em>Tribe, \u00b6 30. Accordingly, we determine that imposing a constructive trust on the proceeds of Roy\u2019s two life insurance policies, Policy 799 and Policy 936, in favor of RBV is the proper remedy in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">\u00b651 As we noted, a significant issue emerges from this determination because Valerie has accepted the life insurance proceeds and spent or invested them on real property. This is not a case where the asset or money is being held in trust while a determination is made. We recently reviewed a similar circumstance in <em>LeMond v. Yellowstone Dev., LLC, </em>2014 MT 181A, 375 Mont. 402, 336 P.3d 345, a case in which we imposed a constructive trust in LeMond\u2019s favor because he lost title to lands promised to him in business dealings with Yellowstone Development.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\u00b652 In <em>LeMond, </em>LeMond entered an agreement to trade his work promoting sales for Yellowstone Development for a particular land parcel owned by Yellowstone Development. Prior to completing the agreement, Yellowstone Development traded the promised parcel to a third party and it was unavailable to LeMond when he completed his part of the contract. LeMond asked for the traded parcels to replace the conveyed parcels as part of a constructive trust, and the District Court agreed. We concluded that, because the traded parcels had more acreage and likely a higher value, the District Court had to determine the extent of the remedy. LeMond was granted a constructive trust under an implied contract legal theory, unlike the unjust enrichment theory in this case. Nonetheless, the resulting constructive trusts are similar because LeMond, like RBV, did not have direct access to the property subject to the constructive trust; in other words, the property was not set aside awaiting the Court\u2019s determination. In <em>LeMond, </em>we remanded to the District Court for a determination of value regarding other lands owned by Yellowstone Development to replace the lost parcels. There, as here, the District Court needed to determine the proper amount of the constructive trust to make a determination \u201cif, in equity and conscience, it belongs to [the plaintiff].\u201d <em>LeMond, </em>\u00b6 51 (citation omitted). We explained that the \u201cequity of the transaction must shape the measure of relief.\u201d <em>LeMond, </em>\u00b6 52 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AQA\">\u00b653 A court sitting in equity is empowered to determine all questions involved in the case, and to fashion an equitable result that will accomplish complete justice. <em>Blaine Bank of Montana v. Haugen, </em>260 Mont. 29, 35, 858 P.2d 14, 18 (1993); <em>Kauffman-Harmon v. Kauffman, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>2001 MT 238, \u00b6 11, 307 Mont. 45, 36 P.3d 408. As in <em>LeMond, </em>the measure of relief must be shaped by the circumstances of the affected parties and the equity of the transaction. We conclude it is necessary to remand this matter to the District Court so that, acting in equity, it may fashion a result that will accomplish justice in light of the present circumstances of all affected parties. Among other matters, because we are directing that Roy\u2019s changes of beneficiary designations be set aside and the designations returned to the previous status quo, the court must take account of any claim that may be asserted by Volk Sand &amp; Gravel as co-beneficiary under Policy 936. The court may in addition consider any other factors it deems pertinent to its obligation to work an equitable result, and will be free to direct the nature and course of further proceedings on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Saraya Roberson and the \u201cOctober Agreement\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">\u00b654 Because we have determined that a constructive trust must be imposed on Roy\u2019s insurance proceeds we conclude that we do not need to reach the arguments made on cross-appeal by Saraya Roberson. Pamela agreed on RBV\u2019s behalf in her Amended Complaint of June 11, 2013, to pay Saraya\u2019s creditor\u2019s claim against Roy\u2019s estate if a constructive trust was created in favor of RBV. Thus, we determine that this issue is moot as it is properly resolved under the parties\u2019 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">\u00b655 We conclude that Valerie Goeser has been unjustly enriched because she has received a benefit that rightfully belongs to another. We make this determination in equity and conclude that Roy Volk\u2019s errors in changing the beneficiary of his life insurance under the statutorily-mandated restraining order invalidates his designations on Policy 799 and Policy 936. We hold that a constructive trust was created on RBV\u2019s behalf as a result of these errors, and that Valerie Goeser must return the insurance proceeds or that portion of the proceeds by which she \u201cwould be unjustly enriched if [she] were permitted to retain [them].\u201d Section 72-38-123, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">\u00b656 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b432-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER and BAKER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b432-11\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"AqY\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">\u00b657 I concur with the Court\u2019s decision to reverse and remand for further proceedings. I would add the observation that the Court has not ordered that all of the contested life insurance proceeds must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>necessarily be placed in trust for RBV. Rather, on remand, the District Court will need to design equitable relief based upon all of the circumstances of the affected parties. These factors could include the funds currently held for RBVs benefit; the reasonable future needs of RBV; the fact that, by agreement, Saraya\u2019s creditor\u2019s claim would be paid from the proceeds of the constructive trust; Valerie\u2019s financial situation, including any indebtedness she incurred or other disadvantage she assumed by virtue of receiving the insurance proceeds, and the costs of the disgorgement process; any claim asserted by Volk Sand &amp; Gravel as co-beneficiary under Policy 936 as a result of our decision setting aside Roy\u2019s final changes of beneficiary designations; and any other factor that the District Court would deem appropriate to consider in working an equitable result in this matter.</p>\n<judges id=\"b433-5\">JUSTICE BAKER joins in the concurring Opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b433-6\">JUSTICE SHEA,</author>\n<p id=\"AQD\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">\u00b658 I concur with the Court\u2019s analysis in this case and its ultimate conclusion that Valerie was unjustly enriched and a constructive trust should be imposed. I submit, however, that although the District Court should properly be afforded the discretion to fashion an equitable resolution of this issue on remand, we can provide more precise guidance as to what the equitable objective should be.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">\u00b659 There is no dispute that Roy violated the District Court\u2019s restraining order when he changed the beneficiary of both life insurance policies to name Valerie as the sole beneficiary. There is likewise no dispute that Valerie was not otherwise entitled to any of the life insurance proceeds and, but for Roy\u2019s violation of the restraining order, she would not have received any of the proceeds. We also know the precise amount, down to the penny, of the money that Valerie received and to which she was not entitled: $2,306,103.13. So when we conclude \u201cthat Valerie Goeser must return the insurance proceeds or that portion of the proceeds by which she \u2018would be unjustly enriched if she were permitted to retain [them],\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 55,1 have to ask: What do we mean by \u201cportion\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">\u00b660 Having determined that Valerie was not entitled to the life insurance proceeds, I would conclude that the portion of the proceeds by which Valerie would be unjustly enriched if she were entitled to retain it is anything above $0. That being noted, I recognize the Court\u2019s concern that there is a significant issue in the imposition of the constructive trust because Valerie has spent or invested the life insurance proceeds on real property in California. Opinion, \u00b6 51. It seems to me, however, that the primary significance of this issue is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>that it will likely require Valerie to sell the property if she is otherwise unable to pay the $2,306,103.13 that should have gone to Roy\u2019s estate. While requiring Valerie to sell her home is indeed significant, it is certainly no more significant of an issue than ensuring that Roy\u2019s estate is able to pay claims to Roy\u2019s children and provide for their future as was intended and promised under the MSA and the parenting agreement providing for Saraya.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\u00b661 I agree that achieving an equitable result in this case will require the resolution of certain issues that are best left to the District Court on remand. For example, fluctuating real estate market values may affect Valerie\u2019s ability to recoup and disgorge the full amount of the proceeds. A court sitting in equity is empowered to determine all questions involved in the case, and to fashion an equitable result that will accomplish complete justice. <em>Kauffman-Harmon, </em>\u00b6 11. While the nuances of fashioning that equitable result are properly within the purview of the District Court on remand, I believe the facts of this case enable us to hold on appeal that the objective should be the recoupment, to the fullest extent possible, of the entire life insurance proceeds. I would so instruct the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b434-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH joins the concurrence.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b434-7\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"AJu\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">\u00b662 I disagree with the Court\u2019s decision on multiple grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">\u00b663 Preliminarily, the Court has not accorded proper deference to a trial court\u2019s decision in matters of equity where there is no dispute of fact and the trial court has correctly applied the law. Although the District Court\u2019s decision was rendered pursuant to summary judgment in a case of equity, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3-2-204, MCA, the decision of whether a constructive trust should be created; what, if anything, should be done for violation of an economic restraining order in a dissolution proceeding; and the remedy for failing to disclose a marital asset are all firmly committed to the discretion of the trial court for which an abuse of discretion must be found. Here, there were no disputed facts and the law \u2014 specifically \u00a7 40-4-252(4), MCA, and <em>Briese, </em>\u00b6 39 \u2014 allowed the trial court discretion in fashioning an appropriate remedy. In <em>Briese, </em>we specifically rejected a per se rule that automatically voids changes made in violation of an economic restraining order, holding that equitable principles should govern rather than a bright-line rule that beneficiary changes, as a matter of law, are void. <em>Briese, </em>\u00b6 40 (\u201cOther courts, while holding that the violation does not serve to <em>automatically </em>void the beneficiary change, generally have found that courts have the authority to grant some form of relief through use of their powers of equity.\u201d). Pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>202, MCA, a district court has broad discretion to distribute a marital estate equitably according to the circumstances of the case and, absent clearly erroneous findings, \u201cwe will affirm a trial court\u2019s property distribution unless the court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Marriage of Gebhart, </em>2003 MT 292, \u00b6 16, 318 Mont. 94, 78 P.3d 1219. In my view, we have failed to account for the discretion of the trial court in our standard of review. The District Court presided over the dissolution, the probate, and claims of unjust enrichment and creation of a constructive trust. I would accord the trial court considerable latitude and discretion in applying and formulating an equitable remedy, and the trial court\u2019s decision should not be overturned in the absence of an abuse of discretion. <em>See Rawlings v. Rawlings, </em>2010 UT 52, \u00b6 21, 240 P.3d 754 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\u00b664 The decision reached by the Court reforms the Marital Settlement Agreement, ignores the Final Parenting Plan, and invalidates life insurance contracts. The principal issue before the Court is whether a constructive trust should be imposed on $2,306,103.13 for the benefit of RBV, because V alerie was unjustly enriched when she received Roy\u2019s life insurance proceeds due to the fact that: (1) Roy violated the TRO by changing beneficiaries of two life insurance policies; (2) Roy failed to execute a will giving all of his assets to RBV; and, alternatively, (3) Roy failed to disclose Policy 799 as an asset during their divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\u00b665 It is undisputed that Roy violated the economic TRO by changing his beneficiary designations in two term life insurance policies during the pendency of his dissolution proceeding and while the economic TRO was in effect. The issue, however, is whether Valerie \u2014 who was not a party to the dissolution proceeding \u2014 has been unjustly enriched. It is the third element of the test for unjust enrichment set forth in <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe </em>which is at issue in these proceedings: whether \u201cthe acceptance or retention by the conferee of the benefit under such circumstances as to make it inequitable for the conferee to retain the benefit without payment of its value.\u201d <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe, </em>\u00b6 36. The imposition of a constructive trust serves as a possible remedy to rectify the unjust enrichment of a party. Accordingly, it must be <em>inequitable </em>for Valerie to retain the benefit of Roy\u2019s life insurance proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">\u00b666 In Briese, the husband died while the divorce was pending and the economic TRO was in effect. We stated in <em>Briese </em>that the purpose of an economic restraining order in a dissolution proceeding is to \u201cmaintain the status quo\u201d of the parties \u201cso long as a dissolution action is pending.\u201d <em>Briese, </em>\u00b6 25. An economic restraining order \u201cmitigates the potential harm to spouses and children caused by the dissolution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>process itself and ensures that reasonable provision is made for the spouse and children during the litigation.\u201d <em>Briese, </em>\u00b6 25. In fashioning an appropriate equitable remedy for a violation, a trial court must be cognizant of these principles and considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\u00b667 We revisited the issue in <em>In re Estate of Corrigan, </em>2014 MT 337, 337 Mont. 364, 341 P.3d 623, when the husband died prior to the dismissal of the dissolution proceeding. We held that the husband\u2019s failure to serve his wife with the dissolution petition and accompanying economic TRO within the three-year deadline for service of pleadings set forth in M. R. Civ. P. 4(t)(l) rendered the economic TRO ineffective after the three-year deadline lapsed. <em>In re Estate of Corrigan, </em>\u00b6 21. Because the TRO was no longer effective, we refused to void the husband\u2019s change in beneficiary designation to his adult children from his wife, finding <em>Briese </em>distinguishable because it involved \u201can active and ongoing divorce proceeding.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Corrigan, </em>\u00b6 21. We explained that \u201cin <em>Briese </em>we declined to adopt a rule that would automatically void any change of beneficiary made by a decedent in violation of a divorce TRO. Rather, we gave the district court the discretionary authority to void such a change if equitable principles demanded it.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Corrigan, </em>\u00b6 20 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"A_S\">\u00b668 Here, Roy\u2019s death occurred after the divorce was finalized and the economic TRO had been dissolved. Once the TRO was dissolved, the District Court recognized that Roy would have been free to change his beneficiaries at any time. Pursuant to \u00a7 72-2-814 (2)(a)(i), MCA, Pamela, as an ex-spouse, would have been removed as a beneficiary of any of Roy\u2019s life insurance policies as a matter of law. Therefore, while a change of beneficiary may have been voidable up until the dissolution was final, upon the economic TRO being dissolved there were no restraints on Roy\u2019s ability to change the beneficiary. The District Court properly factored these considerations into its decision to deny Pamela equitable relief, finding that Roy\u2019s change of beneficiary was evidence of his intent to make Valerie the beneficiary of his life insurance. Contrary to the Court\u2019s conclusion, the fact that Roy actually did change his beneficiary requires no speculation about Roy\u2019s intent and that he would have effectuated that intent subsequently through executing a valid change of beneficiary. The District Court, unlike this Court, refused to speculate that Roy would not have followed through with a change when it concluded that Roy obviously intended Valerie to be the beneficiary having made no further changes after dissolution or the lifting of the economic TRO. The District Court observed that Valerie was not a party to the dissolution proceeding and, therefore, it was not \u201cinequitable\u201d for her to receive the proceeds which Roy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>obviously intended her to have and which had been memorialized in an insurance contract. This Court has not found the District Court\u2019s refusal to speculate or its findings regarding Roy\u2019s actions clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\u00b669 Unjust enrichment is \u201cthe receipt of a benefit whose retention without payment would result in the unjust enrichment of the defendant at the expense of the claimant.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment \u00a7 1 cmt. a (2011); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 72-38-123, MCA. We relied upon 66 American Jurisprudence <em>2d Restitution and Implied Contracts </em>\u00a7 11 (1973) in <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe </em>to establish the elements of unjust enrichment. <em>N. Cheyenne Tribe, </em>\u00b6 39. \u201cThe doctrine of unjust enrichment or recovery in quasi contract applies to situations where <em>there is no legal contract </em>but where the person sought to be charged is in possession of money or property which in good conscience and justice he should not retain but should deliver to another.\u201d 66 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Restitution and Implied Contracts </em>\u00a7 11 (emphasis added). Thus, to permit recovery on a theory of quasi contract where a written agreement <em>exists </em>would constitute a reformation of the contract and subversion of principles of law relating to contracts. A life insurance policy is issued pursuant to a contract. Moreover, \u201c[a] life insurance policy owner, like a testator, may alter or revoke designations at any time until death; thus, either instrument \u2014 whether will or insurance policy \u2014 must be interpreted and applied at death in order to effectuate the transferor\u2019s final intent.\u201d <em>Thrivent Fin. For Lutherans v. Andronescu, </em>2013 MT 13, \u00b6 7, 368 Mont. 256, 300 P.3d 117. The District Court determined that Valerie had not been unjustly enriched when she received proceeds pursuant to a valid insurance contract. The District Court did not make an incorrect conclusion of law or clearly erroneous factual finding in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\u00b670 The MSA, by its plain terms, provides that Roy was to execute a will making his son the beneficiary of his estate, not his life insurance. Life insurance proceeds are non-testamentary in nature and pass outside of the estate in accordance with the wishes of the insured. Section 72-6-111, MCA. Neither the MSA nor the Parenting Plan include any provision that states either party agreed to procure or maintain a life insurance policy for the benefit of anyone. Although it is common for marital settlement agreements or parenting plans to contain agreements requiring the procurement and maintenance of a life insurance policy with minor children, as an aspect of child support, designated as beneficiaries, neither the MSA nor Parenting Plan here mention anything about life insurance. In fact, although Pamela was aware of at least one of Roy\u2019s life insurance policies she chose not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>pursue Roy\u2019s life insurance in the MSA. The District Court recognized that although Roy was required to make a will naming RBV as the beneficiary of his estate, Roy failed to do so prior to his untimely death. The District Court attempted to ascertain the intent of the parties when entering into the MSA and determined that it was not the parties\u2019 intention to include Roy\u2019s insurance policies in the MSA or the Parenting Plan. Given the provisions of \u00a7 72-6-111, MCA, and that the policy that was disclosed was given to Roy in the MSA, I agree with the District Court that Roy\u2019s failure to make a will does not support a finding that Valerie has been unjustly enriched. The Court thus incorrectly concludes that Valerie was unjustly enriched because \u201cRoy\u2019s estate is unable to pay claims to his children or provide for their future as was intended and promised under the MSA and the parenting agreement providing for Saraya.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 47. Such a conclusion confuses principles of contract, the District Court\u2019s findings of fact, and relevant statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b671 As the Court appears to restrict its analysis only to Roy\u2019s violation of the economic TRO, I will not address whether a term life insurance policy is an \u201casset\u201d with a cash value and whether it was required to be disclosed or whether it would have been significant to the parties in negotiating their marital property settlement. I would affirm the District Court\u2019s decision by applying a correct standard of review and the principle that the District Court be afforded latitude in fashioning an appropriate equitable remedy for violation of one of its orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\u00b672 I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
