Shelhamer appeals the order of the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, which affirmed the order of the Department of Public Health and Human Services, Child Support Enforcement Division (CSED). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">\n<em>Whether a parent\u2019s military housing and subsistence allowances should be included as part of the parent\u2019s actual income when calculating child support obligations.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">\u00b63 Shelhamer and Tamara Hodges are the natural parents of A.S. In October 1999, CSED entered an order requiring Shelhamer to pay Hodges $74 per month in child support. The order remained in effect without modification until Hodges filed a request for review nearly fifteen years later, on May 1, 2014. On May 12, 2014, CSED issued a modification notice and order establishing Shelhamer\u2019s monthly support obligation at $743 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">\u00b64 Shelhamer requested an administrative hearing, which was held on July 23, 2014. Shelhamer is a Warrant Officer in the United States Marine Corps, with a base pay of $53,309 per year. Shelhamer also receives a non-taxable basic housing allowance (BAH) of $25,776 per year and a non-taxable basic subsistence allowance (BAS) of $2,955 per year. At the hearing, the Administrative Law Judge combined Shelhamer\u2019s base pay with his BAH and BAS, and attributed to him a total annual income of $82,040. Hodges was attributed a total annual income of $24,960. On August 19, 2014, CSED issued its final administrative order, setting Shelhamer\u2019s support obligation at $935 per month, beginning June 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">\u00b65 Shelhamer petitioned for judicial review of CSED\u2019s final decision. Shelhamer objected to CSED\u2019s inclusion of his BAH and BAS in his income, arguing that these allowances defray the cost of food and housing. CSED responded, and the matter was fully briefed in the District Court. On May 12, 2015, the District Court affirmed the final decision of CSED setting Shelhamer\u2019s child support obligation at $935 per month. Shelhamer appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-13\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b210-14\">\u00b66 In contested cases, district courts review administrative decisions to determine whether the agency interpreted the law correctly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>whether the findings of fact were clearly erroneous. <em>Arlington v. Miller\u2019s Trucking, Inc., </em>2015 MT 68, \u00b6 10, 378 Mont. 324, 343 P.3d 1222. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the court misapprehended the effect of evidence, or if this Court\u2019s review of the record convinces us a mistake has been made. <em>Arlington, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">\u00b67 \u201cThis Court employs these same standards when reviewing a district court\u2019s order affirming or reversing the agency\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Knowles v. State ex rel. Lindeen, </em>2009 MT 415, \u00b6 23, 353 Mont. 507, 222 P.3d 595. However, an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own rule \u201cshould be afforded great weight, and the court should defer to that interpretation unless it is plainly inconsistent with the spirit of the rule. The agency\u2019s interpretation of the rule will be sustained so long as it lies within the range of reasonable interpretation permitted by the wording.\u201d <em>Knowles, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\u00b68 <em>Whether a parent\u2019s military housing and subsistence allowances should be included as part of the parent\u2019s actual income when calculating child support obligations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">\u00b69 CSED is required to adopt uniform child support guidelines to determine minimum child support amounts. Section 40-5-209(1), MCA. The guidelines are used to establish \u201ca standard to be used by the district courts, child support enforcement agencies, attorneys and parents in determining child support obligations.\u201d Admin. R. M. 37.62.101(1) (1998). The underlying principle and stated purpose of the guidelines is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-9\">These guidelines are based on the principle that it is the first priority of parents to meet the needs of the child according to the financial ability of the parents. ... [A] child\u2019s standard of living should not, to the degree possible, be adversely affected because a child\u2019s parents are not living in the same household.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Admin. R. M. 37.62.101(2) (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">\u00b610 At issue in this appeal is the definition of \u201cactual income\u201d attributable to a parent when calculating a child support obligation. \u201cActual income\u201d is broadly defined by Admin. R. M. 37.62.105 (2012), and, among other things, includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-12\">(a) <em>economic benefit from whatever source derived ... </em>and includes but is not limited to income from salaries, wages, tips, commissions, bonuses, earnings, profits, dividends ... earned income credit and <em>all other government payments and benefits.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>(e) <em>allowances for expenses, flat rate payments or per diem received, except as offset by actual expenses. </em>Actual expenses may be considered only to the extent a party can produce receipts or other acceptable documentation. Reimbursement of actual employment expenses may not be considered income for purposes of these rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Admin. R. M. 37.62.105(2)(a), (e) (2012) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\u00b611 The District Court affirmed CSED\u2019s holding that Shelhamer\u2019s BAH and BAS should be included in his actual income as an \u201ceconomic benefit,\u201d noting that \u201cthe allowances are substantial, and they are available to be utilized without restriction.\u201d The District Court cited <em>In re Marriage of Stokes, </em>228 P.3d 701 (Or. Ct. App. 2010), in which the Oregon Court of Appeals held that both BAH and BAS should be included in a parent\u2019s \u201cincome from any source\u201d when calculating a parent\u2019s child support obligations. <em>Stokes, </em>228 P.3d at 705. The District Court also noted that, when calculating child support obligations, all parents are credited with a personal allowance in order to address their housing and food costs. \u201cPersonal allowance is an amount which reflects 1.3 multiplied by the federal poverty guideline for a one-person household. ... Personal allowance is a contribution toward, but is not intended to meet the subsistence needs of parents.\u201d Admin. R. M. 37.62.114(1) (2012). Both Shelhamer and Hodges were allowed a personal allowance of $15,171. This amount was therefore subtracted from Shelhamer\u2019s actual income calculation when determining his child support obligation. The District Court agreed with CSED\u2019s argument that, if Shelhamer were allowed to receive the benefit of the personal allowance in addition to having his BAH and BAS excluded from his actual income calculation, he would in effect be receiving a double benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">\u00b6 12 Shelhamer\u2019s BAH and BAS are allowances provided by the Marine Corps in addition to his base pay. BAH is based on a service member\u2019s pay grade, the dependency status of the member, and the geographic location of the member. 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 403(a)(1) (2012). BAS is based on a member\u2019s BAS from the preceding year and the cost of a \u201cliberal food plan for a male in the United States.\u201d 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(b)(1)(A), (B) (2012). The payments are intended to assist with a service member\u2019s housing and food expenses; however, there are no requirements for how the money is spent, no accounting of any expenditures is required, and the payments are made with each paycheck.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">\u00b613 Shelhamer argues in this appeal that he provided acceptable documentation that his BAH and BAS are \u201coffset by actual expenses\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>of his housing and food costs, and therefore the payments cannot be included in his actual income under Admin R. M. 37.62.105(2)(e) (2012). We disagree. Read in the proper context of the entire rule, the \u201cactual expenses\u201d that offset the inclusion of such an allowance or per diem into actual income are additional expenses incurred because of the parent\u2019s work, not the regular mortgage or rent payments and grocery bills that would otherwise have to be paid from any parent\u2019s regular source of income. This is evident from the remainder of the section which provides that \u201c[r]eimbursement of <em>actual employment expenses </em>may not be considered income for purposes of these rules.\u201d Admin R. M. 37.62.105(2)(e) (2012) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ahp\">\u00b614 The infirmity of Shelhamer\u2019s argument is further illustrated when considering other items that the rule <em>does </em>include as actual income. Specifically, Admin R. M. 37.62.105(2)(c) (2012), considers actual income to include \u201cthe value of noncash benefits, including... housing, ... food, utilities, etc.\u201d Thus, if we were to accept Shelhamer\u2019s interpretation of the rule, it would lead to the paradoxical conclusion that the cash value of employer-provided housing and food is considered income, but the actual cash to pay for housing and food is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\u00b615  Shelhamer further asserts that the District Court erroneously relied on the personal allowance as justification for including the BAH and BAS in his income. We disagree. The personal allowance recognizes the cost that a parent incurs to care for his or her own needs. It was not error for the District Court to note that all parents are allowed a personal allowance for such expenses under Admin. R. M. 37.62.114(1) (2012), but not all parents receive extra funds from their employers to be used as they choose.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u00b616 Finally, Shelhamer argues the District Court improperly relied on <em>Stokes, </em>arguing that Oregon law does not contain the same exemption for expense payments offset by actual expenses found in Admin R. M. 37.62.105(2)(e) (2012). While the Oregon court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Stokes </em>is merely persuasive authority, we note the spirit of Oregon\u2019s child support guidelines mirrors our own. The Oregon court noted in <em>Stokes </em>that the Oregon child support guidelines \u201cmust ensure that the child benefits from the income \u2018of both parents to the same extent that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>child would have benefited had the family unit remained intact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stokes, </em>228 P.3d at 705 (citing Or. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 25.275(2)(a) (2015)). Compare Montana\u2019s guidelines which provide: \u201c[A] child\u2019s standard of living should not, to the degree possible, be adversely affected because a child\u2019s parents are not living in the same household.\u201d Admin. R. M. 37.62.101(2X1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\u00b617  Shelhamer\u2019s BAH and BAS contribute a significant amount of income towards his ability to provide for his own needs as well as the needs of A.S. CSED\u2019s interpretation of Admin R. M. 37.62.105(2)(e) (2012) is reasonable and well within the language and the spirit of the rule. The District Court correctly affirmed CSED\u2019s order which included Shelhamer\u2019s BAH and BAS in his actual income to calculate his child support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\u00b618 The District Court\u2019s affirmation of the final decision of CSED \u2014 which included Shelhamer\u2019s BAH and BAS in his actual income to calculate his child support obligation \u2014 was correct. Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b214-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-6\"> It bears noting that the military similarly distinguishes BAH and BAS from per diem travel payments and allowances. Military members are \u201cprovided transportation-, lodging-, or meals-in-kind, or <em>actual and necessary expenses of travel and transportation, </em>for, or in connection with, official travel...\u201d 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 452(a) (2012) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
