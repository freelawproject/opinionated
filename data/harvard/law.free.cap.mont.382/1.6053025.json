We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-9\">\n<em>Whether the Water Court erred in determining that off-stream water storage in the Eureka Reservoir was included as part of Teton Canal\u2019s April 18, 1890 Notice of Appropriation.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b24-12\">\u00b62 We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-13\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b24-14\">\u00b63 Teton Canal was formed in 1903 for the purpose of appropriating, transporting, storing, and using water for irrigation in Teton County. It and Teton Reservoir are among several water supply entities that distribute water to shareholders from the Teton River northwest of Choteau, Montana. Numerous other water users also divert water from this stretch of the Teton River. Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors in interest filed a number of notices of appropriation for water right claims on the Teton River, including an April 18,1890 Notice of Appropriation (1890 Notice) and an April 29, 1891 Notice of Appropriation (1891 Notice). The Notice of Appropriation under which Teton Canal claims its priority date for the Eureka Reservoir is the 1890 Notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-15\">\u00b64 In the 1890 Notice, Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors claimed 3,000 inches of Teton River water for the \u201cspecial purpose\u201d of \u201cgathering said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>water in a reservoir and using it to irrigate adjacent lands in Township number 25 North of Range 4 and 5 west.\u201d The 1890 Notice describes the point of diversion as <em>\u201ca </em>point upon [the Teton River\u2019s] north bank six hundred sixty five feet from the [southeast] corner of the [southwest quarter] of Section thirty[-]one (31) Township Twenty[-]five (25) North of Range five (5) West....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">\u00b65 In the 1891 Notice, Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors claimed 10,000 inches of Teton River water for \u201cirrigating, reservoirs, and other purposes.\u201d The 1891 Notice describes the point of diversion as beginning \u201cupon [the Teton River\u2019s] north bank about 1015 feet south 34\u00b0 west from the [northwest] corner of Section (36) Thirty[-]six T[ownship] 25 North, R[ange] 6 West....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">\u00b66 After filing the 1890 Notice, Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors immediately began constructing the Glendora Canal. They eventually formed the Eureka Reservoir Canal and Irrigation Company (Eureka Company). In 1892, the Eureka Company filed an application and plat map with the U.S. General Land Office (GLO) for its water supply and distribution system. The GLO approved the application and plat map in September 1892. The 1892 plat map both depicts the irrigation system the Eureka Company intended to develop and provides legal descriptions for the canals the company had developed by 1892.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b26-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>\u00b67 On the 1892 plat map, the Eureka Company\u2019s engineer attested that the Glendora Canal had been built under his supervision. The plat map described the Glendora Canal as \u201cbeginning at a point on the north bank of the Teton River... from which the quarter Section corner on the south side of Sec[tion] 31, T[ownship] 25 N[orth], R[ange] 5 W[est] bears N[orth] 47\u00b0 25\u2019 W[est] 698 feet distant....\u201d The Glendora Canal\u2019s diversion point depicted and described on the 1892 plat map corresponds to the diversion point described in the 1890 Notice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The 1892 plat map depicts the Glendora Canal running to the Glendora Reservoir.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">\u00b68 The Eureka Company\u2019s engineer similarly attested on the 1892 plat map that Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors constructed the Eureka Canal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> under his supervision. The plat map describes the Eureka Canal as \u201cbeginning at a point on the north bank of the Teton River in the Northeast quarter (N.E. Vi) of Section 35, T[ownship] 25 N[orth], R[ange] 6 W[est] ... from which the Northeast corner of Sec[tion] 36, T[ownship] 25 N[orth], R[ange] 6 W[est] bears N[orth] 85\u00b0 58\u2019 E[ast] 6641 feet distant....\u201d The Eureka Canal\u2019s diversion point depicted and described on the 1892 plat map corresponds to the diversion point described in the 1891 Notice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The 1892 plat map both describes and depicts the Eureka Canal\u2019s diversion point approximately two miles upstream from the Glendora Canal\u2019s diversion point.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">\u00b69 In 1893, the Eureka Company sold its assets, including its water rights, to the Montana Land and Water Company, which in turn transferred all of its assets to Russell Shepherd in 1902. Shepherd later was named as a defendant in a district court case adjudicating water rights on the Teton River. <em>Perry v. Beattie, </em>Cause No. 371 (Mont. 11th Judicial Dist., March 28, 1908). In his answer to the complaint, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Shepherd asserted water rights based on three notices of appropriation \u2014 including both the 1890 Notice and the 1891 Notice. During the <em>Perry </em>litigation, Shepherd transferred his interest in the irrigation assets, including the water rights, to Teton Canal. In 1908, the <em>Perry </em>court decreed that Teton Canal \u201cis entitled to the use of three thousand inches of the waters of said Teton River of date April 18th, 1890.\u201d It is undisputed that Teton Canal\u2019s claims under the 1891 Notice did not survive the <em>Perry </em>decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">\u00b610 The 1892 plat map depicts the Eureka Canal running to the Eureka Reservoir in Section 31, Township 25 North, Range 6 West. In 1909 and again in 1926, GLO representatives investigated the Eureka Reservoir site. Although the representative who inspected the Eureka Reservoir site in 1909 recommended \u201cfinal approval of this reservoir site,\u201d by 1926 another GLO inspector reported that \u201cno reservoir has been built where it was intended to construct the Eureka reservoir....\u201d The inspector recommended that Teton Canal should \u201cstate what their intentions are as to the Eureka site,\u201d and suggested that the GLO \u201ccall on [Teton Canal] to file proof of ownership, and proof of construction\u201d of the Eureka Reservoir. The inspector further reported that Teton Canal\u2019s Secretary \u201cexpressed the opinion that [Teton Canal] was interested in the Eureka site and probably would use it later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">\u00b611 Teton Canal demonstrated its interest in developing the Eureka Reservoir site at various stockholder and director meetings in the early 1920s. Based on these discussions, Teton Canal filed a notice of appropriation with a priority date of October 11,1921, (1921 Notice) for 100 cubic feet per second (cfs) of the flood waters of the Teton River. The 1921 Notice\u2019s stated purpose was \u201cfor storing water in [a] reservoir located in Sections] 36-25 T[ownship] 25 N[orth] R[ange] 6 W[est], and Sec[tion] 31 T[ownship] 25 N[orth] R[ange] 5 W[est].\u201d This description corresponds with the Eureka Reservoir\u2019s current location and its location depicted on the 1892 plat map. The 1921 Notice also described the point of diversion as \u201cupon [the Teton River\u2019s] north bank... in the Northeast <em>Vi </em>of the Northeast <em>Vi </em>of Section 35 T[ownship] 25 N[orth] R[ange] 6 W[est].\u201d The diversion point described in the 1921 Notice corresponds with the diversion point described in the 1891 Notice and the Eureka Canal\u2019s diversion point described and depicted on the 1892 plat map.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">\u00b612 After filing the 1921 Notice, Teton Canal\u2019s stockholders rejected a proposal to create an irrigation district to finance the Eureka Reservoir\u2019s development. Following the 1926 GLO inspection, minutes of the December 16,1926 Board of Directors meeting indicate that the board directed Teton Canal\u2019s officers to obtain further information as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>to the company\u2019s right in the reservoir site and to \u201cfind out and do what is necessary to hold the right.\u201d It appears that Teton Canal\u2019s stockholders did not again discuss developing the Eureka Reservoir site until January 1934. In September 1936, the stockholders eventually approved \u201cputting $400 per share\u201d toward developing a reservoir. The stockholders voted to apply to the State Water Conservation Board for a loan \u201cof $25,000 for building [a] Reservoir,\u201d and to turn over the reservoir site to the Water Conservation Board.</p>\n<p id=\"AQl\">\u00b613 The Water Conservation Board filed a declaration of intention to store, control, and divert water on December 3, 1936 (1936 Declaration). Under the 1936 Declaration, the Water Conservation Board claimed the unappropriated waters of the Teton River by \u201cmeans of the \u2018Teton Cooperative Canal Company Project.\u2019 \u201d The 1936 Declaration stated, \u201cSaid waters will be appropriated by means of a diversion ditch, dam and storage reservoir.\u201d It described the point of diversion as a \u201cditch located in [the southeast quarter] of Section 35, Township 25 north of range 5 West.\u201d In January 1982, Teton Canal\u2019s President signed an affidavit stating that the diversion point\u2019s legal description in the 1936 Declaration was a misprint and that the actual diversion point was located in the northeast quarter of the northeast quarter of the northeast quarter of Section 35, Township 25 North, Range 6 West. This point corresponds to the Eureka Canal\u2019s diversion point as described on the 1892 plat map, the 1891 Notice, and the 1921 Notice. The 1936 Declaration further described the dam and reservoir as being \u201clocated in Section 25, township 25 north, range 6 west.\u201d This location corresponds to the Eureka Reservoir\u2019s current location and to its general depiction on the 1892 plat map.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">\u00b614 Teton Canal and the Water Conservation Board jointly constructed the Eureka Reservoir from 1936 to 1937. In November 1946, the Water Conservation Board turned over ownership of the Eureka Reservoir to Teton Canal. The Eureka Reservoir originally had a storage capacity of 4,000 acre feet. In 1947 and 1957, the dam was expanded to increase the Eureka Reservoir\u2019s storage capacity to its current 5,500 acre feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\u00b615 When Teton Canal filed its statement of claim for existing water rights in 1982 as required by the Montana Water Use Act of 1973, it claimed the following distinct water rights: two claims (irrigation and stock) under the decreed 1890 Notice at a flow rate of 75 cfs; two claims (irrigation and stock) under the filed 1921 Notice at a flow rate of 100 cfs; and two claims (irrigation and stock) under the filed 1936 Declaration for unappropriated water. All six claims appeared in the Temporary Preliminary Decree for the Teton River Basin with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>same priority date (April 18, 1890), source, period of diversion, period of use, point of diversion (the Eureka Canal), and place of use.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Teton Reservoir and the Lower Teton Joint Objectors objected to all six claims. Farmers Cooperative Canal Company (Farmers Canal) filed and subsequently withdrew its objections to Teton Canal\u2019s three irrigation claims. The Water Master consolidated all of the parties\u2019 objections in August 2008. The Lower Teton Joint Objectors reached a settlement agreement with Teton Canal and accordingly withdrew their objections. Teton Reservoir was therefore the single remaining objector. The Water Master held a hearing on October 1 and 2, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap2\">\u00b616 Under Rule 53(e)(1), M. R. Civ. P., and Rule 23, W. R. Adj. R., the master is to \u201cprepare a report upon the matters submitted to the master by the order of reference.\u201d The presiding Water Master was appointed as an Associate Water Judge for the Water Court in September 2013; therefore, the Associat\u00e9 Water Judge proceeded to issue a Water Court order rather than a water master\u2019s report. The Water Court issued its order adjudicating Teton Canal\u2019s claims on February 3, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">\u00b617 The Water Court concluded that Teton Canal\u2019s water right claims for the Eureka Reservoir were properly administered under the 1890 Notice. The court further concluded that later additions to the Eureka Reservoir constituted expansions of the original appropriation that must be reflected in more junior water right claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court determined that Teton Canal\u2019s total annual volume for all claims is 14,000 acre feet, that its period of use for all claims runs from April 20 to October 14, and that its historical place of use totals 17,322 acres with a 7,650 acre limit on annual irrigation. Finally, the court determined that Teton Canal\u2019s stockwater claims are valid reflections of historical use. Teton Reservoir appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u00b618 We review the Water Court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are clearly erroneous. <em>Skelton Ranch, Inc. v. Pondera Cnty. Canal &amp; Reservoir </em>Co., 2014 MT 167 \u00b6 26, 375 Mont. 327, 328 P.3d 644 (citation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>omitted). A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the Water Court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that a mistake has been made. <em>Skelton Ranch, Inc., </em>\u00b6 27 (citations omitted). We review the Water Court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>Skelton Ranch, Inc., </em>\u00b6 26 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">\u00b619 <em>Whether the Water Court erred in determining that off-stream water storage in the Eureka Reservoir was included as part of Teton Canal\u2019s 1890 Notice of Appropriation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\u00b620 Existing water rights are those rights that were acquired prior to the Montana Water Use Act\u2019s passage in 1973. Section 85-2-102(12), <em>MCA; Axtell v. M.S. Consulting, </em>1998 MT 64, \u00b6 23, 288 Mont. 150, 955 P.2d 1362. A properly filed statement of claim for an existing water right \u201cconstitutes prima facie proof of its content ....\u201d Section 85-2-227(1), MCA; Rule 19, W. R. Adj. R. This prima facie validity may be overcome if the objector \u201cprove[s] by a preponderance of the evidence that the elements of the original claim \u2018do not accurately reflect the beneficial use of the water right as it existed prior to July 1, 1973.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nelson v. Brooks, </em>2014 MT 120, \u00b6 37, 375 Mont. 86, 329 P.3d 558 (quoting W. R. Adj. R. 19). Since the Montana Water Use Act recognizes existing water rights, \u201cpre-1973 law is still applicable in determining the existence and validity of water rights acquired before 1973.\u201d <em>Axtell, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">\u00b621 Teton Canal properly filed its statement of claim for existing water rights in 1982; accordingly, the claim serves as prima facie evidence that the information contained in it is true. Section 85-2-227(1), MCA; Rule 19, W. R. Adj. R. It was therefore Teton Reservoir\u2019s \u201cburden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the information in the claim is incorrect.\u201d <em>Marks v. 71 Ranch, Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>2014 MT 250, \u00b6 16, 376 Mont. 340, 334 P.3d 373 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AcD_\">\u00b622 On appeal, Teton Reservoir asserts that Teton Canal has no right to off-stream water storage in the Eureka Reservoir under the 1890 Notice because the evidence shows the following: that Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors developed the diversion point described in the 1890 Notice; that the 1890 Notice did not contemplate the Eureka Reservoir; that Teton Canal did not proceed with reasonable diligence in developing the Eureka Reservoir; and that Teton Canal\u2019s priority date for the Eureka Reservoir is based on the 1936 Declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>The 1890 Notice and the Eureka Reservoir</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">\u00b623 In concluding that the 1890 Notice included off-stream storage in the Eureka Reservoir, the Water Court relied, in part, on the following findings: that Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors developed the 1890 Notice diversion point by building the Eureka Canal; and that Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors intended for the 1890 Notice to include the Eureka Reservoir. Teton Reservoir asserts that both of these findings are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u00b624 Teton Reservoir first challenges the Water Court\u2019s finding that it failed to present sufficient evidence demonstrating that Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors developed the diversion point described in the 1890 Notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u00b625 The Water Court addressed the development of the diversion point identified in the 1890 Notice in a single paragraph. The court found that the \u201cactual point of diversion developed by [Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors under the 1890 Notice] was located about two miles further up the Teton River\u201d than the diversion point described in the 1890 Notice. The court identified the actual diversion point developed under the 1890 Notice as the northeast quarter of the northwest quarter of the northeast quarter of Section 35, Township 25 North, Range 6 West.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court cited to the 1892 plat map and to Teton Canal\u2019s expert\u2019s testimony in finding that the change in the point of diversion \u201cwas necessary to develop the Eureka Reservoir site.\u201d Based on these findings, the court concluded, \u201cIt does not appear [Teton Canal] ever developed the Section 31 diversion point referenced by the [1890 Notice].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">\u00b626 Teton Reservoir argues that the Water Court\u2019s finding is not supported by substantial evidence and that the court overlooked the evidence establishing that Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors developed the 1890 Notice diversion point by building the Glendora Canal. Teton Canal asserts generally that the Water Court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous, but it offers no record support for the court\u2019s finding that the diversion point described in the 1890 Notice was never developed. In fact, Teton Canal acknowledges in its briefing that \u201cfrom the record presented, it appears that both the Eureka Canal and the Glendora Canal were constructed by [Teton Canal\u2019s] predecessors between April, 1890 and April, 1892.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">\u00b627 The evidence establishes that the Glendora Canal is the diversion point described in the 1890 Notice. The 1892 plat map describes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Glendora Canal\u2019s diversion point as \u201cbeginning at a point on the north bank of the Teton River ... from which the quarter Section corner on the south side of Sec[tion] 31, T[ownship] 25 N[orth], R[ange] 5 W[est] bears N[orth] 47\u00b0 25\u2019 W[est] 698 feet distant ....\u201d This description corresponds to the diversion point described in the 1890 Notice \u2014 \u201ca point upon [the Teton River\u2019s] north bank six hundred sixty five feet from the [southeast] corner of the [southwest quarter] of Section thirty[-]one (31) Township Twenty-five (25) North of Range five (5) West....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">\u00b628 Other evidence in the record clearly demonstrates that Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors constructed the Glendora Canal and therefore developed the diversion point described in the 1890 Notice. A history of Teton Canal written by a past President states that after filing the 1890 Notice, Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors \u201cimmediately began building a ditch\u201d that later would be named the Glendora Canal. On the 1892 plat map, the engineer for Teton Canal\u2019s predecessor affirmed that the Glendora Canal had \u201cbeen constructed under his supervision ....\u201d The GLO representative who examined the Glendora Reservoir site in 1909 reported that \u201c[t]his reservoir is a depression, natural lake bed, thru which main ditch of the Company runs ....\u201d The ditch to which the representative referred is identified on the 1892 plat map as the Glendora Canal.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u00b629 Testimony from Teton Canal\u2019s witnesses further demonstrates that Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors developed the diversion point described in the 1890 Notice by constructing the Glendora Canal. Although Teton Canal\u2019s expert, John Westenberg, testified that the Eureka Canal\u2019s construction was necessary to develop the Eureka Reservoir site, he also testified that the Glendora Canal is still \u201cvisible on the ground\u201d and that \u201cthere\u2019s some remaining infrastructure connecting it with even the current ditch.\u201d Charles Crane, Teton Canal\u2019s Secretary-Treasurer, testified that the Glendora Canal was built and that \u201cthere\u2019s still remnants of it up there.\u201d Crane further testified that although the Glendora Reservoir is no longer part of Teton Canal\u2019s irrigation system, the reservoir is still used by a Teton Canal stockholder. This stockholder fills the Glendora Reservoir out of Teton Canal\u2019s current canal.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\u00b630  There is substantial, uncontradicted evidence in the record, some from Teton Canal\u2019s own witnesses, establishing that Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors developed the Glendora Canal at the diversion point described in the 1890 Notice. The 1892 plat map and John Westenberg\u2019s testimony do not contradict this evidence and do not support the Water Court\u2019s finding that Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>never developed the diversion point referenced in the 1890 Notice. Accordingly, the Water Court\u2019s finding on this issue is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">\u00b631 The Water Court\u2019s finding that Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors intended to include the Eureka Reservoir in the 1890 Notice depended, in part, on its finding that the diversion point referenced in the 1890 Notice was never developed and that it was relocated as necessary to develop the Eureka site. Teton Reservoir asserts that the evidence demonstrates that Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors did not intend that the 1890 Notice include the Eureka Reservoir and that the Eureka Canal constituted a new point of diversion that was intended to be included under the 1891 Notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u00b632 Teton Reservoir\u2019s objections to the application of the 1890 Notice are \u201cgoverned by pre-1973 law.\u201d <em>Marks, </em>\u00b6 15. As such, the 1885 statutory appropriation act applies to the 1890 Notice. <em>Shammel v. Vogl, </em>144 Mont. 354, 367, 396 P.2d 103, 110 (1964). In order for Teton Canal\u2019s claims to relate back to the 1890 Notice under the 1885 act, Teton Canal must have complied with the act\u2019s requirements. Section 81-812, RCM (1947) (repealed 1973) (providing in part that \u201cby complying with the provisions of this chapter the right to the use of the water shall relate back to the date of posting the notice\u201d); <em>Bailey v.

Among other things, a notice of appropriation provides other water users with notice of the appropriator\u2019s intent.

In making this finding, the court relied on the 1890 Notice and the 1892 plat map. The court reasoned that the 1892 plat map showed \u201can extensive system of canals and ditches\u201d and both the Eureka and Glendora Reservoirs. The court further found that Teton Canal established that the 1890 Notice included the development of two small reservoirs and the eventual development of the Eureka Reservoir. Based on these findings, the court ultimately found that \u201c[a] preponderance of the evidence shows that a sizable reservoir at the Eureka site was part of the intent of the [1890 Notice].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AP2h\">\u00b635 On appeal, Teton Canal contends that the Water Court did not err in finding that its predecessors contemplated storage in the Eureka Reservoir under the 1890 Notice. Teton Canal asserts that substantial evidence supports the court\u2019s findings that Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors developed and maintained off-stream water storage under the 1890 Notice. The Eureka Reservoir, argues Teton Canal, simply consolidated the company\u2019s longstanding off-stream storage practices under the 1890 Notice into one place. Teton Canal relies on the 1890 Notice, the 1892 plat map, the GLO representatives\u2019 reports, and its stockholder and director meeting minutes from the 1920s and 1930s to support its assertion that the Water Court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">\u00b636 Under the 1885 act, the 1890 Notice serves as prima facie evidence that the information contained in it is true. Section 89-814, RCM (1947) (repealed 1973). The evidence establishes that Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors intended the Glendora Canal and the Glendora Reservoir to be included under the 1890 Notice. As we concluded above, Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors developed the diversion point described in the 1890 Notice by constructing the Glendora Canal. Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors stated in the 1890 Notice that they had diverted water by means of a ditch that \u201ccarries or conducts 3000 inches of water from\u201d the Teton River. Over a decade after Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors filed the 1890 Notice, another predecessor, Russell Shepherd, asserted in his answer to the <em>Perry </em>complaint that the ditch diverting water under the 1890 Notice conveyed \u201c3,000 inches of the water\u201d from the Teton River. The effect of this evidence is that Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors intended to, and eventually did, convey 3,000 inches of water in the Glendora Canal under the 1890 Notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u00b637 The 1890 Notice further indicates that the \u201cspecial purpose for which [the appropriated] water <em>is intended </em>to be used ... is for gathering said waters in <em>a reservoir </em>and using it to irrigate adjacent lands ....\u201d (Emphases added.) The 1892 plat map depicts the Glendora Canal running to the Glendora Reservoir; accordingly, the evidence demonstrates that the <em>reservoir </em>to which the 1890 Notice referred is the Glendora Reservoir. Other evidence in the record supports the conclusion that the Glendora Reservoir is the reservoir Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors intended to develop under the 1890 Notice. The history of Teton Canal written by a past President states that the Glendora Canal \u201cwas completed to the small lake\u201d that eventually would be known as the Glendora Reservoir. The GLO representative who examined the Glendora Reservoir site in 1909 confirmed that the Glendora Canal ran to the reservoir that was contained by a dam 450 feet long and five feet high. The effect of this evidence is that Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors intended to, and eventually did, develop and maintain off-stream water storage in the Glendora Reservoir under the 1890 Notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">\u00b638 While the 1892 plat map depicts the Eureka Canal running to the not-yet-developed Eureka Reservoir, the evidence establishes clearly that Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors intended this portion of its irrigation system to be included under the 1891 Notice. The engineer for Teton Canal\u2019s predecessor affirmed on the 1892 plat map that the Eureka Canal was \u201cconstructed under his supervision ....\u201d He identified the Eureka Canal\u2019s diversion point as \u201cbeginning at a point on the north bank of the Teton River in the Northeast quarter (N.E. <em>Vi) </em>of Section 35, T[ownship] 25 N[orth], R[ange] 6 W[est] ... from which the Northeast corner of Sec[tion] 36, T[ownship] 25 N[orth], R[ange] 6 W[est] bears N[orth] 85\u00b0 58\u2019 E[ast] 6641 feet distant.\u201d In the 1891 Notice, Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors described the point of diversion as beginning \u201cupon [the Teton River\u2019s] north bank about 1015 feet south 34\u00b0 west from the [northwest] corner of Section (36) Thirty[-]six T[ownship] 25 North, R[ange] 6 West....\u201d The diversion point described in the 1891 Notice corresponds to the Eureka Canal\u2019s diversion point described on the 1892 plat map and is approximately two miles upstream from the Glendora Canal\u2019s diversion point.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\u00b639 Under the 1885 act, the 1891 Notice serves as prima facie evidence that the information contained in it is true. Section 89-814, RCM (1947) (repealed 1973). Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors claimed water under the 1891 Notice \u201cfor irrigating, <em>reservoirs </em>and other purposes.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The 1891 Notice specifies that the diversion ditch \u201ccarries or conducts Ten Thousand inches of water\u201d from the Teton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>River. In his answer to the <em>Perry </em>complaint, Shepherd asserted that the ditch diverting water under the 1891 Notice conveyed the \u201camount of ten thousand inches\u201d of water from the Teton River. Additionally, the GLO representative who examined the Eureka Reservoir site in 1909 reported that a large \u201cfeeder ditch\u201d ran from the Teton River to the undeveloped reservoir site. The effect of this evidence is that Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors intended to, and eventually did, convey water in the Eureka Canal under the 1891 Notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\u00b640 Although the 1892 plat map reveals the intent of Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors to develop and maintain off-stream water storage in the Eureka Reservoir by way of the Eureka Canal, this intent is expressed in the 1891 Notice, which undisputedly did not survive the <em>Perry </em>decree. The Water Court misapprehended the effect of the nullified 1891 Notice. When taken together with the two-mile distance between the points of diversion, and the fact that the 1890 Notice\u2019s diversion point was undisputedly put to use in the Glendora Canal, the court\u2019s finding that the Eureka Reservoir has a priority date based on the 1890 Notice is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u00b641 Teton Canal\u2019s actions in the 1920s and 1930s further establish Teton Canal\u2019s understanding that the Eureka Reservoir was not included under the 1890 Notice. Teton Canal\u2019s stockholders approved \u201cputting $400 per share\u201d toward developing the Eureka Reservoir at a September 2, 1936 special stockholders\u2019 meeting. The discussion of \u201csecuring water rights\u201d at this same meeting demonstrates Teton Canal\u2019s recognition that developing the Eureka Reservoir required a new appropriation. Moreover, Teton Canal\u2019s filing of the 1921 Notice and the Water Conservation Board\u2019s filing of the 1936 Declaration further demonstrate that Teton Canal understood that new water right claims were needed for the Eureka Reservoir\u2019s development. The proposed reservoir\u2019s legal descriptions in both the 1921 Notice and the 1936 Declaration generally correspond to the Eureka Reservoir\u2019s current location and its location as shown on the 1892 plat map. The diversion point described in the 1921 Notice corresponds with both the Eureka Canal\u2019s diversion point described on the 1892 plat map and the diversion point described in the 1891 Notice. The affidavit signed by Teton Canal\u2019s President in 1982 demonstrates that the diversion point described in the 1936 Declaration was meant to correspond to the Eureka Canal\u2019s diversion point as described on the 1892 plat map, the 1891 Notice, and the 1921 Notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">\u00b642 The <em>Perry </em>decree extinguished all rights claimed by Teton Canal except those preserved under the 1890 Notice. The 1921 Notice and the 1936 Declaration therefore confirm Teton Canal\u2019s understanding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>it lost its claim under the 1891 Notice to the Eureka Reservoir through the <em>Perry </em>decree and that the Eureka Reservoir was not part of the 1890 Notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">\u00b643  A thorough review of the record convinces us that the Water Court misapprehended the effect of the evidence in finding that a sizable reservoir at the Eureka site was part of the 1890 Notice\u2019s intent. Although Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors contemplated and eventually developed an extensive system of canals and reservoirs \u2014 as detailed by the 1892 plat map \u2014 the evidence establishes that the Eureka Reservoir was intended to be developed under the 1891 Notice and not the 1890 Notice. Accordingly, the Water Court\u2019s conclusion that the Eureka Reservoir is properly administered as part of Teton Canal\u2019s water right claims under the 1890 Notice is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Reasonable Diligence and the Eureka</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">Reservoir\u2019s Priority Date</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\u00b644 Teton Canal contends that \u201ceven if the [1890 Notice] was initially developed at the Glendora Canal diversion point..., nothing under the law prevented [Teton Canal\u2019s] predecessors from moving the diversion point and diverting water under the [1890 Notice] from either the Glendora or the Eureka Canal diversions, or both.\u201d In other words, Teton Canal asserts that off-stream storage in the Eureka Reservoir is included under the 1890 Notice because Teton Canal simply moved the 1890 Notice\u2019s diversion point two miles upstream following the <em>Perry </em>decree. Teton Canal ignores Teton Reservoir\u2019s contention that the 1891 Notice, which the <em>Perry </em>decree extinguished, sets forth Teton Canal\u2019s original claim for the Eureka Reservoir. Moreover, independent of our conclusion that the 1890 Notice does not include the Eureka Reservoir, the evidence establishes that Teton Canal and its predecessors failed to proceed with reasonable diligence in developing the Eureka Reservoir site. Therefore, regardless of Teton Canal\u2019s contention that it moved the 1890 Notice\u2019s diversion point, the Eureka Reservoir\u2019s completion in 1937 could not relate back to the 1890 Notice\u2019s filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u00b645 Under the 1885 statutory appropriation act, Teton Canal\u2019s 1890 Notice could not \u201cripen into a valid appropriation until the... statutory requirements for a completed appropriation [were] met.\u201d <em>Intake, </em>171 Mont. at 431, 558 P.2d at 1118. Accordingly, the priority date for the Eureka Reservoir could not relate back unless Teton Canal showed that it \u201cproceed[ed] to prosecute the excavation or construction of the work by which the water appropriated [was] to be diverted, and ... prosecute[d] the same with reasonable diligence to completion.\u201d Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>89-811, RCM (1947) (repealed 1973). In <em>Intake, </em>we held that under \u00a7 89-811, RCM, an appropriator is not required to commence \u201cactual on-site excavation or construction of the diversion works\u201d to preserve its priority date, but the appropriator must demonstrate that it made a \u201csteady on-going effort in good faith ... to prosecute the construction of the project under the circumstances ....\u201d <em>Intake, </em>171 Mont. at 436, 558 P.2d at 1121. We based this holding on the following passage from a leading water law treatise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-4\">What constitutes due diligence is a question of fact to be determined by the court in each case. Diligence does not require unusual or extraordinary effort, but it does require a steady application of effort \u2014 that effort that is usual, ordinary and reasonable under the circumstances. * * * So long as the applicant prosecutes the construction of works in good faith with a steady effort, he should be held to have prosecuted with diligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-5\"><em>Intake, </em>171 Mont. at 434, 558 P.2d at 1120 (quoting 6 <em>Waters and Water Rights </em>\u00a7 514.1, 308-309 (Robert Emmet Clark ed., 1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\u00b646 The Water Court cited this same passage from <em>Intake </em>in concluding that Teton Canal proceeded with reasonable diligence in developing the Eureka Reservoir site. The court found that Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors \u201caggressively pursued\u201d developing reservoirs under the 1890 Notice. The court further found that \u201cwhile [Teton Canal] controlled the Eureka site and ran its canal through a natural lake bed at this location, it is not clear if [Teton Canal] could actually store water at the Eureka site prior to 1936.\u201d The court noted that Teton Canal\u2019s record of director and shareholder meeting minutes begins in 1920; therefore, \u201cthere is a significant period of time with no evidence regarding [Teton Canal\u2019s] progress towards developing Eureka Reservoir.\u201d In concluding that Teton Canal proceeded with reasonable diligence in developing the Eureka Reservoir, the court relied on the following evidence: the 1892 plat map; the GLO representatives\u2019 reports; Teton Canal\u2019s director and stockholders\u2019 meeting minutes from the 1920s and 1930s; and historical reservoir development in the area by Teton Reservoir and Farmers Canal.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">\u00b647 Based on our review of the record, we conclude that Teton Canal failed to proceed with reasonable diligence in developing the Eureka Reservoir site until the mid-1930s. The evidence shows that after filing the 1890 Notice, Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors completed constructing the Eureka Canal in 1892. Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors also filed an application and plat map with the GLO in 1892. In 1909, a GLO special agent examined the Eureka Reservoir site and reported in a February 1910 letter that the site was \u201ca natural lake bed ....\u201d The agent further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>noted that the site \u201ccould also be used as a reservoir ....\u201d Although the agent recommended \u201cfinal approval of this reservoir site,\u201d the letter demonstrates that Teton Canal had not yet developed the reservoir.</p>\n<p id=\"Auc\">\u00b648 Over ten years later, in September 1921, Teton Canal held a special stockholders\u2019 meeting at which \u201cthe possibilities of building a reservoir\u201d were discussed. The stockholders approved getting an engineer \u201cto find out the [reservoir\u2019s] actual costs and water storage\u201d during the same meeting. Teton Canal subsequently filed the 1921 Notice and attempted to secure a private loan to finance the Eureka Reservoir\u2019s development. These efforts were unsuccessful, so Teton Canal\u2019s Board of Directors approached the stockholders about creating an irrigation district to finance the reservoir\u2019s construction. At a July 29, 1922 special stockholders\u2019 meeting, Teton Canal\u2019s stockholders rejected the proposal to create an irrigation district to finance the Eureka Reservoir\u2019s development. The stockholders ultimately voted to form a committee in November 1922 \u201cto do the best they can without any expense to the company\u201d to explore options for developing the reservoir. The committee was to report at the annual stockholders\u2019 meeting; however, the minutes from the January 13, 1923 annual stockholders\u2019 meeting do not mention any report by a committee on the reservoir. There is no record of any actions taken by the committee and the next mention of the reservoir site came in December 1926 \u2014 after questions were raised regarding Teton Canal\u2019s rights in the reservoir site.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\u00b649 In November 1926, a GLO division inspector investigated the site and reported that \u201cno reservoir has been built where it was intended to construct the Eureka reservoir ....\u201d The inspector noted that the Secretary of Teton Canal did \u201cnot possess the fund of information about this project, one might expect from an active officer, he expressed the opinion that [Teton Canal] was interested in the Eureka site and probably would use it later.\u201d The inspector further reported that Teton Canal \u201cemploys no engineer, and to obtain from [Teton Canal\u2019s Secretary] any definite dependable information was rather difficult, for the reason that he does not possess it.\u201d The inspector went on to state, \u201cI am frank to say that an authoritative dependable record, showing complete title to this grant, can be had only in an abstract, and I think [Teton Canal] should be required to furnish one.\u201d The inspector recommended that Teton Canal should \u201cstate what their intentions are as to the Eureka site,\u201d and suggested that the GLO \u201ccall on [Teton Canal] to file proof of ownership, and proof of construction\u201d of the Eureka Reservoir. In response to the GLO\u2019s report, questions were raised at the January 1927 annual stockholders\u2019 meeting about \u201cwhat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>was being done to protect the Company\u2019s title to the [Eureka Reservoir] site near the river in Sec[tion] 31-T[ownship] 25.\u201d The minutes reflect that \u201c[t]he general opinion was that ... [Teton Canal\u2019s] title to the reservoir site was good and was not subject to cancellation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">\u00b650 Nearly seven years later, at a January 1934 annual stockholders\u2019 meeting, Teton Canal\u2019s stockholders again discussed developing a reservoir. At this meeting, the stockholders approved forming a committee to see what could be done \u201cabout putting [a] reservoir in any appropriate location.\u201d At a September 2, 1936 special stockholders\u2019 meeting, Teton Canal\u2019s stockholders finally approved \u201cputting $400 per share\u201d toward developing a reservoir. The stockholders approved appointing a committee and holding another special meeting for the \u201cpurpose of investigating building of Reservoir or securing water rights\u201d at the same meeting. At the September 19, 1936 special stockholders\u2019 meeting, the stockholders voted to \u201capply to [the Water Conservation Board] for [a] loan of $25,000 for building Reservoir and securing land for same and other expenses in connection of same.\u201d At this same meeting, the stockholders voted to turn over the reservoir site to the Water Conservation Board. That Board subsequently filed the 1936 Declaration. It ultimately took the Water Conservation Board\u2019s involvement in the project to finally complete the Eureka Reservoir in 1937 \u2014 over forty-five years after Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors filed the 1890 Notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">\u00b651  While reasonable diligence does not require that Teton Canal undertook \u201cunusual or extraordinary effort\u201d in completing the Eureka Reservoir, it does require that Teton Canal made a \u201csteady on-going effort in good faith ... to prosecute the construction\u201d of the reservoir. <em>Intake, </em>171 Mont. at 434, 436, 558 P.2d at 1120-1121. The record establishes that, although Teton Canal and its predecessors maintained title to the site, they did not undertake a steady, on-going effort in good faith to develop the Eureka Reservoir until the mid-1930s.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\u00b652 The available evidence shows that after taking the initial steps of filing the 1890 and 1891 Notices, developing the Eureka Canal, and filing the application and 1892 plat map with the GLO, Teton Canal did not discuss building a reservoir at the site until 1921. The 1926 GLO inspector\u2019s report makes clear that site development had not occurred in the thirty-plus years since Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors took the initial steps. Although Teton Canal filed the 1921 Notice for the Eureka Reservoir site, Teton Canal\u2019s stockholders ultimately rejected a proposal to fund the site\u2019s development. Moreover, Teton Canal\u2019s stockholders were unwilling to commit \u201cany expense to the company\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>to even explore building a reservoir in 1922.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">\u00b653 The 1926 GLO inspector\u2019s report indicates that one of the few efforts that Teton Canal\u2019s predecessors made to develop the site \u2014 filing the application and plat map with the GLO \u2014 was being called into question due to Teton Canal\u2019s lack of progress. The report also demonstrates that Teton Canal\u2019s own Secretary did not possess any \u201cdefinite dependable information\u201d regarding the Eureka Reservoir\u2019s development. The Secretary lacked this information only a few years after Teton Canal\u2019s shareholders discussed the site\u2019s development, filed the 1921 Notice for the reservoir, rejected a proposal to fund the reservoir\u2019s construction, and formed a committee to explore options for developing the site. The Secretary did convey to the GLO representative that Teton Canal was \u201cinterested\u201d in the site; he also indicated that Teton Canal would \u201cprobably use it later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\u00b654 Based not only on the dearth of evidence between the 1892 plat map and the 1921 minutes of the Teton Canal stockholders\u2019 meetings, but also on the shareholders\u2019 recorded actions and inactions, we conclude that the Water Court misapprehended the effect of the evidence when it found that Teton Canal \u201caggressively pursued\u201d the development of the Eureka Reservoir. Although there were sporadic and isolated actions in the decades following the 1890 and 1891 Notices, the shareholders expressly rejected a plan in 1922 that would have moved the project forward^Four years later, an active officer of Teton Canal did not know about*1 plans for the reservoir\u2019s development and merely expressed a possible interest in the site. The evidence therefore establishes that Tetbn Canal failed to prosecute the Eureka Reservoir\u2019s development with reasonable diligence following its first Notices of Appropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">\u00b655 Since Teton Canal\u2019s claim cannot be staked to the 1890 Notice or to the nullified 1891 Notice, the ihquiry turns to what priority date should be assigned to the Eureka Reservoir. Teton Reservoir asserts that the Eureka Reservoir should be decreed a December 3, 1936 priority date under the 1936 Declaration. It bases its argument on three grounds: the Eureka Reservoir was not intended as part of the 1890 Notice; the Eureka Reservoir was not developed with due diligence; and even if the reservoir had been contemplated as part of the 1890 Notice and pursued with reasonable diligence, the current reservoir is much larger than the reservoir reflected on the 1892 plat map.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">\u00b656  Teton Canal has not made an alternative argument that any date other than the April 18, 1890 priority date should apply. The evidence establishes that the 1890 Notice did not contemplate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Eureka Reservoir and that Teton Canal failed to prosecute the Eureka Reservoir\u2019s development with reasonable diligence until the mid-1980s. Accordingly, the Water Court must determine Teton Canal\u2019s priority date for the Eureka Reservoir in accordance with this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u00b657 The Water Court\u2019s Order regarding Teton Canal\u2019s water right claims to the Eureka Reservoir is reversed.
