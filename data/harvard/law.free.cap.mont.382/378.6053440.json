The Amended Final Parenting Plan awarded primary custody of H.D., the parties\u2019 child, to Appellee Jennifer Missel (hereinafter \u201cJennifer\u201d), during the school year. We affirm and address the following issue on appeal: '</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-4\">\n<em>Did the District Court err by affirming the Standing Master\u2019s Order Amending the Parenting Plan?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u00b62 Jennifer and Russell are the parents of H.D., who is five years old. Jennifer lives in Jackson, Wyoming, and Russell lives in Great Falls, Montana. The couple dissolved their marriage in 2012 (H.D. was two years old at the time), and when issuing the decree of dissolution, the District Court approved a stipulated parenting plan that the parties had entered. This stipulated plan provided that H.D. would split her time equally between the parties, spending two weeks at a time with each parent in their respective homes in different states. Both Jennifer and Russell contemplated enrolling H.D. in kindergarten in the fall of 2015, at which time it became apparent the stipulated plan would need to be revised. Russell filed a Motion to Modify the Parenting Plan in November 2014, and Jennifer responded with her own proposed parenting plan. The District Court\u2019s Standing Master held a hearing in July 2015, and issued Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Amending Parenting Plan on August 7 that placed H.D. with Jennifer during the school year. The Standing Master found that both parents held a \u201cvery close and loving\u201d relationship with H.D., and that \u201cH.D. is well adjusted to both her communities and families\u201d located in Jackson and in Great Falls. However, the Standing Master also found that \u201c[djuring Russ[ell]\u2019s parenting time Jennifer has difficulty contacting H.D. Russ[ell] frequently does not answer the phone and Jennifer does not have uninterrupted Skype visits.\u201d In addition, the Standing Master found that \u201c[i]t is difficult for Jennifer to communicate with Russ[ell] regarding H.D. because Russ[ell] has blocked Jennifer\u2019s phone number on his phone,\u201d that \u201cRuss[ell] has negative views of Jennifer and her home,\u201d and that \u201cRuss[ell] does not always discuss parenting issues with Jennifer. For example, the parties each take H.D. to the Baptist church in their area. Recently Russ[ell] has been taking H.D. to the Latter Day Saints church without discussing this with Jennifer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">\u00b63 Russell filed objections to the Standing Master\u2019s Order with the District Court, and the District Court affirmed the Order on September 29, 2015. Russell appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b64 \u201cTwo standards of review are relevant in cases involving both a standing master and the district court: the standard the district court applies to the master\u2019s report and the standard we apply to the district court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Kostelnik, </em>2015 MT 283, \u00b6 15, 381 Mont. 182, 357 P.3d 912 (citing <em>In re G.J.A., </em>2014 MT 215, \u00b6 11, 376 Mont. 212, 331 P.3d 835). We review a district court\u2019s decision <em>de novo </em>to determine whether it applied the correct standard of review to a standing master\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. <em>See G.J.A., </em>\u00b6 11. \u201cA district court reviews a standing master\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, and its conclusions of law to determine if they are correct.\u201d <em>Kostelnik, </em>\u00b6 15 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\u00b65 <em>Did the District Court err by affirming the Standing Master\u2019s Order Amending the Parenting Plan ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">\u00b66 Russell argues it was error for the Standing Master and the District Court to weigh his religious choice as a factor in determining child custody without a thorough evaluation of the effects of that religious choice on the child. Russell urges adoption by this Court of \u201can enhanced standard\u201d that would \u201cprotect religious liberty while ensuring child custody decisions are made in the best interest of the child.\u201d Russell offers that the new rule should require that \u201c[bjefore placing any weight on custodial parent\u2019s exercise of religious choice,... the Court must expressly determine, on competent evidence, whether that religious choice impairs the child\u2019s emotional development. Absent that evaluation, religious choice should not be considered, whether directly or indirectly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">\u00b67 Presented with the motion to amend the parenting plan, the Standing Master had to determine with which parent to place H.D. for the quickly-approaching school year. Both parents testified before the Standing Master. Jennifer testified that when H.D. was in Russell\u2019s care for his two-week periods, she would have trouble communicating with H.D. through Skype or the phone. Jennifer further testified that she and Russell communicated exclusively through email, as Russell had blocked her number on his phone. In his testimony, Russell dismissed the breakdowns in communication during his parenting time as occurring because \u201cwe get busy,\u201d but stated that the breakdowns were not happening purposefully. He admitted that he had not been participating recently in transporting H.D. to the mutually agreed exchange location, half-way between the parties\u2019 Wyoming and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Montana homes, electing instead to have his parents take H.D. to the location in order to avoid contact with Jennifer. When asked if he had spoken to Jennifer about the decision to take H.D. to a different church in Great Falls, Russell acknowledged he had not consulted her.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u00b68 In making her determination, the Standing Master entered detailed findings regarding the mandatory best interest factors set forth in \u00a7 40-4-212(l)(a)-(m), MCA. The Master found that both Jennifer and Russell \u201care fit and appropriate parents who provide a nurturing, secure and loving home for H.D.\u201d She further determined, under \u00a7 40-4-212(1)(1), MCA, that \u201cRuss[ell] has very negative views of Jennifer and her home, including long standing concerns that Jennifer is attempting to harm him. Russ[ell] does not communicate with Jennifer about important parenting issues and is not responsive to Jennifer\u2019s efforts to stay in touch with H.D. during Russ[ell]\u2019s parenting time.\u201d The Master ultimately concluded that Jennifer\u2019s proposed parenting plan was in H.D.\u2019s best interest, and entered an Amended Final Parenting Plan accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u00b69  The Standing Master\u2019s concerns about the difficulties in communication between Russell and Jennifer were properly drawn from the evidence presented at the hearing. The Master\u2019s reference to Russell unilaterally taking H.D. to a particular church during his parenting time was not a criticism of Russell\u2019s religious preference, but rather an example of the real problem \u2014 Russell\u2019s deficits in cooperatively co-parenting with Jennifer. The District Court also recognized this, and after articulating the correct standard of review, affirmed the Standing Master\u2019s Order and Amended Final Parenting Plan. <em>See </em>G.J.A., \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u00b610  Upon an independent review of the record, we find no error in the District Court\u2019s affirmance of the Standing Master\u2019s Order. Because this case is resolved within the confines of the applicable standard of review, we decline to adopt a new constitutional standard in regard to consideration of religious factors in child custody determinations. Russell\u2019s religious preference itself was not a factor in the Standing Master\u2019s decision, and \u201cas a matter of longstanding principle, courts avoid constitutional issues whenever possible.\u201d <em>State v. Kolb, </em>2009 MT 9, \u00b6 13, 349 Mont. 10, 200 P.3d 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">\u00b611 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b413-9\">JUSTICES COTTER, BAKER, McKINNON and SHEA concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
