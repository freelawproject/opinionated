(Mother) and C.L. (Father). Mother and Father were never married, a custody order or parenting plan was never entered, and J.H. saw Father only occasionally. When this case originated, J.H. was living in Lewistown, Montana, with Mother, Mother\u2019s boyfriend, J.H.\u2019s half-sister B.S., J.H.\u2019s maternal grandmother, and his grandmother\u2019s boyfriend. Father was living in Lancaster, Texas, with his girlfriend, their two children, and two of his girlfriend\u2019s children from a prior relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">\u00b64 In November 2012, the Department initiated a petition for Emergency Protective Services, for Adjudication of J.H. as a Youth in Need of Care, and for Temporary Legal Custody of J.H. The petition alleged Mother had abused and neglected J.H. by exposing him to illegal drug use and failing to protect him from her abusive boyfriend. Father was served with the Department\u2019s petition, and shortly thereafter signed and filed an acknowledgement of service of the petition. Father expressed to Rose McLees (McLees), the Department social worker assigned to J.H.\u2019s case, that he wanted custody of J.H. \u00b65 At the January 2013 show cause hearing, at which Father was not present, Mother stipulated that J.H. was a Youth in Need of Care. The District Court granted the Department Temporary Legal Custody of J.H. for 180 days, including the initial plan to reunite J.H. with Mother. Shortly after the show cause hearing, Mother and Father participated by telephone in a Family Group Decision Making meeting with the Department. Father stated he wanted custody of J.H., but Mother objected to placing J.H. with Father. McLees stated she would not place J.H. with Father in Texas until Texas child authorities conducted a home study pursuant to the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) and ensured Father\u2019s home was a safe environment for J.H.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">\u00b66 The Department returned J.H. to Mother\u2019s care in February 2013, but Mother failed to comply with her treatment plan. J.H. was again removed from her care in July 2013 and returned to foster care, and the Department filed a petition to extend temporary legal custody of J.H. At the hearing, McLees stated the Department would continue to provide reunification services to Mother while simultaneously seeking a home study under the ICPC to determine whether J.H. could be placed with Father in Texas. The District Court granted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Department\u2019s extension of temporary legal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b67 In September 2013, McLees asked Texas child protective services to conduct, under the ICPC, a home study and determine whether placement with Father was viable. After obtaining the results of criminal and child protective services background checks on Father, Texas authorities refused to conduct a home study. The background checks revealed Father had committed multiple crimes from 2006 to 2010, including two charges for selling dangerous drugs and an aggravated assault on his girlfriend involving a knife. Further, an incident involving Father and a girlfriend had resulted in the loss of the custody of two of his children to Texas child protective services.</p>\n<p id=\"Abn\">\u00b68 The Department filed its first permanency plan proposal in January 2014, stating it would continue to attempt reunification of J.H. with Mother but would seek termination of her parental rights if she was noncompliant with her treatment plan. The concurrent plan was to place J.H. with a relative, and if no suitable relative could be found, to petition for long-term custody of J.H. and a permanent living arrangement in Montana. The permanency plan did not include the option of placing J.H. with Father, although that option had apparently not yet been ruled out by the Department. Meanwhile, Father filed a Motion for Disposition and to Dismiss, requesting the District Court place J.H. with Father as the non-custodial and non-offending parent. The District Court approved the permanency plan, but declined to rule on Father\u2019s motion at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b69 In March 2014, the Department petitioned to terminate Mother\u2019s parental rights and to extend temporary legal custody of J.H. The Department asserted that an extension of custody was necessary because, although Texas had denied an ICPC placement with Father, the Department needed additional time to determine if placement with Father could still be achieved. Father had commissioned a private home study at his own expense, and both the Department and the guardian ad litem had agreed to consider the results of the private home study. The District Court terminated Mother\u2019s parental rights and granted the Department\u2019s extension of temporary legal custody, which Father did not contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b610 In September 2014, Texas child authorities approved J.H.\u2019s maternal great aunt, E.J., as a kinship placement for J.H., as well as for J.H.\u2019s half-sister B.S., with whom J.H. was very close. E. J. resided in Texas. In October 2014, the Department filed a petition to extend temporary legal custody of J.H. Father\u2019s private home study was not yet complete and the Department wanted more time to determine whether placement with Father was viable. In the meantime, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Department planned to move J.H. and B.S. to live with E.J. in Texas, and stated that if the home study was not completed within three months, or if the home study did not recommend placement with Father, the Department would file for long-term custody of J.H. or for termination of Father\u2019s parental rights. In December 2014, J.H. and B.S. moved to live with their Great Aunt E.J. in Texas. In January 2015, Father\u2019s private home study was received. The study was inconclusive and the evaluator was unable to recommend Father as a viable placement for J.H.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b611 The Department then filed a petition for long-term custody of J.H. and a second permanency plan, which sought placement of J.H. with E.J. under a guardianship. The District Court held a hearing on the permanency plan in February 2015. Michelle Feller (Feller), a licensed clinical professional counselor who counseled J.H. bi-weekly from September 2013 until he moved to Texas, testified J.H. was very close with B.S., and that it would be in J.H.\u2019s best interests to stay with E. J., \u201cfor the reason of being with his sister and for the reason of being in a safe, secure, consistent environment.\u201d J.H.\u2019s guardian ad litem testified J.H.\u2019s relationship with B.S. was critical to his well-being, that J.H. was \u201cin an ideal place,\u201d and that there was no reason why J.H. should not be with E.J. An ICPC social worker in Texas reported J.H.\u2019s placement with E.J. was going well, and that E.J. was providing consistency, structure, and meeting J.H.\u2019s basic needs. The District Court approved the permanency plan but stated the approval did not preclude a later determination that the child should be placed with Father.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u00b612 The District Court later held a hearing on the petition for long-term custody and Father\u2019s motion to dismiss. The testimony largely mirrored that of the February 2015 permanency plan hearing. Additionally, E.J. testified she was committed to caring for the children for the long term, explaining \u201c[t]hey are mine. I mean I didn\u2019t birth them, but they are attached to me and I\u2019m attached to them. It\u2019s like a blessing. They\u2019ve been through so much.\u201d The District Court granted the Department\u2019s petition for long-term custody until J.H. reached the age of 18, holding that J.H. remained a youth in need of care, the Department made reasonable efforts to place J.H. with Father, it was contrary to J.H.\u2019s best interests to be placed with Father, and J.H.\u2019s placement with E.J. was in his best interests, particularly because B.S. also resides there. Father appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">\u00b6 13 Whether a district court complied with the statutory requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>presents a question of law that this Court reviews for correctness. <em>In re H.T., </em>2015 MT 41, \u00b6 10, 378 Mont. 206, 343 P.3d 159. We review a district court\u2019s finding of fact for clear error. <em>In re R.M.T., </em>2011 MT 164, \u00b6 27, 361 Mont. 159, 256 P.3d 935 (citation omitted). A factual finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if review of the record convinces the Court a mistake was made. <em>In re C.J.M., </em>2012 MT 137, \u00b6 10, 365 Mont. 298, 280 P.3d 899 (citation omitted). We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party when determining whether substantial credible evidence supports the district court\u2019s findings. <em>In re </em>B.D., 2015 MT 339, \u00b6 5, 381 Mont. 505, 362 P.3d 636. A district court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless there is a mistake of law or a finding of fact clearly erroneous that amounts to an abuse of discretion. <em>In re M.N., </em>2011 MT 245, \u00b6 14, 362 Mont. 186, 261 P.3d 1047 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u00b614 Under \u00a7 41-3-445(8)(e)(v), MCA, a district court may approve a permanency plan and grant long-term custody of the child in a planned permanent living arrangement if it is established by a preponderance of the evidence that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">(A) the child has been adjudicated a youth in need of care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">(B) the department has made reasonable efforts to reunite the parent and child, further efforts by the department would likely be unproductive, and reunification of the child with the parent or guardian would be contrary to the best interests of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">(C) there is a judicial finding that other more permanent placement options for the child have been considered and found to be inappropriate or not to be in the best interests of the child; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">(D) the child has been in a placement in which the foster parent or relative has committed to the long-term care and to a relationship with the child, and it is in the best interests of the child to remain in that placement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">\u00b615 Father argues the District Court violated the statute in two ways. First, Father argues the Department did not engage in reasonable efforts to reunify J.H. with Father because its efforts consisted solely of the ICPC request. Second, Father argues the District Court\u2019s finding that J.H.\u2019s best interests were served by living with E.J., and not Father, was clearly erroneous because it was not supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>substantial evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b616 <em>1. Did the District Court err by finding the Department engaged in reasonable efforts to reunify J.H. with </em>Father?</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\u00b617 The determination of whether the Department made \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to reunify a family requires that \u201ceach case [] be evaluated on its own facts.\u201d <em>In re </em>K.L., 2014 MT 28, \u00b6 41, 373 Mont. 421, 318 P.3d 691. The term is not defined by statute, but \u201cclearly the statute does not require herculean efforts.\u201d <em>In re K.L., </em>\u00b6 41. Rather, \u201cthe child\u2019s health and safety are of paramount concern,\u201d when determining what efforts are required. Section 41-3-423(1), MCA; <em>see also In re </em>K.L., \u00b6 41 (citing \u201cthe child\u2019s need for permanency and stability\u201d in considering whether the Department\u2019s efforts were reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">\u00b618 The parties and the Guardian ad litem also argue concerning the proper application of the ICPC in this case. Under the ICPC, which Montana has joined by statute and for which the Department has adopted by rule the regulations of the Association of Administrators of the ICPC (AAICPC), neither a state court nor a child protective services agency may send a child to another state until the public authorities in the receiving state notify the sending state that \u201cthe proposed placement does not appear to be contrary to the interests of the child.\u201d Section 41-4-101, MCA, Art. Ill, \u00a7 4; Mont. Admin. R. 37.50.901. An open dependency and neglect case requires compliance with Article III of the ICPC unless (1) the court places the child with a parent from whom the child was not removed, (2) the court has no evidence the parent is unfit and seeks none from the receiving state, and (3) relinquishes jurisdiction over the child immediately upon placement with the parent. AAICPC Reg. 3, \u00a7\u00a7 2(b), 3(a). After finding a child is a youth in need of care, a district court may dismiss the proceeding \u2014 ending the Department\u2019s obligations and the applicability of the ICPC \u2014 and order placement with the noncustodial parent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>protect the welfare of the child. Section 41-3-438(3)(d), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b619 The Department argues its efforts were reasonable because as long as the case remained open it was required to follow the ICPC, which precluded placement with Father until Texas approved the placement. Father responds that the Department could have simply agreed to dismiss the case, which would have made the ICPC inapplicable, and placed J.H. with Father pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-438(3)(d), MCA. Father further argues the Department did not \u201cset out any goals or objectives that could have resulted in J.H.\u2019s placement with Father.\u201d We agree with the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u00b620  The very goal of the Department\u2019s ICPC request to Texas child services was to determine whether placing J.H. with Father was viable. When Texas denied the request after conducting a criminal background check and child protective services background check, the Department was left only two avenues to place J.H. with Father: dismissal of the case under \u00a7 41-3-438(3)(d), MCA, to remove the applicability of the ICPC, or establish Father met the exception under AAICPC Reg. 3, \u00a7 3(a). That exception could not be satisfied because the District Court had evidence before it that Father was potentially unfit, including that Father had dealt crack cocaine and was party to a domestic violence incident involving a knife.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Department investigated the possibility of placing J.H. with Father \u2014 by dismissal under \u00a7 41-3-438(3)(d), MCA \u2014 when it agreed to consider the results of the private home study commissioned by Father. This effort to reunite J.H. with Father also proved futile when the examiner of that study could not recommend placement with Father. Although Father had apparently made progress, the Department was understandably reluctant to agree that dismissal and placement with Father would protect the welfare of J.H., given Father\u2019s recent criminal history and the failure to be approved by his private home study. At that point, the Department had exhausted the three main avenues to place J.H. with Father, and began seeking an alternative, stable, placement that was in J.H.\u2019s best interests. The Department\u2019s efforts to reunify J.H. with Father constituted reasonable efforts under these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\u00b621 <em>2. Did the District Court err by finding that J.H.\u2019s best interests were served by living with E.J., and not </em>Father?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">\u00b622 Father argues the District Court was required to explicitly find he was an \u201cunfit\u201d parent before it could determine whether J.H.\u2019s best interests were served by living with his Great Aunt E.J., and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>there was no substantial evidence supporting the District Court\u2019s finding that it was in J.H.\u2019s best interests to live with E.J., and not with Father. The Department counters that a finding of \u201cunfitness\u201d is not required in a long-term custody proceeding, and that the District Court\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence. We agree with the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">\u00b623 Nothing in the statutes or our precedents suggests a district court must explicitly find a parent is unfit before it may determine the best interests of the child in a long-term custody proceeding. It is correct that we have adopted the presumption that the best interests of a child are served in the custody of the natural parents. <em>In re Guardianship of J.R.G., </em>218 Mont. 336, 342, 708 P.2d 263, 267 (1985). Further, \u00a7 41-3-445(8)(e)(v)(B), MCA, requires that a district court find \u201creunification of the child with the parent or guardian would be contrary to the best interests of the child,\u201d thus codifying and applying this presumption to long-term custody proceedings. But nowhere is it suggested a district court must find more than this before ordering an alternative placement in a long-term custody proceeding. We reject Father\u2019s position that the District Court erred as a matter of law by not explicitly finding that Father was \u201cunfit\u201d before determining it was in J.H.\u2019s best interests to be placed with E.J.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\u00b624 Substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even if weak and conflicting. <em>Siebken v. Voderberg, </em>2015 MT 296, \u00b6 12, 381 Mont. 256, 359 P.3d 1073. It consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be less than a preponderance. <em>Marriage of Schmitz, </em>255 Mont. 159, 165, 841 P.2d 496, 500 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">\u00b625 There was significantly more than a \u201cscintilla\u201d of evidence supporting the District Court\u2019s finding that J.H.\u2019s best interests were served by a placement with E.J. and not Father. Feller testified it was in J.H.\u2019s best interests to stay with E.J., \u201cfor the reason of being with his sister and for the reason of being in a safe, secure, consistent environment.\u201d The guardian ad litem testified it was critical J.H. reside in the same place as B.S., calling the placement with E.J. an \u201cideal place\u201d for J.H.\u2019s well-being. E.J. herself testified and committed to the long-term care of J.H. and B.S., stating \u201cthey are attached to me, and I\u2019m attached to them.\u201d The Texas social worker reported E.J. was providing consistency, structure, and meeting J.H.\u2019s basic needs. In contrast, the District Court had evidence before it that Father had sold crack-cocaine, been in a domestic violence incident, and had been in a dispute that resulted in two of his children being taken away by Texas child services. A reasonable mind could well weigh these facts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>conclude it was in J.H.\u2019s best interests to live with E.J., and not with Father. The District Court\u2019s findings were therefore not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u00b626 It is worth noting that Father\u2019s parental rights to J.H. were not terminated in this proceeding, that he lives relatively close to where J.H. is residing with E.J. in Texas, and that he may well have an opportunity to further his relationship with J.H. in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">\u00b627 <em>3. Did the District Court err by approving the permanency plan without first holding an age-appropriate consultation with J.H. ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">\u00b628 Father argues the District Court failed to hold an age-appropriate consultation with J.H. prior to approving the Department\u2019s second permanency plan as required by \u00a7 41-3-445(4), MCA. However, Father failed to raise this issue before the District Court. \u201c[I]t is well settled that issues raised for the first time on appeal will not be reviewed.\u201d <em>In re Transfer Terr. From Poplar Elem. Sch. Dist. No. 9 to Froid Elem. Sch. Dist. No. 65, </em>2015 MT 278, \u00b6 18, 381 Mont. 145, 364 P.3d 1222 (citation omitted).
