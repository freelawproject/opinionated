Allport appeals from the judgment and sentence of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Lincoln County, which sentenced him to a 13-month commitment at the Montana Department of Corrections (DOC) followed by a five-year suspended commitment at the DOC for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), a fifth-offense felony. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u00b62 The issue on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\">\n<em>Whether the District Court correctly ruled that the result of Allport\u2019s blood-alcohol test was admissible at trial because Allport\u2019s blood sample was taken in compliance with \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">\u00b63 On December 17, 2013, at approximately 9:30 p.m., Lincoln County Sheriffs Deputy Boyd White observed a moving vehicle with the driver-side headlight out. Deputy White pulled the vehicle over and, when he approached, he found Allport alone in the vehicle looking at Deputy White \u201cwith a blank stare.\u201d Deputy White could smell alcohol from inside Allport\u2019s vehicle, and he noticed that Allport\u2019s eyes were \u201ckind of glassy and bloodshot.\u201d Deputy White asked Allport if he had been drinking any alcohol, and Allport said he had one shot five hours earlier. Deputy White asked Allport to step out of the vehicle so Deputy White could conduct field sobriety tests. Deputy White was unable to complete the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, and Allport failed the other field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">\u00b64 When Allport was inside the patrol vehicle, Deputy White read him the Implied Consent Advisory. Allport refused a blood-alcohol test. Deputy White applied for and was granted a search warrant to get a sample of Allport\u2019s blood. Deputy White drove Allport to Cabinet Peaks Medical Center in Libby, and at approximately 11:30 p.m. medical technologist David Baker took a blood sample from Allport.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">\u00b65 Baker regularly takes blood samples and conducts a number of laboratory tests for the Medical Center. Baker has a Bachelor\u2019s degree in clinical laboratory science, and he is a trained phlebotomist. On the night of December 17, 2013, Baker was working alone at the Medical Center. Baker testified at trial that \u201c[t]here is no one supervising me at night but our lab has a manager and it is overseen by an MD from Kalispell.\u201d Baker testified that the lab manager is his direct supervisor. After taking the sample of Allport\u2019s blood, Baker filled out the required paperwork, sealed the sample, and returned the sample to Deputy White. Allport\u2019s blood sample was sent to the State Crime Lab for analysis. The State Crime Lab reported that Allport\u2019s blood sample contained a blood-alcohol content of 0.237%.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-12\">\u00b66 On January 2, 2014, Allport was charged by information with DUI, or alternatively, with operating a vehicle with a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more. The District Court held a jury trial on June 3 and 4, 2014. At trial, Allport objected to the admission of his blood-alcohol test results. Allport contended that the blood sample was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>not taken by a physician, registered nurse, or a qualified person acting under the supervision of a physician or registered nurse, as required by \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA. The District Court overruled the objection, stating that under <em>State v. Merry, </em>2008 MT 288, 345 Mont. 390, 191 P.3d 428, the supervision of a nonresident physician meets the requirements of \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA. The jury found Allport guilty of DUI.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b67 On September 15, 2014, Allport was sentenced to a 13-month commitment to the DOC and a consecutive five-year suspended commitment to the DOC for a fifth-offense felony DUI. Allport appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u00b68 \u201cThe District Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 61-8-405, MCA, presents a conclusion of law which we review for correctness.\u201d <em>Merry, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u00b69 <em>Whether the District Court correctly ruled that the result of Allport\u2019s blood-alcohol test was admissible at trial because Allport\u2019s blood sample was taken in compliance with \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">\u00b610 Allport argues that his blood sample was not taken in compliance with \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA. The statute states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-10\">Only a physician, registered nurse, or other qualified person acting under the supervision and direction of a physician or registered nurse may, at the request of a peace officer, withdraw blood for the purpose of determining any measured amount or detected presence of alcohol, drugs, or any combination of alcohol and drugs in the person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">Section 61-8-405(1), MCA. \u201c[A] qualified person who draws blood while subject to offsite or on-call supervision can satisfy the statutory requirement that the person be \u2018acting under the supervision and direction of a physician or registered nurse ....\u2019 \u201d <em>Merry, </em>\u00b6 19 (quoting \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-12\">\u00b611 According to Allport, <em>Merry </em>requires that a supervising physician or registered nurse must be present or on-call at the time a blood draw is performed, otherwise a qualified person is not \u201cacting under the supervision and direction of a physician or registered nurse\u201d under \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA. Allport argues that because Baker testified that he is not directly supervised by a present or on-call registered nurse or physician, his blood sample was taken in violation of \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA. Therefore, Allport argues that the results of his blood-alcohol test were improperly admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\u00b612 \u201c[W]hen interpreting a statute, we seek to implement the objectives the Legislature sought to achieve, and if the legislative intent can be determined from the plain language of the statute, the plain language <em>controls.'' Montanans for Justice v. State, </em>2006 MT 277, \u00b6 60, 334 Mont. 237, 146 P.3d 759. In <em>Merry, </em>this Court recognized that the plain meaning of the phrase \u201cunder the supervision and direction\u201d was broad enough to encompass multiple interpretations. <em>Merry, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"ASN\">\u00b613 \u201cWhen the legislative intent cannot be readily derived from the plain language, we review the legislative history and abide by the intentions reflected therein.\u201d <em>Montanans for Justice, </em>\u00b6 60. In 1981, the Legislature added the language allowing \u201cother qualified person[s] acting under the supervision and direction of a physician or registered nurse\u201d to take blood samples under \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA. 1981 Mont. Laws ch. 103 \u00a7 4. Senator Stimatz of Butte introduced the bill amending \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA, to the Montana Senate at the request of the Montana Department of Justice (DOJ). Mont. S. Jud. Comm., <em>Hearing on S.B. 111, </em>47th Reg. Sess., Mins. at 1 (Jan. 19, 1981). The DOJ requested the bill because blood-alcohol test results were being challenged in court if a blood sample was not drawn by a doctor or registered nurse. Mont. H. Jud. Comm., <em>Hearing on S.B. 111, </em>47th Reg. Sess., Mins. at 3 (Mar. 5, 1981). Chad Smith of the Montana Hospital Association testified that blood samples are usually drawn by lab technicians. Mont. H. Jud. Comm., Mins. at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u00b614 As we recognized in <em>Merry, </em>the bill\u2019s sponsors in both the Senate and the House focused on allowing qualified persons to take blood samples, rather than the supervision requirements. <em>Merry, </em>\u00b6 18. In the Senate, Senator Stimatz \u201csuggest[ed] that qualified persons, such as laboratory technicians, be allowed to take blood samples to determine alcohol level of the blood.\u201d Mont. S. Jud. Comm., Mins. at 1. In the House, Representative Daily said the bill \u201cwill allow a person other than a doctor or a registered nurse to draw blood. A lab technician who specializes in this could withdraw blood.\u201d Mont. H. Jud. Comm., Mins. at 2. Neither sponsor \u201chinged the lab technician\u2019s ability to draw blood on the physical presence of a physician or RN.\u201d <em>Merry, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u00b615 Furthermore, during the Senate hearing on the bill, Senator Mazurek asked if even broader language to define persons who could take blood samples would be helpful. Larry Majerus of DO J stated that \u201cthe main intent was to allow the medical technicians to be included, not to take the process out of the hospital environment where such qualified persons would not be available.\u201d Mont. S. Jud. Comm., Mins. at 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>\u00b616  In this case, Baker is a medical technologist, a certified phlebotomist, and he works at Cabinet Peaks Medical Center, a hospital. Although Baker does not work under the direct supervision of an MD or a registered nurse, he is a qualified person working in a hospital environment. Contrary to Allport\u2019s assertion that a physician or registered nurse must be present or on-call to comply with \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA, we concluded in <em>Merry </em>that \u201coffsite <em>or </em>on-call supervision\u201d satisfies \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA. <em>Merry, </em>\u00b6 19 (emphasis added). Cabinet Peaks Medical Center is supervised by an offsite MD in Kalispell. Allport\u2019s blood sample was taken in compliance with \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA, and the results of the blood-alcohol test performed on the blood sample were properly admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\u00b617 The District Court was correct when it ruled that Allport\u2019s blood sample was taken in compliance with \u00a7 61-8-405(1), MCA, and the results of the blood-alcohol test performed on the blood sample were properly admitted at trial.
