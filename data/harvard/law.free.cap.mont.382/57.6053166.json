Stewart raises the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC6\">\n<em>Whether the District Court erred when it denied Stewart\u2019s request to instruct the jury on misdemeanor assault as a lesser-included offense of attempted deliberate homicide.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">\u00b63 On the morning of November 1, 2012, Montana Highway Patrol Trooper Joe DeJong stopped Stewart for speeding on Highway 87 outside Stanford, Montana. Stewart handed his driver\u2019s license to Trooper DeJong, who took the license to his patrol car. Trooper DeJong learned from dispatch that Virginia law enforcement wanted to speak with Stewart in relation to an investigation in Virginia. In accordance with standard operating procedure, Trooper DeJong requested that another officer come to the scene before re-engaging Stewart. Before the back-up officer arrived, however, Stewart drove off in the direction of Great Falls. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">\u00b64 Trooper DeJong activated his lights and siren and pursued Stewart along the highway. Several minutes into the pursuit, Stewart threw a homemade pipe bomb out of the driver\u2019s side window of his car. The bomb exploded approximately 100-150 yards ahead of Trooper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>De Jong\u2019s car. Trooper DeJong saw the explosion and heard pieces of debris hit his car. Concerned about additional bombs, Trooper DeJong slowed to keep 150-200 yards between his car and Stewart\u2019s and radioed for additional assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\u00b65 After Stewart turned off Highway 87 onto a dirt road, Trooper Goodemoot joined in the pursuit. Stewart threw another pipe bomb out of his window. Upon seeing the smoke from the second pipe bomb, the troopers stopped 150-200 yards away and waited for the bomb to detonate. Trooper DeJong testified that he stayed a distance away from the bomb \u201cbecause [he] did not want to die.\u201d When the bomb detonated, the troopers heard a \u201cbig boom\u201d and could hear shrapnel \u201czing by [their] cars.\u201d Trooper DeJong testified that he could feel \u201cthe concussion\u201d when the bomb went off. At this point, because they were \u201cvery concerned\u201d about more pipe bombs, the troopers stayed even further back from Stewart\u2019s car \u2014 approximately three to four miles.</p>\n<p id=\"A7f\">\u00b66 After some distance, Stewart turned back onto Highway 87 where another Highway Patrol Trooper had laid spike strips over the highway. Despite swerving to avoid the spikes, Stewart drove over them, puncturing his tires. Stewart continued to drive as multiple officers from the Highway Patrol, the Cascade County Sheriffs Department, and the Judith Basin County Sheriffs Department pursued him.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\u00b67 As the chase continued, Stewart threw several more pipe bombs out of his window. Responding officers had to swerve to avoid hitting the bombs. Some bombs, however, detonated very near several of their cars, throwing shrapnel along the side of the cars. One officer testified that his car shook when he drove by one of the explosions.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\u00b68 Eventually the tires on Stewart\u2019s car began to come off of their rims and he turned off of the highway. An officer rammed his patrol car into the back of Stewart\u2019s car, sending it into the ditch partially down a slope and into a fence. Stewart got out of the car with a handgun and ran. The officers chased Stewart, surrounded him, tased him, and finally apprehended him. No one fired any shots. As he was being escorted to Trooper De Jong\u2019s patrol car, Stewart told the officers he did not mean to hurt anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">\u00b69 None of the officers were harmed during the pursuit and eventual apprehension of Stewart. During the \u201crender safe\u201d process that followed, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) Agent Brad Engelbert discovered a total of nine additional pipe bombs \u2014 seven in Stewart\u2019s car and two along the roadway \u2014 that were undetonated. The bombs were constructed from galvanized metal pipe, end caps, cannon fuse, and plastic tape, and were filled with hex nuts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>dry-wall screws, and ball bearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\u00b610 On November 16,2012, the State charged Stewart by Information with seven counts of Attempted Deliberate Homicide, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-4-103 and 45-5-102, MCA. The court held a jury trial from April 29 through May 6, 2013. The jury heard testimony from the officers involved in the pursuit and saw video footage from dashboard cameras of their vehicles. The video footage captured several of the explosions. During closing argument, the State played a portion of a video obtained by federal law enforcement agencies in which Stewart previously had made threatening statements that if law enforcement came for him, \u201cpeople will die.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\u00b6 11 During the settling of jury instructions, Stewart asked the District Court to instruct the jury on various lesser-included offenses, including misdemeanor assault. After hearing argument from both counsel, the court concluded that, as a matter of law, misdemeanor assault is a lesser-included offense of deliberate homicide. The court also concluded, however, that the evidence at trial did not support a misdemeanor assault instruction, \u201chowever formulated.\u201d The court instead decided to give an instruction on the lesser-included offense of attempted aggravated assault. Stewart asked the jury to acquit him on Counts I-IV, and to convict him on the lesser-included offense of attempted aggravated assault on Counts V-VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">\u00b612 The jury found Stewart guilty on all seven counts of attempted deliberate homicide. The District Court sentenced Stewart to serve a life term in prison on each count and declared him ineligible for parole. Stewart appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">STAJNTDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">\u00b613 We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s refusal to give an instruction on a lesser-included offense. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2008 MT 227, \u00b6 12, 344 Mont. 313, 187 P.3d 662. A district court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason. <em>State v. McLaughlin, </em>2009 MT 211, \u00b6 9, 351 Mont. 282, 210 P.3d 694. A district court has broad discretion when it instructs the jury; we review jury instructions in criminal cases to determine whether the instructions, as a whole, fully and fairly instruct the jury on the law applicable to the case. <em>McLaughlin, </em>\u00b610.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">\u00b614 <em>Whether the District Court erred when it denied Stewart\u2019s request to instruct the jury on misdemeanor assault as a lesser-included offense </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number><em>of attempted deliberate homicide.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u00b615  A defendant is entitled to a lesser-included offense instruction if: 1) the offense constitutes an included offense as defined by \u00a7 46-1-202(9), MCA, and 2) there is sufficient evidence to support an instruction on the lesser-included offense. <em>State v. Cameron, </em>2005 MT 32, \u00b6 20, 326 Mont. 51, 106 P.3d 1189. In other words, the court must give a lesser-included offense instruction if the party properly requests it and if \u201cthe jury, based on the evidence, could be warranted in finding the defendant guilty of a lesser included offense.\u201d Section 46-16-607(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\u00b616 A person commits misdemeanor assault when he purposely or knowingly causes bodily injury, to another or the reasonable apprehension of bodily injury in another. Section 45-5-201, MCA. \u201cBodily injury means physical pain, illness, or an impairment of physical condition and includes mental illness or impairment.\u201d Section 45-2-101(5), MCA. A person commits aggravated assault when he \u201cpurposely or knowingly causes serious bodily injury to another or purposely or knowingly, with the use of physical force or contact, causes reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury or death in another.\u201d Section 45-5-202, MCA. Serious bodily injury means bodily injury that: '</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">(i) creates a substantial risk of death;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">(ii) causes serious permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function or process of a bodily member or organ;or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">(iii) at the time of injury, can reasonably be expected to result in serious permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function or process of a bodily member or organ.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-10\">(b) The term includes serious mental illness or impairment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aay\">Section 45-2-101(66), MCA. \u201cA person commits the offense of attempt, when with the purpose to commit a specific offense, the person does any act toward the commission of the offense.\u201d Section 45-4-103(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">\u00b617 \u201cA defendant may be convicted only of the \u2018greatest included offense about which there is no reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Castle, </em>285 Mont. 363, 367, 948 P.2d 688, 690 (1997) (quoting \u00a7 46-16-606, MCA). We have held, and the State does not dispute, that misdemeanor assault is a lesser-included offense of deliberate homicide. <em>Castle, </em>285 Mont. at 368-69, 948 P.2d at 691. In <em>State v. Feltz, </em>2010 MT 48, 355 Mont. 308, 227 P.3d 1035, and in <em>State v. Reiner, </em>179 Mont. 239, 587 P.2d 950 (1978), we considered the issue of misdemeanor assault as a lesser-included offense of aggravated or felony assault. In both cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>we recognized that whether bodily injury is serious, within the meaning of the law, is a question for the jury to determine. <em>Feltz, </em>\u00b6 25; <em>Reiner, </em>179 Mont. at 252, 587 P.2d at 958. The trial court need not instruct the jury on misdemeanor assault, however, if the evidence shows that the only type of injury that would be feared is serious bodily injury. <em>Reiner, </em>179 Mont. at 253, 587 P.2d at 958.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u00b618 Stewart argued at trial that there was sufficient evidence for a misdemeanor assault instruction and that the jury reasonably could conclude that there was a risk of only bodily injury, as opposed to serious bodily injury. Stewart noted that the State \u201cnever put on any expert that talked about the strength of the explosive potential of the bombs that were recovered from Mr. Stewart\u2019s car, or the two that were found that never exploded.\u201d The court denied Stewart\u2019s request on the ground that the evidence \u201cdoesn\u2019t support the concept of intent to either cause mere bodily injury or to cause reasonable apprehension of mere bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\u00b619 Stewart\u2019s counsel requested at a minimum that the court instruct the jury on misdemeanor assault as a lesser-included offense on Counts I and II \u2014 the bombs that exploded in front of Trooper DeJong and Trooper Goodemoot. The court denied the request on grounds that the \u201cmanifest dangerous nature\u201d of pipe bombs, together with the officers\u2019 proximity to the bombs as they pursued Stewart, did not support a reasonable conclusion that there was an intent simply to \u201ceither scare [the troopers] by reference to mere bodily injury or to attempt mere bodily injury as distinct from the risk or actuality of serious bodily injury.\u201d The District Court instead instructed on the lesser-included offense of attempted aggravated assault with respect to all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"ADz\">\u00b620 On appeal, Stewart argues that evidence supported his defense that he \u201cwas trying only to scare the officers away during the pursuit or cause at most bodily injury \u2014 not serious bodily injury or death.\u201d The question whether he intended or attempted to cause serious bodily injury or lesser bodily injury, Stewart claims, was one of fact for the jury. Stewart argues that the court\u2019s refusal based on the \u201cmanifest dangerous nature of pipe bombs\u201d was improper because it \u201ctook that question of fact out of the jury\u2019s hands.\u201d Stewart asserts that the detonations shown in the pictures and videos \u201cwere not massive explosions,\u201d and that there was \u201cno expert testimony to inform the jury about the capacity of these pipe bombs, their force, or their actual dangerousness.\u201d Stewart underscores that the bombs caused no injuries and that he \u201crepeatedly stated he had not intended to hurt anyone.\u201d Therefore, Stewart contends that the District Court erred when it \u201cusurped the jury\u2019s role in making that determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>\u00b621 Stewart relies on <em>Feltz </em>to support his assertions. In <em>Feltz, </em>the defendant was charged with felony assault with a weapon for wielding a knife at his neighbors while swearing and calling them names. <em>Feltz, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5,11. The district court denied the defendant\u2019s request for a lesser-included offense instruction on misdemeanor assault. <em>Feltz, </em>\u00b6 12. We held that the district court erred in refusing the instruction because there was evidence to support a fear of bodily injury. We reasoned that \u201cthe size and type of knife used, the way [the defendant] held it, whether he displayed it prominently, and what [the defendant] said while doing so were in dispute.\u201d <em>Feltz, </em>\u00b6 28. Moreover, the victim did not testify that she feared for her life. <em>Feltz, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u00b622 In <em>Reiner, </em>the defendant was armed with a .357 Magnum revolver and threatened to shoot and kill suspected trespassers on the property he was caretaking. <em>Reiner, </em>179 Mont. at 242-43, 578 P.2d at 952-53. The defendant fired two shots on the ground near where the suspected trespassers were standing. The State charged him with three counts of aggravated assault. <em>Reiner, </em>179 Mont. at 243, 587 P.2d at 953. The district court denied the defendant\u2019s request for a lesser-included offense instruction on misdemeanor assault. <em>Reiner, </em>179 Mont. at 251, 587 P.2d at 957. We upheld the court\u2019s refusal of the instruction because the evidence did not support that the victims were at risk of bodily injury; rather, it was \u201cclear that defendant put his victims in reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury by his menacing use of a .357 Magnum revolver.\u201d <em>Reiner, </em>179 Mont. at 253, 587 P.2d at 958. W\u00e9 distinguished <em>Feltz </em>because the jury would not have been warranted in finding that the defendant\u2019s actions could have caused reasonable apprehension of only bodily harm. <em>Reiner, </em>179 Mont. at 253, 587 P.2d at 958.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\u00b623  As in <em>Reiner, </em>we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion because the evidence did not warrant a conviction of any offense lesser than the two offenses on which the trial court gave instructions. Stewart lit the fuses on seven pipe bombs and tossed them into the paths of oncoming law enforcement vehicles. The pipe bombs were filled with materials that easily would cause serious bodily injury if a bomb had detonated in contact with a vehicle. Stewart\u2019s argument that the State should have provided expert testimony about the \u201cactual dangerousness\u201d of pipe bombs is unpersuasive. Videos show the bombs exploding with considerable force. The videos and witness testimony demonstrate that upon explosion, shrapnel from the bombs flew substantial distances from the detonation site. Multiple law enforcement officers testified that they feared for their lives. Stewart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>previously had recorded a video in which he made threats to kill law enforcement officers. Although Stewart claims that he did not intend to hurt anyone, the jury would not have been warranted in finding that Stewart purposely or knowingly caused only reasonable apprehension of bodily injury, as opposed to reasonable apprehension of or attempt to cause serious bodily injury or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\u00b624  The trial court did not act arbitrarily, without conscientious exercise of judgment, or exceed the bounds of reason when it determined that the \u201cmanifest dangerous nature of pipe bombs\u201d and the officers\u2019 proximity to the bombs supported the jury\u2019s consideration of only the offenses of attempted deliberate homicide or attempted aggravated assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u00b625  We conclude further that the District Court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on misdemeanor assault did not prejudice Stewart\u2019s substantial rights. Despite an instruction on the lesser-included offense of attempted aggravated assault, the jury rejected that lesser charge in favor of attempted deliberate homicide on all seven counts. Given this rejection, Stewart\u2019s case does not present \u201cthe situation where the jury, convinced that the defendant is guilty of some crime, although not necessarily the crime charged, convicts the defendant rather than let his action go unpunished simply because the only alternative was acquittal.\u201d <em>Castle, </em>285 Mont. at 367, 948 P.2d at 690 (citing <em>State v. Gopher, </em>194 Mont. 227, 231, 633 P.2d 1195, 1197-98 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u00b626  The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Stewart\u2019s request to instruct the jury on misdemeanor assault as a lesser-included offense of deliberate homicide. Accordingly, the Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b86-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and SHEA concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
