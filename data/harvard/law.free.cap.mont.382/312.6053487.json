The Wayne S. Hansen Trust (Trust) appeals from two orders issued by the Third Judicial District Court, Powell County. The Trust acquired tax deeds to three tracts of real property located in Powell County, previously owned by Douglas W. Johnson (Johnson). The District Court\u2019s first order granted summary judgment to Johnson, declaring the tax deeds void, and the second order addressed the calculation of the final amount to be paid to the Trust. We affirm and address the following issues:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-13\">\n<em>1. Did the District Court err by granting summary judgment to Johnson and declaring the tax deeds void?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-14\">\n<em>2. Did the District Court err in determining the final amount due to the Trust as purchaser of the tax liens?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b343-16\">\u00b62 Johnson owned three parcels of real property located in Powell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>County that were valued collectively for tax purposes at $260,478. After Johnson failed to pay the property taxes over several years, the Trust acquired tax deeds to the properties in December of 2012. The Trust filed three quiet title actions for the respective properties in March 2013, and Johnson responded by filing his own quiet title actions on the properties. Johnson alleged that the tax deeds issued to the Trust violated statutory procedural requirements and asked that the District Court set them aside and declare his ownership interest.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay4\">\u00b63 In April 2013, upon the Trust\u2019s motion, Johnson deposited $20,000 into the Clerk of Court\u2019s trust account as a bond pursuant to \u00a7 15-18-411, MCA. Later, the District Court consolidated the six quiet title actions and dismissed Powell County and Powell County Treasurer Lisa Smith (Smith) as defendants, with the understanding that they would produce documents and other evidence as requested by the parties. In response to Johnson\u2019s requests, Powell County and Smith produced several hundred pages of records pertaining to the tax liens and deeds on the subject properties. Following a motion from the Trust, the District Court issued an order in October 2013, directing Johnson to deposit an additional $17,497.48 into the Clerk of Court\u2019s trust account, raising his deposit to $37,497.48.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AFL\">\u00b64 Johnson moved for summary judgment in December 2013, citing evidence obtained from the County to argue that both the County and the Trust had failed to comply with several statutes, and that the tax deeds were therefore void. The District Court granted summary judgment to Johnson in May 2014, finding multiple instances of statutory noncompliance in the tax deed process, and declared the tax deeds void. In the same order, the District Court denied another request from the Trust to order Johnson to deposit additional bond funds. On June 30,2014, the District Court entered judgment, ordering that Johnson\u2019s deposit be remitted to the Trust, and that a Certificate of Redemption for each of the properties be issued to Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\u00b65 On July 15,2014, the Trust filed objections and a request for relief from the judgment pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 54(c) and 58(e). On July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>28, the Trust also filed a Motion to Alter or Amend the Findings and Judgment or for a New Trial. In both of these motions, the Trust argued that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment by ignoring genuine issues of material fact, and by failing to properly calculate the final amount owed to the Trust. The Trust contended that the District Court erred by denying the Trust\u2019s request for an additional bond deposit, arguing that the $37,497.48 deposited by Johnson, which had been calculated as of July 19, 2013, failed to account for additional taxes, interests, and costs paid by the Trust. In November 2014, the District Court issued an order partially granting and partially denying the Trust\u2019s motions. Specifically, the District Court denied the request to alter or amend the grant of summary judgment, but acknowledged that the judgment failed to \u201caddress the issue of taxes accrued or paid by either party during the pendency of the proceedings.\u201d Accordingly, the District Court ordered the parties to submit additional memorandum with supporting evidence \u201cto address any discrepancy between the bond deposit returned to Defendant Hansen Trust and any final redemption amount that is still alleged owed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\u00b66 After receiving additional briefing from the parties, the District Court issued an Order Regarding Final Redemption Amount in February 2015. The District Court noted that the Trust, in its additional briefing, had submitted the affidavit of the Trustee Christian Hansen that \u201creferences unsubstantiated amounts for an additional bond deposit, accrued interest, and other disbursements, including property taxes for 2014, property insurance renewal costs, and court filing fees.\u201d However, the court further noted that \u201cDefendant Hansen Trust does not provide any supporting documentation to show how it calculates the interest nor does it provide the Court with evidence of proof of payments ....\u201d The District Court ruled that \u201cbased on the evidence presented to the Court, no additional redemption amount is due or owing to Defendant Hansen Trust.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Trust appeals from the District Court\u2019s orders granting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>summary judgment and determining the final amount owed to it.</p>\n<p id=\"Abn9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\u00b67 The Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo', performing the same analysis as does a district court. <em>Lorang v. Fortis Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 252, \u00b6 36, 345 Mont. 12, 192 P.3d 186 (citation omitted). \u201cThe judgment sought should be rendered if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M.

Did the District Court err by granting summary judgment to Johnson and declaring the tax deeds void?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">\u00b610 The Trust contends that the District Court improperly granted summary judgment and declared the tax deeds void. Generally, the Trust argues that summary judgment was improper because the record was incomplete and disputed issues remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">\u00b6 11 Tax deed proceedings require strict compliance with the governing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>statutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">Tax deed proceedings implicate a property owner\u2019s fundamental interests. The purpose behind the tax lien sales statutes is to protect property owners and their rights to due process. Due to the important interests at stake, every essential and material step required by the tax deed statutes must be strictly followed. Such exacting compliance with the statutes is necessary because the owner risks losing his or her real property for the failure to pay the property taxes. Often, very valuable property is lost for a mere pittance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-6\"><em>Hansen Trust v. Ward, </em>2015 MT 131, \u00b6 26, 379 Mont. 161, 349 P.3d 500 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). We have also held that \u201c[i]n determining the sufficiency of the tax deed proceedings, the record alone is to be considered <em>....\u2019\u2019 Moran, </em>261 Mont. at 483, 863 P.2d at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\u00b612 In his motion for summary judgment, Johnson asserted, among other claims of statutory violations, that Treasurer Smith had failed to provide the County Clerk and Recorder with a report of all persons and property owing taxes, in violation of \u00a7 15-16-301, MCA. The statute requires the county treasurer to \u201cmake a report to the county clerk and recorder in detail, showing the amount of taxes collected and a complete list of all persons and property then owing taxes.\u201d Section 15-16-301(1), MCA. As evidence of this failure, Johnson included a copy of a memo sent from Smith to the Powell County Clerk and Recorder on March 31, 2011, in which she acknowledged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">Per [\u00a7] 15-16-301, MCA, on the third Monday of June of each year, I am required to provide you with a report of the amount of taxes collected, a list of all persons and property then owing taxes and a separate report showing the amount of taxes suspended or canceled. I don\u2019t know that this has ever been done. I know I haven\u2019t prepared these reports for you since I started .... The attachments provide these reports to you for fiscal years 2007, 2008, 2009[,] and 2010. Although the statutory date requirement has not been met, this will provide a starting point for future compliance with this statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">In another memorandum, also dated March 31, 2011, Smith acknowledged that other reports required under \u00a7 15-17-214(2)(a), MCA, had likewise not been submitted to the County Clerk and Recorder. Johnson also provided records of the procedures and notices employed in this case, and detailed how they failed to satisfy statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">\u00b613 In <em>Isern v. Summerfield, </em>1998 MT 45, 287 Mont. 461, 956 P.2d 28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>the appellant taxpayer claimed that the district court had erred by granting summary judgment to the tax purchasers, and by concluding that multiple errors in the process did not void the tax deed. We agreed with the appellant taxpayer and reversed following a discussion of the statutory infractions, concluding, \u201c[gjiven the requirement of strict compliance with statutory procedures for issuing a tax deed,... we hold that the errors and omissions discussed above void the subject tax deed ....\u201d Isern, \u00b6 21. The appellant taxpayer noted several statutory errors, including a failure to comply with \u00a7 15-16-301, MCA. <em>Isern, </em>\u00b6 11. Similarly, here, Johnson demonstrated a violation of this same statute, as well as many other violations, from the records provided by the County. The District Court reviewed the records and correctly granted summary judgment to Johnson, identifying a total of thirteen errors in the tax deed process.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u00b614 The Trust argues that the record was incomplete and that genuine issues of material fact remained, but fails to articulate exactly what those issues of fact are. The records cited by Johnson were clearly sufficient to establish several violations of the statutory tax deed process. After producing records regarding these tax deed transactions, Treasurer Smith submitted an affidavit wherein she stated that \u201cadditional documentation <em>may </em>exist that was not located during the week-long search\u201d (emphasis added). The Trust emphasizes this statement in arguing that the District Court prematurely granted summary judgment without giving the Trust the opportunity to conduct \u201coriginal discovery.\u201d However, the Trust fails to show how the discovery of additional documentation could have changed the outcome \u2014 multiple statutory violations, sufficient to void the tax deeds, were already established by the uncontested evidence presented.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AtA\">\u00b615 We affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment. Montana law clearly requires \u201cexacting compliance with the statutes\u201d governing the tax deed process, and the host of errors in the statutory procedure in this case required voiding of the deeds. <em>Hansen Trust, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u00b616 <em>2. Did the District Court err in determining the final amount due to the Trust as purchaser of the tax liens ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>\u00b617 The Trust argues that the District Court failed to determine a proper equation or formula for calculation of the redemption amount<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> owed to it, that the District Court incorrectly ordered the bond deposit paid in lieu of redemption when the liens on the properties had not been properly extinguished, and that the final amount remitted by Johnson failed to include the proper interest, subsequent taxes, and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b618 A tax deed conveys to the tax purchaser, or \u201cgrantee,\u201d the \u201cabsolute title to the property described in the deed ....\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 15-18-413(1), MCA. In addition, this \u201cconveyance\u201d from the county gives to the tax purchaser \u201cthe right, if the tax deed ... [is] attacked and held irregular or void, to recover the unpaid taxes, interest, penalties, and costs that would accrue if the tax proceedings had been regular and it was desired to redeem the property.\u201d Section 15-18-413(2)(b), MCA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The delinquent taxpayer may seek to have the tax deed declared void via a quiet title action, as happened in this case, and is referred to by statute as the \u201ctrue owner.\u201d Section 15-18-411(l)(b), MCA. In such an action, the true owner may be ordered to deposit with the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">the amount of all taxes, interest, penalties, and costs that would have accrued if the property had been regularly and legally assessed and taxed as the property of the true owner and was about to be redeemed by the true owner; and the amount of all sums reasonably paid by the purchaser following the order and after 3 years from the date of the tax lien sale to preserve the property or to make improvements ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Section 15-18-411(l)(c)(i)(A)-(B), MCA. Then, if \u201cthe true owner is successful in the action and the tax proceedings are declared void, the amount deposited with the court must be paid to the purchaser\u201d of the tax lien. Section 15-18-412(3), MCA. This deposit \u201cencourages prompt return of the property to the tax rolls\u201d and \u201cprevents unjust enrichment of the owner at the expense of the tax purchaser should the owner win.\u201d <em>Ball v. Gee, </em>243 Mont. 406, 412, 795 P.2d 82, 86 (1990). \u201cThe deposit also lessens the burden on the courts and the purchasers by precluding frivolous defenses.\u201d <em>Ball, </em>243 Mont. at 412, 795 P.2d at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\u00b619 Here, the two parties and the District Court all used different equations to calculate the final amount due to the Trust after the tax deeds were declared void, and we hope to clarify the statutory equation herein. First, as used in <em>Hansen Trust, </em>\u00b6 44, the term \u201credemption amount\u201d means the \u201camount reflecting the taxes, interest, penalties, and costs that would have accrued under normal circumstances.\u201d This amount, which a court may order to be deposited with the court, represents the amount the delinquent taxpayer or \u201ctrue owner\u201d would have had to pay to the County \u201cif the property had been regularly and legally assessed and taxed as the property of the true owner and was about to be redeemed by the true owner.\u201d Section 15-18-411(l)(c)(i)(A), MCA. In other words, the statute requires a calculation as if redemption were taking place by a payment to the County at that moment in the litigation,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which consists of the \u201camount of taxes due, including penalties, interest, and costs, as of the date of the notice of pending tax deed issuance ....\u201d Section 15-18-212(6)(e), MCA. In addition, \u201c[t]he amount of interest and costs provided for in subsection (6)(e) continues to accrue until the date of redemption ....\u201d Section 15-18-212(7), MCA. Thus, reading these provisions together, we conclude the redemption amount requires a calculation of a sum of the unpaid taxes, interest that accumulates at the statutory rate until the date of deposit, and the costs and penalties assessed up until the date of deposit. Additional interest that may accrue on this amount during further litigation and additional costs are discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">\u00b620 The next amount required by statute to be repaid by the true owner is any property taxes on the property paid by the tax purchaser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>subsequent to issuance of the tax deed. Section 15-18-412(6), MCA, provides that the court \u201cshall also determine the rights resulting from any additional taxes on the property accruing or being paid by either party during the pendency of the suit.\u201d If the tax purchaser has paid property taxes on the property subsequent to issuance of the tax deed, the true owner must reimburse this cost. <em>See also Hansen Trust, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"AIL\">\u00b621 The next item in the equation is costs. By statute, the true owner must deposit \u201cthe amount of all sums reasonably paid by the [tax] purchaser,\u201d after the court\u2019s deposit order and at least 3 years after the date of the tax lien sale, \u201cto preserve the property or to make improvements on the property while in the purchaser\u2019s possession....\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 15-18-411(l)(c)(i)(B), MCA. Further, \u201ccosts\u201d are also defined as those that are incurred by the tax purchaser and are \u201crequired by law.\u201d Section 15-17-121(2)(b), MCA; <em>Hansen Trust, </em>\u00b6 42. We have held that, even if costs such as property insurance, administrative expenses, and attorney fees could be considered reasonable, they are not \u201crequired by law\u201d and are not reimbursable. <em>See Hansen Trust, </em>\u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">\u00b622 Finally, there is the issue of additional interest that may be claimed during the course of litigation. As discussed above, the redemption amount necessarily includes the unpaid taxes, interest that accumulates until the date of deposit, and costs and penalties. In <em>Hansen Trust, </em>we also affirmed the District Court\u2019s award of interest to the tax purchaser that had accumulated on the true owner\u2019s deposit during the litigation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Hansen Trust, </em>\u00b6 41. However, the decision to award any such interest lies within the discretion of the presiding court, and a tax purchaser is not automatically entitled to such an award. <em>See </em>\u00a7 15-18-412(7), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\u00b623 Here, the District Court ordered Johnson to deposit $37,497.48, which included property taxes for tax years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, accumulated interest on that sum assessed by the Trust, insurance premiums, court filing costs, and publication costs. As explained herein, there is no provision in the statutes entitling a tax purchaser to collect interest on the redemption amounts owed or other costs not expressly required by law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 15-17-121(2), MCA; \u00a7 15-18-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321a\">*321a</page-number>411(l)(c)(i)(B), MCA. On the other hand, the Trust points out that the $37,497.48 amount was calculated only as of July 19,2013, and did not include the subsequent taxes it paid for tax years 2013 and 2014. However, the Trust failed to submit the necessary documentation when ordered by the District Court, leading the court to conclude that the Trust had waived further reimbursement. While further proceedings, in light of this opinion, may well have resulted in both positive and negative adjustments in the amount properly payable to the Trust, its waiver of further reimbursement, and Johnson\u2019s lack of a challenge to the $37,497.48 ordered by the District Court, leads us to the conclusion that affirming the judgment as entered is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b352-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, SHEA and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-17\"> The Trust raises 19 issues on appeal.

In its motion, the Trust requested a deposit in the amount of $79,421.39. Included in that sum were accrued taxes for the years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, penalties, interest, property insurance premiums, publication costs, court filing fees, trust administrative expenses, andlegal fees. In ordering Johnson to deposit $37,497.48, the District Court specifically did not include trust administrative expenses or attorney fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b345-6\"> The Trust filed a third post-judgment motion for relief pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1) and (5) on March 2, 2015, requesting that the District Court consider the \u201cexcluding of those receipts from its Memorandum as being an inadvertent mistake.\u201d The Trust included an affidavit and receipts that had not been submitted previously. This documentation contained the property insurance premium information, as well as receipts for the 2013 and 2014 tax year payments. The District Court denied this motion, finding the Trust\u2019s supplemental documentation was untimely. On May 11, 2015, Johnson filed a motion that requested the District Court to order the Powell County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Treasurer to mail the tax bills for the properties to him, and not to the Trust. In its answer, the Trust argued that the District Court should use its authority <em>sua sponte </em>to resolve the discrepancy between the bond deposit and the redemption amount, and that the matter of the tax bills should be held in abeyance. By then, the appeal had been filed to this Court, and the District Court concluded that it was \u201cdivested of jurisdiction to address this matter further.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b348-7\"> The Trust also argues that summary judgment was improperly entered because \u201crevelations of the county\u2019s alleged nonfeasance, misfeasance, and knowledgeable contributions to the problems\u201d in the tax deed process \u201cconstituted a genuinely disputed material issue.\u201d However, this was a quiet title proceeding in which the County claimed no interest in the property, and in which no claims against the County were filed, if any could have been. The District Court\u2019s dismissal of the county defendants was proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\"> We use the term \u201credemption amount\u201d here because it has been used throughout the course of this case (e.g., the District Court\u2019s \u201cOrder Regarding Final Redemption Amount\u201d), and has been used in our previous case law. <em>See, e.g., Hansen Trust, </em>\u00b6 44. The term \u201credemption\u201d is primarily used in statute to refer to the process of extinguishing a tax hen on a property by payment to the County, as codified in \u00a7 15-18-111, MCA, et seq., wherein the delinquent taxpayer or interested party is referred to as the \u201credemptioner.\u201d Section 15-18-112(2)-(3), MCA. However, the use of the term within the context here clearly refers to the amount to be reimbursed directly to the tax purchaser in tax litigation. <em>See also </em>\u00a7 15-18-412(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b349-8\"> We take this opportunity to clarify our discussion of this statute in <em>Hansen Trust, </em>\u00b6 42. In describing the rights of the tax purchaser after a tax deed has been declared void, as provided by \u00a7 15-18-413(2), MCA, we stated that the term \u201cconveyance\u201d in the statute refers to a \u201cnew deed,\u201d presumably transferring the property back to the true owner. <em>Hansen Trust, </em>\u00b6 42, n.4. However, as used here, the term \u201cconveyance\u201d actually describes the original conveyance from the county to the tax purchaser by way of the tax deed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b350-6\"> Section 15-18-413(2)(b), MCA, contains very similar language, entitling a tax purchaser, in the event that the tax deed is declared void, to recover the amount that would have accrued \u201cif the tax proceedings had been regular and it was desired to redeem the property.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b351-6\"> The Court cited to \u00a7 15-18-412(3), MCA, as authority for awarding interest that had accrued on the deposit during the litigation. <em>See Hansen Trust, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 41,47. However, interest is not referenced in that provision, and authority for this award is more properly derived from \u00a7 15-18-412(7), MCA, which provides that \u201c[i]n the quiet title action, the court has complete jurisdiction to fix the amount of taxes that should have been paid, including penalties, interest, and costs, and to determine all questions necessary in granting full relief...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
