We address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\">\n<em>Whether the District Court erred when it denied Deshazer\u2019s motion to dismiss for improper venue.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\u00b63 In December 2013, the State of Montana charged Deshazer with felony theft by common scheme for double-cashing seven paychecks issued by SS Staffing Inc., an employment agency located in Ravalli County. SS Staffing issued the paychecks for Deshazer\u2019s work as a temporary employee at The Springs, a senior living community in Missoula County.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">\u00b64 Between October and December 2012, Deshazer electronically deposited the seven paychecks to his Bank of America account via a mobile banking application on his smartphone. Using the application, Deshazer sent a photograph of each paycheck and a note of its amount to Bank of America for deposit. After making the electronic deposits, Deshazer retained the physical paychecks; then, between February and April 2013, Deshazer endorsed, submitted, and received cash for those same paychecks at either a Walmart or an Albertson\u2019s in Missoula. Bitterroot Valley Bank in Ravalli County,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> where SS Staffing does its banking, honored all fourteen deposits and later reimbursed SS Staffing for the duplicate charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">\u00b65 In April 2013, an SS Staffing employee reported the double-cashed paychecks to the Hamilton Police Department in Ravalli County. Deshazer admitted to double-cashing the paychecks, and the State charged him in Ravalli County with one count of felony theft by common scheme. Deshazer moved to dismiss the charges against him, alleging that they were brought in an improper venue. At a May 8, 2014 pre-trial hearing, the District Court verbally denied Deshazer\u2019s motion, concluding that Ravalli County was a proper venue. The District Court issued its written opinion and order denying Deshazer\u2019s motion on June 2, 2014. The District Court concluded that the State could charge Deshazer with theft in Ravalli County because the stolen funds were unlawfully transferred from SS Staffing\u2019s bank account at Bitterroot Valley Bank in Ravalli County.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>\u00b66 On June 3, 2014, at the conclusion of a non-jury trial, Deshazer was convicted of felony theft by common scheme. The parties stipulated to $1,549.03 in restitution, and Deshazer was sentenced to a five-year commitment to the Department of Corrections. On appeal, Deshazer contends that the District Court erred by denying his motion to dismiss for improper venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\u00b67 We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case. <em>State v. Young, </em>2007 MT 323, \u00b6 24, 340 Mont. 153, 174 P.3d 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">\u00b68 <em>Whether the District Court erred when it denied Deshazer\u2019s motion to dismiss for improper venue.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">\u00b69 The Montana Constitution safeguards a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a trial by a. \u201cjury of the county or district in which the offense is alleged to have been committed.\u201d Mont. Const, art II, \u00a7 24. In line with this provision, \u00a7 46-3-110(1), MCA, requires criminal charges to be filed \u201cin the county where the offense was committed.\u201d However, when the requisite acts of a criminal offense occur in more than one county, \u201cthe charge may be filed in any county in which any of the acts or offenses occurred.\u201d Section 46-3-112(1), MCA. Similarly, \u201cif the county in which the offense was committed cannot be readily determined, the offender may be charged in any county in which it appears that an element of the offense occurred.\u201d Section 46-3-114(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">\u00b610 The State charged Deshazer with the crime of felony theft by common scheme pursuant to \u00a7 45-6-301(1), MCA. \u201cA person commits the offense of theft when the person purposely or knowingly obtains or exerts unauthorized control over property of the owner\u201d with \u201cthe purpose of depriving the owner of the property.\u201d Section 45-6-301(1), MCA. Felony theft thus consists of two elements: \u201ca knowing exertion of control and a purpose to deprive.\u201d <em>State v. Eagle Speaker, </em>2000 MT 152, \u00b6 13, 300 Mont. 115, 4 P.3d 1 (citing \u00a7 45-6-301(1)(a), MCA (Compiler\u2019s Cmts.)). Under the Montana Constitution, the State had the authority to bring charges against Deshazer in any county in which either of these elements occurred. <em>See Eagle Speaker, </em>\u00b6 24 (\u201c[T]he offense of theft occurs for jurisdictional purposes where the elements of that offense take place.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">\u00b611 The parties dispute the moment in time at which Deshazer \u201cknowingly exert[ed] unauthorized control\u201d over the property of SS Staffing. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-6-301(1), MCA. In its order denying Deshazer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>motion to dismiss, the District Court concluded that Ravalli County was an appropriate venue because \u201cthe requisite act of exerting unauthorized control over money occurred when Deshazer cashed each of the 7 checks a second time, causing funds to be unlawfully transferred from SS Staffing\u2019s bank account at Bitterroot Valley Bank, thereby acting negatively upon these two Ravalli County based entities.\u201d On appeal, Deshazer contends that Ravalli County was not a proper venue because \u201cMr. Deshazer completed the theft when he accepted the cash\u201d and, thus, \u201c[e]very element of Mr. Deshazer\u2019s theft transpired within Missoula County.\u201d By contrast, the State contends that \u201c[ujnauthorized control did not occur until Bitterroot Valley Bank transferred the funds\u201d for the duplicate checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\u00b612 \u201c[A] theft is complete once all the elements of the theft transpired.\u201d <em>Eagle Speaker, </em>\u00b6 15. The State cites <em>State v. Cline, </em>170 Mont. 520, 555 P.3d 724 (1976), to support its argument that Deshazer\u2019s theft was not complete until the funds for the duplicate checks were retracted from SS Staffing\u2019s bank account at Bitterroot Valley Bank. In <em>Cline, </em>we held that Lewis and Clark County was a proper venue to charge a defendant with obtaining money by false pretenses because one of the elements of that crime \u2014 \u201cfraud in obtaining the state\u2019s settlement money\u201d \u2014 occurred \u201cin Lewis and Clark County where the settlement money was disbursed.\u201d <em>Cline, </em>170 Mont. at 533, 555 P.3d at 732-33. Deshazer attempts to distinguish <em>Cline </em>by arguing that, in <em>Cline, </em>\u201cthe disbursal action completed the element of fraud.\u201d By contrast, Deshazer argues, a theft charge does not require a victim to assent to action, so Deshazer committed a theft \u201cas soon as\u201d he received cash for his paychecks at Albertson\u2019s or Walmart.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u00b613 Section 45-6-301(1), MCA, specifically requires the exertion of \u201cunauthorized control over the property <em>of the owner\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The parties do not dispute that SS Staffing owned the bank account from which the money for Deshazer\u2019s duplicate paychecks was retracted. Until the funds were transferred out of SS Staffing\u2019s account, Deshazer did not exert unauthorized control over SS Staffing\u2019s property. We find Deshazer\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Cline </em>unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">\u00b614 SS Staffing, based in Ravalli County, issued Deshazer\u2019s paychecks. Deshazer first electronically deposited seven paychecks into his own bank account. He then took the same seven paychecks to retailers in Missoula County and received cash in exchange for them. Deshazer did not obtain control of SS Staffing\u2019s property until the duplicate amounts were transferred from SS Staffing\u2019s bank account at Bitterroot Valley Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>\u00b615  Had Deshazer\u2019s theft been interrupted immediately after he had cashed the checks, or had Bitterroot Valley Bank refused to honor the checks before retracting the money from SS Staffing\u2019s bank account, then Deshazer\u2019s theft would have been perpetrated against Walmart and Albertson\u2019s, since they would have been the \u201cowners\u201d of the money over which he had exercised \u201cunauthorized control.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-6-301(1), MCA. But that is not what happened in this case. The checks were honored, and duplicate funds were retracted from SS Staffing\u2019s account, thus completing Deshazer\u2019s theft of SS Staffing\u2019s funds. Accordingly, the element of theft requiring the exertion of unauthorized control over property of the owner occurred in Ravalli County when the stolen funds were transferred out of SS Staffing\u2019s bank account. The District Court did not err in concluding that Ravalli County was a proper venue for the State to charge Deshazer with felony theft by common scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">\u00b616 We affirm the District Court\u2019s decision and order denying Deshazer\u2019s motion to dismiss for improper venue.</p>\n<judges id=\"b123-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, McKINNON and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-10\"> Deshazer requests that this Court take judicial notice of the Secretary of State\u2019s Registry that Bitterroot Valley Bank is located in Lolo, in Missoula County. We decline to do so, as that fact was not presented below and we \u201cwill not consider on appeal facts that are not found in the record.\u201d <em>State v. Bromgard, </em>273 Mont. 20, 23, 901 P.2d 611, 613 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
