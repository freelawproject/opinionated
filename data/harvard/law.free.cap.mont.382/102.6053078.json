We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">\u00b62 In April 2014, MEIC filed suit in the Fifth Judicial District Court, challenging the DEQ\u2019s decision to approve the expansion of GSM\u2019s gold mine to include a smaller nearby pit. MEIC contended that the reclamation plan the DEQ chose to reclaim the nearby pit violated Article IX, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution and the Montana Metal Mine Reclamation Act (MMRA), \u00a7 82-4-301, MCA, et seq. MEIC argued that Article IX, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution and the MMRA require land disturbed by the taking of natural resources to be \u201cfully reclaimed\u201d to its previous condition, and that the reclamation plan the DEQ chose to reclaim the pit failed to do so. MEIC maintained that the DEQ must adopt a reclamation plan that requires GSM to completely backfill the pit after closure in order to comply with the Montana Constitution and the MMRA. MEIC also contended that the DEQ\u2019s decision to select the particular reclamation plan was arbitrary and capricious because the criteria set forth in the MMRA were not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">\u00b63 In response, the Appellees asserted that MEIC should be collaterally estopped from relitigating whether the Montana Constitution and the MMRA require lands disturbed by a mining operation to be fully reclaimed. Appellees argued that, in connection with a reclamation plan for a different pit at GSM\u2019s mine, this precise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>question had already been litigated, with MEIC receiving an adverse ruling from the District Court. Alternatively, the Appellees argued that neither the Montana Constitution nor the MMRA require full reclamation of disturbed lands. The Appellees also maintained that the DEQ\u2019s decision regarding its choice of reclamation plans was supported by substantial evidence under the criteria set forth in the MMRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">\u00b64 The District Court agreed with the Appellees, concluding that MEIC\u2019s constitutional and statutory arguments were collaterally estopped and the DEQ\u2019s decision was supported by the evidence under the MMRA criteria. We \u00e1ffirm the District Court\u2019s decision regarding collateral estoppel and thus do not address the merits of whether Article IX, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution and the MMRA require land disturbed by the taking of natural resources to be fully reclaimed to its previous condition. We also affirm the District Court\u2019s holding that the criteria under the MMRA were satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u00b65 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">\n<em>1. Whether MEIC is precluded from relitigating the issue of whether Article IX, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution requires land disturbed by the taking of natural resources to be fully reclaimed to its previous condition.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">\n<em>2. Whether MEIC is precluded from relitigating the issue of whether the Montana Metal Mine Reclamation Act requires land disturbed by the taking of natural resources to be fully reclaimed to its previous condition.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">\n<em>3. Whether the DEQ made a reasoned decision in selecting the Agency-Modified Alternative under the criteria set forth in the Montana Metal Mine Reclamation Act.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">\u00b66 Golden Sunlight Mines operates an open pit gold mine on the southern edge of the Bull Mountains near Whitehall, Montana. In September 2012, GSM submitted an application to the DEQ to amend the operating permit for its mine, proposing to expand its mining operation to develop a smaller nearby pit that the parties refer to as the North Area Pit. The North Area Pit is estimated to cover approximately 49.4 acres. The expansion would allow GSM to mine an additional 4.2 million tons of gold ore and extend GSM\u2019s current mining operation by about two years. GSM proposed mining the North Area Pit through the use of conventional open pit mining methods which would be consistent with its current mining operation. In order to obtain the gold ore beneath the North Area Pit, GSM proposed excavating below the natural water table and installing external <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>dewatering wells adjacent to the North Area Pit to lower the water table beneath the pit and allow for the mineral extraction.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\u00b67 As part of the proposed expansion, GSM submitted a reclamation plan for the North Area Pit to the DEQ. In 2013, the DEQ issued a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) which discussed the impacts of four alternative reclamation plans for the North Area Pit: (1) the No Action Alternative; (2) the GSM Proposed Reclamation Alternative; (3) the Agency-Modified Alternative; and (4) the North Area Pit Backfill Alternative. The No Action Alternative reflects the current mining operation conducted under GSM\u2019s existing permit with no management plan for an additional disturbance at the North Area Pit. Under the GSM Proposed Reclamation Alternative, the approximately 52.6 million tons of non-ore waste rock that will be generated from the North Area Pit will be primarily placed in an expansion area on the east side of the mine. The GSM Proposed Reclamation Alternative requires GSM to continue to operate its external dewatering wells after closure of the mine to prevent contamination of local groundwater. In addition, GSM must install an underground in-pit sump to protect against local groundwater contamination in the event that one of the external dewatering wells fails. The Agency-Modified Alternative is the same as the GSM Proposed Reclamation Alternative with the exception of various additional modifications developed by the DEQ to further mitigate environmental impacts associated with the mining. These modifications include: (1) the implementation of closure geodetic and ground-movement monitoring for the North Area Pit to ensure safe access and to keep reclamation systems working, and (2) the preparation of a detailed bat and raptor habitat plan for the North Area Pit to provide habitat and add utility to the North Area Pit highwall. Lastly, the fourth proposed reclamation plan identified as the North Area Pit Backfill Alternative requires GSM to use 9.2 million tons of waste rock from the mine to backfill the North Area Pit. Like the GSM Proposed Reclamation Alternative and the Agency-Modified Alternative, the Backfill Alternative requires GSM to continue to operate the external dewatering wells after closure. However, unlike the other alternatives, the Backfill Alternative does not allow for the installation of an in-pit sump to protect against contamination of local groundwater in the event of an external dewatering well failure. In the draft EIS, the DEQ extensively analyzed the advantages and disadvantages associated with these four alternatives and evaluated the alternatives in light of the criteria set forth in the MMRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b68 Following a public hearing and comments, the DEQ issued a final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>EIS identifying the Agency-Modified Alternative as the preferred alternative. In rejecting the Backfill Alternative, the DEQ recognized several benefits associated with the Backfill Alternative, including better structural stability, increased wildlife habitat, and added aesthetic value. However, despite these advantages, the DEQ rejected the Backfill Alternative in lieu of the Agency-Modified Alternative, concluding that the Backfill Alternative failed to sufficiently mitigate the risk of groundwater contamination because it did not permit GSM to install an in-pit sump. The DEQ explained that local groundwater and surface water contamination could result if the natural water table rebounds and comes into contact with the acidic North Area Pit highwalls. The DEQ found that unlike the Agency-Modified Alternative in which the underground sump would prevent the water table from rebounding in the event of an external dewatering well failure, \u201c[i]f the external dewatering wells were to fail under the North Area Pit Backfill Alternative, it is unlikely that replacement wells could be installed before impacted groundwater begins to discharge from the North Area Pit.\u201d Thus, the DEQ explained that it chose the Agency-Modified Alternative rather than the Backfill Alternative because the Agency-Modified Alternative provided adequate assurance that pollution of the local aquifers and surface waters would not occur. The Backfill Alternative did not provide such assurances.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">\u00b69 On January 9, 2014, the DEQ approved the expansion of GSM\u2019s mine to include the proposed North Area Pit and issued a Record of Decision (ROD) outlining the reasons for its decision. On April 8,2014, MEIC filed its complaint, challenging the DEQ\u2019s decision to approve the expansion of the existing mining operation to include the North Area Pit with the Agency-Modified Alternative as the chosen reclamation plan. MEIC contended that the DEQ\u2019s decision to choose the Agency-Modified Alternative violated the Montana Constitution and the MMRA. MEIC argued that Article IX, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution requires that all land disturbed by a mining operation must be \u201cfully reclaimed\u201d to its previous condition, and that, because of this constitutional mandate, the MMRA must also require all lands to be fully reclaimed. MEIC further sought a legal declaration from the District Court that to the extent the MMRA could be interpreted to \u201callow less than full reclamation\u201d the MMRA violated Article IX, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution. Finally, MEIC maintained that the DEQ\u2019s decision to adopt the Agency-Modified Alternative was arbitrary and capricious because the alternative did not satisfy the criteria under the MMRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\u00b610 In response, the Appellants argued that MEIC should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>collaterally estopped from contending that Article IX, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution and the MMRA require full reclamation of disturbed lands because that issue had been previously litigated in <em>Montana Environmental Information Center v. Montana Department of Environmental Quality, </em>2011 Mont. Dist. LEXIS 99 (5th Jud. Dist. Ct. June 30, 2011) (hereinafter, <em>MEIC I). </em>In <em>MEIC I, </em>MEIC filed suit against the DEQ and GSM in the Fifth Judicial District Court, challenging the DEQ\u2019s adoption of its reclamation plan regarding a large open pit mine also located at GSM\u2019s mine near Whitehall. The parties refer to this open pit mine as the Mineral Hill Pit. As in the present case, MEIC claimed that the reclamation plan was unlawful under the Montana Constitution and the MMRA. Similarly, MEIC argued that Article IX, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution and the MMRA require all land disturbed by mining operations to be \u201cfully reclaimed\u201d to its previous condition. MEIC likewise sought a legal declaration that to the extent the MMRA \u201callows less than full reclamation\u201d the statute was in violation of this constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\u00b611 The District Court disagreed with MEIC in <em>MEIC I, </em>holding that Article IX, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution does not require disturbed land to be returned to its previous condition. Instead, the District Court concluded that the constitutional standard by which legislative actions are measured under Article IX, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution is whether the Legislature has provided \u201creasonable\u201d standards for the reclamation of disturbed lands. Citing the language of the Montana Constitution, the transcripts from the 1972 Constitutional Convention, and a lack of precedent from this Court indicating that reclamation is a fundamental right, the court explained that the constitutional provision \u201cprovide[s] a guide for the legislature\u201d and that the \u201clegislature is authorized to do that which is reasonable\u201d under the provision. MEIC did not appeal the District Court\u2019s decision in <em>MEIC I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\u00b612 In the present case, based on its conclusion in <em>MEIC I, </em>the District Court held that MEIC was estopped from relitigating the question of whether Article IX, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution and the MMRA require land disturbed by the taking of natural resources to be fully reclaimed to its previous condition. The court explained that in <em>MEIC I </em>it \u201csquarely rejected MEIC\u2019s argument that \u2018[Article IX, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution] requires restoration of the ground to its previous condition.\u2019 \u201d The court further explained that in <em>MEIC I </em>it expressly \u201cheld that this provision provides a \u2018guide for the legislature\u2019 \u201d and \u201cempowers the legislature to \u2018do that which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>reasonable.\u2019 \u201d After determining that \u201c[cjollateral estoppel precludes MEIC from arguing that the MMRA is unconstitutional to the extent that it did not require restoration of the ground to its previous condition,\u201d the court concluded that the Agency-Modified Alternative satisfied the criteria under the MMRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on motions for summary judgment de novo. <em>Gibbs v. Altenhofen, </em>2014 MT 200, \u00b6 8, 376 Mont. 61, 330 P.3d 458. Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\u201d together with any affidavits, demonstrate that no genuine issue exists as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Dewey v. Stringer, </em>2014 MT 136, \u00b6 6, 375 Mont. 176, 325 P.3d 1236. The availability of collateral estoppel and the preclusive effect of a prior judgment are also reviewed de novo. <em>Brilz v. Metro. Gen. Ins. Co., </em>2012 MT 184, \u00b6 13, 366 Mont. 78, 285 P.3d 494.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\u00b614 We review an agency\u2019s decision not classified as a contested case under the Montana Administrative Procedure Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> using the same standard as the district court. We determine whether the agency decision was \u201carbitrary, capricious, unlawful, or not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Clark Fork Coal. v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Quality, </em>2008 MT 407, \u00b6 21, 347 Mont. 197, 197 P.3d 482. In making this inquiry, \u201cwe consider whether the decision was \u2018based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clark Fork, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>North Fork Pres. Ass\u2019n v. Dep\u2019t of State Lands, </em>238 Mont. 451, 465, 778 P.2d 862, 871 (1989)). Although our review of an agency decision is narrow, we will not \u201cautomatically defer to the agency \u2018without carefully reviewing the record and satisfying [ourjselves that the agency has made a reasoned decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clark Fork, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>Friends of the Wild Swan v. DNRC, </em>2000 MT 209, \u00b6 28, 301 Mont. 1, 6 P.3d 972).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">\u00b615 <em>1. Whether MEIC is precluded from relitigating the issue of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number><em>whether Article IX, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution requires land disturbed by the taking of natural resources to be fully reclaimed to its previous condition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b616 Issue preclusion (collateral estoppel) bars a party from relitigating an issue already decided in prior litigation. <em>Baltrusch v. Baltrusch, </em>2006 MT 51, \u00b6 15, 331 Mont. 281, 130 P.3d 1267. The doctrine ensures that \u201conce a court decides an issue of fact or law necessary to its judgment, that decision precludes relitigation of the same issue in a different cause of action between the same parties.\u201d <em>Brilz, </em>\u00b6 18. Issue preclusion serves dual purposes. First, it protects the interests of litigants by \u201crelieving] parties of the expense and vexation of multiple lawsuits.\u201d <em>Brilz, </em>\u00b6 18. Second, it promotes judicial economy by \u201cprevent[ing] parties from incessantly waging piecemeal, collateral attacks against judgments.\u201d <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 15. In substantively considering whether the issues are the same in the former and present actions, we do not equate an issue with \u201celements of a cause of action.\u201d Rather, \u201cthe bar that arises from collateral estoppel extends to all questions essential to the judgment and actively determined by a prior valid judgment.\u201d <em>McDaniel v. State, </em>2009 MT 159, \u00b6 33, 350 Mont. 422, 208 P.3d 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b617 We apply a four-element test to determine whether relitigation of an issue is barred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">1. Was the issue decided in the prior adjudication identical to the issue raised in the action in question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-7\">2. Was there a final judgment on the merits in the prior adjudication?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">3. Was the party against whom preclusion is now asserted a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">4. Was the party against whom preclusion is now asserted afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue which may be barred?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-10\"><em>Omimex Can., LTD. v. State, </em>2015 MT 102, \u00b6 13, 378 Mont. 490, 346 P.3d 1125 (citing <em>McDaniel, </em>\u00b6 28). The parties agree that the final three elements of the issue preclusion test are satisfied. Further, the parties do not dispute that in <em>MEIC I </em>MEIC directly presented the District Court with the question of whether Article IX, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution requires disturbed land to be restored to its previous condition, and that the court \u201csquarely rejected\u201d this argument. MEIC thus focuses on the first element \u2014 whether the issue is identical \u2014 and advances two arguments in support of its contention that the issue in <em>MEIC I </em>is not identical to the issue in the present action. First, MEIC argues that the legal issue here and the legal issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>in <em>MEIC I </em>are different because the constitutional standard it advanced in <em>MEIC I </em>is not the standard it puts forth in the current litigation. Second, MEIC argues that factual differences in the two actions create different issues. We address MEIC\u2019s arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"AnvK\">\u00b618 MEIC begins by arguing that the District Court\u2019s holding entirely \u201cmisses the point\u201d with respect to its constitutional argument in this case, contending that, contrary to the District Court\u2019s understanding, MEIC did not argue that Article IX, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution requires land disturbed by the taking of natural resources to be fully reclaimed to its previous condition. Instead, MEIC maintains that its argument here and in the District Court below is that the Constitution requires the \u201cDEQ to choose the most effective reclamation alternative\u201d and the \u201cBackfill Alternative most effectively reclaims the land disturbed by the North Area Pit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b619 The Appellees respond that the legal issue here is the same as the legal issue in <em>MEIC I </em>and MEIC is attempting on appeal to reframe the same constitutional argument it made in <em>MEIC I </em>in order to avoid issue preclusion. The Appellees argue that the constitutional standard MEIC has offered \u201chas been somewhat of a moving target during the course of the GSM litigation.\u201d Appellees observe that in the District Court MEIC argued that the Constitution requires \u201cfull reclamation,\u201d but on appeal MEIC argues that the Constitution requires the \u201cmost effective reclamation alternative.\u201d The Appellees maintain the legal issue nevertheless remains the same: \u201cwhether the Constitution requires [full] restoration of land disturbed by natural resource extraction.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\u00b620 We agree with the Appellees that MEIC raised the same legal issue in <em>MEIC I </em>that it raises in the present action. We have explained that a \u201clitigant cannot avoid preclusion simply by reframing the same issues or raising novel contentions.\u201d <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 25. If this were the case, \u201ca party could escape the preclusive effect of an adverse judgment\u201d in every case by using different language to describe the same argument. <em>B&amp;B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis </em>Indus.,_U.S._, 135 S. Ct. 1293, 1308 (2015). While MEIC couches its argument on appeal in terms of the \u201cmost effective\u201d reclamation alternative, MEIC stated in its complaint in the present action, as it did in <em>MEIC I, </em>that Article IX, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution requires \u201cfull reclamation.\u201d Similarly, in both complaints, MEIC sought a legal declaration that to the extent the MMRA \u201callows less than full reclamation\u201d the MMRA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>is unconstitutional. Further, MEIC argues on appeal that the DEQ cannot constitutionally choose a reclamation alternative that \u201creclaims less land\u201d than another alternative. Although MEIC\u2019s argument can certainly be stated in any number of different ways, the constitutional standard MEIC advocated for in <em>MEIC I </em>and the constitutional standard that it advocates for in the present litigation are indistinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\u00b621 Moreover, even if we were to accept MEIC\u2019s assertion that it is offering a different constitutional standard than it offered in <em>MEIC I, </em>MEIC would still be precluded from advancing it because MEIC could have raised that different legal theory in the former litigation. We have explained that merely because a litigant advances a new contention in a second action, it does not necessarily follow that the new contention is exempt from preclusion. <em>Haines Pipeline Constr. v. Mont. Power Co., </em>265 Mont. 282, 288-89, 876 P.2d 632, 636-37 (1994). \u201c Tf a new legal theory or factual assertion put forward in the second action is related to the subject-matter and relevant to the issues that were litigated and adjudicated previously, so that it <em>could </em>have been raised, the judgment is conclusive on it despite the fact that it was not in fact expressly pleaded or otherwise urged.\u2019 \u201d <em>McDaniel, </em>\u00b6 33 (quoting <em>Haines, </em>265 Mont. at 288-89, 876 P.2d at 636-37) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\u00b622 In <em>MEIC I, </em>MEIC pressed the District Court to decide the constitutional standard under Article IX, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution. MEIC could have pleadedor otherwise urged the District Court to adopt whatever constitutional standard it believed to be appropriate. It elected to argue that the Constitution requires disturbed land to be restored to its previous condition. The District Court disagreed with MEIC, holding instead that the Constitution requires that the statutory scheme achieve \u201creasonable\u201d reclamation. MEIC now attempts to challenge that determination in a separate action involving the same parties, contending that the \u201cConstitution does not direct the legislature to enact \u2018reasonable\u2019 standards,\u201d and that such an interpretation is \u201chollow\u201d and a \u201cdead letter.\u201d MEIC had an opportunity to make this argument and challenge the District Court\u2019s determination by appealing the court\u2019s decision in <em>MEIC I </em>to this Court. For whatever reason, MEIC did not do so. Issue preclusion now prevents MEIC from raising the same issue with respect to the North Area Pit that it raised, and lost, with respect to the Mineral Hill Pit. In <em>MEIC I, </em>the District Court conclusively addressed the constitutional standard under Article IX, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\u00b623 We next turn to MEIC\u2019s argument that it can avoid issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>preclusion because of the factual differences between the Mineral Hill Pit and the North Area Pit. MEIC asserts that the \u201ctwo pits are materially different,\u201d and that these factual differences have legal significance, thereby preventing the issues from being the same. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u00b624 Issue preclusion applies with equal force to both issues of law and issues of fact. In cases involving the same issues of law, issue preclusion is appropriate when the factual differences between the two actions \u201care of no legal significance whatever in resolving the issue presented in both cases.\u201d <em>United States v. Stauffer Chem. Co., </em>464 U.S. 165, 174, 104 S. Ct. 575, 579 (1984). <em>Accord Pacific Power &amp; Light Co. v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>246 Mont. 398, 404, 804 P.2d 397, 401 (1991). The United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stauffer </em>and this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pacific Power </em>provide clear illustrations of the category of cases, in which the present case falls, where the party opposing the preclusive effect of collateral estoppel sought to relitigate legal issues in which the different facts of the underlying litigation and the former litigation were not legally significant in determining the issue presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u00b625 In <em>Stauffer, </em>the United States Supreme Court addressed whether the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) could relitigate the issue of whether private contractors are \u201cauthorized representatives\u201d as that term is used in the Clean Air Act. <em>Stauffer, </em>464 U.S. at 166, 104 S. Ct. at 576. In previous litigation, <em>Stauffer Chemical Co. v. EPA, </em>647 F.2d 1075 (10th Cir. 1981) (hereinafter, <em>Stauffer I), </em>private contractors from the EPA attempted to conduct an inspection of one of Stauffer\u2019s phosphate plants in Wyoming, but Stauffer refused to allow them to enter the plant. In <em>Stauffer I, </em>Stauffer argued that he did not need to permit the contractors entry because private contractors are not \u201cauthorized representatives\u201d under the Clean Air Act for purposes of conducting inspections. The district court agreed, and the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. In a subsequent action filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, <em>Stauffer Chemical Co., v. EPA , </em>511 F. Supp. 744 (M.D. Tenn. 1981) (hereinafter, <em>Stauffer II), </em>the EPA attempted to inspect one of Stauffer\u2019s chemical plants in Tennessee using different private contractors than the ones used in <em>Stauffer I. </em>Stauffer again refused to allow entry to the private contractors and argued that the EPA should be estopped from relitigating the issue of whether private contractors are authorized representatives under the Clean Air Act based on the Tenth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Stauffer I. </em>The Sixth Circuit agreed, holding that the EPA was collaterally estopped by <em>Stauffer I </em>from relitigating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>the same question against Stauffer. The United States Supreme Court upheld the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision, concluding that, while the two suits involved two completely different occurrences at different plants located in different States, the \u201cauthorized representative\u201d issue was the same in <em>Stauffer I </em>and <em>Stauffer II. Stauffer, </em>464 U.S. at 170, 104 S. Ct. at 578. The Court explained that \u201c[a]ny factual differences between the two cases, such as the difference in the location of the plants and the difference in the private contracting firms involved, are of no legal significance whatever in resolving the issue presented in both cases.\u201d <em>Stauffer, </em>464 U.S. at 172, 104 S. Ct. at 579. Thus, the Court determined the EPA was collaterally estopped from relitigating whether private contractors are \u201cauthorized representatives\u201d under the Clean Air Act, despite factual differences in the plants and the particular private contractors utilized for inspections. <em>Stauffer, </em>464 U.S. at 174, 104 S. Ct. at 580.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u00b626 Similarly in <em>Pacific Power, </em>this Court addressed whether public utility owners could relitigate the issue of whether beneficial use taxes on the utility owners were unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause. <em>Pacific Power, </em>246 Mont. at 404, 804 P.2d at 401. In previous litigation, the Court had held that the beneficial use taxes were constitutional for the year 1984. However, the utility owners argued that issue preclusion did not bar their suit because the present action involved different tax years, namely 1985, 1986, and 1987. <em>Pacific Power, </em>246 Mont. at 404, 804 P.2d at 401. This Court rejected the owners\u2019 argument, concluding that the \u201cfact that different tax years are being challenged makes no difference\u201d in resolving the constitutional issue presented in both cases. <em>Pacific Power, </em>246 Mont. at 404, 804 P.2d at 401. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">The constitutional challenges remain the same, and it is the substance of these challenges that have failed. The year in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>they were brought has no bearing upon their lack of success. Allowing the [utility owners] to raise the <em>same </em>challenges to the <em>same </em>tax each subsequent tax year serves no purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-6\"><em>Pacific Power, </em>246 Mont. at 404, 804 P.2d at 401 (emphasis in original). Thus, we precluded the utility owners from relitigating the legal issue. <em>Pacific Power, </em>246 Mont. at 405, 804 P.2d at 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\u00b627 The present case fits comfortably into the framework provided by <em>Stauffer </em>and <em>Pacific Power. </em>Here, like the parties opposing issue preclusion in <em>Stauffer </em>and <em>Pacific Power, </em>MEIC seeks to relitigate a legal issue in which any factual differences between the former and the current action are of no legal significance whatsoever in resolving the legal issue presented in both cases. Just as the difference in the contracting firms and location of the plants in <em>Stauffer </em>and the difference in the year in which the constitutional challenge was brought in <em>Pacific Power </em>were irrelevant to the issues presented in those cases, the difference in the physical characteristics of the North Area Pit and the Mineral Hill Pit are wholly immaterial to the legal issue presented here. MEIC does not, nor could it, seriously contend that the constitutional issue \u2014 whether Article IX, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution requires land disturbed by the taking of natural resources to be restored to its previous condition \u2014 turns on geography, location, size, or any other physical characteristic of the two pits. Indeed, in making its constitutional argument, MEIC relies on the language of Article IX, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution, the jurisprudence of this Court, and the transcripts from the 1972 Constitutional Convention, not the physical characteristics of the two pits. Like the utility owners\u2019 challenge in <em>Pacific Power, </em>MEIC\u2019s constitutional argument remains the same, and any factual distinctions are without legal significance. The District Court has already \u201csquarely rejected\u201d MEIC\u2019s argument that the Montana Constitution requires restoration of the ground to its previous condition. Allowing MEIC to relitigate the issue of full reclamation would frustrate the collateral estoppel doctrine and defeat its purpose of protecting litigants from burdensome relitigation and of promoting judicial economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">\u00b628  In sum, MEIC pressed the District Court in <em>MEIC I </em>to decide the constitutional standard by which legislative actions are measured under Article IX, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution. The District Court did so. Because that issue was specifically raised, litigated, and decided by the District Court in the former litigation in <em>MEIC I </em>in which the DEQ and GSM were parties, MEIC is barred by the doctrine of issue preclusion from raising the issue again for consideration by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>District Court. We hold that the District Court did not err by precluding MEIC from relitigating whether Article IX, Section 2 of the Montana Constitution requires land disturbed by the taking of natural resources to be fully reclaimed to its previous condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\u00b629 <em>2. Whether MEIC is precluded from relitigating the issue of whether the Montana Metal Mine Reclamation Act requires land disturbed by the taking of natural resources to be fully reclaimed to its previous condition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u00b630  MEIC is similarly precluded from relitigating whether the MMRA requires land disturbed by the taking of natural resources to be fully reclaimed to its previous condition. First, our rationale for precluding MEIC from raising its constitutional challenge applies with equal force to MEIC\u2019s statutory argument. In <em>MEIC I, </em>the District Court considered and rejected the same legal argument that MEIC makes here \u2014 that the MMRA requires the DEQ to choose the most effective reclamation alternative because Article IX, Section 2 of Montana Constitution requires as much. Similarly, here, MEIC maintains that the factual differences between the Mineral Hill Pit and the North Area Pit create different issues. As explained above, any factual variations between the two pits are legally insignificant to resolving the issue presented in both cases \u2014 whether the MMRA requires land disturbed by the taking of natural resources to be fully reclaimed to its previous condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u00b631 Second, even if MEIC had not advanced its statutory argument in <em>MEIC I, </em>our conclusion with respect to Issue 1 precludes review of this issue as well. Issue preclusion operates to preclude a party from advancing an issue in a current action even though the party did not advance that issue in the former \u201cwhen the issues are so intertwined that to decide the issue before it, the District Court would have to rehear the precise issue previously decided.\u201d <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 25 (quoting <em>Martelli v. Anaconda-Deer Lodge County, </em>258 Mont. 166, 169, 852 P.2d 579, 581 (1993)) (ellipsis, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). Here, MEIC\u2019s statutory argument is entirely premised on its constitutional argument and the two arguments are so intertwined that the District Court would have to revisit the constitutional issue to decide the statutory issue. Because we affirmed the District Court\u2019s conclusion to preclude MEIC from relitigating the constitutional standard, MEIC\u2019s statutory argument is necessarily precluded as well. We hold that the District Court did not err by precluding MEIC from relitigating whether the MMRA requires land disturbed by the taking of natural resources to be fully reclaimed to its previous condition. Our conclusion on this Issue, however, does not preclude MEIC from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>challenging the DEQ\u2019s application of the MMRA\u2019s statutory criteria to the facts of the North Area Pit.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\u00b632 <em>3. Whether the DEQ made a reasoned decision in selecting the Agency-Modified Alternative under the criteria set forth in the Montana Metal Mine Reclamation Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\u00b633 MEIC argues that the DEQ\u2019s decision to select the Agency-Modified Alternative is unsupported by the evidence under the criteria set forth in the MMRA. Pursuant to \u00a7 82-4-336(9)(b), MCA, of the MMRA \u201ca reclamation plan must provide sufficient reclamation to a condition: (i) of stability structurally competent to withstand geologic and climatic conditions without significant failure that would be a threat to public safety and the environment; (ii) that affords some utility to humans or the environment; (iii) that mitigates postreclamation visual contrasts between reclamation lands and adjacent lands; and (iv) that mitigates or prevents undesirable offsite environmental impacts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\u00b634 In both the final EIS and the ROD, the DEQ extensively analyzed the Agency-Modified Alternative in light of the MMRA criteria set forth in \u00a7 82-4-336(9)(b), MCA. Beginning with the first condition, the DEQ concluded that \u201c[wjhile the North Area Pit Backfill Alternative would provide better structural stability, no highwall failures would occur under any of the alternatives that would threaten public safety or the environment outside the pit.\u201d To ensure public safety within the North Area Pit, the DEQ required that GSM install fencing and monitor ground-movement after closure of the mine under the Agency-Modified Alternative. The DEQ concluded that with these precautionary measures \u201c[mjinor raveling and small wall failures could occur over time but would not present a risk to human health or the environment.\u201d To better afford utility to the environment, the DEQ required GSM to place growth media on the pit benches to support establishment of vegetation and to plant tree seedlings on the berms and benches. The revegetated portions of the North Area Pit will total approximately 22 acres, which the DEQ concluded will provide wildlife habitat for a number of animal species, including the Black-tailed Prairie Dog, the Fringed Myotis, and the Hoary Bat. To mitigate postreclamation visual contrasts between reclaimed lands and adjacent lands, the DEQ required GSM to plant shrubs and trees on accessible benches in the highwalls that are visible from outside of the North Area Pit. The DEQ concluded that the \u201cplanting and seeding of benches will reduce the visual contrast between the highwall areas and adjacent undisturbed topography.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\u00b635 Lastly, the DEQ addressed the potential for undesirable offsite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>impacts, specifically the potential impact associated with contaminated groundwater. The DEQ concluded that with the installation of an underground sump pump the Agency-Modified Alternative \u201cprovided adequate assurance that pollution of the Jefferson River alluvial aquifer and surface water in the Jefferson River Slough in violation of water quality laws would not occur.\u201d The DEQ found that \u201cif the external dewatering wells were to fail, they could be replaced before the water table rebounds and impacted water begins discharging from the North Area Pit.\u201d The DEQ found that \u201c[g]iven the capacity of the underground sump,\u201d the flow of impacted groundwater \u201cwill not exceed the design capacity of the sump.\u201d The DEQ explained that under the Agency-Modified Alternative even if the external dewatering wells were to fail \u201cno impacts to groundwater or surface water outside the pit are anticipated because impacted groundwater would be captured by the underground sump and not flow from the pit.\u201d Thus, the DEQ concluded that the Agency-Modified Alternative provided better assurances against ground water contamination than the Backfill Alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u00b636  The DEQ\u2019s decision was based on consideration of the relevant factors set forth in \u00a7 82-4-336(9)(b), MCA, of the MMRA, and was not arbitrary, capricious, unlawful, or unsupported by substantial evidence. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the DEQ made a clear error of judgment, and we are satisfied that the DEQ made a reasoned decision in selecting the Agency-Modified Alternative. The District Court did not err by upholding the DEQ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\u00b637 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b139-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES RICE, COTTER and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-9\"> \u201cContested case\u201d denotes a \u201cproceeding before an agency in which a determination of legal rights, duties, or privileges of a party is required by law to be made after an opportunity for hearing.\u201d Section 2-4-102(4), MCA.

In <em>Stauffer, </em>the Supreme Court acknowledged that \u201cthe exception is generally recognized\u201d but was \u201cfrank to admit uncertainty as to its application.\u201d <em>Stauffer, </em>464 U.S. at 171, 104 S. Ct. at 579. Similarly, other courts have recognized the \u201c \u2018unmixed question of law\u2019 exception is not easily summarized.\u201d <em>AMTRAK v. Pa. PUC, </em>288 F.3d 519, 530 (3d Cir. 2002). Here, however, unlike the EPA in <em>Stauffer, </em>MEIC has failed to develop an argument under the ill-defined exception. Thus, we decline to address whether the \u201cunmixed question of law\u201d exception is applicable in this instance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
