This is the second time this matter has been before this Court on appeal. <em>Fellows v. Office of Water Comm\u2019r, </em>2012 MT 169, 365 Mont. 540, 285 P.3d 448 (hereafter <em>Fellows I). </em>The <em>Perry </em>Defendants raise several issues on appeal that we restate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-4\"><em>1. Whether the water right claims in controversy were properly determined following this Court\u2019s remand in </em>Fellows I.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court erred in granting Fellows\u2019 motion for substitution.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">\u00b63 Because the background facts are delineated in <em>Fellows I, </em>we restate the facts only briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">\u00b64 Montana\u2019s Constitution requires the Legislature to \u201cprovide for the administration, control, and regulation of water rights\u201d and to \u201cestablish a system of centralized records\u201d for those rights. Mont. Const, art. IX, \u00a7 3(4). In implementing this constitutional mandate, the Legislature created the Water Court, which has jurisdiction over \u201call matters relating to the determination of existing water rights within the boundaries of the state of Montana.\u201d Section 3-7-224(2), MCA. The law provides district courts with jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of water rights decrees and to supervise the distribution of adjudicated water. Tit. 3, Ch. 7, Pt. 2, MCA; Tit. 85, Ch. 2, MCA. The Water Court is in the process of adjudicating the water rights of all appropriators in Basin 410, which includes the Teton River and Spring Creek \u2014 the sources of water at issue here. Although the Water Court has issued a temporary preliminary decree for Basin 410, it has not yet issued a final decree. Therefore, the adjudication process in Basin 410 is still ongoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">\u00b65 Fellows owns several water rights in Spring Creek near Choteau, Montana. His rights were decreed in <em>Sands Cattle &amp; Land Co. v. Jackson, </em>Case 727 (Mont. 10th Judicial Dist. Ct., May 31, 1892). Fellows claims that Spring Creek is recharged by water seeping through a subsurface aquifer from a stretch of the Teton River known as the Springhill Reach. In other words, Fellows asserts that Spring Creek and the Teton River are hydrologically connected. Fellows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>therefore contends that maintaining the flow of Spring Creek is dependent upon maintaining water in the Springhill Reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u00b66 The <em>Perry </em>Defendants own various water rights in the upper Teton River northwest of Choteau. Their rights were decreed in <em>Perry v. Beattie, </em>Case 371 (Mont. 11th Judicial Dist. Ct., March 28, 1908). The Ninth Judicial District Court, Teton County, now supervises the distribution of water pursuant to both <em>Perry </em>and <em>Sands. </em>The water rights decreed in <em>Perry </em>are administered by a water commissioner pursuant to \u00a7 85-5-101, MCA. In administering water rights under <em>Perry, </em>the Water Commissioner has diverted water out of the Teton River into the Bateman Ditch above the Springhill Reach as a water management tool. <em>Fellows I, </em>\u00b6 4; <em>Eldorado Co-Op Canal Co. v. Lower Teton Joint Objectors, </em>2014 MT 272, \u00b6 32, 376 Mont. 420, 337 P.3d 74 (hereafter <em>Eldorado). </em>Fellows alleges that water diversion through the Bateman Ditch diminishes the flow of water through the Springhill Reach and adversely affects the water available to satisfy his Spring Creek rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\u00b67 In February 2011, Fellows filed a complaint challenging the Water Commissioner\u2019s administration of water under the <em>Perry </em>decree. Specifically, he challenged the Water Commissioner\u2019s authority to divert water out of the Teton River by means of the Bateman Ditch. The District Court ultimately dismissed Fellows\u2019 complaint under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a clai m upon which relief could be granted, and Fellows appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\u00b68 In <em>Fellows I, </em>we reversed the District Court\u2019s dismissal and remanded for further proceedings. <em>Fellows I, </em>\u00b6 22. We agreed with the District Court that Fellows could not seek relief from the action of the <em>Perry </em>Water Commissioner under \u00a7 85-5-301, MCA, because he did \u201cnot derive his Spring Creek water right from the <em>Perry </em>decree ....\u201d <em>Fellows I, </em>\u00b6 16. We concluded, however, that Fellows could seek declaratory relief and that his allegations were sufficient to state a claim under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). <em>Fellows I, </em>\u00b6 19. We concluded further that if Fellows could \u201cprove hydrological connectivity between Spring Creek and the Teton River, then the next step should be certification to the chief water judge under \u00a7 85-2-406(2)(b), <em>MCA.\u201d Fellows I, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">\u00b69 On remand, Fellows filed a motion for substitution of district court judge, which Judge Olson granted. After Judge Oldenburg assumed jurisdiction, Monte Giese, William Reichelt, and Steve Kelly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>(Intervenors) intervened.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Fellows then moved for summary judgment on the issue of hydrological connectivity. Following consideration of the parties\u2019 expert depositions, the District Court granted Fellows\u2019 motion, concluding that Spring Creek and the Teton River are hydrologically connected. The court found it unnecessary \u201cat this stage of the proceeding\u201d to address the scope, extent, or timing of the connectivity.</p>\n<p id=\"A3M\">\u00b610 Fellows then requested the court to certify a question to the Water Court. The <em>Perry </em>Defendants objected to the request; the District Court held, however, that the \u201capplicable and appropriate scope of the determination of the rights involved in the controversy is best left to the processes of the Water Court.\u201d Accordingly, the District Court certified the following issue for determination by the Water Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqq\">Upon remand from the Montana Supreme Court in Cause No. 2012 MT 169, pursuant to this Court\u2019s determination of the hydrological connectivity between the Teton River and Spring Creek, and pursuant to MCA Section 85-2-406(2)(b), the Ninth Judicial District Court certifies this matter to the Montana Water Court for determination of the existing rights involved in this controversy, pursuant to Chapter 2 of Title 85, MCA. Upon its determination, the Water Court shall issue to the District Court a list or tabulation of rights, priorities, and approved points of diversion in a form determined appropriate by the Water Judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYM\">The Water Court issued its final order on certification on March 13, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\u00b611 In its final order, the Water Court concluded that the purpose of certification under \u00a7 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA, is \u201cto provide sufficient information to enable the District Court to resolve the immediate controversy.\u201d Because it concluded that the underlying controversy stemmed from the Water Commissioner\u2019s use of the Bateman Ditch as a water management tool, the Water Court determined that the scope of the controversy should be defined by Fellows\u2019 water right claims and by the water right claims that historically utilized the Bateman Ditch. Consequently, the Water Court concluded that three Patrick Saylor Teton River water right claims, a Choteau Cattle Company Teton River water right claim, and Fellows\u2019 Spring Creek water right claims \u201cconstitute the claims properly before the Water Court in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>certification.\u201d By the time of its certification order, all of the Saylor, Choteau Cattle Company, and Fellows water right claims had been adjudicated in the temporary preliminary decree. The court therefore concluded that further proceedings were not required in answering the certification issue. The Water Court tabulated the claims at issue and ordered that the matter be closed and returned to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"A6t\">\u00b612 The <em>Perry </em>Defendants then filed a M. R. Civ. P. 59(e) motion to alter or amend the Water Court\u2019s judgment. The motion requested that the Water Court withdraw its final order and return the matter to the District Court \u201cto properly identify the water rights involved in the controversy, as defined by the allegations of Fellows\u2019 First Amended Complaint.\u201d The Water Court denied the motion. The <em>Perry </em>Defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\u00b613 We review a trial court\u2019s denial of a M. R. Civ. P. 59(e) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Anderson, </em>2013 MT 238, \u00b6 13, 371 Mont. 321, 307 P.3d 313. A trial court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>RN &amp; DB, LLC v. Stewart, </em>2015 MT 327, \u00b6 14, 381 Mont. 429, 362 P.3d 61. We review a trial court\u2019s interpretation of a statute de novo. <em>City of Livingston v. Mont. Pub. Emps. Ass\u2019n ex rel. Tubaugh, </em>2014 MT 314, \u00b6 11, 377 Mont. 184, 339 P.3d 41. Whether a court has jurisdiction over the parties or the subject matter is a legal conclusion that we review de novo. <em>Pinnow v. Mont. State Fund, </em>2007 MT 332, \u00b6 13, 340 Mont. 217, 172 P.3d 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">\u00b614 <em>1. Whether the water right claims in controversy were properly determined following this Court\u2019s remand in </em>Fellows I.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">\u00b615 In its order denying the <em>Perry </em>Defendants\u2019 motion to alter or amend its judgment, the Water Court first concluded that it had jurisdiction to determine the scope of the certification question because the Water Court\u2019s role under \u00a7 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA, \u201cis to provide sufficient information to the District Court to facilitate resolution of the underlying water distribution controversy.\u201d The court next concluded that \u201cFellows has decreed rights from Spring Creek[;] he is not claiming the Teton River as the source for these water rights.\u201d The court reiterated that \u201cFellows is seeking the ability to participate in any District Court proceedings on use of the Bateman Ditch as a water conservation measure.\u201d The Water Court therefore concluded that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>correctly identified the scope of the controversy and appropriately tabulated \u201cthe rights that historically used the Bateman Ditch and the Spring Creek claims Fellows is seeking to protect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\u00b616 On appeal, the <em>Perry </em>Defendants raise several points of error in asserting that the Water Court abused its discretion in denying their M. R. Civ. P. 59(e) motion, including: that the Water Court did not follow the law of the case; that certification under \u00a7 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA, was inappropriate; and that the Water Court failed to define the scope of the controversy, improperly determined the purpose of the tabulation, and inadequately tabulated the rights in controversy. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">\u00b617 First, the <em>Perry </em>Defendants contend that the law of the case established <em>in Fellows I </em>was not followed because Fellows\u2019 rights were not properly certified for determination with a modified Teton River source. They assert that in <em>Fellows I, </em>we implicitly contemplated that the purpose of certification \u201cwas for Fellows\u2019 rights to be determined as Teton rights vis-\u00e1-vis the <em>Perry </em>Decree users.\u201d They therefore contend that the Water Court abused its discretion in determining that Spring Creek is the source of Fellows\u2019 water right claims in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">\u00b618 We are not persuaded by the <em>Perry </em>Defendants\u2019 contention that we implicitly concluded in <em>Fellows I </em>that Fellows\u2019 rights must be determined with a modified Teton River source. The <em>Perry </em>Defendants rely on the well-established rule that when we state in an opinion \u201ca principle or rule of law necessary to the decision, such pronouncement becomes the law of the case, and must be adhered to throughout its subsequent progress ....\u201d <em>Fiscus v. Beartooth Elec. Coop., </em>180 Mont. 434, 437, 591 P.2d 196, 197 (1979) (citation and internal quotations omitted). In <em>Fellows I, </em>we stated multiple times explicitly that Spring Creek is the source of Fellows\u2019 water right claims involved in the controversy. <em>E.g., Fellows I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 2, 16, 21. We did not hold that the Water Court on certification must determine Fellows\u2019 rights as Teton River rights. Accordingly, we conclude that the Water Court adhered to the law of the case and therefore did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the source of Fellows\u2019 rights in controversy is Spring Creek, not the Teton River.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">\u00b619 The <em>Perry </em>Defendants next argue that certification under \u00a7 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA, was improper based on a \u201cholistic reading\u201d of the statute. They contend that certification is appropriate under \u00a7 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA, only if the rights involved in the controversy have not yet been determined. Because the rights in controversy here are \u201cdetermined claims,\u201d the <em>Perry </em>Defendants assert that the Water Court could perform only an enforcement tabulation pursuant to \u00a7 85-2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>406(4), MCA. They next argue that the Water Court lacked jurisdiction under \u00a7 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA, to determine which parties and water rights were involved in the underlying water distribution controversy. The statute, they contend, requires that the District Court make those determinations prior to certification. Without a determination by the District Court as to which parties and which water rights are involved in the controversy, the <em>Perry </em>Defendants claim that certification under \u00a7 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA, was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u00b620 In <em>Fellows I, </em>we pronounced that if Fellows could establish \u201chydrological connectivity between Spring Creek and the Teton River, then the next step should be certification to the chief water judge under \u00a7 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA.\u201d <em>Fellows I, </em>\u00b6 21. Upon remand, the District Court established hydrological connectivity on summary judgment and then followed this Court\u2019s direction by certifying a question to the Water Court pursuant to \u00a7 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u00b621 The role of the judge in construing a statute \u201cis simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. It is a well-established rule that \u201c[w]hen construing a statute, it must be read as a whole, and its terms should not be isolated from the context in which they were used by the Legislature.\u201d <em>State v. Price, </em>2002 MT 229, \u00b6 47, 311 Mont. 439, 57 P.3d 42 (citing <em>State v. Nye, </em>283 Mont. 505, 510, 943 P.2d 96, 99 (1997)). It also is well-established that \u201cstatutes should be construed according to the plain meaning of the language used therein.\u201d <em>Price, </em>\u00b6 47 (citing <em>Nye, </em>283 Mont. at 510, 943 P.2d at 99). Moreover, we have concluded, \u201cSection 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA, should not be narrowly interpreted so as to frustrate solutions to water distribution controversies, but rather should be applied so as to allow for the expeditious resolution of these controversies.\u201d <em>Giese, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">\u00b622 Section 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA, initially requires that a \u201cwater distribution controversy\u201d exist before a party may petition a district court for certification. As the <em>Perry </em>Defendants acknowledge, this matter \u201cis undeniably a water distribution controversy\u201d; therefore, the first requirement for certification under \u00a7 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA, is met. <em>Giese, </em>\u00b6 11. The statute further provides that, for certification to be proper, the water distribution controversy must \u201carise[ ] upon a source of water in which not all existing rights have been conclusively determined according to part 2 of this chapter ....\u201d Section 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA. We determined in <em>Giese </em>that certification under \u00a7 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA, was appropriate based in part on the fact \u201cthat not all existing rights on the Teton River have been conclusively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>determined.\u201d <em>Giese, </em>\u00b6 15. We conclude that the plain meaning of the language used in \u00a7 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA, is that if all existing rights on the source of water in controversy have not been conclusively determined by final adjudication under the 1973 Water Use Act, then a party involved in a water distribution controversy may petition the court for certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\u00b623  Although the rights at issue here were decreed in <em>Perry </em>and <em>Sands, </em>those rights \u2014 along with other claimed existing water rights in Basin 410 \u2014 are subject to a temporary preliminary decree. <em>Teton Co-Op Canal Co. v. Teton Coop Reservoir Co., </em>2015 MT 344, 382 Mont. 1, 365 P.3d 442; <em>Teton Coop. Reservoir Co. v. Farmers Coop. Canal </em>Co. 2015 MT 208, 380 Mont. 146, 354 P.3d 579; Eldorado; <em>Skelton Ranch, Inc. v. Pondera Cnty. Canal &amp; Reservoir Co., </em>2014 MT 167, 375 Mont. 327, 328 P.3d 644; <em>Heavirland v. State, </em>2013 MT 313, 372 Mont. 300, 311 P.3d 813. Water right claims in Basin 410 are still working their way through the adjudication process. <em>See </em>\u00a7 85-2-231(1), MCA (providing that the Water Court \u201cmay issue a temporary preliminary decree prior to the issuance of a preliminary decree if the temporary preliminary decree is necessary for the orderly adjudication or administration of water rights\u201d). As such, all the existing rights in the sources of water at issue here have not been conclusively determined pursuant to Title 85, chapter 2, part 2, MCA. <em>See </em>\u00a7 85-2-227(1), MCA (providing in pertinent part, \u201cFor purposes of administering water rights, the provisions of a temporary preliminary decree or a preliminary decree, as modified after objection and hearings, supersede a claim of existing right <em>until a final decree is issued.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). Fellows is not seeking enforcement of a temporary preliminary decree under \u00a7 85-2-406(4), MCA, but determination of his rights and relative priorities in order to challenge delivery of water through the Bateman Ditch. Accordingly, Fellows\u2019 petition for certification was proper pursuant to \u00a7 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\u00b624 The <em>Perry </em>Defendants next assert that the plain language of \u00a7 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA, permits only district courts to identify which parties and water rights are involved in the underlying water distribution controversy. Section 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA, provides, in relevant part, \u201cIf a certification request is made, the district court shall certify to the chief water judge the determination of the existing rights that are involved in the controversy according to part 2 of this chapter.\u201d We conclude that the plain language of the statute explicitly confers on the Water Court, when a district court requests, the authority to \u201cdetermin[e] [ ] the existing rights that are involved in the controversy according to part 2 of this chapter.\u201d Section 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>\u00b625 The <em>Perry </em>Defendants\u2019 overly narrow interpretation of the statute would \u201cfrustrate solutions to water distribution controversies.\u201d <em>Giese, </em>\u00b6 16. Our construction of the terms used in the statute is consistent with the context in which the terms were used by the Legislature. Under Montana law, \u201cthe water court is vested with exclusive jurisdiction relative to <em>all matters </em>relating to the determination of existing water rights within the boundaries of the State of Montana.\u201d <em>Baker Ditch Co. v. District Ct., </em>251 Mont. 251, 255, 824 P.2d 260, 260 (1992) (emphasis added) (citing \u00a7 3-7-501, MCA; <em>Mildenberger v. Galbraith, </em>249 Mont. 161, 815 P.2d 130 (1991)). Given the Water Court\u2019s comprehensive oversight of the adjudication process, its jurisdiction necessarily includes the authority to identify those parties and rights involved in a water distribution controversy based on the adjudication process, the claims made in the affected area, and the evidence before the Water Court. <em>See Giese, </em>\u00b6 18 (instructing a district court \u201cto certify <em>all appropriate issues </em>to the Chief Water Judge as provided in \u00a7 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA...\u201d (emphasis added)). Accordingly, we conclude that under the plain language and the context of the terms used in \u00a7 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA, the Water Court has authority to determine which parties and rights are involved in a water distribution controversy certified by a district court. Such an application of the statute will \u201callow for the expeditious resolution of these controversies.\u201d <em>Giese, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b626 The <em>Perry </em>Defendants\u2019 final contention is that the Water Court failed to define adequately the scope of the controversy based on the parties\u2019 pleadings. They assert that the Water Court reframed the scope of the controversy too narrowly because \u201cin order to fully determine the water distribution controversy pled by Fellows, it is necessary to determine the validity of the water right claims of [all of the named Defendants] allegedly causing damage to Fellows.\u201d The <em>Perry </em>Defendants allege that the underlying controversy is broader than the Water Commissioner\u2019s use of the Bateman Ditch because Fellows alleged in his complaint that the named Defendants were appropriating his \u201crecharge water,\u201d giving rise to a claim for damages. Because the Water Court did not include all of the named Defendants in its order, they assert that the Water Court provided the District Court with an incomplete tabulation of the rights in controversy. Furthermore, they contend that the Water Court made an incorrect conclusion that the purpose of the certification was not enforcement of rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00b627 In its final order, the Water Court concluded that \u201c[t]he scope of certification refers to the water right claims that require a review by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the Water Court in order to provide the necessary information to the District Court.\u201d The Water Court further determined that \u201c[t]he point of certification is to provide sufficient information to the District Court to facilitate resolution of the underlying water distribution controversy,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he scope of the certification is typically defined by that underlying controversy.\u201d In determining the scope and the purpose of the certification, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">Fellows requested certification for a limited purpose. He seeks the right to object if other water users ask to divert water into the Bateman Ditch as a water saving measure. He is not questioning the elements of any specific water right. He has not asserted the right to place a call on any specific water right. The water right claims involved need not include all Basin 410 water rights that may benefit from use of the Bateman Ditch as a water saving measure or all water rights that may, through their use, have an adverse impact on the Springhill Reach or Spring Creek. Fellows is specifically asking for the right to participate in any future proceeding on use of the Bateman Ditch as a water saving measure, he is not seeking enforcement of all water rights and permits upgradient from his point of diversion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The Water Court noted that we had affirmed its prior tabulation of water right claims associated with the Bateman Ditch in <em>Eldorado, </em>and concluded that the \u201csame water right claims identified in the <em>[Eldorado] </em>tabulation are at issue in this certification case.\u201d As such, the Water Court concluded that Saylor\u2019s, Choteau Cattle Company\u2019s, and Fellows\u2019 water right claims are the existing rights that are involved in the underlying controversy before the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">\u00b628  We agree with the Water Court that the purpose of certification under \u00a7 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA, is to provide sufficient information to the District Court to facilitate resolution of the underlying water distribution controversy. <em>See Giese, </em>\u00b6 16 (concluding that \u00a7 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA, \u201cshould be applied so as to allow for the expeditious resolution of [water distribution] controversies\u201d). We therefore agree that the underlying water distribution controversy defines the scope of the certification. The Water Court\u2019s order, like any court\u2019s judgment, \u201cmust be within the issues presented to the court.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Sur. Corp. v. Kruse, </em>121 Mont. 202, 205-06, 192 P.2d 317, 319 (1948). Accordingly, the Water Court properly looked to Fellows\u2019 First Amended Complaint in determining the scope of the controversy and purpose of the certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">\u00b629 A review of that complaint establishes that Fellows alleged that maintaining the flow of Spring Creek is dependent upon \u201cRecharge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Water\u201d seeping through a subsurface aquifer located at the Springhill Reach. Fellows further alleged that the Water Commissioner \u201caltered the delivery of water in <em>[Perry] </em>to allow for diversion and use of Recharge Water by unknown water users (\u2018Defendants\u2019)\u201d by means of the Bateman Ditch. Fellows claimed that the Water Commissioner\u2019s practice of diverting water through the Bateman Ditch impaired the use of his Spring Creek rights. Fellows therefore sought to enjoin the Water Commissioner from using the Bateman Ditch as a water management tool and pursued relief from the practice under both private and public nuisance as well as negligence theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\u00b630 The <em>Perry </em>Defendants\u2019 assertions that the Water Court erred in defining the scope of the controversy and determining the purpose of the certification are unpersuasive. Based on our review of the issues presented in Fellows\u2019 Amended Complaint, we conclude that the Water Court properly opined that Fellows requested certification for the limited purpose of obtaining the right to object when water was diverted through the Bateman Ditch. His complaint specifically sought an injunction \u201cbarring the distribution, diversion or use of Recharge Water\u201d by means of the Bateman Ditch. Furthermore, the Water Court correctly determined that the scope of the certification was limited to use of the Bateman Ditch. Fellows\u2019 complaint alleges that the groundwater aquifer located at the Springhill Reach is the primary source of water in Spring Creek; therefore, he asserts, the diversion of water through the Bateman Ditch impacts his Spring Creek rights. The Water Court appropriately confined its order to the controversy before the District Court \u2014 use of the Bateman Ditch to deliver water.</p>\n<p id=\"AfM\">\u00b631  Moreover, the Water Court did not err in determining that the claims properly before the court on certification were Saylor\u2019s and Choteau Cattle Company\u2019s Teton River water right claims and Fellows\u2019 Spring Creek water right claims. Upon certification, the Water Court is tasked with determining \u201cthe existing rights that are <em>involved </em>in the controversy....\u201d Section 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA (emphasis added). As the Water Court noted, we concluded in <em>Eldorado </em>that it properly tabulated the \u201cwater rights that can be diverted through the Bateman Ditch.\u201d <em>Eldorado, </em>\u00b6 36. Because the scope of the instant controversy is limited to the use of the Bateman Ditch, it was unnecessary for the Water Court to tabulate rights beyond those that historically have used the Bateman Ditch and Fellows\u2019 Spring Creek rights. The Water Court properly determined the existing rights involved in the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\u00b632 The only purpose of the certification order is the tabulation and relative priority of Fellows\u2019 Spring Creek rights and the rights of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>using the Bateman Ditch for delivery of their Teton River water. It will be in the District Court \u2014 when and if Fellows challenges use of the Bateman Ditch as a management tool \u2014 that he will need to prove that diverting water through the ditch actually and as a matter of hydrological fact impairs his water right. It is then the District Court\u2019s function to \u201csupervise the distribution of water among all appropriators.\u201d Section 85-2-406(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\u00b633  Although the <em>Perry </em>Defendants make additional arguments, we conclude that the contentions discussed above are dispositive. Based on the foregoing analysis, we conclude the following: that the Water Court correctly determined that Spring Creek is the source of Fellows\u2019 rights involved in the controversy; that certification pursuant to \u00a7 85-2-406(2)(b), MCA, was proper; and that the Water Court did not err in determining the scope of the controversy, defining the purpose of the certification, or tabulating the applicable rights involved in the controversy. Accordingly, we hold that the Water Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the <em>Perry </em>Defendants\u2019 motion to amend and that the water right claims in controversy were properly determined following this Court\u2019s remand in <em>Fellows I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u00b634 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in granting Fellows\u2019motion for substitution.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">\u00b635 Section 3-1-804, MCA, provides for the substitution of district court judges; it provides, however, that there is no right of substitution of \u201ca judge supervising the distribution of water under 85-2-406, including supervising water commissioners under Title 85, chapter 5, part 1.\u201d Section 3-1-804, MCA. The <em>Perry </em>Defendants assert that the substitution of Judge Olson was improper because this case is \u201cundeniably a water distribution controversy, ....\u201d The <em>Perry </em>Defendants further contend that the issue is properly before this Court on appeal. They rely on M. R. App. P. 6(1), which provides that this Court may review \u201call previous orders and rulings excepted or objected to which led to and resulted in the judgment.\u201d Finally, they argue that the appeal is timely pursuant to M. R. App. P. 6(3)(k).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">\u00b636 Under M. R. App. P. 6(3)(k), an aggrieved party in a civil case may appeal \u201c[f]rom an order granting or denying a motion for substitution of judge\u201d so long as \u201cthe order is the court\u2019s final decision on the referenced matter.\u201d In civil cases, M. R. App. P. 4(5)(a)(i) requires that \u201cthe notice of appeal shall be filed with the clerk of the supreme court within 30 days from the date of entry of the judgment or order from which the appeal is taken.\u201d M. R. App. P. 4(2)(c) provides, \u201cExcept where the supreme court grants an out-of-time appeal under section (6) of this rule, the timely filing of a notice of appeal or cross-appeal is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>required in order to invoke the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court.\u201d We conclude that an order pertaining to a motion for substitution of judge under M. R. App. P. 6(3)(k) must satisfy M. R. App. P. 4\u2019s requirements for being timely. Substitution of a presiding judge is a right that is lost if not exercised early in the case. Section 3-l-804(l)(a), MCA (providing that a motion for substitution in a civil action must be filed within thirty days after either \u201cthe first summons is served or an adverse party has appeared[,] ... [or] after service has been completed in compliance with M. R. Civ. P. 4,\u201d depending on which party files the motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b637 It would defeat the purpose of the rule to allow a party to appeal a substitution order only after the case has been finally decided. Here, the order granting Fellows\u2019 motion for substitution of judge was entered in August 2013. The parties thereafter engaged in discovery and summary judgment proceedings in the District Court. That court certified the case to the Water Court, which conferred with the parties, reviewed the District Court record, issued its opinion and an order on certification, and then considered and denied a motion to alter or amend its order. The process consumed approximately two years. Now that the decision is made, the <em>Perry </em>Defendants seek to begin the process anew because the initial substitution of Judge Olson was improper. The rules do not support their argument. We conclude that the <em>Perry </em>Defendants\u2019 appeal of the substitution order is untimely because the notice of appeal from the order was not filed within 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\u00b638 Upon remand, however, the case will return to Judge Olson as the judge responsible under \u00a7 85-2-406(1), MCA, for supervising both the distribution of water under <em>Perry </em>and <em>Sands </em>and the Water Commissioners appointed to administer the water under both decrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">\u00b639 We affirm the Water Court\u2019s order denying the <em>Perry </em>Defendants\u2019 M. R. Civ. P. 59(e) motion and remand to the Ninth Judicial District Court, the Honorable Robert Olson presiding, for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b341-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and SHEA concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-19\"> Appellants are Patrick Saylor, Farmers Cooperative Canal Company, Eldorado Cooperative Canal Company, Teton Cooperative Canal Company, John D.
