Section 61-8-731, MCA. The Information provided that Hancock had been convicted of DUI offenses on three previous occasions, once in 1999 and twice in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"A_6\">\u00b66 On August 19, 2013, Hancock filed a motion to dismiss the 1999 DUI conviction in Great Falls Municipal Court, alleging that his constitutional right to counsel was violated in that proceeding. In addition to his brief, Hancock filed an affidavit in which he represented that at the initial appearance, he pled not guilty and informed the municipal court that he would retain private counsel. The affidavit also states that at a later date Hancock returned to court and requested court-appointed counsel, which he was denied because it was too late. On the day set for trial, June 2, 1999, Hancock pled guilty to the DUI charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">\u00b67 The District Court conducted a hearing on October 21, 2013, to assess Hancock\u2019s assertions regarding the 1999 DUI conviction. Both Hancock and the Hon. Nancy Luth, who presided over Hancock\u2019s 1999 trial, testified. The 1999 proceeding was set in municipal court, which was not a court of record at the time. However, there was a docket sheet with minutes from the initial appearance; Judge Luth explained that the docket sheet indicated that Hancock was advised of his rights. Hancock confirms that he declined a court-appointed attorney at that appearance. There is no record that Hancock requested an attorney following the initial appearance. Judge Luth testified that it was her general practice to grant a request for a court-appointed attorney unless the request was made on the day of trial and thereby requiring that the trial be postponed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">\u00b68 On November 7,2013, the District Court denied Hancock\u2019s motion to dismiss the 1999 DUI conviction. Hancock pled guilty to the offense of \u201coperation of noncommercial vehicle by person with alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more,\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-406, MCA, reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u00b69 The issue concerning the use of prior convictions to support a felony charge of DUI is a question of law and is reviewed de novo. <em>State v. Maine, </em>2011 MT 90, \u00b6 12, 360 Mont. 182, 255 P.3d 64. The district court\u2019s factual findings regarding the validity of a prior conviction are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>Maine, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u00b610 <em>Issue one: Did the District Court err by denying Hancock\u2019s motion to dismiss a DUI conviction based on his claim that his 1999 DUI conviction, used to support the felony charge, was constitutionally infirm?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">\u00b611 The State may not rely on a constitutionally infirm conviction for sentence enhancement purposes because doing so violates a defendant\u2019s due process rights. <em>State v. Haas, </em>2011 MT 296, \u00b6 14, 363 Mont. 8, 265 P.3d 1221 (internal citations omitted). In <em>State v. Okland, </em>283 Mont. 10, 941 P.2d 431 (1997), we outlined a procedural framework for assessing collateral challenges to previous convictions. <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 18, 941 P.2d at 436. The framework establishes that a \u201cpresumption of [validity] attaches to a prior conviction during a collateral [challenge]\u201d and a defendant who raises the constitutional validity of the prior conviction \u201chas the burden of producing direct evidence of its invalidity.\u201d <em>Okland, </em>283 Mont. at 18, 941 P.2d at 436.</p>\n<p id=\"A0C\">\u00b612 In <em>State v. Howard, </em>2002 MT 276, \u00b6 3, 312 Mont. 359, 59 P.3d 1075, and <em>State v. Walker, </em>2008 MT 244, \u00b6 14, 344 Mont. 477, 188 P.3d 1069, we held that an unequivocal statement in the form of a sworn affidavit is sufficient direct evidence to overcome the presumption of validity. Nevertheless, the defendant has the ultimate burden of proof to both produce and persuade \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that the conviction is invalid.\u201d <em>Maine, </em>\u00b6 12. Consequently</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">to meet his or her burden of proof, [he or she] may not simply point to an ambiguous or silent record, but must come forward with affirmative evidence establishing that the prior conviction was obtained in violation of the Constitution. Self-serving statements by the defendant that his or her conviction is infirm are insufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity and bar the use of the conviction for enhancement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-9\"><em>Maine, </em>\u00b6 34. A defendant\u2019s affidavit merely alleging the unconstitutionality of a previous conviction is not sufficient to rebut the presumption of validity of the conviction. <em>State v. Nixon, </em>2012 MT 316, \u00b6 19, 367 Mont. 495, 291 P.3d 1154.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>\u00b613 The District Court correctly applied this standard in considering Hancock\u2019s 1999 DUI conviction. The District Court held an evidentiary hearing during which both Hancock and Judge Luth testified about events prior to the 1999 DUI conviction. In 1999, the Municipal Court in Great Falls was not a court of record. The District Court had to rely on the credibility of the witnesses testifying about the events that occurred 14 years earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\u00b614  Hancock testified that he saw Judge Luth prior to trial and requested court-appointed counsel. However, according to Hancock, his request for counsel was denied because he was too late in making the request. Judge Luth testified that she had no recollection of Hancock but she presented what she considered the likely course of events based on her experience and custom as municipal court judge for 25 years. Hancock does not dispute that he was advised of his rights and that he initially declined a court-appointed attorney. There are no court records that suggest that he, at a later time, requested an attorney. Judge Luth testified that it is unlikely that he appeared prior to his trial date to request an attorney, and that it is her common practice to appoint counsel if requested prior to the date of trial. In light of Judge Luth\u2019s testimony, we are not convinced by Hancock\u2019s assertions in his affidavit and testimony that he timely requested appointment of counsel. Hancock has not satisfied his burden of proof. <em>Nixon, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-21. Given the testimony and evidence presented by Hancock to the District Court at the hearing, we cannot conclude that the court\u2019s factual findings constitute clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u00b615 <em>Issue Two: Did the District Court err by stating that Hancock was convicted of a DUI rather than a DUI per se?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\u00b616 Pursuant to \u00a7 46-20-703, MCA, this Court may \u201cmodify the judgment or order\u201d that originated the appeal. We have in the past directed the district court to correct clerical errors in the record. <em>State v. Goff, </em>2011 MT 6, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33, 359 Mont. 107, 247 P.3d 715. In this case, we note that there is a difference between the offense to which Hancock pled and the offense stated in the District Court\u2019s judgment. Although it has no bearing upon the integrity of the felony conviction pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA, Hancock technically pled to a DUI per se pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-406, MCA, as his fourth offense. Thus, to avoid any confusion and future litigation, we remand this cause to the District Court with instructions to amend the judgment so that it states the correct offense for which Hancock was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">\u00b617 We affirm the order of the District Court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b166-9\">JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER, McKINNON and SHEA concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
