We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">\u00b62 We restate and address the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by excluding trial testimony of Cleveland\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Phillip Steele.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-11\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by excluding trial testimony of Cleveland\u2019s physical therapist, Anne Ripley.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-12\">\n<em>3. Whether the District Court erred in granting a directed verdict on Cleveland\u2019s claim that her rotator cuff tear and shoulder arthritis were caused by the collision.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-13\">\n<em>4. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that Cleveland could not recover damages incurred by Shelby House.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-14\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b141-15\">\u00b63 On June 1,2012, Cleveland was involved in a vehicle collision with another driver, Janice Ward. Cleveland was stopped in traffic when Ward struck her vehicle from behind and pushed it into the vehicle in front of Cleveland. The impact totaled Cleveland\u2019s vehicle. Ward admitted that she was negligent, and Cleveland filed suit for damages. Cleveland contended that she suffered physical injuries from the collision and sought, among other items, damages for emotional distress, past medical costs, and \u201cbusiness loss/lost income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-16\">\u00b64 On November 5, 2014, Ward filed pre-trial motions in limine. Ward sought to exclude reference to any damages suffered by Shelby House, and to exclude any testimony by Dr. Steele that Cleveland suffered a rotator cuff injury as a result of the collision. On January 21, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>2015, the District Court granted Ward\u2019s motions on those two issues.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court concluded that, because Shelby House was not a named party, any discussion of damages it incurred was not relevant. The District Court further concluded that Dr. Steele could not testify as to the cause of Cleveland\u2019s rotator cuff tear because he \u201cclearly avoided giving an opinion\u201d on causation in a September 2014 deposition. In reaching this conclusion, the District Court relied on the following testimony from Dr. Steele in that deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-4\">My belief is that [Cleveland] had pre-existing shoulder pathology that to my knowledge had never bothered her. Its relationship to the automobile accident would be purely speculative on my part. I don\u2019t have a firm way to confirm or deny it. I think certainly the automobile accident could have exacerbated it; the automobile accident could have nothing to do with it. I don\u2019t really know at this point in time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\u00b65 On January 6, 2015, the parties took Dr. Steele\u2019s perpetuation deposition. On January 23,2015, Ward filed objections to certain parts of Dr. Steele\u2019s perpetuation deposition testimony based on the District Court\u2019s decision that Dr. Steele could not testify about the cause of Cleveland\u2019s rotator cuff tear. On January 27, 2015, the District Court issued an order sustaining several of Ward\u2019s objections. The court concluded that Dr. Steele\u2019s testimony could not be \u201coffered for the purpose of establishing the cause of the rotator cuff injury, as his testimony did not include medical opinions based on the required probability that the collision \u2018more likely than not\u2019 caused the injury,\u201d quoting <em>Beehler v. E. Radiological Assocs., </em>P.C., 2012 MT 260, \u00b6 35, 367 Mont. 21, 289 P.3d 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u00b66 A three-day jury trial commenced on February 2,2015. During the trial, Cleveland called her physical therapist, Anne Ripley, to testify. Outside of the presence of the jury, the District Court asked Ripley several questions to clarify the scope of her testimony. When asked whether she could diagnose the cause of Cleveland\u2019s rotator cuff tear, Ripley responded: \u201cI can\u2019t say that the accident caused the rotator cuff tear. But I can say function was normal before the accident and after the accident she had all of this change.\u201d The District Court therefore prohibited Ripley from offering \u201ctestimony as to medical causation\u201d of Cleveland\u2019s rotator cuff tear. Cleveland\u2019s attorney then made an offer of proof by questioning Ripley.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>\u00b67 At the close of evidence, Ward moved for a directed verdict on Cleveland\u2019s claim that her rotator cuff tear and shoulder injuries were caused by the collision. Ward\u2019s attorney argued that Cleveland must have \u201cmedical expert testimony to establish the medical causation link\u201d between Cleveland\u2019s shoulder injuries and the collision, and that \u201c[t]he jury can\u2019t speculate on something like that.\u201d The District Court granted Ward\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, preventing Cleveland from arguing that her rotator cuff tear or shoulder arthritis were caused by the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\u00b68 On February 4, 2015, the jury returned a verdict for Cleveland in the amount of $10,534. On February 17, 2015, the District Court entered judgment for Cleveland in the amount of $3,056.99, after factoring in offsets for previously-made payments. Cleveland appeals, contending that the District Court abused its discretion in limiting the scope of Dr. Steele\u2019s testimony, grantingfive ofWard\u2019s objections to Dr. Steele\u2019s testimony, and limiting the scope of Ripley\u2019s trial testimony. Cleveland further contends that the District Court erred by granting a directed verdict on Cleveland\u2019s shoulder injury claim and ruling that Cleveland may not recover damages incurred by Shelby House.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\u00b69 We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings and determination whether a witness is qualified as an expert to testify. <em>Harris v. Hanson, </em>2009 MT 13, \u00b6 18, 349 Mont. 29, 201 P.3d 151; <em>Seltzer v. Morton, </em>2007 MT 62, \u00b6 65, 336 Mont. 225, 154 P.3d 561. District courts have broad discretion to control the admission of evidence at trial. <em>Seltzer, </em>\u00b6 65. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason. <em>Seltzer, </em>\u00b6 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">\u00b610 If an appellant demonstrates that a district court has abused its discretion in rendering an evidentiary ruling, we determine whether that abuse of discretion constitutes a reversible error. <em>Seltzer, </em>\u00b6 65. No reversible error occurs unless a substantial right of the appellant is affected or the evidence in question could have affected the outcome of the trial. <em>Seltzer, </em>\u00b6 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">\u00b611 Whether a directed verdict should be granted or denied is a question of law, which we review de novo. <em>Johnson v. Costco Wholesale, </em>2007 MT 43, \u00b6 18, 336 Mont. 105, 152 P.3d 727. In reviewing a motion for a directed verdict, we determine \u201cwhether the non-moving party could prevail upon any view of the evidence including the legitimate inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Cameron v. Mercer, </em>1998 MT 134, \u00b6 8, 289 Mont. 172, 960 P.2d 302. Courts must \u201cexercise the greatest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>self-restraint in interfering with the constitutionally-mandated process of jury decision. Thus, unless there is a complete absence of any credible evidence in support of the verdict, a motion for a directed verdict is not properly granted.\u201d <em>Cameron, </em>\u00b6 8 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u00b612 <em>1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by excluding trial testimony of Cleveland\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Phillip Steele.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AkS\">\u00b613 Cleveland appeals the District Court\u2019s January 21, 2015 order that Dr. Steele could not testify on the cause of Cleveland\u2019s rotator cuff injury and its January 27, 2015 order excluding several specific portions of Dr. Steele\u2019s perpetuation deposition testimony. M. R. Evid. 702 permits \u201ca witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\u201d to testify \u201cin the form of an opinion or otherwise\u201d if \u201cscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d An expert\u2019s testimony is reliable if: (1) the expert field is reliable, (2) the expert is qualified, and (3) the qualified expert reliably applied the reliable field to the facts. <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 36 (citing M. R. Evid. 702). The first two factors are determined by the district court. By contrast, \u201c[t]he question whether a qualified expert reliably applied the principles of th[e] reliable field to the facts of the case is for the finder of fact.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>\u00b6 36. However, when expert medical testimony is required to establish a necessary element of a claim, \u201cthe expert must testify with a \u2018reasonable medical certainty.\u2019 \u201d <em>McClue v. Safeco Ins. Co., </em>2015 MT 222, \u00b6 29, 380 Mont. 204, 354 P.3d 604. Under this standard, \u201c[a] medical expert\u2019s opinion is admissible if it is based on an opinion that it is \u2018more likely than not\u2019 that the alleged wrongdoing caused the plaintiffs injury.\u201d <em>McClue, </em>\u00b6 29 (quoting <em>Hinkle ex rel. Hinkle v. Shepherd Sch. Dist. </em># <em>37, </em>2004 MT 175, \u00b6 36, 322 Mont. 80, 93 P.3d 1239).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u00b614 Neither party disputes that Dr. Steele\u2019s field is reliable or that he is qualified as an expert. The parties dispute the scope of Dr. Steele\u2019s testimony and the District Court\u2019s exclusion of five portions of it. In its January 21, 2015 order, the District Court determined that Dr. Steele \u201ccannot be offered for the purpose of establishing causation\u201d because he would not say that the collision \u201cmore likely than not\u201d caused Cleveland\u2019s rotator cuff tear. The District Court based its decision on Dr. Steele\u2019s September 2014 deposition testimony that it would be \u201cpurely speculative\u201d for him to opine on the relationship between Cleveland\u2019s rotator cuff tear and the collision. The District Court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>not abuse its discretion by prohibiting Dr. Steele from testifying that the collision caused Cleveland\u2019s rotator cuff tear because Dr. Steele clearly indicated that he could give no such opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u00b615 The District Court relied on its decision that Dr. Steele could not testify on causation to exclude several specific portions of Dr. Steele\u2019s perpetuation deposition testimony. Cleveland appeals five of these exclusions, summarized below. Cleveland contends that the excluded evidence was offered to explain factual issues \u201crelated to observations and conclusions Dr. Steele made in the course of his treatment\u201d and should have gone to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\u00b616 Though district courts have broad discretion to control the admission of evidence at trial, we have long recognized that it is \u201cthe sole province of the jury to determine questions of fact.\u201d <em>Murray v. Heinze, </em>17 Mont. 353, 364, 42 P. 1057, 1061 (1895). As such, courts should liberally construe the rules of evidence to admit all relevant expert testimony, even if that evidence may be characterized as \u201cshaky.\u201d <em>McClue, </em>\u00b6 23. \u201cThe expert\u2019s testimony then is open for attack through \u2018the traditional and appropriate\u2019 methods: \u2018vigorous cross examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof.\u2019 \u201d <em>McClue, </em>\u00b6 23 (quoting <em>State v. Clifford, </em>2005 MT 219, \u00b6 28, 328 Mont. 300, 121 P.3d 489).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">\u00b617 In the first excluded portion of his testimony, Dr. Steele responded to a request for clarification of his treatment note that a vehicle collision \u201ccan be\u201d a contributor to Cleveland\u2019s symptoms. Dr. Steele did not opine whether the collision caused Cleveland\u2019s rotator cuff tear. Rather, he testified about the medical difficulty of determining the \u201cpain generator\u201d of shoulder and neck pain. This testimony was factual; thus, it was admissible. Although this testimony should have been admitted, Dr. Steele made a similar statement using nearly the same language earlier in his deposition. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">[0]ne of the big conundrums of musculoskeletal care is all the nerve roots from the neck go there through the shoulder ... so sometimes shoulder pain is neck pain and sometimes neck pain is shoulder pain.... It\u2019s an extremely challenging area to determine what\u2019s coming from where.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">The District Court did not exclude that testimony and, thus, there is not a reasonable possibility that the excluded evidence contributed to the jury\u2019s verdict. The District Court\u2019s exclusion of Dr. Steele\u2019s testimony was not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">\u00b618 The second and third excluded portions of Dr. Steele\u2019s testimony directly pertain to the cause of Cleveland\u2019s rotator cuff tear. In the second excluded portion, Dr. Steele responded to a question regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>whether Cleveland had a rotator cuff tear in 2001 by refusing to speculate as to when Cleveland\u2019s rotator cuff tear occurred. In the third excluded portion, during a discussion about whether Cleveland had a rotator cuff tear prior to the collision, Dr. Steele testified that a person typically would show symptoms of a tear. In the fourth excluded portion, Dr. Steele discussed the various treatment options for Cleveland\u2019s rotator cuff tear.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u00b619  There is no dispute that Cleveland had a rotator cuff tear. However, as discussed below in our resolution of Issue 3, Cleveland never produced expert testimony that her rotator cuff tear was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d caused by the collision, and the jury ultimately did not consider that claim because of the District Court\u2019s directed verdict. As further discussed in our resolution of Issue 3, Cleveland never argued that her rotator cuff tear, even if pre-existing, was aggravated or rendered symptomatic by the collision. In the absence of either medical evidence supporting Cleveland\u2019s causation theory or an argument that the collision aggravated a pre-existing condition, the District Court did not err by excluding testimony about the cause of Cleveland\u2019s rotator cuff tear or treatment for that injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\u00b620 In the fifth excluded portion of his testimony, Dr. Steele testified that it was not possible to apportion Cleveland\u2019s symptoms between the vehicle collision and any pre-existing conditions. Cleveland contends on appeal that this testimony was admissible to rebut Ward\u2019s contention that Cleveland\u2019s symptoms were \u201c100% attributable to a pre-existing rotator cuff tear.\u201d However, this was not Ward\u2019s contention. The only testimony in this regard came when Cleveland\u2019s attorney asked Ward\u2019s medical expert, Dr. Heid, whether Cleveland\u2019s limitations were \u201ccompletely 100 percent unrelated to the motor vehicle accident.\u201d Dr. Heid responded that the question was misleading because it was unclear how much of Cleveland\u2019s limitations were due to her neck injury versus her shoulder injury. Since Ward never attempted to apportion potential causes of Cleveland\u2019s injuries to the jury, Dr. Steele\u2019s testimony that it was not possible to apportion Cleveland\u2019s symptoms was not in rebuttal of anything. The District Court did not err in excluding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">\u00b621 <em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by excluding trial testimony of Cleveland\u2019s physical therapist, Anne Ripley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">\u00b622 Cleveland next contends that the District Court abused its discretion by barring Ripley from offering medical causation testimony. At trial and outside of the presence of the jury, the District Court questioned Ripley about the scope of her testimony. When asked by the court whether she could determine the cause of a rotator cuff tear, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Ripley responded: \u201cI can\u2019t say that the accident caused the rotator cuff tear. But I can say function was normal before the accident and after the accident she had all of this change.\u201d Based in part on this statement, the District Court decided that it was \u201cnot going to allow [Ripley] to offer testimony as to medical causation.\u201d The District Court further explained that Cleveland had not produced required medical expert testimony that, \u201cto a reasonable degree of medical certainty!,] ... this accident caused her rotator cuff tear.\u201d On appeal, Cleveland contends that the District Court reached this decision arbitrarily by not first allowing Cleveland an opportunity to make an offer of proof. Cleveland further contends that the District Court should have considered Ripley\u2019s qualifications to determine whether she was competent to testify under M. R. Evid. 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">\u00b623 Regardless of whether Ripley was qualified as a physical therapist to testify on medical causation, she clearly indicated that she could not opine that the collision caused Cleveland\u2019s rotator cuff tear. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Ripley could not testify that the collision \u201cmore likely than not\u201d caused Cleveland\u2019s rotator cuff tear.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\u00b624 Moreover, it bears noting that the District Court did not exclude Ripley\u2019s testimony regarding Cleveland\u2019s general pain and limitations in her shoulder. Outside of the presence of the jury, Ripley told the court that she could testify \u201cabout the change in function that I saw after the motor vehicle accident in [Cleveland], I can talk about her pain ....\u201d The District Court never said that Ripley could not provide this information to the jury. In fact, before the District Court made its ruling, and while Ripley was still in front of the jury, Ripley extensively testified about Cleveland\u2019s shoulder injuries, functional limitations, and pain. The District Court did not exclude any of this testimony. The District Court\u2019s ruling that Ripley could not testify that the collision caused Cleveland\u2019s rotator cuff tear did not prevent Cleveland\u2019s attorney from asking Ripley further questions about her treatment of Cleveland\u2019s injuries. Nor did the Court\u2019s ruling prevent Cleveland\u2019s attorney from asking whether Ripley believed the collision aggravated a pre-existing injury or prevent Ripley from testifying about Cleveland\u2019s pain and limitations before and after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"Abc\">\u00b625 <em>3. Whether the District Court erred in granting a directed verdict on Cleveland\u2019s claim that her rotator cuff tear and shoulder arthritis were caused by the collision.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">\u00b626 \u201cA directed verdict ... is not proper if reasonable persons could differ regarding the conclusions which could be drawn from the evidence, and a directed verdict is proper only in the complete absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>of any evidence to warrant submission to the jury.\u201d <em>King v. Zimmerman, </em>266 Mont. 54, 60, 878 P.2d 895, 899 (1994). The District Court granted Ward\u2019s motion for a directed verdict \u201cas to the argument for the rotator cuff or arthritic condition\u201d because it concluded: \u201cThere is no medical causation, expert testimony, that says that [Cleveland\u2019s] rotator cuff arthritic condition in her shoulder is related to the accident.... [N]obody has \u2014 and we have to have an expert \u2014 has said it was caused by the motor vehicle accident.\u201d On appeal, Cleveland contends that the District Court erred in reaching this decision because the jury could infer from \u201csubstantial credible evidence\u201d that the collision was the \u201capparent cause\u201d of Cleveland\u2019s \u201con-going shoulder pain and limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b627 Regarding its directed verdict, the District Court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">I have further concluded at the conclusion of the evidence that there is insufficient evidence to establish that the motor vehicle accident caused the plaintiffs rotator cuff tear and arthritis in the right shoulder. So you are not to be awarding damages for the rotator cuff tear or the arthritis in her right shoulder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Nowhere in its ruling on Ward\u2019s motion for a directed verdict or explanation of that ruling to the jury did the District Court prevent Cleveland from arguing that the collision aggravated a pre-existing condition or caused her pain and limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"AsP\">\u00b628  On appeal, Cleveland conflates the District Court\u2019s directed verdict on the issue of whether the accident caused her objectively-diagnosed rotator cuff tear and shoulder arthritis \u2014 an argument that did not have the required medical testimony to support it \u2014 with the issue of whether the accident aggravated those injuries, irrespective of their origin \u2014 an argument that was not made to the District Court. As a general rule, \u201cthis Court will not address either an issue raised for the first time on appeal or a party\u2019s change in legal theory.\u201d <em>Unified Indus., Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 255, 961 P.2d 100 (citing Day <em>v. Payne, </em>280 Mont. 273, 276, 929 P.2d 864, 866 (1996)). This is because \u201cit is fundamentally unfair to fault the trial court for failing to rule correctly on an issue it was never given the opportunity to consider.\u201d <em>Easley, </em>\u00b6 15 (quoting Day, 280 Mont. at 276-77, 929 P.2d at 866). We will not fault the District Court for failing to rule on Cleveland\u2019s claim that the collision aggravated a pre-existing injury or caused her pain because the District Court never was given the opportunity to consider that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">\u00b629 <em>4. Whether the District Court erred in concluding that Cleveland could not recover damages incurred by Shelby House.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>\u00b630 In its January 21, 2015 order on Ward\u2019s motions in limine, the District Court concluded that Cleveland could not seek damages for \u201cbusiness loss/lost income\u201d on behalf of Shelby House because Shelby House was not a named party in the lawsuit. Cleveland claims that the District Court erred in excluding evidence of an alleged increase in payroll expenses incurred by Shelby House, and that she has standing to assert a claim for these losses because they filter through to her as the sole shareholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">\u00b631  \u201cA corporation has a separate and distinct entity from its stockholders.\u201d <em>First Sec. Bank v. </em>Gary, 245 Mont. 394, 402, 798 P.2d 523, 528 (1990). As the District Court recognized, \u201c[generally, a shareholder may not bring a claim that belongs to their corporation.\u201d <em>Weaver v. Advanced Refrigeration, </em>2011 MT 174, \u00b6 14, 361 Mont. 233, 257 P.3d 378 (citing <em>Gullett v. Van Dyke Constr. Co., </em>2005 MT 105, \u00b6 14, 327 Mont. 30, 111 P.3d 220). This includes claims of profits lost to the corporation. <em>Gullet, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14, 17. Cleveland is bound by her pleadings, <em>see Weaver, </em>\u00b6 15, and she does not allege personal loss of income due to her injuries. Any claim against Ward for \u201cbusiness loss/lost income\u201d belongs to Shelby House, not to Cleveland personally. <em>See Weaver, </em>\u00b6 15. The District Court did not err in concluding that Cleveland could not recover damages incurred by Shelby House.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\u00b632 The District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Dr. Steele may not testify that the vehicle collision caused Cleveland\u2019s torn rotator cuff and shoulder injuries. Any abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s exclusion of the five disputed portions of Dr. Steele\u2019s testimony was not reversible error. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Ripley may not testify that the collision caused Cleveland\u2019s rotator cuff tear or shoulder arthritis. Because Cleveland produced no expert testimony that her rotator cuff tear or shoulder arthritis more likely than not were caused by the collision, the District Court did not err in granting a directed verdict on that claim. Finally, the District Court did not err in concluding that Cleveland may not recover damages incurred by Shelby House. We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b149-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, McKINNON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\"> The District Court also granted and denied Ward\u2019s motions on other issues not appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b149-8\">JUSTICE COTTER,</author>\n<p id=\"ATt\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">\u00b633 I concur in the outcome reached by the Court, but not in all that is said in the Opinion. At \u00b6 19, in addressing the exclusion of Dr. Steele\u2019s testimony, the Court states that Cleveland never argued that her rotator cuff tear was aggravated or rendered symptomatic by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>collision. However, as the Court notes at \u00b6 4, Dr. Steele had already opined in his deposition that \u201cthe automobile accident could have exacerbated it; the automobile accident could have nothing to do with it. I really don\u2019t know at this point.\u201d Thus, Dr. Steele was on record prior to trial that he would not offer an opinion as to aggravation. Cleveland\u2019s counsel did inquire of the defendant\u2019s expert orthopedic surgeon Dr. Heid whether the motor vehicle accident caused any aggravation of a pre-existing injury, and it was her opinion that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\u00b634 I also disagree with the Court\u2019s contention at \u00b6 24 that the District Court\u2019s ruling did not prevent Cleveland\u2019s attorney from asking Ripley whether the collision aggravated a pre-existing injury. As we note in \u00b6 22, the District Court ruled that it would not allow Ripley to offer testimony as to medical causation. A witness testifying that an accident aggravated an injury is clearly testifying as to causation for an aggravated injury; therefore, this opinion too would likely have been excluded. For the same reason, I disagree with the Court\u2019s incorrect assertion at \u00b6 27 that nothing prevented Cleveland from arguing that the collision aggravated a pre-existing condition. As noted, Steele refused to offer an opinion on aggravation, Heid denied it occurred, and Ripley was precluded by court order from offering a causation opinion. Without expert testimony to support a claim that the accident aggravated a pre-existing injury, Cleveland could not present this argument to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\u00b635 With these caveats, I concur in the Court\u2019s Opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
