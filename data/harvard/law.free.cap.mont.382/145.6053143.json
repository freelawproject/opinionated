(Father) appeals from the orders of the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Yellowstone County, terminating his parental rights to A.M.S., M.A.S., and A.W.S., and entering decrees of adoption in favor of C. J. (Grandfather). In accordance with M. R. App. P. 10(6), we have amended the caption to remove the full names of all involved parties. We restate the dispositive issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">\n<em>1. Whether Father was properly served by publication.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court erred in granting the petition for adoption and termination.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">\u00b62 We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b168-13\">\u00b63 Father and J.J. (Mother) are the biological parents of minor children, A.M.S., M.A.S., and A.W.S. Grandfather is the children\u2019s maternal grandfather. Although the record on appeal is quite limited, it is undisputed that Father and Mother married in 2005 and divorced in 2013. Mother and Grandfather currently reside in Billings, Montana, and Father resides in Los Angeles, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-14\">\u00b64 On July 1, 2014, Mother and Grandfather filed a joint petition for termination of Father\u2019s parental rights and for Grandfather to adopt the children. Under the petition, Mother would maintain her parental rights. The District Court issued a summons for Father on the same day the petition was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-15\">\u00b65 After attempting to serve Father, whose exact whereabouts in Southern California were unknown at the time, Mother\u2019s and Grandfather\u2019s counsel submitted an affidavit on October 14, 2014, stating that Father could not be found and requesting that the District Court order publication of summons. On October 15, 2014, the Clerk of Court entered an order directing that service of the summons be made upon Father by publication in the <em>Billings Times </em>newspaper.</p>\n<p id=\"A58\">\u00b66 Father did not respond to the summons. On December 12, 2014, Mother and Grandfather filed a motion for entry of default. The Clerk of Court entered default against Father three days later on December <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>15, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\u00b67 The District Court held a hearing on March 13, 2015. During the seven-minute hearing, Grandfather and Mother testified and submitted one exhibit. The exhibit included the following documents: a letter from Grandfather\u2019s and Mother\u2019s counsel to a California-based process server; a letter to Father at a Billings address regarding the proceedings; an e-mail to Father regarding the proceedings; and a number of pictures of Father from various social media sites. Father did not provide on appeal, and the record does not contain, a hearing transcript. At the close of the hearing, the District Court issued combined written orders terminating Father\u2019s parental rights and granting decrees of adoption for each of the children.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights for an abuse of discretion. <em>In re the Matter of the Termination of the Parental Rights and Adoption of: J.W.M. &amp; A.K.M., </em>2015 MT 231, \u00b6 11, 380 Mont. 282, 354 P.3d 626. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason. <em>J.W.M., </em>\u00b6 11. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of statutes for correctness, and its findings of fact to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>In re the Parenting of S.J.H. &amp; J.B.H, </em>2014 MT 40, \u00b6 8, 374 Mont. 31, 318 P.3d 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">\u00b69 It is well established that parental rights are a fundamental liberty interest that \u201cmust be protected by fundamentally fair procedures.\u201d <em>In the Matter of K.J.B., </em>2014 MT 327, \u00b6 18, 377 Mont. 270, 339 P.3d 824 (citing <em>In re Adoption of A.W.S. &amp; K.R.S., </em>2014 MT 322, \u00b6 25, 377 Mont. 234, 339 P.3d 414); <em>In re the Matter of J.N. &amp; A.N., </em>1999 MT 64, \u00b6 12, 293 Mont. 524, 977 P.2d 317. Accordingly, \u201ca district court must adequately address each applicable statutory requirement before terminating an individual\u2019s parental rights.\u201d <em>J.N., </em>\u00b6 12 (citing <em>In re Declaring E. W., C. W., &amp; A.W., </em>1998 MT 135, \u00b6 12, 289 Mont. 190, 959 P.2d 951). Because an order terminating parental rights implicates a fundamental liberty interest, it must be supported by \u201cclear and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>convincing evidence that the statutory criteria for termination have been met.\u201d <em>J.N., </em>\u00b6 12 (citing <em>E. </em>W., \u00b6 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\u00b610 <em>1. Whether Father was properly served by publication.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">\u00b611 Title 42, MCA, governs the termination of parental rights when a child is the subject of an adoption proceeding. Sections 42-2-601 to - 620, MCA. Under \u00a7 42-2-605(1), MCA, notice of a hearing on a petition for termination of parental rights \u201cmust be served in any manner appropriate under the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure or in any manner that the court may direct ....\u201d The notice must inform the individual whose rights will be terminated \u201cthat failure to appear at the hearing constitutes a waiver of the individual\u2019s interest in custody of the child and will result in the court\u2019s termination of the individual\u2019s rights to the child.\u201d Section 42-2-605(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">\u00b612 Father argues that the clerk\u2019s order for publication was improper and that service may not be made by publication in a proceeding to terminate parental rights. Mother and Grandfather respond that service by publication is proper under \u00a7 42-2-605(1), MCA. They further contend that they \u201cfollowed both the letter and the spirit of this law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">\u00b613 The Montana Rules of Civil Procedure authorize service by publication in four enumerated situations. M. R. Civ. P. 4(o)(l)(A)-(D). A parental rights termination proceeding is not one of the listed situations. Nevertheless, service by publication is permitted by statute in parental rights termination proceedings brought under both Title 41 and Title 42. Sections 41-3-428 and -429, MCA, authorize service by publication in child abuse and . neglect cases and specify the requirements for service in those cases. Section 42-2-605(1), MCA, provides for service of a notice of hearing on a petition for termination of parental rights brought in conjunction with an adoption proceeding \u201cin any manner appropriate under the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure or in any manner that the court may direct on ... a person who is recorded on the child\u2019s birth certificate as the child\u2019s father;... or... a parent... of the child in question who has not waived notice.\u201d We have observed that this statute allows a district court to order service by publication even though that method of service is not otherwise allowed by M. R. Civ. P. 4(o). <em>M.B.J. v. Fourth Judicial Dist. Ct., </em>2010 Mont. LEXIS 515, *8, No. OP 10-0345 Or. (Mont. Oct. 6, 2010) (granting petition for writ of supervisory control and directing district court to order service of putative father(s) by publication).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">\u00b614  Because \u00a7 42-2-605(1), MCA, provides for alternate service \u201cin any manner that <em>the court </em>may direct\u201d (emphasis added), publication may not be ordered by the clerk in the manner provided by M. R. Civ. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>P. 4(o)(3)(B). Rather, the court must direct the manner of alternate service in order for it be sufficient under \u00a7 42-2-605(1), MCA. Here, the Clerk of Court, not the District Court, entered the order directing service by publication. Service therefore was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\u00b615  Service by publication further was insufficient because the publication did not put Father on notice that his parental rights would be terminated as required by \u00a7 42-2-605(2), MCA. The affidavit of publication in the record contains a copy of the published notice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">IN THE MATTER OF THE ADOPTION OF A.M.S.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">THE STATE OF MONTANA SENDS GREETINGS TO RESPONDENT [FATHER]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">You are hereby summoned to respond to the petition in this action which is filed in the office of the Clerk of this Court, a copy of which is herewith served upon you, and to file your response and serve a copy thereof upon the co-petitioners\u2019 attorney within twenty-one (21) days after the service of this Summons, exclusive of the date of service; and in case of your failure to respond, judgment will be taken against you by default for the relief requested in the petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Although the notice informed Father that if he did not respond \u201cjudgment [would] be taken against [him] by default for the relief requested in the petition,\u201d it did not specify the relief requested. The notice therefore failed to inform Father \u201cthat failure to appear at the hearing constitutes a waiver of [his] interest in custody of the child and will result in the court\u2019s termination of [his] rights to the child.\u201d Section 42-2-605(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">\u00b616  The District Court incorrectly applied the statutes governing service of the petition and notice of the hearing on Father. We conclude that Father was not properly served by publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">\u00b617 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in granting the petition for adoption and termination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">\u00b618 Although our holding on Issue 1 requires reversal of the District Court\u2019s orders and decrees, we address Father\u2019s legal challenges to the termination and adoption in the event that service is perfected on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">\u00b619 Father relies on <em>K.J.B. </em>to assert that Mother and Grandfather were not permitted to bring the petition to terminate and adopt \u201cin the first instance.\u201d He argues that Grandfather and Mother are not parties who may bring a petition for termination under \u00a7 42-2-603(2), MCA, and that Grandfather is not a stepparent who may bring a petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>termination of parental rights in conjunction with a petition for adoption. Father therefore contends that the District Court lacked authority to terminate his parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b620 <em>K.J.B. </em>does not support Father\u2019s argument in this case. In K.J.B., the mother sought termination of the father\u2019s parental rights, but the parties\u2019 child was not the subject of an adoption proceeding. <em>K.J.B., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3, 14. We therefore concluded that the mother could not bring the petition because a petition for termination of parental rights \u201cunder Title 42 may be filed only if the child is the subject of an adoption proceeding.\u201d <em>K.J.B., </em>\u00b6 14 (citing \u00a7 42-2-607(2), MCA). Here, the children are the subject of an adoption proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\u00b621 Under Title 42, \u201c[a]n adoption decree may not be entered if the child who is the subject of an adoption proceeding is not legally free for adoption.\u201d Section 42-1-107(1), MCA. Section 42-2-602(1), MCA, provides that \u201ca child is not legally free for adoption until the parental rights of the birth parent or parents have been terminated by a court: (1) as provided in this title ....\u201d Mother and Grandfather joined a petition for termination of parental rights with a petition for adoption \u2014 a procedure that Title 42 authorizes for stepparent adoptions. Section 42-4-302(3), MCA (providing that \u201c[a] petition for adoption by a stepparent may be joined with a petition for termination of parental rights\u201d); \u00a7 42-4-310, MCA (providing in pertinent part that \u201c[a] stepparent who desires to adopt a stepchild shall obtain an order of termination of parental rights of the child\u2019s noncustodial parent prior to <em>or contemporaneously with </em>the petition to adopt....\u201d (emphasis added)). <em>See J. W.M. </em>(reviewing a petition for termination and adoption brought by mother and stepfather); <em>In re the Adoption </em>of K.P.M., 2009 MT 31, \u00b6 45, 349 Mont. 170, 201 P.3d 833 (Nelson, J., dissenting) (observing that \u201ca stepparent may join [his or her] petition for adoption with the natural parent\u2019s petition for termination of parental rights\u201d). If the petitions are joined, both the required contents for a termination of parental rights petition under \u00a7 42-2-604, MCA, and the required contents for an adoption petition under \u00a7 42-5-101, MCA, must be included. Furthermore, a petition for adoption and a petition for termination may be brought only by the proper parties. Sections 42-2-603(2) and 42-1-106, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">\u00b622 Section 42-2-603(2), MCA, provides that a petition for termination of parental rights may be filed by \u201ca guardian with custody of the child ....\u201d Although these terms are not defined in Title 42, we find it appropriate to consult other provisions of the Montana Code to ascertain their meaning. When a word is defined in any part of the MCA, the same definition applies \u201cwherever it occurs, except where a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>contrary intention plainly appears.\u201d Section 1-2-107, MCA. <em>See In re the Matter of the Conservatorship of Minor Children, J.S., K.S., &amp; R.S., </em>2015 MT 335, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 381 Mont. 462, 362 P.3d 76 (applying statute in Title 40, MCA, to ascertain duties of guardian ad litem under \u00a7 25-5-301, MCA). \u201cGuardian\u201d is defined in Title 41 as \u201can adult: (a) who is responsible for a youth and has the reciprocal rights, duties, and responsibilities with the youth; and (b) whose status is created and defined by law.\u201d Section 41-5-103(21), MCA. <em>See also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>822 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 10th ed. 2014) (defining \u201cguardian\u201d as \u201c[s]omeone who has the legal authority and duty to care for another\u2019s person or property, esp. because of the other\u2019s infancy, incapacity, or disability\u201d). Title 40 defines the \u201cparent and child relationship\u201d as \u201cthe legal relationship existing between a child and the child\u2019s natural or adoptive parents incident to which the law confers or imposes rights, privileges, duties, and obligations. It includes the mother and child relationship and the father and child relationship.\u201d Section 40-6-102(2), MCA. Parental authority over a child ceases upon a court\u2019s appointment of a guardian or when the child marries or attains majority. Section 40-6-234, MCA. A parent\u2019s legal rights, powers, and obligations also are divested by a decree terminating the parent-child legal relationship. Section 41-3-611, MCA. \u201cPhysical custody\u201d is \u201cthe physical care and supervision of a child.\u201d Section 40-7-103(14), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\u00b623 As the children\u2019s natural mother who undisputedly has physical custody of the three children, Mother is a \u201cguardian with custody of the child[ren]\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 42-2-603(2), MCA. She has standing to bring a petition for termination, provided that the children are the subject of a proper adoption proceeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AJNJ\">\u00b624 Section 42-1-106, MCA, provides that the following individuals have standing to adopt a child if they otherwise meet the requirements of Title 42:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-5\">(1) a husband and wife jointly or either the husband or wife if the other spouse is a parent of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">(2) an unmarried individual who is at least 18 years of age; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>(3) a married individual at least 18 years of age who is legally separated from the other spouse or whose spouse has judicially been declared incompetent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Because Mother is not relinquishing her children for adoption but seeking their adoption under the stepparent adoption procedures, the requirements of Title 42 \u201cotherwise\u201d applicable in this case are those contained in Title 42, chapter 4, part 3, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\u00b625 Under our case law, a \u201cstepparent\u201d is normally \u201csomeone who is married to a child\u2019s biological parent.\u201d <em>In the Matter of J.B., </em>2015 MT 342, \u00b6 19, 381 Mont. 525, 362 P.3d 859 (citations omitted). Section 42-4-302(2), MCA, however, provides that \u201c[f]or good cause shown, a court may allow an individual who is not the stepparent but who has the consent of the custodial parent of a child to file a petition for adoption.\u201d Such a petition \u201cmust be treated as if the petitioner were a stepparent.\u201d Section 42-4-302(2), MCA. In that case, the petition for adoption \u201cmay be joined with a petition for termination of parental rights.\u201d Section 42-4-302(3), MCA. The District Court made no findings of fact on Grandfather\u2019s standing under either \u00a7 42-1-106 or \u00a7 42-4-302(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\u00b626  On remand, and if service is effected properly on Father, the District Court may allow the petition to proceed if it first determines that there is \u201cgood cause\u201d for Grandfather to be treated as a \u201cstepparent\u201d under \u00a7 42-4-302(2), MCA, and that he meets the qualifications set forth in \u00a7 42-1-106, MCA. If the court so finds, it then may move forward with proceedings on the termination of Father\u2019s parental rights in accordance with \u00a7 42-4-310, MCA, \u201cprior to or contemporaneously with the petition to adopt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">\u00b627 We reverse the District Court\u2019s order terminating Father\u2019s parental rights and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b174-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, McKINNON, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b169-10\"> We consolidated the three orders following Father\u2019s appeal.
