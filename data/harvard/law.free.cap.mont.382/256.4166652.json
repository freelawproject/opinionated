Montana Cannabis Industry Association, Mark Matthews, Shelly Yeager, Jesse Rumble, John Stowers, M.D., Point Hatfield, and Charlie Hamp (collectively \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) cross-appeal the District Court\u2019s refusal to enjoin other provisions of the Act. We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">1. <em>Whether the District Court erred in determining that the Act\u2019s provision requiring the Department of Public Health and Human Services (Department) to notify the Board of Medical Examiners of any physician who certifies 25 or more patients in a year for medical marijuana (\u00a7 50-46-303(10), MCA) fails rational basis review.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">\n<em>2. Whether the District Court erred in determining that the Act\u2019s commercial prohibitions (\u00a7\u00a7 50-46-308(3), (4), (6)(a),(b), MCA) fail rational basis review.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">\n<em>3. Whether the District Court erred in applying strict scrutiny review to the Act\u2019s provision prohibiting advertising by providers of medical marijuana (\u00a7 50-46-341, MCA), thereby concluding that the provision unconstitutionally infringes free speech.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">\n<em>4. Whether the District Court erred in determining that the Act\u2019s provision prohibiting probationers from becoming registered cardholders for medical marijuana use (\u00a7 50-46-307(4), MCA) withstands a facial challenge under rational basis scrutiny.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-11\">\n<em>5. Whether the District Court erred in determining that the Act\u2019s provision allowing warrantless inspections of medical marijuana providers\u2019 businesses by the Department and law enforcement agencies (\u00a7 50-46-329, MCA) comports with the U.S. and Montana Constitutions\u2019 guarantees against unreasonable searches.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-12\">\u00b62 We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-13\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b280-14\">\u00b63 This is the State\u2019s second appeal from the First Judicial District Court\u2019s injunctions preventing implementation of certain provisions of the Act. <em>Montana Cannabis Industry Association v. State, </em>2012 MT 201, 366 Mont. 224, 286 P.3d 1161 (hereafter <em>MCIA </em>I). The Act repealed the 2004 Medical Marijuana Act (2004 Act) \u2014 which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>established by voter initiative (1-148) \u2014 and replaced it with a new statutory framework. The Act contains multiple provisions that limit both the eligibility of patients to qualify for its protections and the activities of medical professionals and providers of marijuana for medical purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b64 In the first case, the District Court preliminarily enjoined several of the Act\u2019s provisions, including: its ban on the commercial sale of medical marijuana; its ban on provider advertising; its authorization of warrantless inspections; and the 25-patient physician review trigger. In its first order, the court reasoned that those provisions implicated Plaintiffs\u2019 fundamental constitutional rights, triggering strict scrutiny analysis. The State agreed to a preliminary injunction against several of the challenged provisions pending consideration of the constitutional merits, but appealed the injunction against the commercial ban on the ground that the District Court erred in applying strict scrutiny analysis to the provisions in the absence of an infringement on fundamental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b65 In <em>MCIA I, </em>we determined that the commercial ban did not implicate the fundamental rights to employment, to health, or to privacy, and that Plaintiffs had no fundamental right to medical marijuana. Accordingly, we reversed and remanded the case to the District Court to apply rational basis scrutiny. <em>MCIA I, </em>\u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\u00b66 Following remand, Plaintiffs moved the District Court for a Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminary Injunction and Order to Show Cause. On October 26, 2012, the District Court granted a Temporary Restraining Order and set a Preliminary Injunction Hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At that hearing, Plaintiffs presented testimony from several witnesses to support their contention that many medical marijuana users and providers would suffer irreparable harm if certain provisions of the Act did not remain preliminarily enjoined. Several witnesses who suffered from debilitating medical conditions testified that they had very negative experiences with prescription drugs and that medical marijuana was the only treatment that provided them effective relief from their conditions. Providers of medical marijuana testified that without the injunction, it would not be feasible for them to continue their medical marijuana businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\u00b67 The State urged the District Court to deny the preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>injunction and to extend the temporary restraining order for a period to allow the Legislature to consider further amendments to the Act. To support its argument, the State referenced several abuses that occurred under the 2004 Act and that were discussed during the June 2011 preliminary injunction hearing. The State referenced telemedicine (the practice of some physicians to certify patients without ever actually seeing the patient), traveling caravans, and a disproportionate number of medical marijuana users in the \u201cchronic pain category\u201d who falsified or exaggerated their need for medical marijuana. The State also emphasized that one-third of medical marijuana users were growing their own supply at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\u00b68 Following the hearing, on January 16, 2013, the court issued an order maintaining its preliminary injunction against the Act\u2019s commercial prohibitions. The court concluded that \u201c[pjroperly registered and eligible cardholders will be injured or irreparably harmed if the Court does not preserve the status quo ... [because] cardholders will be unable to grow their own medical marijuana or will be unable to obtain it from a provider.\u201d Thereafter, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The District Court heard oral argument on the summary judgment motions on April 15, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\u00b69 On January 6, 2015, the District Court issued a Corrected Order on Motions for Summary Judgment. In its decision, the court reviewed the commercial ban and the 25-patient review trigger for a rational basis, and concluded that both provisions were invalid. The court applied strict scrutiny to the advertising prohibition, and enjoined it on the basis that the prohibition impermissibly restricted content-based political and educational speech. The District Court declined to enjoin the warrantless inspection provision and the ban on access to medical marijuana by probationers. The court entered its final judgment on January 8, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">\u00b610 The State appeals the injunctions against the commercial ban, the 25-patient physician review trigger, and the advertising ban. Plaintiffs cross-appeal the District Court\u2019s decision to uphold the warrantless inspection provision and the ban on probationer use. This Court heard oral argument on November 4, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">\u00b611 We review summary judgment rulings de novo, applying the criteria set forth in M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>Walters v. Flathead Concrete Prods., </em>2011 MT 45, \u00b6 8, 359 Mont. 346, 249 P.3d 913. Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>Walters, </em>\u00b6 8. If there are no genuine issues of material fact, we review for correctness a district court\u2019s conclusion that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Zinvest, LLC v. Hudgins, </em>2014 MT 201, \u00b6 11, 376 Mont. 72, 330 P.3d 1135.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\u00b612 This Court exercises plenary review of constitutional issues. <em>Big Sky Colony, Inc. v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Labor and Indus., </em>2012 MT 320, \u00b6 16, 368 Mont. 66, 291 P.3d 1231 (citation omitted). The constitutionality of a statute is presumed, \u201cunless it conflicts with the constitution, in the judgment of the court, beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Powell v. State Comp. Fund., </em>2000 MT 321, \u00b6 13, 302 Mont. 518, 15 P.3d 877. If any doubt exists, it must be resolved in favor of the statute. <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 13. The party challenging the constitutionality of a statute bears the burden of proof. <em>Big Sky Colony, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u00b613 We begin by acknowledging the proverbial \u201celephant in the room.\u201d Marijuana is a Schedule I Controlled Substance under the federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812, under whichits cultivation and distribution are illegal. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 844(a). In this case, no challenge is brought to the Act on the ground that it is preempted by federal law, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2, and the State expressly disclaimed such a challenge during oral argument. In the face of action in numerous states to legalize marijuana for medical or even recreational purposes,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the United States Department of Justice has issued guidance (discussed below) concerning enforcement priorities in an apparent effort to minimize conflict with state actions while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>maintaining the primacy of federal law. The Act is the Montana Legislature\u2019s attempt to navigate shifting public policy toward marijuana in the absence of Congressional action to resolve state and federal differences.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are not called upon in this case to review the broad question of Montana\u2019s authority to act on the subject of medical marijuana. Rather, we address only the question whether, having taken action on the subject, the Legislature\u2019s means of addressing this conflict are permissible under defined standards of constitutional analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\u00b614 Plaintiffs allege denial of equal protection and due process rights under article II, sections 4 and 17 of the Montana Constitution. Plaintiffs bring their constitutional claims as facial challenges to certain statutes within the Act. Analysis of a facial challenge to a statute differs from that of an as-applied challenge. <em>See e.g., State v. Whalen, </em>2013 MT 26, \u00b6\u00b6 20-22, 368 Mont. 354, 295 P.3d 105. In order to prevail on their facial challenges, Plaintiffs must show that \u201cno set of circumstances exists under which the [challenged sections] would be valid, <em>i.e., </em>that the law is unconstitutional in all of its applications.\u201d <em>Wash. State Grange v. Wash. State Republican Party, </em>552 U.S. 442, 449, 128 S. Ct. 1184, 1190 (2008) (citing <em>United States v. Salerno, </em>481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S. Ct. 2095, 2100 (1987)). <em>See also In re Marriage of K.E.V., </em>267 Mont. 323, 336, 883 P.2d 1246, 1255 (1994) (Trieweiler, J., concurring and dissenting) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) (noting that \u201ca facial challenge to a legislative act is of course the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no circumstances exist under which the act would be valid\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">\n<em>Equal Protection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u00b615 The principal purpose of the Montana Constitution\u2019s Equal Protection Clause, art. II, \u00a7 4, is to ensure that Montana\u2019s citizens are not subject to arbitrary and discriminatory state action. <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 16. When presented with an equal protection challenge, \u201cwe first identify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>the classes involved and determine whether they are similarly situated.\u201d <em>Rohlfs v. Klemenhagen, LLC, </em>2009 MT 440, \u00b6 23, 354 Mont. 133, 227 P.3d 42. If we determine that the challenged statute creates classes of similarly situated persons, we next decide whether the law treats the classes in an unequal manner. <em>Caldwell v. MACo Worker\u2019s Comp. Trust, </em>2011 MT 162, \u00b6 16, 361 Mont. 140, 256 P.3d 923. Thus, to state a meritorious equal protection claim, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that \u201cthe state has adopted a classification that affects two or more similarly situated groups in an unequal manner.\u201d <em>Bustell v. AIG Claims Serv. Inc., </em>2004 MT 362, \u00b6 20, 324 Mont. 478, 105 P.3d 286 (citing <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 22).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">\u00b616 A law may create a classification even if the classification is not expressed \u201con the face\u201d of the statute. <em>State v. Spina, </em>1999 MT 113, \u00b6 85, 294 Mont. 367, 982 P.2d 421 (citing John E. Nowak, et al., <em>Constitutional Law , </em>600 (2d ed. 1983)). \u201c[A] law may contain no classification, or a neutral classification, and be applied evenhandedly. Nevertheless the law may be challenged as in reality constituting a device designed to impose different burdens on different classes of persons.\u201d <em>Spina, </em>\u00b6 85 (citing Nowak, <em>supra, </em>at 600). Plaintiffs argue that the Act creates different classifications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">1. The class of persons with debilitating medical conditions: (a) some of whom have conditions for which marijuana is the single most effective medical treatment; (b) others who effectively may be treated with other pharmaceutical drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">2. Among those who are solely or optimally treated with marijuana: (a) those who have the physical ability and the means, including suitable space, to grow their own; (b) those who do not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The District Court concluded that the Act \u201cdo[es] impose different burdens on different classes of persons as described by [Plaintiffs] and, therefore, do[es] create a classification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">\u00b617 We concluded in <em>Caldwell </em>that a statute denying rehabilitation benefits to workers\u2019 compensation claimants based on a claimant\u2019s age-based eligibility for social security benefits created two classes of similarly-situated claimants because it distinguished by age between workers who had similar work-related injuries. <em>Caldwell, </em>\u00b6 18. The statutes at issue here concern a group of persons who all suffer from a debilitating medical condition but are distinguished by the manner in which they may obtain relief. Some may be treated effectively with pharmaceutical drugs; for others, marijuana is the sole or most effective treatment. The identifying factor that distinguishes them is the method of treatment. As we recognized in <em>MCIA I, </em>the Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>regulates a person\u2019s right to a particular treatment for his or her medical condition. <em>MCIA I, </em>\u00b6 24. We observed in <em>Caldwell </em>that whether the challenged statute creates a discriminatory classification is informed by the statute\u2019s purpose. <em>Caldwell, </em>\u00b6 19. In <em>Caldwell, </em>as in <em>Reesor v. Montana State Fund , </em>2004 MT 370, 325 Mont. 1, 103 P.3d 1019, age was \u201cthe only identifiable distinguishing factor between the two classes;\u201d we concluded in both cases that age was \u201cunrelated to a person\u2019s ability to engage in meaningful employment.\u201d <em>Caldwell, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>Reesor, </em>\u00b6 12. In contrast, we concluded in <em>Wilkes v. Montana State Fund, </em>2008 MT 29, 341 Mont. 292, 177 P.3d 483, that where \u201cactual wages\u201d was the single distinguishing factor between workers\u2019 compensation claimants, that was a \u201cfundamental distinction\u201d between the two classes sufficient to defeat similarity for purposes of the plaintiffs equal protection claim. <em>Wilkes, </em>\u00b6 20. We reasoned that one stated purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was that \u201cthe wage-loss benefit should bear a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost as a result of work-related injury or disease.\u201d <em>Wilkes, </em>\u00b6 26 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting \u00a7 39-71-105(1), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u00b618  The reasoning in <em>Wilkes </em>applies here. One stated purpose of the Act is to \u201cprovide legal protections to persons with debilitating medical conditions who engage in the use of marijuana to alleviate the symptoms of the debilitating medical condition.\u201d Section 50-46-301(2)(a), MCA. There is no need for the Legislature to provide legal protections to persons using prescribed pharmaceutical medication. \u201cThe distinguishing factor between the two classes, [their use of medical marijuana], plainly relates to the underlying justification of the statute.\u201d <em>Wilkes, </em>\u00b6 20. We conclude that the distinctions in regulation of different substances for medical treatment does not create two legitimate classes for an equal protection challenge because the single identifying factor \u2014 use of a substance prohibited by federal law \u2014 is a fundamental difference that sufficiently distinguishes the two classes to render them dissimilar.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\n<em>Substantive Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">\u00b619 Although there is considerable overlap between an equal protection analysis and a substantive due process analysis, \u201ceach Clause triggers a distinct inquiry.\u201d <em>Evitts v. Lucey, </em>469 U.S. 387, 405, 105 S. Ct. 830, 841 (1985). Equal protection \u201cemphasizes disparity in treatment by a State between classes of individuals whose situations are arguably indistinguishable,\u201d while due process \u201cemphasizes fairness between the State and the individual dealing with the State, regardless of how other individuals in the same situation may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>treated.\u201d <em>Evitts, </em>469 U.S. at 405, 105 S. Ct. at 841 (quoting <em>Ross v. Moffitt, </em>417 U.S. 600, 609, 94 S. Ct. 2437, 2443 (1974)). \u201cFor example, if a state prohibited all persons from purchasing or using a certain drug or medicine, a challenge to that law would be based on substantive due process.\u201d 2 Ronald D. Rotunda &amp; John E. Nowak, <em>Treatise on Constitutional Law: Substance and Procedure </em>\u00a7 15.4(a) at 824 (5th ed. 2012). Because Plaintiffs essentially claim that the Act\u2019s regulation of marijuana for medical purposes \u201crestrict[s] the freedom of all persons in society without a constitutionally legitimate justification,\u201d their challenges appropriately are analyzed under the due process clause, Montana Constitution Article II, Section 17. Rotunda &amp; Nowak, supra, at 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b620 Substantive due process also reflects a principle distinct from that protected by procedural due process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">If an individual asserts that the government must provide him with some type of procedural safeguards before the government takes an interest from him, he must demonstrate that the interest constitutes life, liberty, or property.... There is no need to define life, property or liberty for substantive due process analysis.... All laws might be said to restrict [an] individual\u2019s use of property rights or personal liberty, in the sense of restricting which actions the individual can take in society. Laws regulating property or liberty that do not restrict the exercise of a fundamental right should be upheld unless the person attacking the law can overcome the presumption of constitutionality and demonstrate that the law is not rationally related to a legitimate interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_t\">Rotunda &amp; Nowak, supra, \u00a7 15.5 at 847-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\u00b621 This Court analyzes substantive due process in the same fashion. Where a fundamental right is not implicated, \u201c[s]ubstantive due process analysis requires a test of the reasonableness of a statute in relation to the State\u2019s power to enact legislation.\u201d <em>Satterlee v. Lumberman\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co., </em>2009 MT 368, \u00b6 33, 353 Mont. 265, 222 P.3d 566 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 29). \u201cSince the State cannot use its power to take an unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious action against an individual, a statute enacted by the legislature must be reasonably related to a permissible legislative objective in order to satisfy guarantees of substantive due process.\u201d <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 33 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 29). <em>See Newville v. State Dep\u2019t of Family Servs., </em>267 Mont. 237, 249, 883 P.2d 793, 800 (1994). We analyze substantive due process claims by examining (1) whether the legislation in question is related to a legitimate governmental concern, and (2) whether the means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>chosen by the Legislature to accomplish its objective are reasonably related to the result sought to be attained. <em>Walters, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b622 In determining whether the statute\u2019s objective is legitimate, we examine the legislation\u2019s purpose, whether expressly stated or otherwise. <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34, 37 (examining the purpose of worker\u2019s compensation laws to determine whether they serve a permissible legislative objective); <em>Goble v. Mont. State Fund, </em>2014 MT 99, \u00b6 41, 374 Mont. 453, 325 P.3d 1211 (examining the stated policy provisions of the worker\u2019s compensation system to determine whether it serves a legitimate governmental interest). The legislation\u2019s purpose \u201cdoes not have to appear on the face of the legislation or in the legislative history, but may be any possible purpose of which the court can conceive.\u201d <em>Walters, </em>\u00b6 28 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 34). <em>See Kottel v. State, </em>2002 MT 278, \u00b6 55, 312 Mont. 387, 60 P.3d 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u00b623 In this case, we need not surmise possible purposes for the legislation because the Act makes explicit several purposes on its face. <em>See Walters, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31-32; <em>Goble, </em>\u00b6 41. Section 50-46-301, MCA, provides that the purposes of the Act are to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">(a) provide legal protections to persons with debilitating medical conditions who engage in the use of marijuana to alleviate the symptoms of the debilitating medical condition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">(b) allow for the limited cultivation, manufacture, delivery, and possession of marijuana as permitted by this part by persons who obtain registry identification cards;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\">(c) allow individuals to assist a limited number of registered cardholders with the cultivation and manufacture of marijuana or marijuana-infused products;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-9\">(d) establish reporting requirements for production of marijuana and marijuana-infused products and inspection requirements for premises; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-10\">(e) give local governments a role in establishing standards for the cultivation, manufacture, and use of marijuana that protect the public health, safety, and welfare of residents within their jurisdictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">Section 50-46-301(2), MCA. In addition, the legislative history demonstrates that the Act was enacted in response to the Legislature\u2019s concern about a number of abuses that occurred following passage of the 2004 Act.

In concluding that the statute at issue in that case lacked a rational basis, this Court relied on the absence of reasons in the legislation to impose a strict assumption of risk standard on skiers in contradiction to state comparative negligence statutes that applied to other inherently dangerous activities. <em>Brewer, </em>234 Mont. at 115, 762 P.2d at 230-31.

After this case was argued, Plaintiffs called the Court\u2019s attention to a recent Congressional Appropriations Act that prohibits the Justice Department from spending funds that would prevent states \u2014 including Montana \u2014 from implementing their own laws authorizing the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.

The court relied in part on testimony from Ian Marquand, who appeared on behalf of the State Board of Medical Examiners. Marquand testified that there had been almost no reported problems with medical marijuana certifications following a standard of care directive issued by the Board in 2010 that disallowed certification exclusively by telemedicine. The court also relied on testimony from Roy Kemp, administrator of the Department\u2019s medical marijuana registry program, who testified that \u201che knew of no rationale justifying the 25-patient limit.\u201d Marquand\u2019s and Kemp\u2019s testimony, coupled with \u201cthe fact that this provision has never been in effect,\u201d led the District Court to conclude that the 25-patient review trigger \u201cis not rationally related \u2014 indeed not necessary at all \u2014 to the goals of the medical marijuana laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u00b637 The State argues that the District Court erred in its application of rational basis standards because it considered circumstances regarding the lack of problems with medical marijuana certifications following entry of the first preliminary injunction. The State contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>that the court instead should have considered the \u201cflagrant abuses\u201d that were occurring in 2011, when the Legislature passed the Act. The State references testimony before a legislative conference committee to argue that the Legislature \u201crealized that the abuse of the \u2018chronic pain\u2019 category was best controlled by increasing physician accountability.\u201d The State also emphasizes the testimony of Dr. Stowers, one of the named plaintiffs, in the June 2011 preliminary injunction hearing. The State contends that Dr. Stowers acknowledged \u201cserious problems with doctor recommendations under the old law.\u201d The State asserts that the 25-patient review trigger is rationally related to the Act\u2019s goals because it creates a standard of care to ensure a bona fide physician-patient relationship and then \u201censur[es] the standard is being followed by requiring review after a doctor certifies 25 or more patients in a year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b638 We agree that the District Court incorrectly applied rational basis scrutiny to conclude that the 25-patient review trigger is not rationally related to the Act\u2019s goals. The District Court based its conclusion on a finding that the 25-patient review trigger was \u201cnot necessary\u201d to the goals of the medical marijuana laws. The question under rational basis review, however, is not whether the provision is necessary, but whether the provision is arbitrary or whether it has a \u201creasonable relation to some permitted end of governmental action <em>Powder River Cnty. v. State, </em>2002 MT 259, \u00b6 79, 312 Mont. 198, 60 P.3d 357 (citations omitted). Although any limit the Legislature chooses may be attacked as an arbitrary number, we conclude that a 25-patient review trigger is not arbitrary in light of the statute\u2019s objectives. The legislative history and testimony from the June 2011 preliminary injunction hearing show that there indeed were problems with over-certification under the 2004 Act. To address this problem, the Legislature created an objective standard of care for marijuana certification \u2014 set forth in \u00a7 50-46-302(2)(c), (18), MCA, \u2014 and the 25-patient review trigger. There is no arbitrary punishment for a doctor who certifies 25 or more patients because the Board of Medical Examiners is not required to suspend or otherwise take remedial action against the doctor under the statute. Section 50-46-303(10)(a), MCA. Section 50-46-303(10)(a), MCA, requires only that the board review the doctor\u2019s practices to determine whether they meet the standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u00b639 While a 25-patient review trigger may or may not be the most effective way to prevent over-certification, it is beyond our purview to second-guess the \u201cwisdom or expediency of the legislation.\u201d <em>Rohlfs, </em>\u00b6 31. And while there may not be precise statistical evidence that 25 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>patients is an ideal number to signal potential abuses, \u201crational distinctions may be made with substantially less than mathematical exactitude.\u201d <em>Ward, </em>\u00b6 23 (citations omitted). The review trigger also addresses the federal government\u2019s expectation for \u201cstrong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems that will address the threat [that State marijuana laws] could pose to public safety, public health, and other law enforcement interests.\u201d Cole Memorandum at 2. While a different scheme for preventing over-certification would have been permissible, the Legislature\u2019s policy choice in this instance is not constitutionally invalid. <em>See Ward, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">\u00b640 Finally, as noted above, the Legislature will continue to monitor its medical marijuana restrictions and recommend changes where circumstances warrant. Section 50-46-343, MCA. The 25-patient review trigger has never been in effect. Therefore, if the review provision turns out to be onerous or unworkable, the issue may be brought to the Legislature for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\u00b641  Because the 25-patient review trigger is rationally related to the legitimate state interest of carefully regulating the distribution of medical marijuana while allowing its limited use for people with debilitating medical conditions, we hold that the District Court erred in determining that the 25-patient review trigger failed rational basis review. Accordingly, we vacate the District Court\u2019s injunction against \u00a7 50-46-303(10), MCA, and uphold that provision of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\u00b642 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred in determining that the Act\u2019s commercial prohibitions (\u00a7\u00a7 50-46-308(3), (4), (6)(a), (b), MCA) fail rational basis review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">\u00b643 The District Court enjoined several provisions of the Act that prohibit commercial trade in marijuana and marijuana products. The Act accomplishes its commercial restraint through two primary mechanisms: a three-patient limit for providers of marijuana products and a restriction against remuneration to providers. Section 50-46-308, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">(3)(a)(i) A provider or marijuana-infused products provider may assist a maximum of three registered cardholders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">(ii) A person who is registered as both a provider and a marijuana-infused products provider may assist no more than three registered cardholders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\">(b) If the provider or marijuana-infused products provider is a registered cardholder, the provider or marijuana-infused products provider may assist a maximum of two registered cardholders other than the provider or marijuana-infused products provider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-11\">(4) A provider or marijuana-infused products provider may accept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>reimbursement from a cardholder only for the provider\u2019s application or renewal fee for a registry identification card issued under this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">(6) A provider or marijuana-infused products provider may not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">(a) accept anything of value, including monetary remuneration, for any services or products provided to a registered cardholder;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">(b) buy or sell mature marijuana plants, seedlings, cuttings, clones, usable marijuana, or marijuana-infused products.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Sections 50-46-308(3), (4), (6)(a), (b), MCA. The District Court analyzed the preceding sections as a whole, collectively referring to them as the \u201ccommercial provisions.\u201d The court concluded that Plaintiffs met their initial burden by showing that the sections created distinct classes, and that the burden then shifted to the State to justify the distinction. The court found that one of the Act\u2019s purposes is to \u201cafford access to marijuana for persons with seriously debilitating conditions.\u201d The court concluded that the commercial prohibitions \u201cwork in opposition to the goals of the statutes and the policy of the state\u201d because the \u201ccompassionate purposes\u201d of the statute are lost by the prohibition. According to the District Court, no provider \u201chas come forward willing to invest the time, money, and labor to provide medical marijuana for free.\u201d Therefore, the court concluded that the commercial prohibitions make it nearly impossible for people with the most serious debilitating conditions to get access to marijuana because the prohibitions essentially require them to grow their own marijuana \u2014 which they often are physically or financially unable to do. Based on these findings, the court held that there was no rational basis for the Act\u2019s commercial prohibitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">\u00b644 The District Court also addressed one of the State\u2019s justifications for the commercial prohibitions \u2014 that marijuana is illegal under federal law. The court concluded that federal illegality cannot be a justification for the commercial prohibitions because the Act itself is \u201ccontrary\u2019 to federal law. To further support its conclusion, the court emphasized that the State had not provided evidence to show that certain abuses, prior to the Act\u2019s passage, still existed. Based on this alleged lack of evidence, the court concluded that the commercial prohibitions were irrelevant because \u201cthe medical marijuana laws, as enjoined ... have accomplished their purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">\u00b645 The State argues that the commercial prohibitions \u201ceasily pass\u201d rational basis review for three reasons. First, the State claims that the court assumed an incorrect purpose for the Act because the explicit purpose of allowing \u201c limited\u2019 cultivation cannot be read to include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>affording commercial access \u2014 certainly not under rational basis review.\u201d The State argues that the court inappropriately ruled on the \u201cwisdom or expediency of the legislation\u201d rather than providing the State the benefit of the doubt and assuming \u201cany possible purpose\u201d that may provide a legitimate interest. Second, the State claims that the District Court erred in refusing to consider federal illegality as a possible legitimate state interest for the commercial prohibitions. The State asserts that it has a legitimate interest in \u201clessening the conflict between a state law, its citizens, and federal law,\u201d and that \u201ctaking the money out\u201d of medical marijuana means that the federal government is less likely to get involved. Third, as discussed above, the State argues that the District Court erred by considering changed circumstances or the effects of the court\u2019s preliminary injunctions. The State suggests that current circumstances support prohibition in any event because the growing number of cardholders evidences an increased potential for abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u00b646 Plaintiffs argue that the commercial prohibitions are an irrational response by the State to \u201cperceived abuses.\u201d According to Plaintiffs, \u201cthe State cannot, on the one hand, declare marijuana legally a medicine, but, on the other hand, arbitrarily discriminate as to who may access it.\u201d Plaintiffs contend that the State failed to provide \u201cconceivable justifications\u201d for the three-patient limit in its response to Plaintiffs\u2019 Interrogatories. Plaintiffs respond to the State\u2019s claimed justifications by arguing that: 1) selective scattered sound bites from legislative debates do not support rational basis because they are not authoritative and are \u201ctoo general and not supported by evidence;\u201d 2) according to Marquand\u2019s testimony, there have been no problems with traveling caravans, doctor certification, and telemedicine since 2011; and 3) the federal ban is equivocal in that the State cannot definitively say whether there truly is a danger of federal prosecution because the U.S. Department of Justice, in the Ogden and Cole Memoranda, have \u201cmade it clear it will not interfere with the states as long as the states carefully monitor their laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\u00b647 Our review of the commercial prohibitions focuses on whether they are rationally related to the State\u2019s legitimate interest in carefully regulating access to an otherwise illegal substance for serious medical conditions. We analyze the three-patient limit separately from the remuneration restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">\n<em>Three-Patient Limit: \u00a7 50-46-308(3), MCA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A42\">\u00b648 The three-patient limit is rational so long as it is not a capricious or arbitrary means of accomplishing the Act\u2019s legitimate purpose. <em>Powder River Cnty., </em>\u00b6 79. As noted previously, the Act was passed \u201cin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>response to a drastic increase of caregivers and medical marijuana users.\u201d <em>MCIA I, </em>\u00b6 2. Because of this concern, one of the Act\u2019s explicit purposes is to \u201callow individuals to assist a limited number of registered cardholders with the cultivation and manufacture of marijuana or marijuana-infused products.\u201d Section 50-46-301(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"ABx\">\u00b649 The Legislature determined that placing a limit on the number of registered cardholders a provider may assist serves the objectives of keeping marijuana away from large-scale manufacturing operations, making it less appealing to major traffickers. This relates directly to the federal government\u2019s goals of preventing marijuana sales revenue from going to criminal enterprises and of keeping state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover for other drug trafficking. Plaintiffs conceded during oral argument that, in light of these concerns, the State \u201cprobably could\u201d set limits on the number of cardholders a provider could assist. The Legislature conceivably could have fixed a different number. But in the face of marijuana\u2019s outright prohibition under federal law, and the U.S. government\u2019s avowed intention to investigate and prosecute marijuana offenses where it finds \u201can important federal interest,\u201d Cole Memorandum at 4, it is not irrational for the Legislature to put mechanisms in place to limit its commercial profitability. Whether a limit of just three patients is the best or the most effective means of achieving the State\u2019s legitimate purpose is not for the Court to judge. <em>Rohlfs, </em>\u00b6 31. Furthermore, it is outside our authority to opine on what number \u2014 if not three \u2014 would pass constitutional muster; \u201cmathematical exactitude\u201d is not required. <em>Ward, </em>\u00b6 23 (citations omitted). Finally, the Legislature has committed itself to reviewing such matters if the three-patient limit proves unworkable. Section 50-46-343, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u00b650  Because the three-patient limit is reasonably related to the legitimate governmental concern of affording a means of treatment while avoiding large-scale commercial marijuana production, we hold that the District Court erred in concluding that the three-patient limit fails rational basis scrutiny. <em>Walters, </em>\u00b6 18. Accordingly, we vacate the District Court\u2019s injunction against \u00a7 50-46-308(3) MCA, and we uphold this subsection of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\n<em>Remuneration Restrictions: \u00a7 50-46-308(4), (6)(a), (b), MCA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AX8\">\u00b651 In analyzing the remuneration restrictions for due process concerns we consider whether the restrictions bear a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation. <em>Powell, </em>\u00b6 29. The State asserts that the purpose of the remuneration restrictions is to protect Montana from federal involvement by avoiding large-scale commercial marijuana operations. According to the State, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>remuneration restrictions are rationally related to that goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\u00b652 Plaintiffs respond by pointing to Kemp\u2019s testimony that if the three-patient limit and the remuneration restrictions were implemented, \u201cthat alone would completely disable it and invalidate the program.\u201d While the initial choice to regulate is one for the legislative branch, Plaintiffs argue, \u201cthe Act\u2019s attempt to prohibit all commercial traffic is completely out of proportion to any reasonable assessment of potential abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\u00b653 Legislative history indicates that the purpose of imposing restrictions against financial compensation of providers was to \u201ckeep the money out\u201d of the marijuana business \u2014 presumably, to meet the federal government\u2019s objectives of preventing large-scale marijuana production operations that could serve as a front for other illegal drug trafficking and could funnel revenues to cartels, gangs, and criminal enterprises. While this is a legitimate objective, we must be able to ascertain a rational relationship between a complete prohibition against financial compensation and the objectives the Legislature sought to achieve. <em>Walters, </em>\u00b6 18. We conclude that the remuneration restrictions fail this inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">\u00b654 We first observe that the Act does not prohibit physicians from being compensated for their services or expenses when they examine a patient and provide written certification for the patient\u2019s medical use of marijuana products. In addition, the State has not cited, and the Court has not found, any other service or product sanctioned by state law that the Legislature has mandated be provided for free. Although the State argues that the remuneration restrictions do effectively \u201ckeep the money out,\u201d the restrictions are at odds with the Legislature\u2019s stated purpose of allowing the limited possession and use of marijuana by persons with debilitating medical conditions in order to alleviate their symptoms. Section 50-46-301(2)(a), (b), MCA. More, the restriction is contrary to the purpose of keeping marijuana revenues out of the hands of criminals because it drives the business of medical marijuana to the black market. The Act allows marijuana to be used medically with approval by a physician. The complete prohibition against compensation is invidious because medical marijuana, even when approved by a physician, would have no commercially available source of supply.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">\u00b655 Finally, this provision also implicates equal protection concerns. <em>See Evitts, </em>469 U.S. at 405, 105 S.

To withstand rational basis scrutiny, a legislative classification must rest upon a \u201creal difference\u201d and some reasonable consideration of difference or policy. <em>Powder River Cnty., </em>\u00b6 79. As between all users of medical marijuana, the remuneration provision imposes a peculiar disability upon those unable to provide for themselves. To prohibit all compensation arbitrarily sets apart the patient who is unable to produce a medical marijuana product for her own use; this is not encompassed within any of the Act\u2019s legitimate objectives and is not based on reasonable consideration of differences between people with debilitating medical conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\u00b656  Accordingly, we conclude that the absolute prohibition against remuneration is not reasonable \u201cwhen balanced against the purpose of the [L]egislature in enacting the [Act].\u201d <em>Egdorf, </em>\u00b6 19. We uphold the District Court\u2019s permanent injunction against the remuneration restrictions, \u00a7 50-46-308(4), (6)(a), (b), MCA, and declare that those provisions are invalid as violative of the equal protection and due process clauses of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\u00b657 3. <em>Whether the District Court erred in applying strict scrutiny review to the Act\u2019s provision prohibiting advertising by providers of medical marijuana (\u00a7 50-46-341, MCA), thereby concluding that the provision unconstitutionally infringes free speech.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\u00b658 Applying strict scrutiny, the District Court determined that the advertising prohibition violates the First Amendment. The court held that the provision restricts content-based speech because it \u201crenders the \u2018playing field\u2019 for discussion of pros and cons of medical marijuana completely uneven.\u201d Additionally, the District Court concluded that the advertising prohibition is \u201cso vague and overbroad as to be meaningless as to what it prohibits,\u201d because it leaves open the potential of banning political speech as well. The court also concluded that the statute is too narrow in that it limits only advertising by valid cardholders and because \u201c[r]egulations which impose speech restrictions on one group are seldom upheld.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\u00b659 The State asserts that this Court should apply basic rules of statutory construction to conclude that the statute unambiguously bars commercial speech only, thus affording it less protection. The State\u2019s primary contention is that the District Court erred by applying strict scrutiny to the advertising ban when it should have applied the four-part commercial speech test set forth in <em>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number><em>v. Public Service Commission of New York, </em>447 U.S. 557, 100 S. Ct. 2343 (1980).

Plaintiffs therefore claim that the court was correct to apply strict scrutiny instead of rational basis. Plaintiffs further argue that the government failed to meet even a rational basis standard when it relied on an overly deferential interpretation of the standard and failed to provide a M. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) witness or other evidence to justify the ban.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u00b661 The U.S. Supreme Court has defined commercial speech as an \u201cexpression related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience.\u201d <em>Cent. Hudson, </em>447 U.S. at 561, 100 S. Ct. at 2349. This definition, together with our well-established rules of statutory interpretation, guides our determination of the speech that \u00a7 50-46-341, MCA, prohibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\u00b662 In construing a statute, we are \u201cto ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. \u201cStatutory language must be construed according to its plain meaning and if the language is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is required.\u201d <em>In re Adoption of Snyder, </em>2000 MT 61, \u00b6 14, 299 Mont. 40, 996 P.2d 875. \u201c[W]e construe statutes narrowly to avoid an unconstitutional interpretation if possible.\u201d <em>Farrier v.

The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">Advertising prohibited. Persons with valid registry identification cards may not advertise marijuana or marijuana-related products in any medium, including electronic media.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AceF\">Section 50-46-341, MCA.

A product is \u201c[something that is distributed commercially for use or consumption ....\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra, </em>at 1402. These commonly understood terms the statute employs are not subject to multiple interpretations. The plain language clearly and unambiguously establishes that the statute is aimed solely at expression relating to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>the commercial sale of marijuana or marijuana products for use or consumption. We would impermissibly \u201cinsert what has been omitted\u201d to hold that the statute implicates political speech or speech pertaining to education or advocacy. Section 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\u00b664 \u201cCommercial speech is accorded less constitutional protection than noncommercial speech.\u201d <em>Mont. Media, Inc. v.

To determine the validity of a commercial speech restriction, we apply the factors set forth in <em>Central Hudson, </em>which do not call for strict scrutiny. <em>Mont. Media, Inc., </em>\u00b6 31. The <em>Central Hudson </em>factors are: (1) the speech must concern lawful activity and not be misleading; (2) the asserted government interest must be substantial; (3) the regulation must directly advance the governmental interest asserted; and (4) the regulation must not be more excessive than necessary to achieve its purpose. <em>Cent. Hudson, </em>447 U.S. at 566, 100 S. Ct. at 2351.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u00b665 Considering the first factor, it bears repeating that marijuana use or possession unequivocally is an unlawful activity under federal law. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812, 841, 845; <em>MCIA I, </em>\u00b6 32. Federal law controls our First Amendment commercial speech analysis, U.S. Const, amend. I; <em>Mont. Media, </em>\u00b6 31, and Plaintiffs rely exclusively on federal law in their argument on this issue. Congress has acted upon the subject of marijuana and made it illegal. That a person possesses or uses medical marijuana in compliance with the laws of his or her state of residence provides no defense under the federal law. <em>Gonzales v. Raich, </em>545 U.S. 1, 29, 125 S. Ct. 2195, 2212-13 (2005). \u201c[A]ny legislation of a State, although in pursuance of an acknowledged power reserved to it, which conflicts with the actual exercise of the power of Congress over the subject of commerce, must give way before the supremacy of the national authority.\u201d <em>Smith v. Ala., </em>124 U.S. 465, 437, 8 S. Ct. 564, 566 (1888); U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3. While the states retain police power to establish and enforce laws protecting the welfare, safety, and health of the public, U.S. Const. amend. X, if Congress acts upon the same subject, \u201cthe laws of the States, in so far as they cover the same field, are superseded, for necessarily that which is not supreme must yield to that which is.\u201d <em>Second Emp\u2019rs Liab. Cases, </em>223 U.S. 1, 55, 32 S. Ct. 169, 177 (1912) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">\u00b666 Because federal law governs the analysis of this issue, we conclude that an activity that is not permitted by federal law \u2014 even if permitted by state law \u2014 is not a \u201clawful activity\u201d within the meaning of <em>Central Hudson\u2019s </em>first factor. As such, the advertisement of marijuana is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>speech that concerns lawful activity. There is no First Amendment violation and our analysis under <em>Central Hudson </em>therefore ends here.</p>\n<p id=\"Afq\">\u00b667  Section 50-46-341, MCA, limits only commercial speech. The District Court accordingly erred in applying strict scrutiny instead of the <em>Central Hudson </em>test. Section 50-46-341, MCA, does not satisfy the first factor under <em>Central Hudson, </em>and thus does not unconstitutionally infringe on First Amendment free speech rights.

Plaintiffs point out that under <em>State v. Ashby, </em>2008 MT 83, 342 Mont. 187, 179 P.3d 1164, a sentencing court may, on a case-by-case basis, impose reasonable conditions on sentences so long as the conditions have \u201ca nexus\u201d either to the offense or to the offender. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6 15. This case-by-case analysis, Plaintiffs suggest, is impossible under the current statute because the ban prohibits medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>marijuana in all cases for probationers. Plaintiffs argue that the \u201ccomplete ban on probationers\u2019 use\u201d should be declared unconstitutional, and that a sentencing court should consider on a case-by-case basis whether to allow marijuana use by an offender serving a suspended or deferred sentence, just as sentencing courts consider other appropriate conditions based on the characteristics of the offender and of the offense committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u00b673  We agree with the District Court. As noted above, a facial challenge may succeed only if the challenger can establish that \u201cno set of circumstances exists under which the [challenged legislation] would be valid.\u201d <em>Salerno, </em>481 U.S. at 745, 107 S. Ct. at 2100. That the challenged provision \u201cmight operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid ....\u201d <em>Salerno, </em>481 U.S. at 745, 107 S. Ct. at 2100. Although Plaintiffs mount a facial challenge to the ban on probationer use, they recognize that a sentencing court is authorized by law to impose reasonable conditions on a sentence that the sentencing judge \u201cconsiders necessary to obtain the objectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society.\u201d Section 46-18-202(1), MCA. Whether a condition or restriction of a sentence bears the requisite \u201cnexus\u201d to the offender or to the underlying offense is a question of compliance with sentencing statutes. <em>Ashby, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-15. If, in a particular case, a district court imposes a sentence prohibiting medical marijuana use but the required nexus is not satisfied, an offender may be able to bring a claim that, as applied to that offender and to his or her sentence, \u00a7 50-46-307(4), MCA, is unconstitutional. Plaintiffs acknowledge that a sentencing court would have discretion, in particular cases, to prohibit an offender from using or possessing medical marijuana. In light of this concession, Plaintiffs cannot argue that the ban on probationer use is invalid under any conceivable set of circumstances. As such, \u00a7 50-46-307(4), MCA, is not facially invalid. We affirm the District Court\u2019s ruling upholding the provision prohibiting probationers from becoming registered cardholders for medical marijuana use.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\u00b674 <em>5.

Burger, </em>482 U.S. 691, 107 S. Ct. 2636 (1987). In <em>Burger, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court established a rule that administrative or regulatory inspections of \u201cclosely regulated\u201d industries can constitute an exception to the warrant requirement even if the inspections are conducted by law enforcement officials to uncover and use evidence of criminal behavior. <em>Burger, </em>482 U.S. at 703-11, 107 S. Ct. at 2646-48. The District Court concluded that the marijuana industry is a closely regulated industry. The court emphasized that \u201cpossession and use of marijuana remains a crime under federal law,\u201d and that the \u201centire issue of marijuana use and possession generally has significant criminal overtones.\u201d Moreover, the court concluded that \u00a7 50-46-329, MCA, \u201ccarefully defin[ed]\u201d the premises subject to inspection, thereby avoiding concerns that inspections might be too broad or intrusive.</p>\n<p id=\"A-p\">\u00b677 Plaintiffs contend that the court\u2019s \u201clock-step adherence\u201d to <em>Burger </em>is incorrect because 1) the search provisions relate to law enforcement functions rather than to administrative searches, and 2) Montana\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>privacy rights are much stronger than those implicitly found under the United States Constitution. Relying on federal law, Plaintiffs argue that the authorization for warrantless inspections is unconstitutional because there are \u201cno administrative regulations concerning specific neutral criteria governing warrantless searches under the Act.\u201d According to Plaintiffs, the lack of a regulatory scheme makes it \u201cabundantly clear that the so-called \u2018inspection\u2019 procedures of the Act are for the sole purpose of allowing law enforcement officers to develop evidence for enforcement of criminal laws.\u201d Additionally, given Montana\u2019s explicit privacy expectation, Plaintiffs argue that the State must have a compelling reason to invade someone\u2019s privacy and that it has demonstrated none. Plaintiffs assert that the State \u201cfailed to provide a meaningful answer and refused to produce a [M. R. Civ. P.] 30(b)(6) witness\u201d when Plaintiffs questioned the inspections\u2019 purposes in pre-trial discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u00b678 Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that marijuana is not a heavily regulated industry in Montana because there are \u201cno regulations ... applying to growing operations or establishing inspection procedures for medical marijuana dispensaries\u201d overlooks that the provision has been the subject of this litigation since its enactment. Thus, there has been no opportunity for its full implementation. Further, Plaintiffs acknowledge that marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug \u2014 the most strictly regulated classification under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). \u201cSchedule I drugs are categorized as such because of their high potential for abuse, lack of any accepted medical use, and absence of any accepted safety for use in medically supervised treatment.\u201d <em>Gonzales, </em>545 U.S. at 14, 125 S. Ct. at 2204.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u00b679 Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the production of medical marijuana is not a closely regulated industry is in disaccord with their argument that many provisions of the Act are overly restrictive. By design, the Act distinguishes medical marijuana from other substances for which a prescription may be obtained and filled under an existing set of laws and regulations comprehensively controlling the sale and dispensing of lawful medications. Because marijuana cannot be prescribed within that regulatory framework, the Legislature imposed instead a series of restrictions to curb widespread distribution and to limit possession of the substance to individuals with debilitating medical conditions for whom there is little or no other effective treatment. Marijuana\u2019s status as a strictly prohibited drug under federal law required the Legislature to devise a substitute method of regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\u00b680 Although Plaintiffs eschew \u201clock-step adherence\u201d to federal law, they do not develop their argument that the result would be different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>under a Montana constitutional privacy analysis, except to fault the State for failing \u201cto produce a 30(b)(6) witness\u201d to establish a compelling state interest as required by Montana Constitution Article II, Section 10. Plaintiffs cite no authority that this determination requires an evidentiary foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\u00b681 Rather, to determine what constitutes an unlawful intrusion by the government into one\u2019s privacy, the Court considers the following factors: (1) whether the person has an actual expectation of privacy; (2) whether society is willing to recognize that expectation as objectively reasonable; and (3) the nature of the state\u2019s intrusion. <em>State v. Therriault, </em>2000 MT 286, \u00b6 33, 302 Mont. 189, 14 P.3d 444. While individuals may have an actual expectation of privacy from warrantless searches, an expectation that a provider\u2019s marijuana production and distribution facilities are entitled to the same privacy protections is not one that society is willing to recognize as objectively reasonable. Indeed, it is reasonable for owners of registered premises where marijuana \u2014 a uniquely regulated substance \u2014 is cultivated, manufactured, or stored to expect those premises to be subject to inspection during normal business hours to satisfy the State\u2019s legitimate regulatory interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u00b682  Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the primary reason for the procedures under \u00a7 50-46-329, MCA, \u201cis to allow for evidentiary searches for criminal enforcement purposes\u201d is not only unsubstantiated, but also inappropriate for a facial challenge. Without any supporting evidence, Plaintiffs conclude that because Montana has no regulatory scheme regarding grow operations, \u201cit is abundantly clear that the so-called \u2018inspection\u2019 procedures of the Act are for the sole purpose of allowing law enforcement officers to develop evidence for enforcement of criminal laws.\u201d This conclusory assertion does not support a holding that the inspection procedures are facially invalid.

As previously explained by this Court, \u201cthe legislature, in its exercise of the State\u2019s police powers, decided that it would legalize the limited use of medicinal marijuana while maintaining a prohibition on the sale of medical marijuana.\u201d <em>MCIA I, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\u00b688 States use their inherent police powers to create crimes and also defenses, exceptions, or immunities to those crimes. The \u201cState of Montana has a police power by which it can regulate for the health and safety of its citizens.\u201d <em>Wiser v.

Certain statutory provisions create affirmative defenses, exceptions, or immunities to crimes which grant defendants a limited immunity from prosecution. <em>See generally State v.

For instance, justifiable use of force provisions, \u00a7\u00a7 45-3-101 through -115, MCA, create an affirmative defense to actions that would otherwise constitute crimes. Human trafficking statutes provide another example of immunity and an affirmative defense provided to a child who is a victim. Sections 45-5-709, -710, MCA. Further, by its terms, \u00a7 45-8-109(3), MCA, provides a variety of exceptions to a charge of civil disorder, including actions of a peace officer committed during performance of their duties; training in nonviolent civil disobedience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>techniques; lawful self-defense or defense of others or an activity intended to teach or practice self-defense or self-defense techniques; or training in safe firearm handling and use.

Finally, under \u00a7 45-8-206(2)(a), MCA, it is a defense to the crime of public display or dissemination of obscene material to minors to have had reasonable cause to believe the minor was 18 years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u00b689 Given that marijuana is illegal and the State, in the exercise of its police powers, has carved out a \u201clegal protection\u201d to a state prosecution for violation of Montana\u2019s controlled dangerous substance laws, I cannot agree that the statute creates any sort of classification of persons necessary for an equal protection challenge or any substantive right necessary for a substantive due process challenge. The Court states that the Act concerns \u201ca group of persons who all suffer from a debilitating medical condition but are distinguished by the manner in which they may obtain relief. Some may be treated effectively with pharmaceutical drugs\u201d and for others, \u201cmarijuana is the sole or most effective treatment.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 17. However, the Act simply fails to make any of the distinctions between \u201cgroups\u201d which the Court implicitly considers. The Act does not provide marijuana for one group of persons and withhold it from another group; it does not distinguish based upon type of prescription medication; and it does not distinguish based upon who is able to grow marijuana. The Act does, however, provide a benefit or privilege \u2014 not a right \u2014 to those using marijuana for medical purposes and correspondingly defines, as the State may do, the parameters of a defense for violation of Montana\u2019s controlled dangerous substance laws.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u00b690 To prevail on an equal protection challenge, the plaintiff \u201cmust demonstrate that the law at issue discriminates by impermissibly classifying individuals and treating them differently on the basis of that classification.\u201d <em>Egdorf, </em>\u00b6 15 (citation omitted). A plaintiff must first show that <em>the challenged law creates a classification </em>between two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>classes which are otherwise similarly situated. <em>Farrier, </em>\u00b6 15. If a plaintiff is unable to show that the challenged law creates such a classification among similarly situated individuals, the inquiry ends and the court need not apply rational basis review. <em>See Powell, </em>\u00b6 22 (\u201cIf the classes at issue are not similarly situated, then the first criteria for proving an equal protection violation is not met and we need look no further.\u201d). To the extent the Court finds that the Act creates two groups of persons who are \u201cdistinguished by the manner in which they may obtain relief,\u201d I disagree. The Act provides limited \u201clegal protections\u201d to those who use marijuana for medical purposes; all other persons are using marijuana in violation of state law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AIF\">\u00b691 After correctly concluding that the Act \u201cdoes not create two legitimate classes for an equal protection challenge,\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 18, the Court is led afield when it conducts an exhaustive substantive due process analysis. I disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that Plaintiffs challenges are appropriately analyzed under Montana\u2019s due process clause. Opinion, \u00b6 19. The Court separates the various provisions of the Act and asks itself whether a legal protection which <em>benefits </em>medical marijuana users, is either \u201carbitrary or unreasonable\u201d or is \u201crationally related to the recognized legitimate government objectives of the Act.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u00b692 Both the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 17 of the Montana Constitution provide that no person shall be <em>deprived </em>of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. \u201cSubstantive due process primarily examines the underlying substantive rights and remedies to determine whether restrictions ... are unreasonable or arbitrary when balanced against the purpose of the legislature in enacting the statute.\u201d <em>Newville, </em>267 Mont. at 249, 883 P.2d at 800 (citation omitted); <em>see also Egdorf, </em>\u00b6 19. The concept of substantive due process refers to \u201cthe ability of government to <em>restrict </em>the freedom of action (regarding life, liberty, or property) of all persons.\u201d Rotunda &amp; Nowak, supra \u00a7 15.4(a) at 823-24 (emphasis added). A substantive due process analysis must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>begin with a careful description of the asserted right, for the \u201cdoctrine of judicial self-restraint requires that we exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field.\u201d <em>Collins v. City of Harker Heights, 503 </em>U.S. <em>115, 125, 112 </em>S. Ct. <em>1061, 1068 </em>(1992). The United States Supreme Court has held that due process specially protects the right to marry, to have children, to direct the education and upbringing of one\u2019s children, to marital privacy, to use contraception, to bodily integrity, to abortion, and to refuse unwanted lifesaving medical treatment. <em>Wash. v. Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. 702, 720, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 2267 (1997) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b693 In explaining the nature of a substantive due process claim, the Supreme Court has:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">[AJlways been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive due process because guideposts for responsible decision making in this unchartered area are scarce and open-ended. By extending constitutional protection to an asserted right or liberty interest, we, to a great extent, place the matter outside the arena of public debate and legislative action. We must therefore exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field, lest the liberty protected by the <em>Due Process Clause </em>be subtly transformed into the policy preferences of the Members of this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-7\"><em>Glucksberg, 521 U.S. </em>at 720, 117 S. Ct. at 2267-68 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). A \u201ccareful description of the asserted fundamental liberty interest\u201d is required and a court must decide whether the asserted liberty interest, as described, is \u201cobjectively, deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition\u201d and \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty, such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed.\u201d <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. at 720-21, 117 S. Ct. at 2268 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In <em>Glucksberg, </em>four physicians representing three anonymous, terminally-ill patients challenged a state law prohibiting assisted suicide. They argued that the patients had a fundamental right to choose medical treatment that included assistance in committing suicide. The Court rejected this argument, stating that, in previously holding that individuals have a fundamental \u201cright to refuse unwanted medical treatment,\u201d that holding could not \u201cbe somehow transmuted into a right to assistance in committing suicide.\u201d <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. at 725-26, 117 S. Ct. at 2270 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">\u00b694 Applying this analysis, many other courts have held that smoking, using, possessing, or manufacturing marijuana is not a substantive due process right. <em>See Raich v. Gonzales, 500 </em>F.3d 850, 864-66 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>2007) (holding that, where the plaintiffs asserted fundamental right was \u201cthe right to use <em>marijuana </em>to preserve bodily integrity, avoid pain, and preserve her life,\u201d that \u201cfederal law does not recognize a fundamental right to use medical marijuana prescribed by a licensed physician to alleviate excruciating pain and human suffering\u201d because the alleged right was neither \u201cfundamental\u201d nor \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <em>U.S. v. White Plume, </em>447 F.3d 1067, 1074-76 (8th Cir. 2006) (holding that there is no substantive due process right to farm hemp, which, like marijuana, contains tetrahydrocannabinol or THC); <em>U.S. v. Maas, </em>551 F. Supp. 645, 647-48 (D.N.J. 1982) (\u201cSmoking marijuana receives no explicit or implicit constitutional protection. The act of smoking does not involve the important values inherent in questions concerning marriage, procreation, or child rearing. Moreover, its use predominantly as a \u2018recreational drug\u2019 undercuts any argument that its use is as important as, e.g., use of contraceptives\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>U S. v. Wash., </em>887 F. Supp. 2d 1077, 1102 (D. Mont. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"A_1\">\u00b695 We clearly stated in <em>MCIA I, </em>that Plaintiffs \u201ccannot seriously contend that they have a fundamental right to medical marijuana when it is still unequivocally illegal under the [federal] Controlled Dangerous Substances Act.\u201d <em>MCIA I, </em>\u00b6 32 (citations omitted). Plaintiffs have no right or claim to \u201caccess\u201d marijuana; rather the State has chosen to provide a benefit to those medical marijuana users who comply with the terms of the Act. It cannot reasonably be argued that there is a \u201csubstantive right\u201d to possess a substance illegal under both federal and state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">\u00b696 I thus disagree with the premise implicit in the Court\u2019s approach \u2014 namely, that it is appropriate to conduct a substantive due process analysis of a \u201clegal protection\u201d allowed in a state criminal prosecution which has the purpose of providing a benefit or privilege \u2014 as compared to a deprivation \u2014 to medical marijuana users. These proceedings are not proceedings in which a defendant has attempted to mount a defense to a criminal prosecution by invoking the Act\u2019s limited protections. Plaintiffs have alleged constitutional challenges premised on a right of <em>access </em>to marijuana. To the extent we have addressed these challenges with a far-reaching constitutional analysis \u2014 inappropriate outside the context of a criminal proceeding invoking the protections of the Act \u2014 I am concerned that we have distorted our constitutional jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u00b697 In particular, we find that the remuneration restriction violates the equal protection clause, after earlier concluding that an equal protection analysis is undeserved, without even identifying the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>classes of persons we considered. We find that a patient who is unable to grow marijuana on her own is set apart. Opinion, \u00b6 55. We conclude, without any analysis, that such a prohibition is not encompassed within the Act\u2019s legitimate objectives. Opinion, \u00b6 55. We cherry pick a provision from the Act that we find offensive and, not surprisingly, are completely unable to support it with an appropriate constitutional analysis. Such a policy preference for members of this Court is precisely the danger inherent in expanding substantive due process to an interest that is neither a substantive nor a fundamental right.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b698 Marijuana is a controlled dangerous substance under federal and Montana law. The State, pursuant to its police powers, may define what is and is not a criminal offense under state law, including defining what constitutes a defense or immunity to a state prosecution. The Legislature, through the provisions of the 2011 Montana Marijuana Act, chose to carve out and define a defense to a state prosecution for marijuana possession. I would uphold all provisions of the Act as related to this exercise of police power.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-7\"> Physicians do not \u201cprescribe\u201d marijuana under the Act, but instead provide a \u201cwritten certification.\u201d Section 50-46-310, MCA. Thus, medical marijuana is not a prescribed drug which, if the State prohibited all persons from using, might serve as a basis for a substantive due process challenge. The Court appears to imply medical marijuana is a prescribed drug, the prohibition of which implicates due process concerns. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b311-6\"> The potential that some individuals who are eligible to use marijuana under the Act may not be able to grow marijuana themselves or locate a provider does not establish a class, as Plaintiffs argue, and is insufficient to prove an equal protection violation. Again, the purpose of the Act is to provide legal protections. The idea that some medical marijuana users who are unable to grow their own marijuana creates a class for purposes of an equal protection violation is akin to an argument that homeless people create a class because they sire unable to raise a defense pursuant to Montana\u2019s \u201ccastle doctrine,\u201d \u00a7 45-3-103, MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b314-6\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"APB\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u00b699 I concur with the Court\u2019s Opinion on all issues except for the remuneration provision, from which I dissent. In striking down the provision, the Court fails to properly implement the standards our precedent has imposed for due process review.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\u00b6100 The sheer deference we pay to the legislature under reasonableness review could not be clearer under our precedent: \u201cthe purpose of the legislation does not have to appear on the face of the legislation or in the legislative history, but may be <em>any possible purpose </em>of which the court can conceive.\u201d <em>Satterlee v. Lumberman\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co., </em>2009 MT 368, \u00b6 34, 353 Mont. 265, 222 P.3d 566 (citing <em>Stratemeyer v. Lincoln County, </em>259 Mont. 147, 152, 855 P.2d 506, 509-10 (1993)) (emphasis added). Despite this standard, the Court proceeds to test each provision of the Act not against <em>any possible purpose, </em>but against a single purpose to which it latches on and won\u2019t let go. We have previously expressly rejected such an approach in the context of rational basis review, which the Court also employs to strike down the remuneration provision. Opinion, \u00b6 55. <em>See Stratemeyer, </em>259 Mont. at 151-52, 855 P.2d at 509-10 (holding lower court erred by reasoning \u201cthe legislature must provide\u201d a rational basis and that a court \u201cmay not speculate\u201d about the legislature\u2019s purpose). We should reject this approach once again. When we have determined, as the Court here concedes, that \u201cthe legislation in question is related to a legitimate government concern,\u201d then the inquiry is simply whether the means chosen by the Legislature to accomplish its objective \u201care reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>related to the result sought to be obtained.\u201d <em>Walters v. Flathead Concrete Products, </em>2011 MT 45, \u00b6 18, 359 Mont. 346, 249 P.3d 913 (citing <em>Plumb v. Fourth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>279 Mont. 363, 372, 927 P.2d 1011, 1016 (1996)). This inquiry is the embodiment of judicial restraint and deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\u00b6101 Given that marijuana is illegal under federal law, and that the State\u2019s interest may be \u201cany possible purpose of which the court can conceive,\u201d <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 34, it requires a particularly uncreative judge indeed to be unable to articulate a legitimate state interest that justifies the remuneration provision. Further, against this first backdrop of federal illegality, there is a second backdrop: the abuses of the drug and of the access provided to it under the 1-148 initiative. In response to this chaos, which Plaintiffs acknowledge, the Legislature chose to decisively restrict, limit and constrain all aspects of marijuana availability, and to impose heavy regulation by passing the Act. While the Court ties itself to the generally stated purpose clauses of \u00a7 50-46-301, MCA \u2014 to which, as stated above, we are not bound \u2014 such as providing protections to those with debilitating medical conditions, it fails to acknowledge that the Act provided not one provision that expanded upon or liberalized access to the drug for anyone, as compared to the 1-148 initiative. The Act, in its entirety, is a clear constriction of access in response to the abuses under prior law. The Legislature specifically sought to impose new, heavy regulations upon the illegal drug, particularly by \u201celiminating commercial access,\u201d as the State\u2019s brief states. This is a legitimate purpose, given the concerns created by commercial access to medical marijuana, such as the need to police, license, and tax commercial goods. The Legislature may well have believed that eliminating commercial access alleviated these concerns, as it has with other home products. <em>See </em>\u00a7 16-3-201(2), MCA (exempting from regulation the manufacture of beer not intended for sale).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u00b6 102 The Court counters that the remuneration provision will likely drive the business of medical marijuana back to the black market. Opinion, \u00b6 54. Perhaps so, but the proper inquiry does not permit the Court to entertain such policy speculations, and, in fact, as properly applied, mandates the Court do just the opposite: speculation and presumption is required in favor of <em>upholding </em>the provision. <em>See Davis v. Union Pacific R.R., </em>282 Mont. 233, 240, 937 P.2d 27, 31 (1997) (\u201c[E]very possible presumption must be indulged in favor of the constitutionality of the legislative act.\u201d). Employing such a presumption here, the remuneration provision certainly seems likely to eliminate commercial access and alleviate the State\u2019s concerns for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>purposes of due process analysis, as well as justifying its enactment and differential treatment of the purported similarly situated classes under equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">\u00b6103 I would uphold all of the provisions of the Act.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b316-5\">JUSTICE WHEAT,</author>\n<p id=\"A1Q\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\u00b6104 Except as to the Majority\u2019s conclusion regarding the remuneration provisions, I respectfully dissent from the Majority\u2019s decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\u00b6105 At the outset, I note that 1-148 was passed by a majority of Montana voters who clearly wanted medical marijuana to be made available for those who need it to treat medical conditions. This was and is the underlying purpose of the law. Shortcomings in the original law subsequently lead to abuses that required the Legislature to step in and impose restrictions to control the abuses. The real question in this case is whether the statutory restrictions went too far and impaired the rights of those who need medical marijuana by severely limiting or eliminating their access to a drug made medicinally legal under the Act. The answer is determined by how one views the underlying purpose of the Act: whether it is to provide \u201caccess\u201d to a medicinal drug, or to provide \u201cprotection\u201d to those engaged in the business (producers, distributors, and consumers), because marijuana remains federally illegal. So, which analytical lens one uses will determine the outcome. While I recognize a need for regulatory framework, I believe the State has gone too far in this case by creating a law that focuses so heavily on curbing the abuses of medicinal marijuana that it violates the rights of patients by so severely limiting or eliminating access to it, which ultimately destroys the law\u2019s purpose. I disagree with the Majority on nearly every issue brought before this Court. I would affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to enjoin certain provisions of the Act, but I would go further and also enjoin the prohibition of medical marijuana use by probationers and the warrantless search provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">\u00b6106 It is noteworthy that the landscape of the law regarding medical and recreational use of marijuana has changed significantly since this case began. Currently, twenty-three states and the District of Columbia have statutes that allow for the legal use of marijuana for medicinal purposes, and four western states have passed laws that allow for legal recreational use of the drug. Opinion, \u00b6 13, n.2.1 believe that many more changes are coming in this area of law based on society\u2019s evolving understanding of marijuana, including its medical benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">The 25-Patient Certification Limit on Physicians</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>\u00b6107 The District Court found that the Board of Medical Examiners reported no problems with medical marijuana certifications throughout the pendency of this action, even though the certification-limit provision was never in effect. The court heard testimony from State officials who testified that no problems exist, and further the State lacked any rationale to justify the limit. Opinion, \u00b6 36. The court also determined that the Board possesses the authority to discipline doctors who violate the standard of care, that the Board had already made changes to completely disallow certification \u201cexclusively by telemedicine,\u201d and thus the Board is fully capable of regulating physicians in the State. Opinion, \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">\u00b6108 I agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the evidence regarding the ability of the Board to self-regulate and the lack of the State\u2019s rationale to justify a 25-patient limit demonstrates that the provision is unnecessary, and further it is arbitrary. Under rational basis review this provision must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and bear a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation. <em>Powder River </em>Cnty., \u00b6 79. It is my belief that the object of medical marijuana legislation is to provide legal medicinal access to marijuana. This government regulation reaches beyond a substantial relation to the object of the legislation and instead sets a number so arbitrarily low that the object is stymied. By definition, an arbitrary act is one that is made without consideration or regard for facts, circumstances, fixed rules, or procedures. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, supra, </em>at 125. This limit fails to consider the fact that the Board already eliminated the telemedicine certification process, which essentially resolved the prior certification problems. This limit fails to consider the circumstance of the Board\u2019s continued authority and ability to properly regulate and discipline doctors for violations of the standard of care in all avenues of medicine. Finally, there is no indication that the Legislature followed any procedure to determine a patient-certification number that would substantially relate to providing regulated access to medicinal marijuana. Instead, the Legislature chose an arbitrary number of 25 that is not reasonable when balanced against the purpose of the legislation. <em>Egdorf, </em>\u00b6 19.1 therefore conclude that this provision of the law fails rational basis review and I would affirm the District Court\u2019s injunction of the 25-patient limit on physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Commercial Provisions</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u00b6109 At the outset, I would decline to split the provisions as the Majority did because both types of commercial provisions, not just the remuneration provisions, serve to limit the access of medical marijuana to a distinct class of persons. Opinion, \u00b6 47. The remuneration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>restrictions and the three-patient commercial limit both impose \u201c \u2018peculiar disabilities upon [a] class of persons arbitrarily selected from a larger number of persons, all of whom stand in the same relation to privileges conferred or disabilities imposed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kottel, </em>\u00b6 55 (quoting <em>Leuthold, </em>100 Mont. at 105, 47 P.2d at 45). The District Court determined that the effect of these provisions renders access to medical marijuana nearly impossible for people with the most debilitating conditions. I agree with the District Court that the commercial provisions create different classes of persons by imposing different burdens on those who can provide medical marijuana for themselves and those who must purchase it in the marketplace, which then fail rational basis review. I agree with the conclusion the Majority reaches in respect to the remuneration decision. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 53-56. However, as stated, I would choose to analyze both commercial provisions as one because I believe both restrictions implicate equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\u00b6110 As written, the statutes create an absurd result where those with the most debilitating medical conditions will have no access to medical marijuana because they will not be able to grow it due to inability, cannot pay someone else to grow it, and will not likely be able to find someone else to do so under the advertising prohibitions. As the Majority notes, this class of persons will likely be forced into the black market to acquire marijuana, creating business for the criminal enterprise the State seeks to avoid under the Act. Opinion, \u00b6 54. Here, I agree with the District Court that the statutes fail because as written \u201c[a] statute which is directly contrary to its justification cannot be rationally related to that justification.\u201d Because the commercial provisions fail to protect those persons with the most debilitating conditions, I would likewise enjoin these commercial provisions as they violate equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Advertising Ban</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">\u00b6111 I disagree with the Majority\u2019s application of the <em>Central Hudson </em>test. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 64-67.1 would apply strict scrutiny because I agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 341 of the Act \u201crenders the \u2018playing field\u2019 for discussion of the pros and cons of medical marijuana completely uneven.\u201d I am not convinced by the Majority\u2019s attempt to limit the language of the Act to a plain-language analysis to establish a commercial-speech basis for allowing the provision. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 62-63. Instead, I find the language of the statute overbroad and vague. While the Majority reaches a narrow interpretation of the language, I believe it is just as straightforward to come to the opposite conclusion that broad restrictions on political and educational speech have occurred under this law. Article II, section 7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>of the Montana Constitution states: \u201cNo law shall be passed impairing the freedom of speech or expression. Every person shall be free to speak or publish whatever he will on any subject, being responsible for all abuse of that liberty.\u201d Because the language of \u00a7 341 creates content-based restrictions as written, it fails an examination under strict scrutiny, which is the standard that should be applied. I would affirm the District Court and enjoin \u00a7 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Prohibition on Probationer Use</p>\n<p id=\"AAb\">\u00b6112 I would reverse the District Court\u2019s determination that the prohibition on probationer use under \u00a7 50-46-307(4), MCA, is constitutional because the State has shown a rational basis for the provision. In my view, the law undermines the purpose of the Act because it clearly bars a class of persons from access to a legally-recognized medicine: medical marijuana. Under the law, all sentences imposed by the district courts include a prohibition on medical marijuana use, which precludes the district court\u2019s ability to apply a case-by-case \u201cnexus\u201d analysis under <em>Ashby. </em>As written, the effect of the prohibition is unconstitutional because the blanket ban violates equal protection of the laws, by classifying persons for different treatment, and it should be analyzed as such. I would enjoin this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Warrantless Searches</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\u00b6113 I would reverse the District Court and enjoin the provisions allowing warrantless searches under \u00a7 50-46-329, MCA, because these provisions provide carte blanche to State and local law enforcement. I would uphold Montana privacy rights and use this opportunity to strengthen our State\u2019s privacy rights. The inspection procedures under the Act result in a constant threat to potential business owners that law enforcement can enter their premises and gather and develop evidence. I believe this provision will only create hostility and enhance the State\u2019s view of medical marijuana as a criminal endeavor rather than a medicine available to those in need. Ultimately, the search provisions would be better served by providing for warrantless administrative inspections to be carried out only by a State agency with no direct involvement by local or State law enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">\u00b6 114 I agree with the Majority that the remuneration restrictions do not bear a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, and furthermore the provisions violate the equal protection clause of the Montana Constitution. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 53-56. I disagree with the Majority on all of the remaining issues in this case and believe the Majority has erred in its interpretation of the statutes. For the reasons stated above, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
