We reverse the convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u00b63 Issue 1: Whether the District Court erred when it disqualified Colburn\u2019s expert witness from testifying at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u00b64 Issue 2: Whether the District Court erred in its application of the Rape Shield Law to exclude evidence that Colburn offered at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">\u00b65 In 2013 the State charged Colburn with two counts of incest, \u00a7 45-5-507, MCA; one count of sexual intercourse without consent, \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA; and two counts of sexual assault, \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA, all felonies. In October 2013 the jury convicted Colburn of all of the charged offenses. In February 2014 the District Court entered judgment sentencing Colburn to terms of imprisonment on each of the convictions. Colburn appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s rulings on the admission of evidence, including the admission of expert testimony, for abuse of discretion. <em>Beehler v. Eastern Radiological Assoc., </em>2012 MT 260, \u00b6 17, 367 Mont. 21, 289 P.3d 131. We review a district court\u2019s application of a statute to determine whether the application was correct. <em>Beehler, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">\u00b67 <em>Issue 1: Whether the District court erred when it disqualified Colburn\u2019s expert witness from testifying at trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">\u00b68 Rule 702 of the Montana Rules of Evidence allows a person qualified by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education to testify \u201cin the form of an opinion or otherwise\u201d if \u201cscientific, technical or other specialized knowledge\u201d will assist the jury to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue. We have encouraged district courts to \u201cconstrue liberally the rules of evidence so as to admit all relevant expert testimony,\u201d subject to \u201cstringent cross-examination.\u201d <em>State v. Damon, </em>2005 MT 218, \u00b6 19, 328 Mont. 276, 119 P.3d 1194; <em>Beehler, </em>\u00b6 23. The District Court determined in this case that expert testimony would be appropriate in assisting the jury to understand issues concerning forensic interview techniques.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-14\">\u00b69 The sexual intercourse without consent and sexual assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>charges against Colburn related to incidents between Colburn and a neighbor girl referred to as R.W. Those incidents occurred when she was age eleven. The State called R.W. as a witness at trial. She testified to encounters with Colburn in which he touched her private parts manually and with his penis. The two incest charges related to incidents between Colburn and his own daughter, referred to as C.C., also age eleven. The State called C.C. as a witness at trial. She denied generally that Colburn had done anything wrong to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\u00b610 The State also presented the testimony of Nurse Practitioner Mary Hansen, a clinical supervisor with a children\u2019s advocacy and adult sexual assault program at St. Patrick Hospital in Missoula. She has an undergraduate degree in sociology and a master\u2019s degree in nursing. She is licensed and certified as a pediatric nurse practitioner. She has attended several courses in sexual assault examiner training for nurses, a course in medical assessments of children, as well as attending several conferences in San Diego on child abuse. She testified that a forensic interview is a \u201cstructured conversation\u201d with a child who may have been a victim of a crime. She testified that she has been trained in several different schools of forensic interview techniques, including those offered by the American Prosecutor\u2019s Research Institute, by First Witness, and by the American Professional Society on Abuse of Children. She testified that she has \u201ca lot of familiarity with many different models\u201d of forensic interviewing, and that there is no certification program or requirement for forensic examiners. Several times in her testimony she characterized forensic interviewing as both a science and an art that requires \u201ca judgment call [to determine] when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u00b6 11 Hansen interviewed both girls and testified that she followed \u201cbest practices\u201d in her interviews. Hansen described disclosures that R.W. made to her about sexual incidents with Colburn. Hansen testified that in her opinion R.W.\u2019s statements to her were consistent with those of a child who had experienced sexual abuse. Hansen opined that R.W. \u201cprovided details that were sexual knowledge that a child may not have <em>unless they\u2019ve had the experience of sexual abuse.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"Agj\">\u00b612 Hansen also testified about her interview with C.C. during which C.C. described inappropriate touching by her father. The prosecution played a video of Hansen\u2019s interview with C.C., which was the major direct evidence to support the incest charges against Colburn.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u00b613 Prior to trial Colburn disclosed that he intended to call Dr. Donna Zook as an expert in child psychology and forensic interview techniques, to critique the techniques used by Hansen in her interview of C.C. The State interviewed Zook prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>\u00b614 At trial, Zook testified that she had a doctorate degree in clinical psychology and that her training included 2000 hours in a pre-doctoral internship dealing with juvenile offenders as well as a 3000-hour postdoctoral experience with the Golden Triangle Community Mental Health Center in Havre, Montana. She is a member of the American College of Forensic Examiners and is included in the National Register of Health Service Providers. She has taught psychology at the University of Great Falls. Zook testified that she has done hundreds of juvenile interviews as part of psychological assessments or evaluations. She has also done over twenty critiques of forensic interviews conducted by others and has testified as an expert forensic psychologist hundreds of times.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u00b615 The defense made an offer of proof that Zook would testify that Hansen used leading or suggestive questions when interviewing C.C., and would describe the result of those questions as reflected in C.C.\u2019s interview. The State objected to Zook\u2019s qualification to criticize Hansen\u2019s interviews with the victims. The District Court became involved in examining Zook as to her qualifications, focusing on her familiarity with an interviewing protocol adopted by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (referred to in the record as the \u201cNICHD\u201d). Zook testified that she was familiar with that forensic interviewing protocol, and that while it was only one of several such protocols, it had been developed by using empirical research. She testified that she had not completed a 40-hour course in the protocol offered by the Institute.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u00b616 The District Court determined that the area of forensic interviewing techniques was an area that would be appropriate for expert testimony to assist the jury. The District Court further determined that the NICHD interviewing technique was the \u201cgold standard\u201d for forensic interviews of children, and apparently that it was the technique employed by Hansen in her interviews with the victims in this case. Based upon Zook\u2019s lack of specific training in the NICHD interviewing protocol, the District Court concluded that she was \u201cnot qualified in this area of NICHD criticism.\u201d The District Court excluded Zook from testifying as an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\u00b617 While the District Court concentrated on whether Zook had been extensively trained in the NICHD interview protocol, Hansen never mentioned that protocol in her testimony. She did not list it as one of the several interview protocols that she had been trained in, and did not testify that she used the protocol in the interview of either victim in this case. Colburn asserts on appeal that the NICHD interview protocol does not appear anywhere in the record except in the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Court\u2019s questioning of Zook\u2019s qualifications. The State does not refute this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">\u00b618  It is clear to this Court that Zook was qualified by both education and experience to provide a critique of Hansen\u2019s interviewing technique as it related to leading or suggestive questions and the effect that such questions could have on the results. Significantly, neither side contends that any properly-administered child forensic interview should rely upon results obtained through leading or suggestive questions. The District Court \u201ctoo narrowly conceived the subject matter\u201d at issue here by constraining it to whether Zook was qualified in the NICHD interview protocols. <em>Beehler, </em>\u00b6 25. Given the importance of the taped interview following CC\u2019s general denial that Colburn had assaulted her, Zook\u2019s expert opinion about the interview technique was a significant exclusion. The District Court abused its discretion in excluding Dr. Zook from testifying at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">\u00b619 <em>Issue 2: Whether the District Court erred in its application of the Rape Shield Law to exclude evidence that Colburn offered at trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u00b620 Colburn asserts that his defense to the charges involving R.W. was that the allegations were fabricated. Both before trial and at trial he sought to introduce evidence that R.W. had a motive to fabricate allegations against him, and that there was an alternative source for her knowledge of the details of sexual behavior other than anything he had done. The defense theory was that R.W. used her allegations against Colburn to determine whether her mother would believe her and, if so, to then disclose that her own father had abused her. Similarly, the defense theory was that the source of R.W.\u2019s detailed knowledge of sexual abuse came not from Colburn but from abuse inflicted by her own father.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\u00b621 The District Court excluded any evidence that R.W. had any sexual encounter with any other person, based upon the Montana Rape Shield Law. That law provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">Evidence concerning the sexual conduct of the victim is inadmissible in prosecutions under this part except evidence of the victim\u2019s past sexual conduct with the offender or evidence of specific instances of the victim\u2019s sexual activity to show the origin of semen, pregnancy or disease that is at issue in the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQn\">Section 45-5-511(2), MCA. The District Court determined that R.W. was absolutely protected by this statute, and that it prohibited introduction of any evidence that she had sexual contact with any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>other person.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b622 In 1975, Montana joined most other states by adopting a rape shield law. <em>See </em>Ch. 129, L. 1975.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under the Rape Shield Law, \u201cevidence concerning the sexual conduct of the victim\u201d is inadmissible in a criminal prosecution, with very limited exceptions not at issue here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 45-5-511(2), MCA. Montana\u2019s Rape Shield Law is designed to prevent the trial of the charge against the defendant from becoming a trial of the victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct. <em>State v. Higley, </em>190 Mont. 412, 422, 621 P.2d 1043, 1050-51 (1980). Rape shield laws generally protect victims from being exposed at trial to harassing or irrelevant questions concerning their past sexual behavior. <em>Michigan v. Lucas, </em>500 U.S. 145, 146, 111 S. Ct. 1743, 1745 (1991); <em>State v. Anderson, </em>211 Mont. 272, 283, 686 P.2d 193, 199 (1984). The statute reflects a compelling state interest in keeping a rape trial from becoming a trial of the victim. <em>Anderson, </em>211 Mont. at 283, 686 P.2d at 199. Rape shield laws evolved from society\u2019s recognition that a rape victim\u2019s prior sexual history is irrelevant to issues of consent or the victim\u2019s propensity for truthfulness. Tanya Bagne Marcketti, <em>Rape Shield Laws: Do They Shield the Children?, </em>78 Iowa L. Rev. 751, 754-55 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b623 Although rape shield legislation originally focused on adult rape victims, most jurisdictions also include child victims of sexual abuse within the protections of their rape shield statutes. The policies underlying the application of rape shield statutes to adult victims apply to child victims, as well: rape shield statutes eliminate the need for victims to defend incidents in their past and minimize the trauma of testifying. Marcketti at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b624 Conflict can arise between rape shield statutes and a defendant\u2019s rights to confront his accuser and to present evidence at trial in defense of the charge against him. A defendant charged with a crime has a right to confront his accusers, arising from the Sixth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. <em>State v. MacKinnon, </em>1998 MT 78, \u00b6 33, 288 Mont. 329, 957 P.2d 23. A defendant has a similarly-based right to present evidence in his defense. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>1998 MT 107, \u00b6 22, 288 Mont. 513, 958 P.2d 1182.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">\u00b625 Neither the Rape Shield Law nor the defendant\u2019s right to confront and present evidence are absolute. <em>MacKinnon, </em>\u00b6 33; <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-23. The Rape Shield Law therefore cannot be applied to exclude evidence arbitrarily or mechanistically, <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 21, and it is the trial court\u2019s responsibility to strike a balance in each case between the defendant\u2019s right to present a defense and a victim\u2019s rights under the st\u00e1tute. <em>State v. Lindberg, </em>2008 MT 389, \u00b6 53, 347 Mont. 76, 196 P.3d 1252. A court balancing the interests of the defendant with those protected by the Rape Shield Law should require that the defendant\u2019s proffered evidence is not merely speculative or unsupported. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 24; <em>Lindberg, </em>\u00b6 56. Here, the proffered evidence that R.W. was abused by her father was neither speculative nor unsupported, given that he was convicted on charges stemming from his sexual assaults against his daughter. The court should consider whether the evidence is relevant and probative (Rules 401 and 402, M. R. Evid.); whether the evidence is merely cumulative of other admissible evidence; and whether the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect (Rule 403, M. R. Evid.). <em>Commonwealth v. Fernsler, </em>715 A.2d 435, 440 (Pa. Sup. Ct. 1998). The purpose of these considerations is to ensure a fair trial for the defendant while upholding the compelling interest of the Rape Shield Law in preserving the integrity of the trial and keeping it from becoming a trial of the victim. <em>Anderson, </em>211 Mont. at 283, 686 P.2d at 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\u00b626 Colburn contends that the District Court\u2019s application of the Rape Shield Law in this case frustrated his ability to respond to two crucial pieces of evidence against him: R.W.\u2019s statement that Colburn sexually abused her, and Hansen\u2019s testimony that R.W.\u2019s knowledge of sexual activity likely came from her having experienced sexual abuse. Colburn proposed to introduce evidence that R.W., following the allegation that he had abused her, alleged that she had been abused by her own father. He also proposed to introduce evidence that R.W. said that she determined that she could make the allegations about her father because her allegations about Colburn had been taken seriously, thus tying her disclosure in the two cases together. In addition, Colburn contended that evidence that R.W. had been abused by her own father was crucial to counter or at least contextualize the testimony of Hansen that R.W.\u2019s detailed knowledge of sexual activities must have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>arisen from her being sexually abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\u00b627 Colburn\u2019s defense to the charges involving R.W. depended upon undermining the credibility of her account that he abused her. It substantially depended upon undermining Hansen\u2019s endorsement of the credibility of R.W.\u2019s account of Colburn\u2019s acts of abuse.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, from Colburn\u2019s point of view, the proposed evidence was an essential part of his important right to confront the witnesses against him and to mount a meaningful defense to the charges.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u00b628 At the same time, the Montana Rape Shield Law has long been construed to not automatically exclude evidence that \u201ccan be narrowed to the issue of the complaining witness\u2019 veracity <em>.\u2019\u2019 Anderson, </em>211 Mont. at 284, 686 P.2d at 200.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court has the power and responsibility to manage the defense evidence to prevent \u201csordid probes into a victim\u2019s past sexual conduct.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>211 Mont. at 284, 686 P.2d at 200. In <em>Lindberg, </em>for example, the district court allowed the defendant in a sexual abuse case to present evidence that his objection to the victim\u2019s relationship with another person provided motivation to fabricate charges of abuse to remove the defendant from the household. However, the defendant was not allowed to present evidence concerning the sexual nature of that relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\u00b629  Such restrictions represent the balancing of the interests involved without wholly sacrificing the interests of the defense or the victim. In the present case the District Court\u2019s statements excluding Colburn\u2019s proffered evidence show no weighing of his rights to present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>a defense with the interests represented by the Rape Shield Law. The District Court abused its discretion by mechanistically applying the Rape Shield Law to exclude Colburn\u2019s proffered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u00b630 After careful consideration of the record and the parties\u2019 arguments and authorities, we reverse the convictions and remand to the District Court for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b253-6\">JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, BAKER, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b250-7\"> Although this evidence did not go before the jury, the record reflects that R.W.\u2019s father was charged with five counts of incest and eventually pled guilty to sexual assault.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b250-8\"> In 1985, Montana broadened the applicability of its Rape Shield Law to include cases involving all types of sexual crimes. <em>See </em>Sec. 3, Ch. 172, L. 1985.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b250-9\"> The statutory exceptions are evidence of the victim\u2019s past sexual conduct with the offender, or evidence of specific instances of the victim\u2019s sexual activity to show the origin of semen, pregnancy, or disease that is at issue in the prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b252-7\"> <em>State v. Stuit, </em>268 Mont. 176, 885 P.2d 1290 (1994), is not dispositive of the present case. There the defendant argued that he should have been allowed to present evidence of prior sexual encounters involving the victim because the prosecution \u201copened the door\u201d in its opening statement. This Court affirmed the District Court\u2019s ruling excluding the evidence because the defendant failed to make a contemporaneous objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b252-8\"> Colburn\u2019s ability to counter Hansen\u2019s endorsement of R.W.\u2019s credibility was also substantially hampered by the District Court\u2019s exclusion of the proposed testimony of Zook.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b252-9\"> The State cites <em>State v. Van Pelt, </em>247 Mont. 99, 805 P.2d 549 (1991), for the proposition that attacking the credibility of a witness is insufficient reason for admitting evidence that may be covered by the Rape Shield Law. However, this Court held that the conduct involved in the prior abuse could not be the source of knowledge of sexual activity involved in the case, and later cases, including <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>hold that an attack upon the complaining witnesses\u2019 veracity does not per se run afoul of the Rape Shield Law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b253-7\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"AEW\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">\u00b631 I agree with the ultimate resolution reached by the Court regarding Issue 2, but I offer the following analysis to help guide litigants and trial courts in applying the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">\u00b632 To begin, some understanding of the facts is necessary. Colburn was charged with two counts of incest involving his minor daughter, C.C. Colburn was also charged with two counts of felony sexual assault and one count of sexual intercourse without consent involving C.C.\u2019s friend, R.W. At the time of the offenses, both girls were age 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">\u00b633 R.W. testified at trial that she and her friend, C.C., used to live in the same apartment building. While visiting C.C., R.W. described how C.C.\u2019s father, Colburn, touched her \u201ctop area\u201d and \u201cprivate part\u201d while she was in Colburn\u2019s living room and, on another occasion, in Colburn\u2019s bedroom. R.W. also described other occasions when Colburn used his \u201choy part\u201d to touch the outside of her \u201cprivate part\u201d and used his mouth on her private part more than once.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">\u00b634 C.C. testified at trial that she and her father would play a game in which she jumped and Colburn would catch her. Colburn\u2019s hand touched her private area. Another time, C.C. testified to Colburn\u2019s hugging her and that Colburn had one hand on her breast. Colburn also touched C.C.\u2019s bottom underneath her nightgown when she was going to bed. C.C. said she saw the keywords \u201cfather-daughter sex\u201d on Colburn\u2019s laptop.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">\u00b635 Mary Pat Hansen is a nurse practitioner and clinical supervisor at First STEP Resource Center at St. Patrick\u2019s Hospital in Missoula. The Center is a children\u2019s advocacy center and an adult sexual assault center. Hansen testified at trial that R.W. made several disclosures of sexual abuse by Colburn and stated that, in her opinion, the statements made by R.W. were consistent with a child who has experienced sexual abuse. Hansen related specific examples to the jury of R.W.\u2019s sexual knowledge that a \u201cchild may not have unless they\u2019ve had an experience of sexual abuse\u201d which included talking \u201cabout his genitals or penis being floppy and hard\u201d and \u201cweird, gross noises that she could hear coming from him while certain acts were going on.\u201d Hansen\u2019s video interview was admitted at trial and played to the jury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>\u00b636 Hansen also conducted an interview of C.C. C.C.\u2019s trial testimony was consistent with her statements in her interview with Hansen. C.C. also told Hansen that her father told her not to tell anyone about the touching because he would get in trouble. C.C. related to Hansen that her father apologized and that the apologies seemed \u201csarcastic.\u201d Hansen\u2019s video interview of C.C. was admitted and played to the jury. \u00b637 Colburn filed a motion in limine asking the District Court to allow him to introduce evidence of R.W.\u2019s motive to fabricate and to offer evidence of an alternative source of R.W.\u2019s sexual knowledge. More specifically, Colburn sought to introduce evidence that within one month after disclosing against Colburn, R.W. disclosed abuse by her father. Dr. Catherine Otway conducted a forensic interview of R.W. on March 28, 2013 \u2014 only several weeks after Hansen\u2019s interview \u2014 and reported \u201cshe [R.W.] just recently felt comfortable disclosing this information because her mom \u2018believed\u2019 her about the sexual abuse by the neighbor, James Colburn.\u201d As a result of R.W.\u2019s subsequent disclosures regarding her father, R.W.\u2019s father was charged with five counts of incest and pleaded guilty to sexual assault. Although R.W. told Hansen in the earlier interview that Colburn was the only person to have ever touched her inappropriately and that she trusted her dad; in fact, R.W. had been abused by her father over a period of several years. Colburn argued that R.W.\u2019s disclosures about Colburn during her earlier interview with Hansen were \u201ctesting the waters\u201d to learn her mother\u2019s reaction before being safe to make a more dramatic disclosure regarding her father. Additionally, Colburn sought to introduce evidence of sexual abuse by R.W.\u2019s father as an alternative source of R.W.\u2019s sexual knowledge. The District Court excluded the evidence, concluding that Montana\u2019s rape shield statute prevented admission of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\u00b638 A trial court normally has discretion regarding questions of admissibility of evidence at trial, and we review the court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of that discretion. <em>State v. Patterson, </em>2012 MT 282, \u00b6 10, 367 Mont. 186, 291 P.3d 556; <em>State v. Stock, </em>2011 MT 131, \u00b6 17, 361 Mont. 1, 256 P.3d 899. However, \u201cin exercising its discretion, the trial court is bound by the Rules of Evidence or applicable statutes, and to the extent that the court\u2019s ruling is based on an interpretation of an evidentiary ruling or statute, our review is de novo. Moreover, where the court\u2019s conclusions of law involve the Constitution or the rules of evidence, our review is, likewise, de novo.\u201d <em>Patterson, </em>\u00b6 10; <em>State v. Derbyshire, </em>2009 MT 27, \u00b6 19, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811. Here, Colburn raises a constitutional claim \u2014 that his right to a fair trial was violated by the trial court\u2019s application of Montana\u2019s rape shield <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>statute. Since the District Court\u2019s interpretation and application of this statute implicate Colburn\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights to a fair trial, we review the court\u2019s ruling de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">\u00b639 \u201cWhether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, or in the Compulsory Process or Confrontation clauses of the Sixth Amendment, the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants \u2018a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crane v.

This includes \u201cthe right to put before a jury evidence that might influence the determination of guilt.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Illinois, </em>484 U.S. 400, 408, 108 S.

Ct. 779, 783 (1914)). \u201cThat opportunity would be an empty one if the State were permitted to exclude competent, reliable evidence bearing on the credibility of a confession when such evidence is central to the defendant\u2019s claim of innocence. In the absence of any valid state justification, exclusion of this kind of exculpatory evidence deprives a defendant of the basic right to have the prosecutor\u2019s case encounter and \u2018survive the crucible of meaningful adversarial testing.\u2019\u201d <em>Crane, </em>476 U.S. at 691, 106 S.

Ct. 1743 (1991), the Supreme Court recognized that the Sixth Amendment right to present relevant evidence \u201cmay, in appropriate cases, bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process.\u201d <em>Lucas, </em>500 U.S. at 149, 111 S. Ct. at 1746 <em>(quoting Rock v. Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44, 55, 107 S. Ct. 2704, 2711 (1987)). However, when a state rule of evidence conflicts with the right of the accused to present witnesses, the \u201crule may not be applied mechanistically to defeat the ends of justice,\u201d but must meet the fundamental standards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>of due process. <em>Chambers, </em>410 U.S. at 302, 93 S. Ct. at 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\u00b641 For example, in <em>Chambers, </em>the defendant was charged with the murder of a police officer. Chambers called a witness who had previously confessed to the murder. <em>Chambers, </em>410 U.S. at 289, 93 S. Ct. at 1043. When the witness repudiated the confession on the stand, the defendant was denied permission to examine him as an adverse witness based on the State\u2019s \u201cvoucher rule,\u201d which barred parties from impeaching their own witnesses. <em>Chambers, </em>410 U.S. at 294, 93 S. Ct. at 1045. In addition, the state hearsay rule did not include an exception for statements against penal interest, and the defendant was therefore not permitted to introduce evidence that the witness had made self-incriminating statements to three other persons. Noting that the State had not even attempted to \u201cdefend\u201d or \u201cexplain [the] underlying rationale\u201d of the \u201cvoucher rule,\u201d <em>Chambers, </em>410 U.S. at 297, 93 S. Ct. at 1047, the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe exclusion of [the evidence of the witness\u2019s out-of-court statements], coupled with the State\u2019s refusal to permit [the defendant] to cross-examine [the witness], denied [the defendant] a trial in accord with traditional and fundamental standards of due process.\u201d <em>Chambers, </em>410 U.S. at 302, 93 S. Ct. at 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u00b642 That a statute operates to prevent a criminal defendant from presenting an entire defense does not necessarily render it unconstitutional. Rules excluding evidence from criminal trials do not abridge an accused\u2019s right to present a defense so long as they are not arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>1998 MT 107, \u00b6 22, 288 Mont. 513, 958 P.2d 1182 (citing <em>United States v. Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 307-08, 118 S. Ct. 1261, 1264 (1998)). Thus, trial judges retain wide latitude to limit reasonably a criminal defendant\u2019s right to cross-examine a witness \u201cbased on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness\u2019 safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.\u201d <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 679, 106 S. Ct. 1431, 1435 (1986). Courts are required, on a case-by-case basis, to balance the interests of an evidentiary rule excluding evidence with the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense. <em>Lindberg, </em>\u00b6 56; <em>Lajoie v. Thompson, </em>217 F.3d 663, 669 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u00b643 Montana\u2019s rape shield statute, contained at \u00a7 45-5-511 (2), MCA, precludes \u201cevidence concerning the sexual conduct of the victim.\u201d The statute provides two narrowly-drawn exceptions: (1) evidence of past sexual conduct with the defendant, and (2) evidence of specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>instances of the victim\u2019s sexual activity to show the origin of semen, pregnancy, or disease that is at issue in the prosecution. Neither exception is at issue here. We have consistently recognized that the statutory prohibition of certain evidence in \u00a7 45-5-511, MCA, \u201creflects a compelling interest in favor of preserving the integrity of the trial and preventing it from becoming a trial of the victim.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>211 Mont. at 283, 686 P.2d at 199 (brackets, ellipsis, and citation omitted). <em>See also Johnson, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>State v. Van Pelt, </em>247 Mont. 99, 805 P.2d 549 (1991); <em>State v. Higley, </em>190 Mont. 412, 621 P.2d 1043 (1980). Therefore, to avoid an arbitrary and mechanical operation of the statute which would render it unconstitutional, a defendant\u2019s right to present his defense must be balanced against the interest in preserving the integrity of the trial and preventing it from becoming a trial of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\u00b644 This Court has previously recognized that the bar imposed by Montana\u2019s rape shield statute is not absolute. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 23. For example, \u201cevidence of prior false accusations of the same sexual crime involved in a more current case, while not admissible for the purpose of impeaching the <em>general character or reputation </em>of the witness, may be admissible if probative of the witness\u2019 state of mind, motive, or biases with respect to making the more current accusations.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>211 Mont. at 283, 686 P.2d at 199 (emphasis supplied). Evidence of alleged prior sexual acts of a victim which tend to impugn the victim\u2019s reputation or character \u201cis precisely the type of testimony that the rape shield law was designed to prohibit.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Mazurek v. District Court, </em>277 Mont. 349, 355, 922 P.2d 474, 478 (1996). However, the policy of protecting against the trial becoming a trial of the victim \u201cis not violated or circumvented if the offered evidence can be narrowed to the issue of the complaining witness\u2019 veracity.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>211 Mont. at 284, 686 P.2d at 200. Accordingly, where the evidence is offered to demonstrate a prior false accusation, we have set forth a procedure for the trial court to employ in determining whether to admit the evidence. <em>See Mazurek, </em>277 Mont. at 358, 922 P.2d at 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\u00b645 Inadmissible evidence under the rape shield statute is evidence of the victim\u2019s sexual conduct offered for the purpose of impugning the victim\u2019s reputation or character and, as a result, rendering the trial a trial of the victim. <em>Mazurek, </em>277 Mont. at 355, 922 P.2d at 478; <em>State v. Higley, </em>190 Mont. 412, 621 P.2d 1043, 1050 (1980). It is difficult to imagine a factual situation where evidence would ever be relevant to an issue in the case which had as its only purpose the impugning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>victim\u2019s reputation or character. However, sexual conduct evidence which is otherwise inadmissible because it is reputation or character evidence of the victim may still be relevant and probative based upon an alternative theory of admissibility. Thus, we have recognized \u2014 in addition to veracity \u2014 that evidence of the victim\u2019s sexual conduct may be admissible in rape shield cases when it is relevant and \u201cprobative of the witness\u2019 state of mind, motive, or biases with respect to making the more current accusations.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>211 Mont. at 283, 686 P.2d at 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">\u00b646 Where the sexual conduct evidence is sought to be admitted under a permissible basis for admission, the trial judge must balance the probative value of the evidence, as it relates to the defendant\u2019s presentation of his defense, against the interest in preventing prejudice to the victim and preserving the integrity of the trial, i.e., ensuring that the trial does not become a trial of the victim. The first step of the inquiry focuses on identifying the permissible basis for admission; the second step requires the trial court to balance the probative value of the evidence against the interest in protecting the integrity of the trial. \u201cThe constitution does not require a blanket exception to rape shield statutes for all evidence related to motive to fabricate. Speculative or unsupported allegations are insufficient to tip the scales in favor of a defendant\u2019s right to present a defense and against the victim\u2019s rights under the rape shield statute.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">\u00b647 Finally, the State\u2019s reliance on <em>Van Pelt </em>is misplaced. Van Pelt argued that the .victim could not have consented to any sexual acts because of her young age and that raising prior acts of abuse would not violate \u00a7 45-5-511, MCA. <em>Van Pelt, </em>247 Mont. at 100, 805 P.2d at 550. This Court found, based on the evidence presented, that the prior sexual abuse was not relevant to the issue of whether Van Pelt sexually molested the victim because the knowledge the victim exhibited at trial could not have been gained from the type of prior abuse the victim had endured. <em>Van Pelt, </em>247 Mont. at 104, 805 P.2d at 552. Indeed, we recognized in <em>Van Pelt </em>that \u00a7 45-5-511, MCA, does not provide an \u201cimpenetrable wall\u201d of protection for the victim and that the Montana Rules of Evidence certainly allow the credibility of the victim to be attacked. <em>Van Pelt, </em>247 Mont. at 103, 805 P.2d at 552. The State\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Stuit, </em>268 Mont. 176, 885 P.2d 1290 (1994), is similarly misplaced. The issue in Stuit was whether the State had opened the door to sexual abuse evidence during its opening statement and whether Stuit timely objected. <em>Stuit, </em>268 Mont. at 177, 885 P.2d at 1291. We concluded that the court properly ruled that the prosecutor\u2019s comment did not open the door to testimony regarding the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>prior sexual abuse. <em>Stuit, </em>268 Mont. at 184, 885 P.2d at 1296.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">\u00b648 Colburn contends that his inability to present evidence that the victim was \u201ctesting the waters\u201d when she disclosed Colburn\u2019s acts to a forensic interviewer impaired his ability to present an entire defense and to bring out all facts relevant to the issue of the child\u2019s motive to fabricate. The result, Colburn argues, was a partial presentation of the relevant facts to the jury. In contrast, the State presented to the jury a picture of a young victim who made sexually knowledgeable and explicit allegations against her neighbor, with no apparent reason whatsoever to fabricate, supported by a professional\u2019s undisputed assessment that the child was credible because she had sexual abuse-based sexual knowledge. Colburn maintains that the State chose to make R.W.\u2019s sexual knowledge a pivotal issue at trial \u2014 the kind that only comes from an experience of sexual abuse \u2014 to support the inference that Colburn must have been the source of that sexual knowledge. Colburn maintains that the evidence that R.W. was sexually abused by her father could have rebutted that powerful inference. Colburn also maintains that evidence presented through Dr. Catherine Otway that R.W. disclosed against her father because she \u201conly recently felt comfortable disclosing this information because her mom \u2018believed\u2019 her about the sexual abuse by the neighbor, James Colburn\u201d was highly probative of R.W.\u2019s motive to fabricate.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">\u00b649 I agree, after examining the particular facts and the excluded evidence, that evidence related to R.W. testing the waters was relevant to her motive to fabricate. Preventing Colburn from presenting this evidence to the jury violated his constitutional right to present an entire defense. The ability to explore a witness\u2019s biases, prejudices, and motives to fabricate enjoys particular constitutional protection because ofits critical role in a defense. <em>Olden v. Kentucky, </em>488 U.S. 227, 231-32, 109 S. Ct. 480, 482 (1988); <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 317-20, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 1110-12 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u00b650 Furthermore, evidence that R.W. had been a victim of sexual abuse of her father was relevant to show that R.W. could have learned about the sexual acts and male genitalia other than through sexual abuse by Colburn. The jury did not hear of situations from which R.W. could have gained sexual knowledge as a result of the undisputed abuse she suffered at the hands of her father. The State relied heavily on R.W.\u2019s sexualization in the presentation of its case, supported by Hansen\u2019s assessment of R.W.\u2019s credibility based on her sexual abuse knowledge. Colburn was unable to rebut this powerful inference that he was the only cause of R.W.\u2019s sexualization.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">\u00b651 For these reasons, and pursuant to this analysis, I would conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>that the District Court incorrectly applied the law when it failed to balance Colburn\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense against the interests of the rape shield statute. I join the Court\u2019s opinion regarding Issue 1.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
