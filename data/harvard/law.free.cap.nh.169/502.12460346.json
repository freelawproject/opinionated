On appeal, the City asserts that the trial court erred in refusing to apply the doctrine of <em>nullum tempus occurrit regi. </em>(\u201ctime does not run against the king\u201d) so as to exempt the City\u2019s claims against defendants Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron n/k/a CB&amp;I, Inc. (CB&amp;I) and Whitman &amp; Howard n/k/a AECOM Technical Services, Inc. (AECOM) from the bar of the six-year statute of limitations that was in effect when CB&amp;I and AECOM substantially completed their contract with the City. <em>See </em>RSA 508:4, I (1983) (amended 1986). We affirm and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">The following facts are drawn from the interlocutory appeal statement. The City\u2019s Department of Public Works owns and operates the Rochester Water System, which provides water to residents of the City. The City operates three water storage tanks, one of which is the Rochester Hill Water Storage Tank (the Tank). AECOM designed the Tank and oversaw its construction by CB&amp;I. CB&amp;I completed the Tank in 1985, and it was placed into service that same year.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>In June 2009, the City contracted defendant Marcel A. Payeur, Inc. (Payeur) to service the Tank by recoating the Tank\u2019s interior and exterior, installing a mixer, and modifying the Tank to accommodate the mixer. Defendant Wright-Pierce, a Maine corporation, performed the engineering and design work for the modification project. Payeur substantially completed the modification, under Wright-Pierce\u2019s supervision, in November 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">In December 2011, the Tank developed a leak. The City had to evacuate nearby residents, drain the Tank, and remove it from service. The City inspected the Tank and discovered that Payeur had failed to properly construct the modifications in accordance with Wright-Pierce\u2019s design.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The City filed suit against Payeur in November 2012, alleging breach of contract, breach of warranty, negligence, and unjust enrichment. In April 2014, the City named CB&amp;I, AECOM, and Wright-Pierce as additional defendants. The City\u2019s amended complaint alleged that Wright-Pierce had failed to properly supervise Payeur\u2019s 2009 modification work; it also alleged that, in 1985, CB&amp;I had failed to properly construct the Tank in accordance with AECOM\u2019s design, and AECOM had failed to adequately monitor CB&amp;I.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">CB&amp;I and AECOM moved to dismiss the City\u2019s claims against them, arguing that the claims were time-barred by RSA 508:4. The City objected, arguing that the doctrine of <em>nullum, ternpus </em>precluded the statute of limitations from running against the City. The trial court granted CB&amp;I and AECOM\u2019s motions to dismiss. Thereafter, the trial court approved, and we accepted, this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">The statute of limitations is an affirmative defense and thus a matter as to which defendants CB&amp;I and AECOM bear the burden of proof. <em>Glines v. Bruk, </em>140 N.H. 180, 181 (1995). However, in ruling on the motion to dismiss, the trial court assumed the factual allegations of the complaint to be true, and ruled as a matter of law that the doctrine of <em>nullum, ternpus </em>was inapplicable and that the statute of limitations barred the City\u2019s claims against CB&amp;I and AECOM. Therefore, our review is <em>de novo. See State v. Lake Winnipesaukee Resort, </em>159 N.H. 42, 45 (2009) (\u201cBecause the trial court rejected the statute of limitations defense as a matter of law, our review is <em>de novo.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">The City submits two issues for our review: (1) \u201cWhether the doctrine of <em>nullum, ternpus </em>applies to municipalities to bar the application of statutes of limitation[s] to claims brought by a municipality\u201d; and (2) \u201cWhether the doctrine of <em>nullum, ternpus </em>bars the application of RSA 508:4 to the City\u2019s claims here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\u201cThe doctrine of <em>nullum, tempus </em>is a common law rule excepting the sovereign from general limitations periods.\u201d <em>Lake Winnipesaukee Resort, </em>159 N.H. at 45. Although <em>\u201cnullum, tempus </em>endures as a recognized doctrine of law in New Hampshire,\u201d <em>id., </em>our case law applying the doctrine is sparse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We applied the doctrine in <em>Lake Winnipesaukee Resort, </em>when we held that <em>nullum, tempus </em>exempted a state civil enforcement action from the current three-year statute of limitations for personal actions, RSA 508:4, I (2010). <em>Lake Winnipesaukee Resort, </em>159 N.H. at 45-49. In <em>In re Dockham Estate, </em>108 N.H. 80, 82 (1967), we declined to apply <em>nullum, tempus </em>to bar the application of a non-claim statute of limitations to a state action to recover an inmate\u2019s cost of care from his estate. <em>But see Reconstruction &amp;c. Corp. v. Faulkner, </em>100 N.H. 192, 194 (1956) (holding that a non-claim statute did not preclude a federal government agency from asserting its claim after the running of the limitations period). Additionally, we note that the New Hampshire legislature has codified the doctrine with respect to adverse possession and prescriptive easements. <em>See </em>RSA 236:30 (2009) (prohibiting prescriptive periods from running against public highways); RSA 477:33 (2013) (prohibiting, in some circumstances, the acquisition of prescriptive rights in state waters); RSA 477:34 (2013) (prohibiting the acquisition of prescriptive rights in public grounds); RSA 539:6 (2007) (prohibiting adverse possession of state lands).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">We have not previously determined whether <em>nullum, tempus </em>applies to claims asserted by municipalities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The City urges us to apply the doctrine of <em>nullum, tempus </em>to its contract claims against the defendants. We decline to do so because applying <em>nullum, tempus </em>to a municipality\u2019s contract claims is not supported by the public policy underlying <em>nullum, tempus </em>and undermines the public policy underlying statutes of limitations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The public policy supporting application of <em>nullum, tempus </em>to adverse possession claims against public property and state civil enforcement actions does not support extending the doctrine to a municipality\u2019s contract claims. In cases of adverse possession, the very basis for the claim is that the claimant has committed a trespassory invasion of the owner\u2019s property rights that continued for the applicable limitations period. <em>See, e.g., Bonardi v. Kazmirchuk, </em>146 N.H. 640, 642 (2001). \u201c[T]he nature of the use must have been such as to show that the owner knew <em>or ought to have known, </em>that the right was being exercised, not in reliance upon the owner\u2019s toleration or permission, but without regard to the owner\u2019s consent.\u201d <em>Sandford v. Town of Wolfeboro, </em>143 N.H. 481, 484 (1999) (emphasis added; brackets and quotation omitted). Given the vast extent and wide variety of publicly-owned land, water and easement rights, as well as governmental bodies\u2019 need to rely on the finite universe of public employees, who are otherwise occupied with their regular duties, to detect encroachments on these rights, application of the doctrine of <em>nullum, tempus </em>to adverse possession claims serves the important purpose of protecting public property rights from loss that could otherwise result from failure to detect unknown encroachments.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Similarly, in the case of enforcement actions to recover fines or penalties for violations of state statutes or local ordinances, governmental agents are not always able to promptly discover the existence of such violations. State agents \u201cdo not generally institute proceedings to punish violations of the laws, except at the instigation of individuals.\u201d <em>State v. Franklin Falls </em>Co., 49 N.H. 240, 252 (1870). As a result, \u201cit may be doubted whether [government officials] are ever aware of a very large proportion of the infringements on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>the rights of the state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, again in this context, <em>nullum, tenvpus </em>operates to protect the public good by preventing wrongdoers from benefitting from the limitations inherent in governmental bodies\u2019 enforcement prowess, to the detriment of public rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Conversely, public bodies such as municipalities <em>are </em>aware of the contracts into which they enter. Thus, a municipality\u2019s contractual undertakings are unlikely to lead to unknown violations of public rights. Rather, municipalities generally are as equipped as private individuals to vigilantly enforce their contract rights in a timely fashion. Furthermore, when a municipality enters into a contract, it acts as does any private party: \u201c[A] municipal corporation is bound by, and may sue and be sued on, all contracts which it may legally enter into in the same manner as a private corporation or an individual.\u201d <em>Great Lakes Aircraft Co. v. City of Claremont, </em>135 N.H. 270, 278-79 (1992) (quotation omitted); <em>see also </em>RSA 31:3 (2000) (authorizing municipal corporations to make contracts); RSA 31:1 (2000) (stating that municipalities may sue and be sued).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Additionally, municipalities cannot raise sovereign immunity as a defense to contract claims. <em>See Great Lakes, </em>135 N.H. at 279 (\u201cThe immunity of government from liability on contracts has never been regarded as applicable to local governmental units.\u201d). Although sovereign immunity and <em>nullum, tempus </em>are distinct doctrines, both have their origins as incidents of sovereignty. <em>See Lake Winnipesaukee Resort, </em>159 N.H. at 45; <em>Sousa v. State, </em>115 N.H. 340, 342 (1975). Thus, a municipality\u2019s inability to raise sovereign immunity as a defense to contract claims demonstrates that when a municipality enters a contract, it is acting as does a private party and not as a sovereign.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">In sum, municipalities enter into contracts in the same manner as private parties, and they are equally equipped to assert their contract rights as are private parties. Because municipalities are not at a disadvantage to assert their contract rights, the doctrine of <em>nullum, tempus </em>is not necessary to protect the public\u2019s interest in those rights.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Allowing a municipality to bring contract claims notwithstanding RSA 508:4 would undermine the public policy behind statutes of limitations. Statutes of limitations \u201creflect the fact that it becomes more difficult and time-consuming both to defend against and to try claims as evidence disappears and memories fade with the passage of time.\u201d <em>Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., </em>131 N.H. 6, 14 (1988). Statutes of limitations both insure that defendants receive timely notice of actions against them and protect defendants from stale or fraudulent claims. <em>Id. </em>at 14; <em>Dupuis v. Smith Properties, Inc., </em>114 N.H. 625, 629 (1974). \u201cSuch statutes thus represent the legislature\u2019s attempt to achieve a balance among State interests in protecting both forum courts and defendants generally against stale claims and in insuring a reasonable period during which plaintiffs may seek recovery on otherwise sound causes of action.\u201d <em>Keeton, </em>131 N.H. at 14. Because statutes of limitations are grounded in public policy, parties cannot agree by contract made in advance of the accrual of a cause of action for breach to extend or avoid application of the limitations period. <em>See West Gate Village Assoc. v. Dubois, </em>145 N.H. 293, 299 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Here, the trial court ruled that the City\u2019s claims were time-barred by RSA 508:4 unless <em>nullum, tempus </em>operated to exempt the City\u2019s claims from that statute of limitations. The former version of RSA 508:4 that governs this case bars contract claims after six years, and the City did not bring its claims until many years after the expiration of the limitations period. Permitting the City to bring its contract claims would unfairly subject the defendants to the harms against which statutes of limitations were designed to protect. Employees of the City and the defendants may have changed jobs, retired, or died. The memories of those witnesses who can still be located will no doubt have faded. Other physical evidence may have been lost or destroyed. Furthermore, because the defendants would not have expected such a stale claim to be enforceable, they had no incentive to preserve evidence. Therefore, because the passage of time has made it more difficult for the defendants to defend against the City\u2019s claims, it would be unfair and would undermine the public policy supporting statutes of limitations to allow the City to bring its twenty-nine-year-old contract claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Because applying the doctrine of <em>nullum tempus </em>to a municipality\u2019s contract claims is not supported by the public policy underlying <em>nullum tempus </em>and undermines the public policy underlying statutes of limitations, we conclude that <em>nullum tempus </em>does not bar the application of RSA 508:4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>to the City\u2019s contract claims. Therefore, we affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. In light of our holding, we need not decide at this time whether municipalities, in other contexts, may properly invoke <em>nullum tem-pus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\n<em>Affirmed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b553-6\">Dalianis, C.J., and Hicks, Conboy, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-7\"> The historical justification for the doctrine is that the king (and, by analogy, modern day sovereigns) cannot be expected to be as vigilant as individuals are in preserving their rights. <em>State v. Franklin Falls Co., </em>49 N.H. 240, 252 (1870). Sovereigns are impersonal and thus are limited to acting through agents such as state officials, who \u201care generally few in number and fully occupied with the regular routine of official duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the doctrine is thought to further \u2018The great public policy of preserving the public rights, revenues, and property from injury and loss, by the negligence of public officers.\u201d <em>Lake Winnipesaukee Resort, </em>159 N.H. at 45 (quotation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b549-8\"> Other states faced with this issue have dealt with it in different ways. Some states do not extend <em>nullum tempus </em>to municipalities in any circumstances. <em>See, e.g., City of Lincoln, Neb. v. Windstream Nebraska, Inc., </em>800 F. Supp. 2d 1030, 1035 (D. Neb. 2011) <em>(\u201c[Nfultum tempus . . . </em>only applies in favor of the sovereign power, and has no application to municipal corporations . . . .\u201d (quotation omitted)). Other states extend <em>nullum tempus </em>to municipalities to the same extent that they apply the doctrine to their state government. <em>See, e.g., Enroth v. Memorial Hosp. at Gulfport, </em>566 So. 2d 202, 206 (Miss. 1990) (recognizing that, by state constitution and statute, <em>nullum tempus </em>applies to state and all political subdivisions of state, including municipalities). The remaining states that have addressed the issue apply <em>nullum tempus </em>to municipalities in a limited fashion, using a variety of tests to determine when it applies. <em>See, e.g., Fennelly v. A-1 Machine &amp; Tool Co., </em>728 N.W.2d 163, 170 (Iowa 2006) <em>(\u201c[NJullum tempus </em>doctrine does not exempt actions by municipalities and counties in Iowa from a general statute of limitations unless the action involves a public or governmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>activity, as opposed to a private or proprietary activity.\u201d); <em>State v. Goldfarb, </em>278 A.2d 818, 822 (Conn. 1971) (\u201c[A] subdivision of the state, acting within its delegated governmental capacity, is not impliedly bound by the ordinary statute of limitations.\u201d); <em>Brown v. Trustees of Schools, </em>79 N.E. 579, 579-80 (Ill. 1906) (applying <em>nullum. tempus </em>to municipalities with regard to \u201cpublic rights\u201d and \u201cproperty held for public use,\u201d but declining to apply <em>nullum tempus </em>to municipalities with regard to \u201ccontracts or mere private rights\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b550-9\"> The City argues that if we apply <em>nullum. tempus </em>to municipalities on a limited basis, we should use either an \u201cultimate right at issue\u201d test or a \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d test to determine when the doctrine applies. However, in light of our holding, we need not decide at this time whether the ultimate right at issue test, discretionary function test, or another test would be proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\"> The City argues that RSA 477:33, RSA 477:34, and our case law support the application of <em>nullum. tempus </em>to municipalities. To the extent that the City contends that these authorities support the application of <em>nullu m, te mpus </em>to a municipality\u2019s contract actions, we disagree for the reasons stated in the text. Although RSA 477:33 and RSA 477:34 prohibit individuals from acquiring prescriptive rights against public lands and state waters, which mirrors the effects of <em>nullum tempus, </em>the statutes are silent regarding the common-law <em>nullum t.empus </em>doctrine, both generally and as applied to contract actions. The City also relies upon our case law for the principle that \u201c[a] public right once acquired cannot be lost to an individual by adverse use.\u201d <em>Windham v. Jubinville, </em>92 N.H. 102, 104 (1942); <em>see also Manchester v. Hodge, </em>74 N.H. 468, 470 (1908); <em>Thompson v. Major, </em>58 N.H. 242, 244 (1878). However, each of these cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>involved adverse possession of public highways or lands, which is prohibited by statute. Consequently, these cases provide no support for the application of <em>nullum, tempus </em>to a municipality\u2019s contract action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
