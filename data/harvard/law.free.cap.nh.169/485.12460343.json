We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The trial court\u2019s order recites the following facts. The Church is located in Durham. Its property includes a church, rectory, \u201ceducational wing,\u201d land, and a 87 - space parking lot. The Church has been leasing spaces in its parking lot to UNH students since 1998. The Church charges students $800 per space, per semester. Under the lease agreement, students are permitted to park in the lot at all times, except: \u201cSundays, from 7:80 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.; the first Saturday in December; the Saturday after Labor Day; days when the Church hosts weddings, funerals, and other events; and days when it snows or the parking lot requires repair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Until 2018, the Church received a religious tax exemption under RSA 72:28, III for its entire parking lot. In early 2018, the Town learned that the Church leased spaces to UNH students. At that time, the Town believed students leased 80 of the 87 parking spaces. Accordingly, after determining that the leased parking spaces were no longer exempt from taxation, the Town issued the Church a tax bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Sometime thereafter, the Town learned that UNH students leased only 24 spaces and that the students were required to remove their vehicles at times so that the spaces could be used for Church functions. Subsequently, the Town reduced the tax due by 25%. The Town\u2019s reduction of the tax due is not an issue for our review in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The Church appealed the Town\u2019s tax assessment to the superior court. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Town. The trial court reasoned that \u201cif each space was being used and occupied directly by the Church members, visitors, and employees,\u201d then the entire parking lot would be tax-exempt. (Quotation omitted.) The court determined that the 18 spaces that are used by only the Church and are not leased to UNH students are tax-exempt. With regard to the 24 spaces leased to UNH students, the court found that they are not tax-exempt because they are not used or occupied directly by the Church. Rather, the leased spaces are occupied and used by UNH students \u201cfor their own private and secular purpose and not for the statutory exempted religious purposes of the Church.\u201d The trial court found that the Church\u2019s use and occupation of the leased spaces, is \u201ctoo slight and insufficiently significant to warrant an exemption.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">\u201cIn reviewing the trial court\u2019s rulings on cross-motions for summary judgment, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to each party in its capacity as the nonmoving party and, if no genuine issue of material fact exists, we determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Granite State Mgmt. &amp; Res. v. City of Concord, </em>165 N.H. 277, 282 (2013) (quotation omitted); <em>see </em>RSA 491:8-a, III (2010). \u201cIf our review of that evidence discloses no genuine issue of material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>fact, and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, then we will affirm the grant of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Granite State Mgmt. &amp; Res., </em>165 N.H. at 282 (quotation omitted). We review the trial court\u2019s application of law to the facts <em>de novo. N. Sec. Ins. Co. v. Connors, </em>161 N.H. 645, 649 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">RSA 72:23 sets forth certain exemptions from real estate and personal property taxation for governmental, religious, educational, and charitable organizations. RSA 72:23 (2012). Paragraph III of the statute exempts from taxation \u201c[hjouses of public worship . . . , buildings and the lands appertaining to them owned, <em>used and occupied directly </em>for religious training or for other religious purposes by any regularly recognized and constituted denomination.\u201d RSA 72:23, III (emphasis added). \u201cThe burden of demonstrating the applicability of any exemption shall be upon the claimant.\u201d RSA 72:23-m (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">There is no dispute that the Church is a \u201cregularly recognized and constituted denomination,\u201d or that the parking lot, which the Church owns, is \u201cappertaining\u201d to the Church\u2019s buildings. RSA 72:23, III. Thus, the only issue for our review is whether the spaces leased to UNH students are \u201cused and occupied directly\u201d for religious purposes and, therefore, are tax-exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">For a religious organization to be deemed to use and occupy property \u201cdirectly\u201d for religious purposes, its use of the property for those purposes must be more than \u201cslight, negligible or insignificant.\u201d <em>Appeal of Liberty Assembly of God, </em>163 N.H. 622, 634 (2012) (quotation omitted). Property is not exempt when it is used by private individuals \u201cfor their own private and secular purposes and not for . . . statutory exempted religious purposes.\u201d <em>Alton Bay Camp Meeting Asso. v. Alton, </em>109 N.H. 44, 49 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Here, the trial court determined that the Church\u2019s use of the leased spaces \u201cis too slight and insufficiently significant to warrant an exemption,\u201d and that the UNH students \u201cwho occupy and use the spaces,\u201d do so \u201cfor their own private and secular purpose and not for the statutory exempted religious purposes of the Church.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(concluding that land owned by a religious association and leased to private individuals, was \u201coccupied and used principally by the [individuals] for their own private and secular purposes and not for the statutory exempted religious purposes of the Association\u201d). As the trial court found, the leased spaces are \u201cused and occupied directly\u201d by the UNH students for \u201call but about six hours each week, plus special event days and during snow plowing and repair operation.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court upheld the Town\u2019s determination that the leased spaces do not qualify for an exemption. We find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>In arguing for a contrary result, the Church contends that \u201can exempt taxpayer may generate revenue from a nonexempt activity and still retain its tax exemption if it uses the revenue for its exempt mission.\u201d The Church asserts that \u201csince 1998, the revenue from leasing spaces has averaged about ten percent of the Church\u2019s annual revenue. It has served to partially offset the decline in annual giving pledges.\u201d The Church\u2019s argument is based upon a misreading of our law.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The issue is not how the Church uses the revenue generated by leasing the spaces, but whether the spaces are \u201cused and occupied directly for religious . . . purposes.\u201d <em>Appeal of Liberty Assembly of God, </em>163 N.H. at 630 (quotation omitted). In the charitable exemption context, we have observed that property owned by an exempt organization and rented to private individuals for residential purposes does not necessarily result in the loss of tax-exemption. <em>See The Housing Partnership v. Town of Rollinsford, </em>141 N.H. 239, 242 (1996). However, for a leased residence to be tax-exempt, \u201cthe occupancy of the property must be <em>reasonably necessary </em>for the charitable organization to carry out its mission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). We have yet to apply this \u201creasonably necessary\u201d test in the religious exemption context, and we need not do so here. The Church does not argue that providing off-campus parking to college students is \u201creasonably necessary\u201d to carry out its mission.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Rather, the Church asserts that <em>its </em>use and occupation of the leased spaces on Sundays and at other times when the Church holds services and conducts other religious activities meets the statutory threshold for an exemption, because its use is more than \u201cslight, negligible or insignificant.\u201d We agree with the trial court, however, that the Church\u2019s use of the leased spaces for \u201cabout six hours each week\u201d and other limited times constitutes \u201cslight, negligible or insignificant\u201d use of the spaces for the Church\u2019s religious purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The Church next contends that its entire parking lot should be exempt, including the leased spaces, because the building that the parking lot serves is exempt. The Church relies upon <em>Granite State Management &amp; Resources, </em>165 N.H. 277, <em>St. Paul\u2019s School v. City of Concord, </em>117 N.H. 243 (1977), and <em>Wentworth Home v. Portsmouth, </em>108 N.H. 514 (1968). However, those cases are distinguishable because none concerned the leasing of parking spaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The Church also argues that to affirm the trial court\u2019s order would require \u201cthe Church to let the 24 spaces lie fallow to avoid becoming taxable,\u201d which \u201cmakes no sense, leads to waste and in no way can be considered sound or reasonable public policy.\u201d To the contrary, we hold only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>that the current leasing of the spaces renders them taxable. We need not address whether a different leasing arrangement would result in a different outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Church did not meet its burden of demonstrating that the leased spaces are exempt. <em>See </em>RSA 72:28. Finally, having reviewed the record regarding the Church\u2019s remaining arguments, we conclude that they warrant no further discussion. <em>See Vogel v. Vogel, </em>137 N.H. 321, 322 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b533-7\">Dalianis, C.J., and Hicks and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
