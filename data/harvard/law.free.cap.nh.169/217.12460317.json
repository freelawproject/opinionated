Ct. R. 11; <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(h)(1) (2012) (explaining that, for the purpose of determining Medicaid eligibility, the term \u201c \u2018assets\u2019 \u201d includes \u201call income and resources of the individual and of the individual\u2019s spouse\u201d). On appeal, the petitioner contends that the AAU erroneously found that the Thea G. Braiterman Irrevocable Trust (the Trust) was includable as an asset for the purpose of determining the applicant\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid-OAA benefits. The petitioner has argued, and DHHS has not disputed, that the petitioner\u2019s challenge is not moot even though the applicant is now deceased. Assuming without deciding that the petition is not moot, we deny the petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">\n<em>I. Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b262-14\">\n<em>A Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b262-15\">The applicant created the Trust in 1994, naming herself and her son, David J. Braiterman, as trustees. The applicant resigned as a trustee in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>2008. However, the Trust authorized the applicant to appoint additional and successor trustees, and the petitioner acknowledges that the applicant could have resumed service as a trustee by appointing herself as an additional or successor trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The Trust named the applicant\u2019s children \u2014 David, Ken Braiterman, and Marta Tanenbaum \u2014 as the \u201cLegatees.\u201d Ken has since died, leaving no issue. Thus, David and Marta are the remaining Legatees.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">When the Trust was created, the applicant granted it all of her real property interests, her personal property interests, and $1.00. The real property included the furnished home in which the applicant and her husband lived. The applicant and her husband lived in the home rent-free until he died in 2004. At some point after her husband died, the applicant moved into an assisted living facility. Thereafter, the furnished home was sold, and, in 2009, the sale proceeds were transferred to an investment account.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">In 2009, the investment account contained approximately $189,000. By November 2018, the account contained between $180,000 and $185,000. Between 2009 (when the applicant entered assisted living) and 2012, regular disbursements from the Trust were made to undisclosed recipients for undisclosed reasons. According to the AAU, the petitioner \u201cequivocated\u201d as to whether either David or Marta used any of the disbursements from the Trust to fund the applicant\u2019s expenses. DHHS has not inquired as to whether the disbursements were used to benefit the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The applicant resided in a nursing home from January 2014 until her death in March 2016. In February 2014, she applied for Medicaid-OAA. In March 2014, DHHS denied her application on the ground that her assets, which included the Trust (then valued at $156,000), were \u201cmore than the limit set for\u201d Medicaid-OAA. The applicant appealed DHHS\u2019s decision to the AAU. Following a hearing, the AAU upheld the determination that the Trust was includable as an asset for the purpose of assessing whether the applicant was eligible for Medicaid-OAA benefits. The applicant unsuccessfully moved for rehearing, and this petition followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">\n<em>B. The Trust</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">The Trust Agreement contains 11 clauses, not all of which are relevant to this appeal. The Trust Agreement refers to both the applicant and her son, David, as \u201cTrustee.\u201d The applicant is also referred to as \u201cDonor,\u201d and David is listed as one of the \u201cLegatees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">Clause 8 concerns the applicant\u2019s reserved powers and rights as the donor of the Trust. Under Clause 3.1, the applicant reserved the right \u201cto alter the order and number of the successor Trustees ... or to name additional Trustees or successor Trustees.\u201d In Clause 3.2, the applicant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>reserved \u201cthe power, exercisable at any time ..., to appoint any part or all of the undistributed income of the Trust Fund to any one or more of the Legatees,\u201d including \u201cthe power to make lifetime gifts.\u201d In Clause 3.3, the applicant reserved \u201cthe power, exercisable at any time . . ., to appoint any part or all of the principal of the Trust Fund, outright or upon trusts, conditions or limitations, to any one or more of the Legatees,\u201d including \u201cthe power to make lifetime gifts.\u201d Under Clause 3.7, the applicant reserved \u201cthe power to require the Trustee to accumulate any or all of the income of the Trust Fund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Clause 3.6 provides that the applicant did \u201cnot retain any interest in the principal or income\u201d of the Trust \u201cby express reservation or by agreement between or among, or assumption of,\u201d the applicant, the trustee, and the Legatees. Clause 3.8 provides that the applicant did \u201cnot reserve any power or authority whatever to revoke or amend any provision\u201d of the Trust Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Clause 4 concerns dispositions from the Trust during the applicant\u2019s lifetime. Pursuant to Clause 4.1, during the applicant\u2019s lifetime, the Trustee could \u201cdistribute, from time to time, to and among any one or more of the Legatees as may be living, so much of the principal or income of the Trust Fund at such time or times and in such amounts and proportions\u201d as the trustee, in his or her \u201cuncontrolled discretion, [deemed] advisable.\u201d Clause 4.1.1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">If, at any time during the lifetime of the [applicant], the [applicant] may lose or may lose eligibility for substantial cash benefits or medical or other services by reason of the existence, size or terms of this Trust, the [applicant] suggests that the Trustee consider taking action to terminate the Trust by distributing the principal and accumulated income of the Trust Fund, if in the judgment of the Trustee such loss of eligibility would likely necessitate expenditures from the Trust for or on behalf of the [applicant] at a rate expected to deplete the Trust substantially and to defeat its supplemental and long-term purposes. The [applicant] expresses the hope that if the Trust is terminated during the lifetime of the [applicant], any persons taking under this paragraph will use a portion of her gift to supplement the income and the governmental benefits and services to which the [applicant] may be entitled by reason of age, disability or otherwise. It is not the intention of the [applicant], however, to impose any legal obligation or trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Clause 7.13 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Notwithstanding any other provisions of this instrument except as specifically set forth herein, the discretionary power of the Trustee ... to distribute principal or income or to determine the size of any such distribution shall not be exercised or exercisable by any Trustee in a manner that will benefit the Trustee personally or anyone whom the Trustee has a legal obligation to support ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\n<em>A. Standards of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\u201cCertiorari review is an extraordinary remedy, granted not as a matter of right, but rather at the court\u2019s discretion when the substantial ends of justice require it.\u201d <em>Petition of Maxi Drug, </em>154 N.H. 651, 655 (2006). \u201cCertiorari review is limited to whether the agency acted illegally with respect to jurisdiction, authority or observance of the law, whereby it arrived at a conclusion which could not legally or reasonably be made, or unsustainably exercised its discretion or acted arbitrarily, unreasonably, or capriciously.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655-56. We exercise our power to grant such writs sparingly. <em>Petition of Chase Home for Children, </em>155 N.H. 528, 532 (2005). In this case, the extraordinary remedy of certiorari is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Resolving the issues in this appeal requires that we interpret federal Medicaid statutory and regulatory provisions. The interpretation of a statute or a regulation is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. See Dube v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>166 N.H. 358, 364 (2014). We interpret federal statutes and regulations \u201cin accordance with federal policy and precedent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When interpreting statutes and regulations, we begin with the statutory or regulatory language, and, if possible, construe that language according to its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">\n<em>B. Medicaid Eligibility in General</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">We begin with a general overview of Medicaid eligibility as it pertains to an applicant\u2019s assets. \u201cMedicaid is a joint state and federal program under which the federal government provides financial support to states that establish and administer a state Medicaid program, in accordance with federal law, through an approved state plan.\u201d <em>Petition of Maxi Drug, </em>154 N.H. at 656; <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396 <em>et seq. </em>(2012 &amp; Supp. II 2014). Medicaid \u201cprovides joint federal and state funding for medical care for individuals who cannot afford to pay their own medical costs.\u201d <em>Arkansas Dept. of Health and Human Servs. v. Ahlborn, </em>547 U.S. 268, 275 (2006); <em>see Ramey v. Reinertson, </em>268 F.3d 955, 958 (10th Cir. 2001) (explaining that, \u201c[i]n <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>structuring the Medicaid program, Congress chose to direct [the] limited funds to persons who were most impoverished\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Because Medicaid is a \u201cprogram for low-income individuals,\u201d it requires \u201capplicants to meet certain financial eligibility criteria.\u201d <em>Appeal of Lowy, </em>156 N.H. 57, 60 (2007). \u201cGenerally, Medicaid provides assistance for two types of individuals: the categorically needy and the medically needy.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Alexander, </em>685 F.3d 325, 332 (3d Cir. 2012). The categorically needy are those who qualify for public assistance under certain federal programs. <em>See id.; see also Appeal of Huff, </em>154 N.H. 414, 416-17 (2006). \u201cThe medically needy are those who would qualify as categorically needy (because they are disabled, etc.) but whose . . . assets are substantial enough to disqualify them.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>685 F.3d at 332; <em>see Appeal of Huff </em>154 N.H. at 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u201cEvery State participating in Medicaid must provide assistance to the categorically needy.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>685 F.3d at 332. Generally, \u201cStates need not provide assistance to the medically needy.\u201d <em>Id. But see Appeal of Huff, </em>154 N.H. at 417 (explaining the circumstances under which a State is required to provide benefits to the medically needy). If States make medical assistance available to the medically needy, they are subject to various federal statutory and regulatory restrictions \u201cin determining to whom medical assistance should be extended.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>685 F.3d at 332; <em>see also Thorson v. Nebraska DHHS, </em>740 N.W.2d 27, 30 (Neb. 2007). New Hampshire makes medical assistance available to the medically needy. <em>See </em>RSA 167:6, VII (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Under federal law, only the assets that are <em>\u201cavailable </em>to the applicant\u201d are considered to determine her eligibility for Medicaid benefits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(17) (Supp. II 2014) (emphasis added); <em>see Thorson, </em>740 N.W.2d at 30-31. \u201cIf the applicant\u2019s \u2018available\u2019 assets exceed a statutory ceiling, then coverage is denied.\u201d <em>Ramey, </em>268 F.3d at 958.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\n<em>1. Prior Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Before 1986, courts \u201chad ruled in various contexts that, if an individual settled assets in an irrevocable trust and the disposition of those assets was at the discretion of a trustee, no beneficiary of the trust would have a right to call for them, and so the assets could not be considered available to the beneficiary\u201d for the purpose of determining the beneficiary\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid. <em>Cohen v. Com\u2019r of Div. of Med. Asst., </em>668 N.E.2d 769, 771 (Mass. 1996) (citing cases). Only assets that were <em>actually </em>available to the beneficiary because they had been distributed were counted toward Medicaid eligibility. <em>See id. </em>at 771 n.7; <em>see also Forsyth v. Rowe, </em>629 A.2d 379, 383 (Conn. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Accordingly, a \u201cloophole\u201d existed under the pre-1986 law, pursuant to which \u201cindividuals anticipating the need for expensive long-term medical care could impoverish themselves and qualify for [M]edicaid assistance while preserving their resources for their heirs.\u201d <em>Forsyth, </em>629 A.2d at 385. To do so, \u201c[a]n individual could place assets in an irrevocable discretionary trust that paid him the income for life until long-term medical care became necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAt that point the trustee could exercise his discretion to withhold payments to the beneficiary, thus, allowing the beneficiary to qualify for [M]edicaid assistance while preserving assets for his heirs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>By \u201cput[ting] large sums of money\u201d in an irrevocable trust, individuals were able to \u201creduc[e] (on paper) the amount of assets [they] owned.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>685 F.3d at 332. In the words of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, \u201c[t]he grantor was able to have his cake and eat it too.\u201d <em>Cohen, </em>668 N.E.2d at 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u201cCongress understandably viewed this as an abuse and began addressing the problem with statutory standards.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>685 F.3d at 332. Thus, in 1986, \u201cin response to the prevalent use of irrevocable trusts by affluent persons to qualify for Medicaid benefits,\u201d Congress enacted 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(k) (1988) (repealed 1993). <em>Ramey, </em>268 F.3d at 961; <em>see Cohen, </em>668 N.E.2d at 771-72. The purpose of Section 1896a(k) was to \u201cclose the \u2018loophole\u2019 in the Medicaid act so that assets in certain trusts would be counted in determining whether a Medicaid applicant satisfied the maximum asset requirement.\u201d <em>Boruch v. Nebraska Dept. of Health, </em>659 N.W.2d 848, 852 (Neb. Ct. App. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The trusts deemed countable for the purpose of determining an applicant\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid were called Medicaid qualifying trusts (MQTs). <em>See id. </em>at 853; <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(k). Section 1396a(k) defined an MQT as an <em>inter vivos </em>trust or similar legal device \u201cunder which the individual [applying for Medicaid benefits] may be the beneficiary of all or part of the payments from the trust and the distribution of such payments is determined by one or more trustees who are permitted to exercise any discretion with respect to the distribution to the individual.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(k)(2). The 1986 law deemed \u201cavailable\u201d to the applicant (the beneficiary) \u201cthe maximum amount that could, at the trustee\u2019s discretion, be distributed to the beneficiary\u201d from an irrevocable trust regardless of whether the funds were actually distributed. <em>Forsythe, </em>629 A.2d at 385; <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(k)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The House Committee on Energy and Commerce recommended passage of \u00a7 1396a(k), along with other provisions, with the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">The Committee feels compelled to state the obvious. Medicaid is, and always has been, a program to provide basic health coverage to people who do not have sufficient income or resources <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>to provide for themselves. When affluent individuals use Medicaid qualifying trusts and similar \u201ctechniques\u201d to qualify for the program, they are diverting scarce Federal and State resources from low-income elderly and disabled individuals, and poor women and children. This is unacceptable to the Committee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">H.R. Rep. No. 99-265, pt. 1, at 72 (1985). \u2018With the passage of \u00a7 1396a(k), MQTs were no longer a permissible means to shelter assets for purposes of Medicaid eligibility.\u201d <em>Ramey, </em>268 F.3d at 959.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\n<em>2. Current Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">In 1993, in reaction \u201cto the sophisticated instruments used to circumvent the MQT rules,\u201d Congress repealed \u00a7 1396a(k) and enacted \u00a7 1396p(d) (1993), which was aimed at \u201cmore effectively curtailing] the use of trusts or similar mechanisms to qualify for Medicaid.\u201d Regan, Comment, <em>Medicaid Estate Planning: Congress\u2019 Ersatz Solution for Long-Term Health Care, </em>44 Cath. U.L. Rev. 1217, 1233, 1239 (1995); <em>see </em>Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. No. 103-66, Title XIII \u00a7 13611(b), (d)(1)(C), (d)(1)(C), 107 Stat. 312, 624-26, 627 (1993) (OBRA); <em>see also Boruch, </em>659 N.W.2d at 853. \u201cIn the 1993 OBRA amendments, Congress established a general rule that trusts would be counted as assets for the purpose of determining Medicaid eligibility.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>685 F.3d at 333. Although \u201cCongress also excepted from that rule three types of trusts meeting certain specific requirements,\u201d <em>id., </em>none of those trusts is here at issue, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(d)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Section 1396p(d) is \u201ceven less forgiving\u201d of <em>inter vivos </em>trusts designed to shelter assets than \u00a7 1396a(k) had been. <em>Ramey, </em>268 F.3d at 959. For example, the restrictions upon the use of trusts to qualify for Medicaid \u201cnow apply without regard to the purposes for which the trust was established, whether the trustees have or exercise any discretion under the trust, or whether there are any restrictions on the making, timing, or use of distributions from the trust.\u201d <em>Miller v. SRS, </em>64 P.3d 395, 401 (Kan. 2003); <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(d)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Because the Trust at issue was established after the effective date of \u00a7 1396p(d), it is governed by that provision. <em>See Cohen, </em>668 N.E.2d at 773. Section 1396p(d)(3)(B), which pertains to irrevocable trusts, such as the Trust, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-10\">(i) <em>if there are any c ircumstances under which payment from the trust could be made to or for the benefit of the individual </em>[applying for Medicaid benefits], the portion of the corpus from which, or the income on the corpus from which, payment to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>individual could be made shall be considered resources available to the individual, and payments from that portion of the corpus or income \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">(I) to or for the benefit of the individual, shall be considered income of the individual, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-6\">(II) for any other purpose, shall be considered a transfer of assets by the individual subject to subsection (c) of this section; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-7\">(ii) any portion of the trust from which, or any income on the corpus from which, no payment could under any circumstances be made to the individual shall be considered, as of the date of establishment of the trust (or, if later, the date on which payment to the individual was foreclosed) to be assets disposed by the individual for purposes of subsection (c) of this section, and the value of the trust shall be determined for purposes of such subsection by including the amount of any payments made from such portion of the trust after such date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(d)(3)(B) (emphasis added). Thus, under the current law, \u201cif there are <em>any circumstances </em>under which payment from the trust could be made to <em>or for the benefit </em>of the\u201d applicant, then the irrevocable trust is deemed countable for the purpose of determining her eligibility for Medicaid. <em>Id. </em>(emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">\n<em>3. Applying the Current Law to the Trust</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">In determining whether the AAU erred when it upheld the determination that the Trust was includable as an asset pursuant to the current Medicaid law, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(d)(3)(B), we find informative <em>The State Medicaid Manual </em>(Manual). <em>See </em>Ctrs. for Medicare and Medicaid Servs., The State Medicaid Manual, Pub.

A \u201cpayment\u201d from a trust \u201cis any disbursal from the corpus of the trust or from income generated by the trust which benefits the party receiving it.\u201d Manual, <em>supra, </em>ch. 3, \u00a7 3259.1(A)(8) (Rev. 64). A \u201cpayment\u201d from a trust \u201cmay include actual cash, as well as noncash or property disbursements, such as the right to use and occupy real property.\u201d Manual, <em>supra, </em>ch. 3, \u00a7 3259.1(A)(8) (Rev. 64).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Section 3259.6 of the Manual defines payments made \u201cfor the benefit\u201d of the individual applying for Medicaid benefits as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\"><em>payments of any sort, including an amount </em>from the corpus or income produced by the corpus, <em>paid to another person or entity such that the individual der ives some benefit from the payment. </em>For example, such payments could include purchase of clothing or other items, such as a radio or television, for the individual. Also, such payments could include payment for services the individual may require, or care, whether medical or personal, that the individual may need. Payments to maintain a home are also payments for the benefit of the individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">Manual, <em>supra </em>ch. 3, \u00a7 3259.6(D) (Rev. 64) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">The Manual advises that \u201c[i]n determining whether payments can or cannot be made from a trust to or for an individual,\u201d one should \u201ctake into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>account any restrictions on payments, such as use restrictions, exculpatory clauses, or limits on trustee discretion that may be included in the trust.\u201d Manual, <em>supra </em>ch. 3, \u00a7 3259.6(E) (Rev. 64). The Manual also gives the following example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-5\">For example, if an irrevocable trust provides that the trustee can disburse only $1,000 to or for the individual out of a $20,000 trust, only the $1,000 is treated as a payment that could be made under the rules in [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(d)(3)(B)]. The remaining $19,000 is treated as an amount which cannot, under any circumstances, be paid to or for the benefit of the individual. On the other hand, if a trust contains $50,000 that the trustee can pay to the grantor only in the event that the grantor needs, for example, a heart transplant, this full amount is considered as payment that could be made under <em>some </em>circumstances, even though the likelihood of payment is remote. Similarly, if a payment cannot be made until some point in the distant future, it is still payment that can be made under some circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Manual, <em>supra, </em>ch. 3, \u00a7 3259.6(E) (Rev. 64) (emphasis added); <em>see Heyn v. Director of Office of Medicaid, </em>48 N.E.3d 480, 483 (Mass. App. Ct. 2016) (explaining that to meet the \u201cany circumstances\u201d test, the circumstances \u201cneed not have occurred, or even be imminent\u201d); <em>cf. Lebow v. Com\u2019r of Div. of Medical Assistance, </em>740 N.E.2d 978, 983 (Mass. 2001) (decided under 1986 law) (in examining whether the trustees were allowed to exercise any discretion in making distributions to the grantor, the court explains that \u201c[t]he issue is not whether the trustee has the authority to make payments to the grantor at a particular moment in time,\u201d but \u201c[r]ather, if there is <em>any </em>state of affairs, at <em>any </em>time during the operation of the trust, that would permit the trustee to distribute trust assets to the grantor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">With the Manual\u2019s guidance in mind, which we find persuasive, <em>see Sai Kwan Wong, </em>571 F.3d at 260-62, we examine the Trust provisions. Under the Trust, the applicant, as donor, \u201cretain[ed] at least some powers over the trust corpus,\u201d <em>Doherty v. Director of Office of Medicaid, </em>908 N.E.2d 390, 392 (Mass. App. Ct. 2009), including the powers \u201cto appoint any part or all of the undistributed income of the Trust Fund to any one or more of the Legatees\u201d and \u201cto appoint any part or all of the principal of the Trust Fund, outright or upon trusts, conditions or limitations, to any one or more of the Legatees.\u201d <em>See id. </em>In addition, the Trust reserved to the applicant, as donor, the power to require the Trustee \u201cto accumulate any or all of the income of the Trust Fund.\u201d <em>See id. </em>The Trust Agreement did not limit the applicant\u2019s ability to impose conditions upon the appointment of Trust principal to any one of the Legatees. Also, in her capacity as donor, the applicant reserved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>to herself the \u201cright to alter the order and number of the successor Trustees . . . , or to name additional Trustees or successor Trustees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In her capacity as Trustee, the applicant had even more authority. For instance, she had the \u201cuncontrolled discretion\u201d to adjust between income and principal. <em>See id. </em>at 391-92. As trustee, the applicant also had the authority, without limitation, to \u201cterminate the Trust by distributing the principal and accumulated income of the Trust Fund,\u201d if, in her judgment, she might \u201close eligibility for substantial cash benefits or medical or other services\u201d because of the Trust and if, in her judgment, \u201csuch loss of eligibility would likely necessitate expenditures from the Trust for or on [her] behalf [as the donor] at a rate expected to deplete the Trust substantially and to defeat its supplemental and long-term purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Further, although Clause 4.1.1 does not constitute a \u201clegal obligation,\u201d it evinces the applicant\u2019s general intent that Trust disbursements be used for her benefit. <em>See id. </em>at 392. That clause expresses the applicant\u2019s \u201chope\u201d that if the Trust is terminated during her lifetime, the Legatees will use Trust assets \u201cto supplement the income and the governmental benefits to which [she] may be entitled by reason of age, disability or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Additionally, once the applicant resigned as Trustee in 2008, there was nothing in the Trust Agreement to preclude her from requiring her children, as a condition of their receipt of the Trust principal, to use those funds for her benefit. After the applicant\u2019s resignation, the only limitation under the Trust Agreement was that <em>David </em>could not make a distribution that benefitted <em>him </em>personally or \u201canyone whom [he] ha[d] a legal obligation to support.\u201d The petitioner observes that David had no obligation to support the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Although the petitioner argues otherwise, the fact that the applicant was not a Trust beneficiary is not dispositive. In contrast to the pre-1993 law, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(k), an irrevocable trust is a countable asset under the current law even when the applicant is not a beneficiary, provided that there are \u201cany circumstances under which payment from the trust could be made . . . for the benefit of the [applicant],\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(d)(3)(B)(i). Given the Trust\u2019s provisions and the specific facts of this case, we hold that the AAU lawfully and reasonably concluded that there were circumstances under which payment from the Trust could be made to benefit the applicant. <em>See Petition of Maxi Drug, </em>154 N.H. at 655-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">The cases from New York upon which the petitioner relies to argue for a different result are distinguishable. <em>See Verdow ex rel. Meyer v. Sutkowy, </em>209 F.R.D. 309, 310 (N.D.N.Y. 2002); <em>Spetz v. New York State Dept. of Health, </em>737 N.Y.S.2d 524 (Sup. Ct. 2002). The issue in both cases was whether the grantor\u2019s retained power to change the trust beneficiaries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>made the trusts \u201cavailable\u201d for the purpose of determining Medicaid eligibility. <em>See Verdow, </em>209 F.R.D. at 315-16; <em>Spetz, </em>737 N.Y.S.2d at 525-26. Under a New York statute, \u201cany trust can be revoked, provided that all beneficiaries consent, in writing, to the revocation.\u201d <em>Verdow, </em>209 F.R.D. at 315; <em>see Spetz, </em>737 N.Y.S.2d at 526. The appellate argument in both cases was that the grantors could use their retained power to change beneficiaries to individuals who were amenable to revoking the trusts, and, therefore, that the trusts were actually revocable and available for Medicaid eligibility purposes. <em>Verdow, </em>209 F.R.D. at 315; <em>Spetz, </em>737 N.Y.S.2d at 526. The courts in both cases rejected the argument, finding that the claim that the grantor would collude with the beneficiaries in this way was speculative. <em>Verdow, </em>209 F.R.D. at 316; <em>Spetz, </em>737 N.Y.S.2d at 526-27. Both courts declined to conclude that the speculative possibility of collusion rendered the trusts revocable, and, therefore, \u201cavailable\u201d to the grantors for the purpose of determining Medicaid eligibility. <em>Verdow, </em>209 F.R.D. at 316; <em>Spetz, </em>737 N.Y.S.2d at 526-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">In this case, unlike <em>Verdow </em>and <em>Spetz, </em>there is no dispute that the Trust is an irrevocable trust. Moreover, unlike the grantors in <em>Verdow </em>and <em>Spetz, </em>the applicant in this case retained broad powers over the Trust, in her capacity both as donor and as Trustee, including the power to make a distribution to a legatee conditioned upon that legatee using the distribution for the applicant\u2019s benefit. In addition, although there is no evidence of collusion in this case, collusion is arguably encouraged by Clause 4.1.1, which provides that, in the event that the Trust\u2019s existence disqualifies the applicant for Medicaid benefits, the applicant \u201csuggests\u201d that the Trust be terminated and that the Legatees (her children) use Trust assets \u201cto supplement the income and ... governmental benefits and services to which [she] may be entitled.\u201d By virtue of these provisions and others, the circumstances under which payments from the Trust could be made to benefit the applicant in this case are not \u201centirely speculative,\u201d <em>Verdow, </em>209 F.R.D. at 316, but, rather, are specifically anticipated under the Trust Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In a motion to submit late authority, the petitioner relies upon <em>Heyn, </em>48 N.E.3d 480. Although we grant the petitioner\u2019s motion to submit <em>Heyn </em>for our review, we do not find it persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">In <em>Heyn, </em>the trust corpus consisted of the applicant\u2019s former residence in which she retained a life estate. <em>Heyn, </em>48 N.E.3d at 482. At some point after the trust was created, the applicant moved into a skilled nursing facility, where she lived until her death in 2013. <em>Id. </em>The state agency had found the applicant ineligible for Medicaid benefits because her former residence was countable as an asset and exceeded the allowable limit. <em>Id. </em>A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>hearing officer had upheld that decision, and, ultimately, the appellate court reversed the hearing officer\u2019s ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 482-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Whether the applicant\u2019s life estate rendered her ineligible for Medicaid benefits was not an issue in the appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 482 n.3. Nor was there a question concerning the applicant\u2019s receipt of income from the trust. <em>Id. </em>at 485 n.11. The sole issue in the case was whether trust principal was countable as an asset for the purpose of determining the applicant\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid. <em>See id. </em>at 483-84. The hearing officer had reasoned, in part, that because the trust allowed the applicant to appoint all or any part of the trust principal to her issue, free of trust, she \u201ccould direct conveyance of the trust property to one of her children, who could in turn convey it to her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486. In rejecting this reasoning, the court explained that a provision that makes \u201ctrust principal available to persons other than the [applicant] does not by its nature make it available to the [applicant].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\"><em>Heyn </em>is distinguishable from this case. Unlike the Trust here, the trust in <em>Heyn </em>expressly precluded the trustee from distributing any part or all of the principal to the applicant. <em>Id. </em>at 484 n.8. Moreover, unlike the Trust in this case, which conceivably allows the applicant to condition a distribution to a Legatee upon that Legatee using the distribution for her benefit, the trust in <em>Heyn </em>did not authorize the applicant to impose any conditions upon the appointment of principal to her issue. <em>See id. </em>at 486. Further, Clause 4.1.1 of the Trust in this case evinces the applicant\u2019s general intent that Trust disbursements be used for her benefit, <em>see Doherty, </em>908 N.E.2d at 392; there is no indication that the trust in <em>Heyn </em>contained a similar clause. Nor is there any evidence that the applicant in <em>Heyn </em>was ever one of the trust\u2019s trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Finally, the petitioner argues that our decision in <em>Appeal of Lowy </em>is dispositive. The trust in that case was a \u201cspecial needs trust.\u201d <em>Appeal of Lowy, </em>156 N.H. at 58. Such trusts fall within the exception to the general rule that trusts are counted as assets for the purpose of determining Medicaid eligibility. <em>See Lewis, </em>685 F.3d at 333; <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1896p(d)(4). Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(d)(4)(A), a State must exclude a special needs trust as an asset in eligibility determinations \u201conly if, among other considerations, the state will be repaid from the trust\u2019s corpus upon the beneficiary\u2019s death for medical assistance provided to the beneficiary during his lifetime.\u201d <em>Appeal of Lowy, </em>156 N.H. at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">The primary issue in <em>Appeal of Lowy </em>was whether the \u201cpayback provision\u201d in the special needs trust was sufficient under federal law to render the trust not countable as an asset. <em>See id. </em>at 58-59. The trust\u2019s payback provision stated that, upon the beneficiary\u2019s death, any amounts remaining in the trust estate were to be paid to the State \u201cto the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>required by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and emphasis omitted). The AAU had found that the phrase \u201cto the extent required by law\u201d impermissibly conditioned \u201cthe obligation to repay on the future existence of an independent legal requirement of repayment, which might not occur,\u201d and, therefore, because the trust did \u201cnot contain the unconditional repayment obligation required for exclusion,\u201d the trust was countable as an asset. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We disagreed. <em>See id. </em>at 61-62. We concluded that to construe the phrase \u201cas referencing anything other than a general requirement that the promise contained in the payback provision be construed in accordance with the law would require us to ignore the settlors\u2019 clear intent,\u201d which was to create a trust that qualified for exclusion under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(d)(4)(A). <em>Id. </em>at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The petitioner contends that, consistent with <em>Lowy, </em>we must interpret the Trust at issue to \u201cgive[ ] meaning to the intention! ] of the [applicant]... to keep the Trust assets out of inclusion as countable Medicaid resources.\u201d This we cannot do. The issue of whether the Trust assets are countable for the purpose of determining the applicant\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid is governed by federal law. Contrary to the petitioner\u2019s assertions, to determine whether there were circumstances under which payment from the Trust could have been made for the applicant\u2019s benefit, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(d)(3)(B)(i), we have not \u201cventured into the land of melodramas and fantasy,\u201d but rather, we have examined the record in the case and interpreted the Trust\u2019s provisions consistent with their plain meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Although it might be argued that the provisions upon which we rely \u201care, at most, economically meaningless administrative boilerplate, that... do not confer upon the trustees any discretionary authority to invade principal for [the applicant\u2019s] benefit, ... we remain unconvinced that [the Legatees were] unable, in any reasonably foreseeable circumstance, to invade trust assets for [her] benefit.\u201d <em>Doherty, </em>908 N.E.2d at 392. \u201cWhen considered as a whole, what strikes us most strongly is that [the Trust] constitutes a remarkably fluid legal vehicle, intelligently structured to provide both [the applicant] and the trustee[ ] maximum flexibility to respond to [her] changing life needs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this light, we cannot say that the AAU\u2019s conclusion that the Trust constitutes a \u201ccountable asset\u201d for the purpose of determining the applicant\u2019s Medicaid eligibility is infirm as a matter of law. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">\n<em>III. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Given the facts of this case, we cannot say that there are <em>no </em>circumstances under which payments from the Trust could be made \u201cfor the benefit\u201d of the applicant. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p(d)(3)(B)(i); <em>see Doherty, </em>908 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>N.E.2d at 392. \u201cFinally, we take this opportunity to stress that we have no doubt that self-settled, irrevocable trusts may, if so structured, so insulate trust assets that those assets will be deemed unavailable to the settlor.\u201d <em>Doherty, </em>908 N.E.2d at 393. The Trust in this case is not such a vehicle. In our view, the Trust, as structured, allows the applicant \u201ca degree of discretionary authority that would . . . permit [her] to enjoy her assets, preserve those assets for her heirs, and receive public assistance, to, in effect, have her cake and eat it too.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted). Congress has declared a contrary intent \u2014 \u201cthat Medicaid benefits be made available only to those who genuinely lack sufficient resources to provide for themselves.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe perceive no reason in this case to deviate from that mandate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\n<em>Petition denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b276-6\">Hicks, Conboy, Lynn, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
