Admin. Rules, Lab 510.08. On appeal, he argues that the CAB erred by: (1) finding that his physical condition had improved since he sustained the original, compensable, work-related injury; (2) determining that the change in his physical condition affected his earning capacity; and (8) failing to make specific findings of fact and rulings of law sufficient to allow meaningful appellate review. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The relevant facts follow. The claimant is approximately 48 years old. He completed the 11th grade and has a high school equivalency diploma. He has worked as a mechanic for most of his working life. He was a marine mechanic for approximately 20 years before becoming employed full-time by respondent MB Tractor <em>&amp; </em>Equipment (the employer), in July 2011, to do heavy equipment repair. On February 18, 2014, the claimant sustained a work-related, compensable injury. On that day, he injured his back while working on an excavator using a large wrench and a blow torch. He continued working that day and for the rest of the week, left work for treatment in early March, and, subsequently, was released to work with modifications. The claimant left work again in late April 2014 because of pain. Thereafter, he began receiving indemnity benefits from respondent Acadia Insurance Company (the carrier) at the temporary total disability rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The claimant\u2019s injury was diagnosed as a lumbar strain with \u201cleft sided radiculitis.\u201d An April 2014 MRI showed that he had a \u201cprominent left posterolateral/foraminal disc protrusion\u201d at the L8-L4 inter-vertebral disc space, causing \u201clikely mass effect upon the left L4 nerve root,\u201d \u201cdisc desiccation .. . consistent with some degenerative disease\u201d at L4-L5, and a \u201csmall porta hepatis protrusion with associated annular tear,\u201d also at L4-L5. A second MRI in May 2015 showed that the claimant has \u201ca small to moderate sized posterolateral left-sided disc herniation\u201d at L8-L4 and \u201ca degenerating mildly bulging disc annulus with a superimposed relatively small posterolateral right-sided disc herniation\u201d at L4-L5.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">From April 2014 to September 2015, the claimant saw several providers and received epidural steroid injections, \u201clumbar medial branch blocks,\u201d physical therapy, group therapy, acupuncture, and opiate narcotics, all to no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Three doctors have evaluated him for surgery and have opined that surgery is not indicated. The last such evaluation was conducted by Anthony Salerni, M.D. in June 2015. Based upon the May 2015 MRI, Salerni observed that the claimant did not have any \u201csevere nerve compression, so [a] simple discectomy would not help him.\u201d Salerni noted that the claimant has continued \u201cto have refractory low back pain,\u201d which Salerni attributed to the claimant\u2019s original work injury. The claimant\u2019s only surgical option, Salerni noted, was \u201cfusion\u201d; however, because the claimant is taking \u201chigh dose narcotics\u201d and is \u201cdeconditioned,\u201d Salerni did not consider him a candidate for surgery at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The claimant undeiwent two independent medical examinations (IMEs) by David B. Lewis, D.O. <em>See </em>RSA281-A:38 (Supp. 2016). The first IME was in November 2014; the second IME was in June 2015. In the first IME, Lewis diagnosed the claimant with \u201c[l]umbosacral, facet, sacroiliac, piriformis strain\u201d and assessed his pain complaints as \u201csubjective.\u201d Lewis observed that the claimant has a \u201cheightened pain response\u201d and that he exhibited \u201cWaddell signs.\u201d The respondents define \u201cWaddell signs\u201d as \u201c[a]ny group of clinical tests occasionally used to identify patients whose back pain is not organic, i.e. more likely to be of psychological origin.\u201d Lewis further observed that his physical examination of the claimant did \u201cnot show any sort of neurological deficit\u201d and that \u201cthe findings on the MRI are mostly mild.\u201d Lewis opined that the claimant \u201cis so focused on his pain that he is not allowing himself to improve his stability,\u201d which makes \u201cthe situation worse.\u201d Following the first IME, Lewis determined that the claimant could work \u201cfull time, lifting . . . 15-20# occasionally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">In the second IME, Lewis noted that the \u201cWaddell signs\u201d were \u201cworsening.\u201d He opined that the claimant\u2019s current treatment, which is \u201cessentially medications including ... an escalating dose of narcotics without true improvement,\u201d is not working and that the narcotics should be discontinued. Lewis observed that the claimant was exhibiting \u201cgreater pain behaviors without evidence [of] true neurological deficits.\u201d Lewis found the claimant to be at maximum medical improvement, capable of full-time light duty work, \u201clifting in the 15-20# range occasionally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Other clinicians who have examined the claimant have concurred with some of Lewis\u2019s findings and observations. For instance, Peter J. Dirksmeier, M.D., who evaluated the claimant for surgery in July 2014, observed that the claimant\u2019s \u201cWaddell\u2019s test was positive,\u201d that the \u201c[s]traight leg raise [did] not elicit pain when [the claimant was] distracted,\u201d and that \u201c[o]verreaction to stimulus [was] present.\u201d Dirksmeier made identical observations when he evaluated the claimant for surgery again in August 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Similarly, the claimant\u2019s treating physician, Nathan Jorgensen, M.D., opined in December 2014 that \u201ca majority of [the claimant\u2019s] problem[s] [are] [his] psychological] unwillingness to work through the pain and to get beyond the pain itself.\u201d Jorgensen noted that the \u201csignificant psychological overl[a]y\u201d to the claimant\u2019s physical condition \u201cseems to be inhibiting his recovery.\u201d In January 2015, Jorgensen observed that although the claimant\u2019s back pain \u201ctruly seems to be disabling him completely,\u201d the MRI, taken in April 2014, \u201cis not particularly concordant with the amount of pain that he has.\u201d Jorgensen stated that there \u201chas been discussion by other practitioners that [the claimant] has extremely poor coping skills and that may explain his inability to work with his pain.\u201d Jorgensen opined that the claimant is unable \u201cto psychologically deal with the back pain\u201d and that he has \u201cpain magnification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The respondents initiated workers\u2019 compensation proceedings in April 2015, requesting a hearing \u201con the issue of the claimant\u2019s ongoing eligibility for weekly indemnity benefits,\u201d based, in part, upon the work release provided by Lewis in November 2014. A department of labor hearing officer held a hearing on the respondents\u2019 request in June 2015. In July, the hearing officer ruled in favor of the respondents. The hearing officer explained that the respondents sought either to terminate the claimant\u2019s weekly indemnity benefits, or to reduce the rate at which his benefits are paid from the temporary total disability rate to the diminished earning capacity rate. The hearing officer stated that \u201c[i]n a request to reduce or terminate workers\u2019 compensation indemnity benefits, the carrier [or employer] bears the burden of proof to demonstrate that such a reduction or termination is warranted by a change in condition.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:48, I. The hearing officer impliedly found a change in the claimant\u2019s physical condition based, in part, upon the work release provided by Lewis in November 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Having found a change in condition, the hearing officer then determined that \u201c[b]ased on the claimant\u2019s testimony, educational background, work history, and the work release provided by Dr. Lewis, and the lack of evidence of work opportunity,\u201d the claimant was still entitled to compensation, but only at the diminished earning capacity rate. <em>See </em>N.H. Admin. Rules, Lab 510.03 (defining the diminished earning capacity rate of benefits for a \u201cpartially disabled person\u201d that applies \u201cin the absence of work opportunity and on the basis of medical and other evidence\u201d). As a result of the hearing officer\u2019s decision, the claimant\u2019s benefits were reduced from the temporary total disability rate to the diminished earning capacity rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">The claimant appealed the hearing officer\u2019s decision to the CAB, which conducted a <em>de novo </em>hearing in November 2015 at which the claimant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>the sole witness. Based upon its review of the claimant\u2019s testimony and the submitted medical records, the CAB found that \u201cthe claimant has a work release and is not totally disabled.\u201d The CAB observed that the claimant \u201cis not a surgical candidate\u201d and that \u201cthere are no anatomic issues that have been found during objective testing.\u201d The CAB stated that \u201c[t]he claim that [the claimant] is totally disabled is completely based on [his] subjective feelings and are [sic] not upheld by any objective findings.\u201d The CAB determined that the claimant \u201ccontinues to be eligible for the Diminished Earning Capacity rate of compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The claimant moved for rehearing, asserting that the CAB\u2019s decision failed to identify any change in his physical condition or his economic condition sufficient to justify paying him benefits at the diminished earning capacity rate, instead of at the temporary total disability rate. The claimant also challenged the CAB\u2019s finding that he is no longer totally disabled, observing that \u201c[evidence of a work release or work capacity does not establish that [he] is no longer classified as totally disabled.\u201d The claimant also argued that the CAB\u2019s findings were insufficient as a matter of law because they were conclusory. The CAB denied the claimant\u2019s motion, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Our standard of review is established by statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">[T]he burden of proof shall be upon the party seeking to set aside any order or decision of the [CAB] to show that the same is clearly unreasonable or unlawful, and all findings of the [CAB] upon all questions of fact properly before it shall be deemed to be prima facie lawful and reasonable; and the order or decision appealed from shall not be set aside or vacated except for errors of law, unless the court is satisfied, by a clear preponderance of the evidence before it, that such order is unjust or unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">RSA 541:18 (2007); <em>see </em>RSA 281-A:48, 1(c) (2010) (\u201cAny party in interest aggrieved by any order or decision of the [CAB] may appeal to the supreme court pursuant to RSA 541.\u201d). \u201cThus, we review the factual findings of the CAB deferentially,\u201d and \u201cits statutory interpretation <em>de novo.\" Appeal of Phillips, </em>165 N.H. 226, 230 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">The parties agree that this case is governed by RSA 281-A:48, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-10\">I.

The parties also agree that the respondents\u2019 theory in this case is that there was a \u201cchange in conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">\u201cThe initial test for determining whether a claimant is entitled to compensation is whether the worker is now able to earn, in suitable work under normal employment conditions, as much as he or she earned at the time of injury.\u201d <em>Appeal of Carnahan, </em>160 N.H. 73, 79 (2010) (quotation omitted). To <em>terminate </em>a claimant\u2019s benefits based upon a change of conditions related to his or her ability to perform work, the carrier or employer must demonstrate that the claimant\u2019s physical condition has improved such that he or she is \u201cnow able to earn, in suitable work under normal employment conditions, as much as he or she earned at the time of injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted); <em>see Appeal of Hiscoe, </em>147 N.H. 223, 231 (2001) (distinguishing between what must be proved to terminate benefits because the claimant is able to return to work and what must be proved to terminate benefits because the claimant\u2019s disability is no longer causally related to her workplace injury). In other words, to terminate a claimant\u2019s benefits based upon his or her ability to perform work, a carrier or employer must show that the claimant has regained his or her previous \u201cearning capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">\u201cEarning capacity\u201d refers to a claimant\u2019s ability to compete in the labor market. <em>Appeal of Woodmansee, </em>150 N.H. 63, 68 (2003). It is \u201can objective measure of a worker\u2019s ability to earn wages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Determining a claimant\u2019s earning capacity requires considering \u201cthe worker\u2019s overall value in the marketplace, taking into account such variables as his age, education and job training.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation, brackets, and ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">However, on appeal, the respondents explain that they no longer seek to terminate the claimant\u2019s compensation, but rather seek to reduce the rate at which his benefits are paid. To <em>reduce </em>a claimant\u2019s compensation, the carrier or employer need not show that the claimant is \u201cnow able to earn, in suitable work under normal employment conditions, as much as he or she earned at the time of injury.\u201d <em>Appeal of Carnahan, </em>160 N.H. at 80 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>The claimant first argues that the CAB erred when it found that his physical condition has improved. He contends that \u201cthe evidence from his treating physicians was that his condition had become worse.\u201d \u201cIn reviewing the CAB\u2019s findings, our task is not to determine whether we would have found differently than did the CAB, or to reweigh the evidence, but rather to determine whether the findings are supported by competent evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Appeal of Phillips, </em>165 N.H. at 235 (quotation and brackets omitted). \u201cThe CAB\u2019s findings of fact will not be disturbed if they are supported by competent evidence in the record, upon which the CAB\u2019s decision reasonably could have been made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Here, the IMEs conducted by Lewis, together with (1) the opinion of Dirksmeier that the claimant was positive for Waddell signs and could do the straight leg raise when distracted, (2) the December 2014 opinion of Jorgensen that the claimant had significant psychological overlay, and (3) Jorgensen\u2019s January 2015 examination of the claimant after which he concluded that the MRI was not concordant with the amount of pain that the claimant experiences, support the CAB\u2019s finding that the claimant\u2019s physical condition has improved. Thus, because the CAB\u2019s finding that the claimant\u2019s physical condition has improved is supported by competent evidence in the record, we uphold it. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Alternatively, the claimant asserts that, \u201c[ajside from his age, education and entire work history as a mechanic, the only evidence in the record pertaining to [his] ability to compete in the labor market was his testimony that he had not looked for other work because he wanted to return to his job with MB Tractor [&amp; Equipment].\u201d In this way, the claimant implies that evidence of his work capacity, age, education, and \u201centire work history\u201d is insufficient to establish that he has a diminished earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">To the contrary, we have held that evidence of a claimant\u2019s work capacity, age, education, and job training is relevant to determine whether he has regained his prior earning capacity. <em>See Appeal of Carnahan, </em>160 N.H. at 80; <em>see also Appeal of Woodmansee, </em>150 N.H. at 68. We have also held that a carrier or employer \u201cgenerally does not need to rely upon expert testimony\u201d to establish a claimant\u2019s earning capacity, although such testimony is required \u201cwhen, due to a claimant\u2019s job skills and education, the determination as to whether he . . . can compete in the open labor market is beyond the ken of the CAB.\u201d <em>Appeal of CNA Ins. Co., </em>148 N.H. 317, 324 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">The claimant has not argued, and we cannot conclude as a matter of law, that, because of his job skills and education, the determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>whether he is able to compete in the open labor market is beyond the ken of the CAB. <em>See id. </em>Thus, the CAB was entitled to rely upon its own judgment to determine whether the claimant now has a diminished earning capacity, given the evidence of his work capacity, age, education, and job training. Moreover, we hold that such evidence was sufficient to support the CAB\u2019s finding that the claimant has a diminished earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Finally, the claimant argues that the CAB\u2019s decision is flawed as a matter of law because it contains insufficient findings of fact and rulings of law to permit meaningful judicial review. <em>See Appeal of Kehoe, </em>139 N.H. 24, 27 (1994). RSA 541-A:35 (2007) requires an agency decision to \u201cinclude findings of fact and conclusions of law, separately stated.\u201d In this case, although the CAB\u2019s decision is not a paragon of clarity, we conclude that it sets forth specific findings of fact and rulings of law sufficient to permit appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The claimant faults the CAB for failing to make a finding of a change in conditions and because it \u201cmade no analysis or findings with respect to [his] earning capacity.\u201d Although the CAB did not use the phrase \u201cchange in conditions,\u201d it found that the claimant was no longer \u201ctotally disabled.\u201d This finding is akin to a finding that the claimant\u2019s physical condition has improved. Similarly, the CAB\u2019s findings that the claimant \u201chas a work release\u201d and that he \u201ccontinues to be eligible for the Diminished Earning Capacity rate of compensation\u201d are equivalent to a finding that the claimant has a diminished earning capacity. <em>Cf. Appeal of Carnahan, </em>160 N.H. at 80-81 (determining that CAB\u2019s findings that the claimant no longer had his prior earning capacity and that he was capable of gainful employment were tantamount to a finding that the claimant had a diminished earning capacity).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">The claimant also faults the CAB because it \u201cfailed to explain how it may have adopted the opinion of Dr. Lewis over all the other medical providers, nor [sic] how it may have resolved the conflicting claims with respect to Dr. Jorgensen\u201d and because it \u201cdid not say or intimate that [the claimant] was not credible or that it disbelieved his testimony.\u201d However, such findings are not necessary to permit meaningful judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b713-9\">Hicks, Conboy, and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
