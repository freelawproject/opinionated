We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">The pertinent facts follow. Enacted in 1963, RSA chapter 195-A allows the establishment of Authorized Regional Enrollment Area (AREA) schools. <em>See </em>Laws 1963, ch. 277. The purpose of the statute is \u201cto increase educational opportunities within the state by encouraging the establishment of area schools in the receiving districts which will serve the receiving district and the sending districts throughout a natural social and economic region ... to permit efficient use of such area school facilities and to provide improved instruction.\u201d RSA 195-A:2, I (2008). The statute sets forth detailed procedures for establishing an AREA plan, <em>see </em>RSA 195-A:3 (Supp. 2015), and for the periodic review of AREA plans and withdrawal of districts from the AREA, <em>see </em>RSA 195-A: 14 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">Under the statute, an \u201c \u2018[a]rea school\u2019 \u201d is defined as \u201can authorized regional enrollment area school, which may be elementary or secondary, and which when approved . . . shall be the assigned school for all the resident elementary or secondary pupils of the school districts or portions thereof within the region which it is established to serve.\u201d RSA 195-A:1, IV (2008). A \u201c \u2018[s]ending district\u2019 \u201d is defined as \u201cany school district or portion thereof which sends its resident pupils to an area school located in a receiving district, paying tuition therefor to the receiving district.\u201d RSA 195-A:1, V (2008). A \u201c \u2018[r]eceiving district\u2019 \u201d is defined as \u201ca school district in which an area school is located.\u201d RSA 195-A:1, VI (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">An AREA plan must include, among other things, a formula for the calculation of tuition. RSA 195-A:3, V(d) (Supp. 2015). \u201c \u2018Tuition\u2019 \u201d is defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>as \u201cthe sum of money which each sending district is obligated to pay to the receiving district to defray the cost of education\u201d and \u201cmay include an annual rental charge per pupil.\u201d RSA 195-A:1, IX (2008). \u201c\u2018Annual rental charge per pupil\u2019 \u201d is defined as \u201cthat additional payment included in tuition . . . which represents a fair charge for building occupancy. It may also include a fair charge for any debt service and reduction of principal, which may become due between date of bond issue and date of building occupancy.\u201d RSA 195-A:1, X (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">In 1971, Goffstown, Dunbarton, and the New Boston School District entered into a written AREA plan pursuant to which Goffstown was designated the receiving school district and Dunbarton and New Boston were designated the sending school districts. The plan established an annual tuition rate that included a rental charge of two percent. At the time the parties entered into this AREA plan, the statute did not require that an AREA plan contain a term of duration. <em>See </em>Laws 1969; 347:2.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">In 1998, the Goffstown Building Needs Study Committee recommended a $10 million plan for renovations and additions to the Goffstown High School and the development of plans for an additional elementary school. The Goffstown school board decided to delay putting the question to public vote for one year. In 1999, a similar renovation plan was recommended by the committee but it was defeated in March 2000. Thereafter, a High School Building Study Committee was formed and, subsequently, it proposed an $11,995,000 plan to renovate Goffstown High School.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">In November 2000, a written memorandum was sent on behalf of the Goffstown School Board to the school boards of Dunbarton and New Boston, notifying them that \u201cthe Goffstown School District will be proposing a building project at the March 2001 School District Meeting. The total cost of the project is $11,995,000. The Board is proposing a 20-year bond. The project encompasses renovations and additions to the Goffstown AREA High School.\u201d In March 2001, Goffstown voters authorized the Goffstown School District to issue bonds to raise $11,995,000 for the \u201cRenovation/Addition Project\u201d for the Goffstown AREA High School. <em>See </em>RSA 195-A:7 (2008) (\u201c[T]he construction of additions or alterations to existing buildings ... shall be the responsibility of the receiving district_ A receiving district may borrow money for such purposes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">In 1999, the legislature amended RSA chapter 195-A to require that AREA plans have a minimum term of 10 years \u201cunless otherwise provided by mutual agreement of the school districts.\u201d Laws 1999, 15:1. Accordingly, in January 2004, Goffstown, Dunbarton, and New Boston agreed to a new written AREA plan to replace the 1971 plan. The 2004 AREA plan established a term of 10 years, with July 1, 2004 as the start date. Among other things, the plan established an annual tuition rate that included a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>rental charge of two and one-half percent effective July 1, 2005, to be recalculated based upon appraisals of the Goffstown middle school and high school buildings \u201cperformed every five years commencing in 2008.\u201d The plan provided that \u201c[o]n the effective date of this Agreement, any former AREA agreements between Goffstown, New Boston and Dunbarton shall become void.\u201d In April 2004, the Board certified that the plan was \u201clawfully adopted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Before the 2014 expiration of the parties\u2019 AREA plan, an AREA planning review board, comprised of representatives from each of the three participating school districts, reviewed the 2004 plan and discussed possible amendments to be included in a new plan. <em>See </em>RSA 195-A: 14, I. The review board subsequently submitted a proposed AREA plan that, with the Board\u2019s approval, would be voted upon in all three districts at the 2018 annual school district meetings. In January 2018, the Board approved the amended AREA plan. At the same time, the Board approved a plan to form a new AREA school designating Bow as the receiving district and Dunbarton as the sending district. Dunbarton and Bow voters approved the Dunbarton/Bow AREA plan, and Dunbarton voters rejected the amended Goffstown/Dunbarton/New Boston AREA plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">In January 2014, Goffstown requested a hearing before the Board to determine Dunbarton\u2019s remaining obligation on the 2001 bond. At a pre-hearing conference, the parties agreed to submit memoranda on the legal issue of whether Dunbarton \u201cis or is not responsible for capital costs after the expiration of the AREA Agreement.\u201d After reviewing the parties\u2019 written submissions, the hearing officer determined that, upon receiving notice from Goffstown in 2001 that it was going to renovate and make additions to the high school and was proposing a 20-year bond to finance the project, Dunbarton was required, pursuant to RSA 195-A:14, VI, to initiate a withdrawal study four months before the vote or it would remain obligated on the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The hearing officer reasoned that, \u201c[b]y initiating the withdrawal study, Dunbarton would have put Goffstown on notice prior to the bond as to the potential additional financial risk on the bond without Dunbarton remaining part of the AREA.\u201d Thus, although the 2004 AREA plan expired June 30, 2014, \u201cDunbarton was clearly on notice back in 2001 that there was a twenty (20) year bond, and had the opportunity to initiate a withdrawal study at that point in time so that Goffstown would be on notice of the possible financial ramifications of Dunbarton withdrawing from the AREA.\u201d Accordingly, the hearing officer recommended that the Board find that Dunbarton remains financially obligated with respect to the high school construction bond. The Board voted to accept the hearing officer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>report and adopted his recommendation. Dunbarton\u2019s request for reconsideration was denied, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\n<em>II. Standard of Re view</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">RSA chapter 541 governs our review of Board decisions. <em>See </em>RSA 21-N:11, III (2012). Under RSA 541:13, a party seeking to set aside a decision of the Board has the burden of demonstrating that the decision \u201cis clearly unreasonable or unlawful.\u201d RSA 541:13 (2007). We will not disturb the Board\u2019s decision, except for errors of law, unless we are satisfied, by a clear preponderance of the evidence before us, that it is \u201cunjust or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Board\u2019s findings of fact are presumed <em>jrrima fade </em>lawful and reasonable. <em>Id. </em>We review the Board\u2019s rulings on issues of law <em>de novo. See Appeal of Hillsborough County Nursing Home, </em>166 N.H. 731, 733 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">To resolve the issues before us, we must engage in statutory interpretation. The interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. Favazza v. Braley, </em>160 N.H. 349, 351 (2010). In matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiters of the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>Id. </em>In construing its meaning, we first examine the language found in the statute, and when possible, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to the words used. <em>Id. </em>We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include. <em>Strike Four v. Nissan N. Am., </em>164 N.H. 729, 735 (2013). We interpret statutory provisions in the context of the overall statutory scheme. <em>Favazza, </em>160 N.H. at 351. Absent an ambiguity, we will not look beyond the language of the statute to discern legislative intent. <em>See New Hampshire Health Care Assoc. v. Governor, </em>161 N.H. 378, 385 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">\n<em>III. RSA Chapter 195-A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">The parties agree that three statutory provisions are dispositive of the issues raised on appeal: RSA 195-A:14, V and VI, and RSA 195-A:3, XI. Paragraph XI of RSA 195-A:3 is part of the procedure for establishing an AREA school. Under that procedure, a written AREA plan must be prepared and must include, among other things, \u201c[t]he term of the agreement, which shall be for a minimum of 10 years unless otherwise provided by mutual agreement of the school districts consistent with the provisions of RSA 195-A:3, XI.\u201d RSA 195-A:3, V(n). Paragraph XI, in turn, provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-10\">[a]n area plan . . . shall be valid for a minimum of 10 years unless otherwise provided by mutual agreement of the school districts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>The area plan may be renegotiated at the request of a sending or receiving district or extended for additional 10-year periods upon a mutual vote of each sending and receiving school district legislative body 2 years prior to the expiration of the area plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">RSA 195-A:3, XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Paragraphs V and VI of RSA 195-A: 14 concern the \u201cReview of Area Plan and Withdrawal of Districts.\u201d RSA 195-A:14 (bolding omitted). Pursuant to RSA 195-A:14, \u201c[a]fter the third anniversary of the date of operating responsibility,\u201d either a sending or receiving district \u201cmay vote to undertake a study of the feasibility and suitability of a withdrawal from the area.\u201d RSA 195-A:14, III. A study committee must be formed and, within 180 days, submit a report to the Board \u201cthat withdrawal is not feasible or suitable or a report that includes a withdrawal plan prepared in accordance with paragraph IV.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A plan for the withdrawal of a district from an AREA must include, among other things, \u201c[t]he liability of the withdrawing district for its share of any outstanding indebtedness of the area in accordance with paragraph V.\u201d RSA 195-A: 14, IV(c). Paragraph V, in turn, provides that \u201c[e]ach withdrawing sending district shall remain liable to the area, or to the receiving district in the case of dissolution of the area, for a rental charge, as determined by the area agreement, for the length of any outstanding bond issue.\u201d RSA 195-A: 14, V.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Under RSA 195-A:14, four months before a vote on a bond issue for construction of new facilities or additions to an AREA school, a receiving district must notify a sending district of such pending vote, and the sending district may thereafter \u201cinitiate a withdrawal study.\u201d RSA 195-A:14, VI. If the sending district does so and the voters in the sending district approve the withdrawal plan, \u201cthe sending district shall not be further obligated to any bonded indebtedness as a result of such bond issue.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">\n<em>TV. Appellate Arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Dunbarton argues that RSA chapter 195-A \u201cenvisions two possible endings to an area relationship: (1) withdrawal by one party; and (2) expiration of the area agreement.\u201d It contends that \u201c[e]ach method of termination is distinct and creates different consequences for the contracting parties.\u201d According to Dunbarton, withdrawal \u201coccurs during the term of an area plan,\u201d and because of \u201cthe potential consequences to students of termination mid-stream in the term of an area plan, the statute lays out a detailed and deliberate process and requires Board input before withdrawal or dissolution may occur.\u201d By contrast, \u201c[e]xpiration . . . occurs simply because an area plan reaches its term.\u201d That is what occurred with respect to the 2004 plan, \u201cand the parties neither contracted for, nor does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>the statute impose, any post-termination obligations upon either party.\u201d Thus, Dunbarton argues, \u201cit is only where an area relationship terminates . . . before the end of its term through \u2018withdrawal\u2019 that the statute imposes liability for payments on outstanding bond issues\u201d pursuant to RSA 195-A:14, V. Consequently, \u201c[t]he Board unlawfully and unreasonably categorized Dunbarton as a \u2018withdrawing\u2019 sending district because Dunbarton never withdrew; instead, the 2004 Contract expired by its terms and with it, any further obligation for Dunbarton to pay Goffstown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Goffstown argues that the Board \u201cproperly gave effect to the plain language of RSA 195-A:14, VI, which sets forth the clear statutory duty of a sending district to initiate a withdrawal study prior to a receiving district\u2019s vote on a bond if the sending district wishes to avoid its financial obligation for the term of the bond.\u201d Goffstown asserts that the statutory obligation imposed under RSA 195-A:14, VI \u201cwas not erased by the Amended Area Plan entered into in 2004 or the expiration of that plan in 2014.\u201d According to Goffstown, not only does Dunbarton\u2019s analysis render RSA 195-A:14, VI \u201cmeaningless,\u201d it also \u201cwould lead to the absurd result that a receiving district could never incur new bond indebtedness during the term of an AREA plan with the assurance that a sending district would remain obligated for the full term of the bond.\u201d Goffstown argues that, under Dunbarton\u2019s analysis, \u201c[a] sending district could remain silent and not initiate withdrawal, thereby leaving the false impression that it remained committed to the bond issue, yet simply walk away at the end of the term of the plan, leaving the receiving district the unanticipated burden of the remainder of the entire bond obligation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">After briefing and oral argument, we invited the attorney general (State) to submit a brief as <em>amicus curiae </em>on behalf of the Board. The State asserts that \u201c[t]he Board\u2019s interpretation [of RSA 195-A:14] is consistent with the legislature\u2019s intent that a receiving district be protected relative to its investments in an area school in the event of an area dissolution.\u201d The State argues that, read together, RSA 195-A:14, V and VI require a sending district to remain liable for any outstanding bond issue following the expiration of an AREA agreement. According to the State, these two statutory provisions \u201ctogether protect the relative interests of receiving districts and sending districts, respectively, when capital investments are made in area schools.\u201d Paragraph VI \u201cprotects a sending district by allowing it to withdraw from an area if it does not wish to become liable on a bond issue being considered by the receiving district.\u201d Paragraph V \u201cprotects a receiving district from becoming solely liable on an investment made in an area school established to serve pupils from both the sending district and receiving district.\u201d Thus, the State argues that the phrase \u201cwithdrawing sending district\u201d should be interpreted to include both school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>districts that withdraw from an AREA before the AREA plan terminates, and those that choose not to extend an AREA plan and instead allow it to expire. The expiration of an AREA plan, the State contends, causes the AREA to dissolve, which, in turn, causes all of the districts to \u201cwithdraw\u201d from what was the AREA.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\n<em>V. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">We agree with Dunbarton\u2019s interpretation of RSA 195-A:14. The statute sets forth two scenarios under which a sending school district may withdraw from an AREA plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">First, if, after three years of operation, a school district votes \u201cto undertake a study of the feasibility and suitability of a withdrawal from the area,\u201d a study committee submits a report to the Board that includes a \u201cwithdrawal plan,\u201d the Board concludes that the plan meets the statutory requirements, and the withdrawing district votes in favor of the withdrawal plan, such vote \u201cshall be conclusive evidence of the withdrawal of the district.\u201d RSA 195-A:14, III, VII. Under this circumstance, the withdrawal plan must include \u201c[t]he liability of the withdrawing district for its share of any outstanding indebtedness of the area,\u201d including \u201ca rental charge, as determined by the area agreement, for the length of any outstanding bond issue.\u201d RSA 195-A:14, IV, V.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Second, if a sending district receives notice of a pending vote in the receiving district on a proposed bond issue for the construction of new facilities or additions to an AREA school, and the sending district initiates a withdrawal study in accordance with the statutory requirements before the vote in the receiving district, the sending district may withdraw if the voters in the sending district approve the withdrawal plan. <em>See </em>RSA 195-A:14, VI. Under this circumstance, the sending district \u201cshall not be further obligated to any bonded indebtedness as a result of such bond issue.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\"> In contrast to those two scenarios, here, the parties\u2019 AREA plan expired by its express term. Although the statute requires that AREA plans contain a term, <em>see </em>RSA 195-A:3, V(n), the statute does not impose any continuing obligations upon a sending district after the expiration of an AREA plan. <em>See </em>RSA 195-A:3, XI. Thus, the Board\u2019s determination that Dunbarton was a \u201cwithdrawing sending district\u201d when the parties\u2019 AREA plan expired in 2014 is not supported by a plain reading of the statute. We will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language to a statute that the legislature did not see fit to include. <em>See Strike Four, </em>164 N.H. at 735. The State argues that the expiration of the AREA plan caused the \u201cdissolution\u201d of the AREA and, thus, the \u201cwithdrawal\u201d of all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>districts from the AREA. Assuming without deciding that \u201cdissolution\u201d is intended to mean the same thing as \u201cwithdrawal\u201d under the statute, whether the Goffstown/Dunbarton/New Boston AREA dissolved is not a determination that can be made upon this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\"> Our conclusion is also supported by the principle of statutory construction that \u201cthe expression of one thing in a statute implies the exclusion of another.\u201d <em>State v. Etienne, </em>163 N.H. 57, 73 (2011). The force of this principle \u201cis strengthened where a thing is provided in one part of the statute and omitted in another.\u201d 2A N. Singer &amp; J.D. Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction, \u00a7 47.23, at 417 (7th ed. 2007). But for the limited exception provided for sending districts in RSA 195-A:14, VI, the statute specifically provides that a sending district withdrawing from an AREA plan during the term of the plan remains obligated to pay a rental charge for the length of any outstanding bond issue. <em>See </em>RSA 195-A:14, V. Had the legislature intended to impose the same obligation upon the expiration of an AREA plan, it would have done so expressly.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Goffstown argues that \u201cDunbarton focuses on the wrong timeframe\u201d and ignores the \u201ckey finding\u201d of the hearing officer that \u201cfocused on the undisputed notice to Dunbarton of the Bond prior to the vote on the Bond in 2001, and Dunbarton\u2019s failure to initiate a withdrawal study prior to the vote.\u201d Given that the 1971 AREA plan did not contain a term of duration, Goffstown\u2019s argument might be persuasive had the parties not entered into a new AREA plan in 2004. The 2004 plan between the parties, however, expressly states, in a section titled \u201cOutdated AREA Agreements,\u201d that \u201c[o]n the effective date of this Agreement, any former AREA agreements between Goffstown, New Boston and Dunbarton shall become void.\u201d (Underlining omitted.) We agree with Dunbarton that \u201c[ujnlike withdrawal, the statute places no limitations or conditions upon expiration, but, instead, leaves it to the parties to contract for such contingencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">We conclude that pursuant to the plain language of the statute, Dunbarton was not a \u201cwithdrawing sending district\u201d when the AREA plan between the parties expired in 2014, and, accordingly, we hold that the Board erred as a matter of law when it found that Dunbarton remains financially liable to Goffstown for its proportional share of the 2001 Goffstown High School construction bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b102-9\">Hicks, Conboy, and Bassett, JJ., concurred; Lynn, J., dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b102-10\">Lynn, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"As0\">dissenting. Although I agree that the majority\u2019s construction of the pertinent provisions of RSA chapter 195-A is a reasonable one, I am not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>persuaded that its construction is consistent with how the legislature really intended the pertinent provisions to operate. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">It is a fundamental principle of statutory construction that we \u201cdo not construe statutes in isolation; instead, we attempt to do so in harmony with the overall statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Holt v. Keer, </em>167 N.H. 232, 241 (2015) (quotation omitted). \u201cWhen interpreting two statutes that deal with a similar subject matter, we construe them so that they do not contradict each other, and so that they will lead to reasonable results and effectuate the legislative purpose of the statutes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We presume that the legislature would not pass an act that would lead to an absurd or illogical result. <em>See Simpson v. Young, </em>153 N.H. 471, 475 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">RSA 195-A:14, V imposes upon a sending school district that withdraws during the term of an AREA plan a rental charge for the length of any outstanding school construction bond undertaken by the receiving school district. <em>See </em>RSA 195-A:14, V (2008) (a withdrawing sending district shall remain liable for a rental charge, as determined by the AREA agreement, for the length of any outstanding bond issue); IV(c) (2008) (a withdrawal plan shall include the liability of the withdrawing district for its share of any outstanding indebtedness in accordance with paragraph V). The statute creates an exception to the requirements of paragraph V, however, by allowing a sending district, upon receiving notice from the receiving district of a pending vote on a school construction bond, to withdraw from the AREA and, thereby, avoid incurring any obligation on that bond. <em>See </em>RSA 195-A:14, VI (2008) (\u201cthe sending district shall not be further obligated to any bonded indebtedness\u201d if the voters in the sending district approve the withdrawal plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The majority accepts Dunbarton\u2019s argument that because it terminated its relationship with the AREA plan as a result of the <em>expiration </em>of the plan, it is not a \u201cwithdrawing sending district\u201d within the meaning of RSA 195-A:14, V, and thus is not liable under that section of the statute \u201cfor a rental charge . . . for the length of any outstanding bond issue.\u201d RSA 195-A:14, V. Dunbarton concedes, however, that, even under this construction of the statute, it was liable to Goffstown for the \u201cannual rental charge\u201d specified in the AREA plan for the period of time during which the plan was in effect, that is, the period before the 2014 expiration of the agreement. <em>See </em>RSA 195-A:1, IX, X (2008) (defining the terms \u201ctuition\u201d and \u201cannual rental charge per pupil,\u201d respectively, for purposes of RSA chapter 195-A). Thus, if Dunbarton\u2019s construction of the statute is correct, one has to assume that the legislature contemplated that, if, in response to notification from a receiving school district of its intention to incur bonded indebtedness that extends beyond the expiration of the existing AREA plan, a sending school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>district takes no action, <em>ie., </em>does not initiate a withdrawal study pursuant to RSA 195-A:14, VI, the receiving district will be deemed to have accepted the risk that, at the expiration of the term of the plan, the receiving district will bear the entire cost of the bonded indebtedness for the period after the agreement expires. But if the legislature was willing to impose this risk upon receiving school districts, it is hard to imagine what purpose is served by imposing upon a sending district liability for the full term of the bond if the sending district withdraws before the term of the plan expires (although not in accordance with RSA 195-A:14, VI).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">In short, no reason is apparent as to why the sending district\u2019s withdrawal <em>before </em>the expiration of the plan should extend its liability <em>beyond </em>the expiration of the plan. Because such a withdrawal would not expose a receiving district to any greater post-expiration risk than would result from a sending district\u2019s nonrenewal of the plan upon its expiration, there is no logical reason why the legislature would not have been content to impose liability for bonded indebtedness upon a withdrawing school district in this circumstance only for the period between the date of its withdrawal and the expiration of the term of the plan. To construe the statute in the fashion Dunbarton advocates, and the majority accepts, imposes, in effect, punitive consequences upon a sending district that withdraws \u2014 other than in compliance with RSA 195-A:14,VI \u2014 prior to the expiration of the term of the AREA plan. Although this construction of the statute does not seem to me to ring true, it is the only construction Dunbarton and the majority can place upon RSA 195-A:14, V if this statute is to be given any operative effect <em>at all </em>under their view of how the statutory scheme operates.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">On the other hand, if \u2014 as I believe should be the case \u2014 the phrase \u201cwithdrawing sending district\u201d is construed so as to include a sending school district that terminates its participation in the AREA plan for <em>any </em>reason, whether as a result of a mid-term withdrawal or the expiration of the term without renewal, then there is no need for the awkward construction of RSA 195-A: 14, V produced under the majority view. Under my reading, RSA 195-A: 14, V and VI operate in tandem. When a receiving district notifies a sending district of its intent to incur bonded indebtedness, the sending district has two choices: it can initiate a withdrawal study under section VI and, if it withdraws from the AREA, have no liability for such indebtedness after the withdrawal; or it can decline to withdraw pursuant to section VI, in which case it will remain liable for its share of any outstanding indebtedness for the length of the bond issue pursuant to section V. This construction does not seem to me to be unfair to sending school districts, as Dunbarton argues, since a sending district that receives notice of a proposed bond issue by a receiving district that contains a term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>extending beyond the expiration of the current AREA plan can insist, as a condition of not exercising its withdrawal rights, that the terms of the plan be extended to cover the length of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">I acknowledge that the construction of the statute I advocate, which treats the expiration of a plan as a \u201cwithdrawal\u201d under RSA 195-A:14, V, places a different meaning on the term \u201cwithdrawal\u201d than it is given under other subsections of RSA 195-A: 14 (2008) (no party asserts, for example, that before a plan can expire at the end of its term a \u201cwithdrawal\u201d feasibility study must be conducted under RSA 195-A:14, III), and that this is arguably at odds with one of our rules of statutory construction. <em>See Appeal of Denton, </em>147 N.H. 259, 260 (2001) (\u201cWords used with plain meaning in one part of a statute are to be given the same meaning in other parts of the statute, unless a contrary intention is clearly shown.\u201d (quotation omitted)). However such rules are intended as interpretative guideposts only, which must give way in the face of other indicia, as exists here, that such rules do not produce a logical outcome. <em>See Ruel v. N.H. Real Estate Appraiser Bd., </em>163 N.H. 34, 39 (2011) (stating that the court will not interpret statutory language in a literal manner when such a reading would lead to an absurd or illogical result). Moreover, because, regardless of whether the reason is mid-term discontinuance or discontinuance at the end of the term, a sending school district that stops educating its children at the receiving district\u2019s schools can logically be understood to have \u201cwithdrawn\u201d from those schools, it is readily understandable that the legislature would use that term in a generic sense in RSA 195-A:14, V to capture both situations. <em>See </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2626 (unabridged ed. 2002) (defining \u201cwithdrawal\u201d as \u201cthe act of drawing someone or something back from or out of a place or position\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">For the reasons stated above, I respectfully dissent. I also add one final point, as to which I feel confident both the majority and I agree: because the statutory provisions at issue are susceptible to two plausible but conflicting interpretations, the legislature should clarify their meaning so as to avoid uncertainty in this important area of law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
