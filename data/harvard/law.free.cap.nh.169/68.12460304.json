(Loreto), appeals an order of the Circuit Court <em>(Leonard, </em>J.) ruling that Loreto failed to establish that it was statutorily exempt from filing annual reports with the New Hampshire Attorney General\u2019s Office, <em>see </em>RSA 7:19, :28 (2013), and requiring it to file reports for fiscal years 2010 to 2014. The petitioner is the Director of Charitable Trusts of the Attorney General\u2019s Office. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-15\">The trial court found, or the record supports, the following facts. Loreto is a nonprofit corporation organized under RSA chapter 292. <em>See </em>RSA ch. 292 (2010 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2015). Its stated purpose is \u201cthe promotion, and propagation of the Roman Catholic religion through the publication, sale, or distribution of books, magazines, pamphlets or [tracts], and the use of any other communications media, whether electronic, audio, visual, printed, written or oral.\u201d In or around 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) granted Loreto a tax exemption under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Revenue Code. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3) (2012). In 2008, the Charitable Trust Unit of the Attorney General\u2019s Office learned that Loreto was operating as a 501(c)(3) tax exempt organization in New Hampshire and advised Loreto that New Hampshire law required it to register with and submit annual reports to the Attorney General\u2019s Office. <em>See </em>RSA 7:21, II (2013); RSA 7:28, III. In 2009, Loreto registered with the Charitable Trust Unit but did not file an annual report for fiscal year 2010 or any subsequent fiscal year. In 2013, Loreto\u2019s 501(c)(3) status was \u201cautomatically revoked [by the IRS] for its failure to file a Form 990-series return or notice for three consecutive years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The Interim Director of Charitable Trusts sought an order in the circuit court requiring Loreto to file its delinquent reports. Loreto moved to dismiss, arguing that \u201c[s]ince [it]... is NOT a Charitable Trust, but rather a church/religious organization, [the] court lacks subject matter jurisdiction under [RSA 547:3,11(a)] to hear this matter.\u201d The court denied the motion. The court held an evidentiary hearing at which, over Loreto\u2019s objection, Diane Murphy Quinlan, the Chancellor of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Manchester, testified that she was unaware of an institutional relationship between Loreto and the Roman Catholic Church. Also over Loreto\u2019s objection, Terry Knowles of the Charitable Trust Unit testified about, among other things, Loreto\u2019s status as a 501(c)(3) tax exempt organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Loreto argued that it was a \u201creligious organization\u201d or an \u201cintegrated auxiliary\u201d of a religious organization under RSA 7:19,1, and was therefore exempt from the reporting requirements. The court rejected this argument and ordered Loreto to file its delinquent reports. Loreto appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">RSA 567-A:4 (2007) sets forth our standard of review: \u201cThe findings of fact of the judge of probate are final unless they are so plainly erroneous that such findings could not be reasonably made.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 490-F:3 (Supp. 2015) (conferring the jurisdiction, powers, and duties of the former probate court on the circuit court). Thus, \u201cwe will not disturb the [circuit court\u2019s] decree unless it is unsupported by the evidence or plainly erroneous as a matter of law.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Couture, </em>166 N.H. 101, 105 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Loreto reasserts its argument that the trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this case. \u201cA party may challenge subject matter jurisdiction at any time during the proceeding, including on appeal, and may not waive it.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Ball &amp; Ball, </em>168 N.H. 133, 140 (2015) (quotation omitted). \u201cWe review, <em>de novo, </em>whether the trial court in this case ha[s] subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">The circuit court has jurisdiction over, among other matters, \u201ccases involving charitable uses and trusts.\u201d RSA 547:3, II (a) (Supp. 2015). RSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>7:21, II defines \u201c[c]haritable trust\u201d as, among other things, a \u201ccharitable organization,\u201d which includes \u201c[a]ny person or entity that is determined by the [IRS] to be a tax exempt organization pursuant to section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code\u201d or \u201c[a]ny other person or entity that is or holds itself out to be established, in whole or in part, for any benevolent, philanthropic ... or other charitable purpose.\u201d RSA 7:21, II (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">There was testimony at the evidentiary hearing, and the exhibits showed, that Loreto registered as a charitable trust with the Attorney General\u2019s Office in 2009 and held 501(c)(3) tax exempt status until the IRS revoked that status in 2013. Loreto maintains that it registered under protest and has not been a 501(c)(3) tax exempt organization since 2009. Regardless of the truth of these assertions, however, Loreto stated in its articles of incorporation, and its president testified, that Loreto was organized as a nonprofit corporation for the charitable purpose of promoting Roman Catholicism. See Restatement (Third) of Trusts \u00a7 28, at 9 (2003) (\u201cCharitable trust purposes [may] include ... the advancement of religion . . . .\u201d). Thus, the record shows that Loreto \u201cholds itself out to be\u201d a charitable entity, and is, therefore, a charitable trust under RSA 7:21, II. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Next, Loreto challenges the relevance and, therefore, the admissibility of the testimony of Quinlan and Knowles. \u201cWe will not reverse the trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Ramsey, </em>166 N.H. 45, 49 (2014). \u201c \u2018Relevant evidence\u2019 means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">In the trial court, Loreto sought to establish, among other things, that it was an \u201cintegrated auxiliary\u201d of the Roman Catholic Church. Quinlan\u2019s testimony concerned the absence of a relationship between Loreto and the Diocese of Manchester, which tended to make it less probable that Loreto was an integrated auxiliary. Thus, the trial court did not unsustainably exercise its discretion by ruling that Quinlan\u2019s testimony was relevant and admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Loreto also asserted that it is not a charitable trust. On appeal, it argues that, from 2010 to 2014 \u2014 the years relevant to the petitioner\u2019s complaint \u2014 Loreto did not have 501(c)(3) status because it stopped filing exemption forms with the IRS after 2009. Thus, its evidentiary argument, as we understand it, is that Knowles\u2019 testimony about Loreto\u2019s 501(c)(3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>status after 2009 is irrelevant because it conflicted with the petitioner\u2019s exhibits, which, according to Loreto, show that it held 501(c)(8) status only until 2009. However, because 501(c)(8) tax exempt organizations are charitable trusts under RSA 7:21, II, Knowles\u2019 testimony about Loreto\u2019s 501(c)(8) designation was relevant. That this testimony may have conflicted with other evidence does not render it inadmissible. <em>See </em>N.H. R. Ev. 402 (\u201cAll relevant evidence is admissible, except as limited by constitutional requirements or as otherwise provided by statute or by these rules or by other rules prescribed by the New Hampshire Supreme Court.\u201d). Thus, the trial court did not unsustainably exercise its discretion by admitting Knowles\u2019 testimony about Loreto\u2019s 501(c)(8) status.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Loreto\u2019s principal argument is that it is statutorily exempt from the Attorney General\u2019s reporting requirements because it is a \u201creligious organization\u201d or an \u2018Integrated auxiliar[y]\u201d of a religious organization under RSA 7:19, I. RSA 7:28, III requires all charitable trusts that are registered in New Hampshire to file annual reports with the Attorney General\u2019s Office. RSA 7:19, I, exempts from the statutes governing charitable trusts <em>\u201cany religious organization </em>which holds property for charitable or religious purposes or <em>their integrated auxiliaries </em>or . . . conventions or associations of churches.\u201d RSA 7:19, I (emphasis added). The statute does not define either \u201creligious organization\u201d or \u201cintegrated auxiliar[y].\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The trial court determined that \u201creligious organization\u201d in RSA 7:19, I, \u201crefers to religious houses of worship or churches,\u201d and concluded that Loreto had failed to show that it was either. The court also concluded that Loreto had failed to show that it was an \u201cintegrated auxiliary\u201d of a religious organization because, it reasoned, \u201c[biased upon the testimony offered at the [hjearing, . . . the Roman Catholic Church does not recognize an institutional relationship with Loreto . . . [and] has no direct authority [or] involvement with Loreto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Loreto argues for a broader definition of \u201creligious organization\u201d as \u201ca voluntary association that is based on or related to a religion and seeks to advance one or more of its purposes or interests but does not encompass the full range or scope of a religion or church.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) The petitioner counters that the term is ambiguous and that, therefore, we must rely upon legislative history. Based upon that history, the petitioner argues that the drafters intended for the statute to mirror a federal tax law enacted in 1969, <em>see </em>Tax Reform Act of 1969, Pub. L. No. 91-172, \u00a7 101(d)(1), 83 Stat. 487, 519-20, which \u201cadded an annual filing requirement for tax exempt organizations but excluded \u2018churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting 26 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>\u00a7 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) (2012)). Searching for \u201ca more inclusive term [than \u2018church\u2019] to describe houses of worship,\u201d the petitioner argues, the statute\u2019s drafters settled on \u201creligious organization.\u201d According to the petitioner, the drafters intended for this broader term to \u201cmatch the IRS\u2019s interpretation of church under [federal tax law], which include[d] synagogues, mosques and other places of worship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Statutory interpretation is a question of law, \u201cwhich we review <em>de novo.\" Petition of Malisos, </em>166 N.H. 726, 729 (2014). In matters of statutory interpretation, \u201c[w]e are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Appeal of Wilson, </em>161 N.H. 659, 662 (2011). \u201cWe first examine the language of the statute and ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to the words used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include.\u201d <em>Appeal of Local Gov\u2019t Ctr., </em>165 N.H. 790, 804 (2014). \u201cUnless we find statutory language to be ambiguous, we will not examine legislative history.\u201d <em>Forster v. Town of Henniker, </em>167 N.H. 745, 750 (2015). A statute is ambiguous if its \u201clanguage is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation.\u201d <em>Appeal of Naswa Motor Inn, </em>144 N.H. 89, 90 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">We acknowledge that \u201creligious organization\u201d is an inherently ambiguous term. <em>Cf. </em>B. Hopkins, The Law of Tax-Exempt Organizations \u00a7 10.3, at 320 (9th ed. 2007) (\u201c[A] formal and consistent definition of the term <em>church . . </em>. appears incapable of formulation.\u201d). The statute does not offer a definition. Nor does Black\u2019s Law Dictionary. Because we conclude that \u201creligious organization\u201d is \u201csubject to more than one reasonable interpretation,\u201d <em>Appeal of Naswa Motor Inn, </em>144 N.H. at 90, it is ambiguous. We therefore look to the statute\u2019s legislative history to determine the term\u2019s meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Our review of that history confirms that the legislature intended for RSA 7:19 to conform to federal tax law. The statute was amended a few years after the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1969. Other than substituting \u201creligious organization\u201d for \u201cchurch,\u201d the statute\u2019s language was nearly identical to the pertinent part of the federal law, which established an annual filing requirement for 501(c)(3) organizations, but excluded from that requirement \u201cchurches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches.\u201d Tax Reform Act of 1969 \u00a7 101(d)(1). Moreover, in a public hearing before the New Hampshire House Judiciary Committee, the former Director of the Division of Charitable Trusts, Wells Anderson, stated that, if enacted, the statute \u201cwould broaden the jurisdiction of the attorney general relative to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>recording of activities of charitable trusts [and]... would bring the law into conformity with . . . the new federal tax law.\u201d Public Hearing on HB 852 Before the House Judiciary Committee at 1 (May 27, 1971). Similarly, a legislator testified that \u201c[t]he intent of the bill[ ] [was] to bring state statutes into line with the [federal tax law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2 (testimony of Rep. David H. Bradley).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Federal tax law regarded \u201cseveral categories of institutions ... as religious organizations,\u201d including \u201cchurches, conventions and associations of churches, [and] integrated auxiliaries of churches.\u201d Hopkins, supra \u00a7 10.2, at 315; <em>see </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6033(a)(3)(A)(i). In 1970, the year before the legislature enacted RSA 7:19, the IRS \u201cformulated the criteria that it use[d] to ascertain whether or not an organization qualifie[d] as a church.\u201d Hopkins, <em>supra. </em>\u00a7 10.3, at 316. The criteria, which the IRS made public in 1977, included \u201ca distinct legal existence, a recognized creed and form of worship, a definite and distinct ecclesiastical government, a formal code of doctrine and discipline, . . . established places of worship, regular congregations, regular religious services,\u201d and others. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In a hearing before the New Hampshire Senate Judiciary Committee, Anderson specifically linked the term \u201creligious organization\u201d in RSA 7:19 to the term \u201cchurch\u201d: \u201cThere are specified exemptions to the reporting requirement: governmental subdivisions; <em>religious organizations </em>\u2014 <em>churches </em>get into social action and hold funds not for religious purposes but for social actions like halfway houses; educational organizations like Dartmouth, St. Paul\u2019s_\u201d Hearing on HB 852 Before the Senate Judiciary Committee at 1 (June 18, 1971) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Based on this legislative history, we construe \u201creligious organization\u201d in RSA 7:19 to be consistent with the term \u201cchurch\u201d as the IRS interprets it in the Federal Tax Code. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6033(a)(3)(A)(i). Our interpretation is bolstered by RSA 7:21, II, which defers in part to the IRS in its definition of \u201c[c]haritable trust.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 7:21, II (defining charitable trust as, among other things, \u201c[a]ny person or entity that is determined by the [IRS] to be a tax exempt organization pursuant to section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">We now turn to Loreto\u2019s argument that it is an exempt religious organization or integrated auxiliary of a religious organization under RSA 7:19. Loreto\u2019s articles of incorporation and testimony at the evidentiary hearing support the conclusion that Loreto is a publishing house and a bookseller dealing predominantly, but not exclusively, in Catholic works. Loreto\u2019s president testified that Loreto conducts no religious services, has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>no congregation, and provides no religious instruction. And although Loreto changed its designation to \u201cchurch\u201d in its 2009 exemption form, its president testified to not having received notification that the IRS recognized Loreto as such. On appeal, Loreto argues that \u201c[n]o evidence was introduced that the IRS denied or contested Loreto\u2019s change in designation.\u201d However, we note that the automatic revocation by the IRS of Loreto\u2019s tax exempt status for its failure to file its forms during the three consecutive years after it re-designated itself indicates that the IRS did not accept Loreto\u2019s new designation and still required Loreto to file. Thus, Loreto has failed to show that it is a \u201creligious organization\u201d under RSA 7:19.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Concerning Loreto\u2019s argument that it is an \u201cintegrated auxiliary\u201d of a religious organization, Quinlan testified that, to her knowledge, there was no institutional relationship between Loreto and the Diocese of Manchester. Quinlan explained that, every year, the Conference of Catholic Bishops receives a group exemption letter from the IRS recognizing the tax exempt status of all \u201ceducational, charitable, and religious organizations of the Roman Catholic Church as listed in the official Catholic directory.\u201d Quinlan then stated that Loreto is not listed in that directory. Thus, Loreto has also failed to show, as it alleges, that it is an integrated auxiliary of the Roman Catholic Church, a \u201creligious organization.\u201d We therefore uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling that Loreto is not statutorily exempt from filing annual reports with the Attorney General\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Loreto asserts that the burden of proving that it is not an exempt organization is on the petitioner, and the petitioner does not meet that burden. \u2018We review the allocation of the burden of proof, a question of law, <em>de novo.\u201d Estate of Abraham v. C.I.R., </em>408 F.3d 26, 35 (1st Cir.), <em>amended by </em>429 F.3d 294 (1st Cir. 2005). Although RSA 7:19 does not explicitly mention who bears the burden of proof, \u201c[generally, the party claiming an exemption from the provisions of a statute has the burden to show that it is entitled to the exemption.\u201d <em>Goodrow v. Lane Bryant, Inc., </em>732 N.E.2d 289, 294 (Mass. 2000); <em>see also Gentry v. Harborage Cottages-Stuart, LLLP, </em>654 F.3d 1247, 1258-59 (11th Cir. 2011) (\u201cGenerally, the party claiming an exemption to a statute\u2019s requirements carries the burden of establishing its entitlement thereto.\u201d). Consistent with this general rule, and absent contrary indication in RSA 7:19, we interpret the statute to place the burden of proof on the party seeking an exemption. Thus, once the petitioner meets its burden of showing that, under RSA 7:21, an organization is a charitable trust, the burden shifts to the organization to show that it is exempt under RSA 7:19. Having concluded in our subject matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>jurisdiction analysis that the petitioner met its burden here, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s shifting the burden of proof to Loreto.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">We need not address Loreto\u2019s arguments about alleged violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Contrary to Loreto\u2019s assertions as we understand them, the trial court did not interfere with the \u201crights of Catholics to associate in furtherance of their religious goals.\u201d The trial court merely concluded that Loreto was not the type of charitable organization that was statutorily exempt from the Attorney General\u2019s reporting requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">We also need not address Loreto\u2019s argument that the notice of decision issued by the trial court\u2019s Clerk of Court erroneously states \u201cPetition for Application of Cy Pres Doctrine; Granted.\u201d The statement appears to be a clerical error that did not affect the trial court\u2019s ultimate disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Having determined that the trial court did not err by ruling that Loreto was not exempt from the statutory reporting requirements, we affirm the court\u2019s order requiring Loreto to file its delinquent annual reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b121-8\">Dalianis, C.J., and Conboy, Lynn, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
