On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred by denying his pretrial motion <em>in limine </em>seeking to limit the State\u2019s cross-examination of him or, alternatively, to \u201csever\u201d the bases for the motion to impose. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>The relevant facts follow. In April 2014, the defendant was convicted of two counts of reckless conduct, <em>see </em>RSA 631:3 (2007) (amended 2014), and one count of being a felon in possession of a dangerous weapon, <em>see </em>RSA 159:3 (2014). On one of the reckless conduct charges, he received a time-served sentence. On the two remaining charges, he received consecutive three-and-one-half-to-seven-year sentences, both suspended for 10 years on the condition of good behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">In June 2014, the defendant was arrested for loitering (a violation-level offense), <em>see </em>RSA 644:6 (2007), and resisting arrest (a misdemeanor), <em>see </em>RSA 642:2 (Supp. 2015). Those charges were tried in September 2014. The trial court acquitted the defendant of the loitering charge and placed the resisting arrest matter \u201con file without a finding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">In August 2014, the defendant was charged with first degree assault, <em>see </em>RSA 631:1 (2007) (amended 2014), robbery, <em>see </em>RSA 636:1 (2007), and being a felon in possession of a dangerous weapon, <em>see </em>RSA 159:3, for his involvement in a stabbing incident. He was subsequently also charged with misdemeanor resisting arrest in connection with the August incident. <em>See </em>RSA 642:2.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">In October 2014, the State moved to impose the defendant\u2019s two consecutive three-and-one-half-to-seven-year sentences on the ground that his June and August charges established that he had violated the condition of good behavior. The defendant filed a pretrial motion <em>in limine </em>seeking to limit the State\u2019s cross-examination of him or, alternatively, to sever the bases for the motion to impose. In that motion, the defendant explained that he \u201cmight testify\u201d as to the June resisting arrest charge, but, as to the August charges he wanted to invoke his right to remain silent pursuant to the 5th and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution and the rights to all proofs favorable and against self-incrimination provided in Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution. During the February 2015 hearing on the motion to impose, the trial court ruled that the defendant could not \u201ctestify selectively; ... if he takes the stand, he waives his Fifth Amendment privilege in a motion to impose hearing.\u201d The defendant did not testify at the hearing. Nor did he put on an affirmative case.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The trial court found that the State had met its burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant had violated the condition of good behavior. Specifically, the court found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the June resisting arrest charge, the August felon-in-possession charge, and the August first degree assault charge were true. The court also found that the State had failed to meet its burden of proof with respect to the August robbery charge and August resisting arrest charge. Because the court found that the defendant had violated the condition of good behavior, it imposed his two previously suspended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>sentences. On the April reckless conduct charge, the court imposed the entire previously suspended sentence (three and one-half years to seven years). As for the April felon-in-possession charge, the court imposed the suspended term of three and one-half to seven years, but further suspended one and one-half years of the minimum term for a period ending five years from the defendant\u2019s release on the charge. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the privilege against compelled self-incrimination, as guaranteed by the State and Federal Constitutions, <em>see </em>N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 15; U.S. Const. amend. V, required the trial court to limit the State\u2019s cross-examination to the subject about which he intended to testify during direct examination (the June resisting arrest charge). <em>See </em>N.H. R. Ev. 611(b) (providing that a cross-examiner may question a witness \u201con any matter relevant to any issue in the case, including credibility,\u201d but \u201c[i]n the interests of justice, the judge may limit cross-examination with respect to matters not testified to on direct examination\u201d). The defendant contends that the trial court should have ruled that he waived his privilege against compelled self-incrimination <em>only </em>as to the June resisting arrest charge and to matters affecting his credibility. Thus, the defendant asserts that the trial court violated the privilege when it ruled <em>in limine </em>that the State could cross-examine him about the August charges even though he intended to testify on direct examination about only the June resisting arrest charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Relying upon <em>Lace v. United States, </em>469 U.S. 38 (1984), and its progeny, the State argues that the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify at the motion to impose hearing renders unreviewable his argument that the trial court erred by failing to restrict the scope of the State\u2019s cross-examination. <em>See Luce, </em>469 U.S. at 39-43; <em>see also State v. Bruneau, </em>131 N.H. 104, 114-15 (1988). The petitioner in <em>Luce </em>was charged with conspiracy and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. <em>Luce, </em>469 U.S. at 39. He moved to preclude the government from using a prior state conviction for possession of a controlled substance to impeach him if he testified. <em>Id. </em>The petitioner did not commit to testifying if the motion were granted and gave no proffer as to what his testimony would be. <em>Id. </em>The trial court determined that the prior conviction was admissible for impeachment purposes under Federal Rule of Evidence 609(a). <em>Id. </em>at 39-40. The trial court did state, however, that if the \u201cpetitioner limited his testimony to explaining his attempt to flee from arresting officers,\u201d the prior conviction would be excluded. <em>Id. </em>at 40. The petitioner did not testify. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The Supreme Court ruled that, because the petitioner never testified, his argument that the trial court erred by ruling the prior conviction admissible for impeachment was unreviewable. <em>See id. </em>at 43. The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>explained that, without the defendant\u2019s trial testimony, \u201c[a]ny possible harm flowing from a [trial] court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>ruling permitting impeachment by a prior conviction is wholly speculative\u201d because a trial court may change its ruling as the case unfolds and because a defendant\u2019s actual testimony may differ from that which was contained in his proffer. <em>Id. </em>at 41. Moreover, \u201c[w]hen the defendant does not testify, the reviewing court . . . has no way of knowing whether the Government would have sought to impeach with the prior conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42. The Court also explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-3\">Were <em>in limine </em>rulings under Rule 609(a) reviewable on appeal, almost any error would result in the windfall of automatic reversal; the appellate court could not logically term \u201charmless\u201d an error that presumptively kept the defendant from testifying. Requiring that a defendant testify in order to preserve Rule 609(a) claims will enable the reviewing court to determine the impact any erroneous impeachment may have had in light of the record as a whole; it will also tend to discourage making such motions solely to \u201cplant\u201d reversible error in the event of conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Although <em>Luce </em>concerned impeachment under Federal Rule of Evidence 609(a), when we adopted <em>Luce, </em>we applied it to a constitutionally-based claim. <em>See </em>Bruneau, 131 N.H. at 114-15. In <em>Bruneau, </em>the defendant had filed a pretrial motion to suppress a statement that the State conceded had been obtained in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966). <em>Id. </em>at 114. The trial court ruled that the statement was inadmissible in the State\u2019s case-in-chief, but was admissible to impeach the defendant, if he took the stand. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the defendant argued that the trial court\u2019s decision violated his right to counsel as guaranteed by Part I, Article 15 of the State Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. <em>Id. </em>We found the defendant\u2019s appellate argument to be \u201ctoo speculative for adjudication\u201d because he \u201cnever testified and was never impeached.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 115. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">We have no way of knowing whether [the defendant\u2019s] decision to remain off the stand was influenced to any degree by the ruling <em>in limine, </em>any more than we can tell what would have happened if he had testified. We do not know whether his testimony would have differed from the substance of his statement, or whether the State would actually have used the statement to impeach him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Relying, in part, on <em>Luce, </em>we held that \u201c[o]nly if the defendant had taken the stand and suffered impeachment by the statement\u2019s use would an issue be ripe for adjudication here.\u201d <em>Id.; accord State v. Croft, </em>142 N.H. 76, 78-79 (1997) (ruling that the defendant\u2019s arguments regarding the admissibility of a prosecutor\u2019s testimony were not preserved because the trial court \u201cnever ruled in the context of actual testimony\u201d and finding that \u201c[t]he specificity of the offers of proof is irrelevant\u201d because trial testimony can differ from proffers). <em>But cf. State v. Blackstock, </em>147 N.H. 791, 797 (2002) (ruling that the defendant could challenge the trial court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>ruling on appeal where he supported his motion \u201cwith an explanation of the line of questioning he sought to pursue during cross-examination\u201d and renewed his request at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Other state courts have also applied <em>Luce </em>to impeachment by a statement obtained in violation of a defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See, e.g., Wagner v. State, </em>347 P.3d 109, 109-10 (Alaska 2015) (declining to review the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred by allowing the State to impeach him with a statement obtained in violation of <em>Miranda </em>because, without his testimony, \u201cit is impossible to tell whether the court\u2019s ruling affected [his] decision not to testify, whether the prosecution would have impeached him with his police statement, or whether this evidence would have affected the jury\u201d); <em>Jordan v. State, </em>591 A.2d 875, 876-78 (Md. 1991) (concluding that the appellate court could not review the defendant\u2019s constitutional argument that the trial court erred by allowing the State to use his allegedly involuntary confession to impeach him because he elected not to testily); <em>cf. People v. Boyd, </em>682 N.W.2d 459, 459-60 (Mich. 2004) (ruling that the defendant had to testify at trial to preserve for review his challenge to the trial court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>ruling that allowed into evidence his post-arrest silence). <em>But see, e.g., State v. Brunelle, </em>534 A.2d 198, 199-200, 204 (Vt. 1987) (ruling that the defendant could challenge on appeal the trial court\u2019s decision allowing the State to impeach him with evidence that had been obtained in violation of his <em>Miranda, </em>rights, even though he neither testified nor made an offer of proof at trial); <em>cf. State v. Cherry, </em>83 P.3d 123, 125-26 (Idaho Ct. App. 2003) (concluding that when a defendant elects not to testify, but has made an adequate offer of proof as to the testimony he would have given, he may challenge on appeal the trial court\u2019s decision to allow impeachment with evidence allegedly obtained in violation of his constitutional rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">We have not previously applied the <em>Luce </em>rule to circumstances similar to those in this case. Thus, whether the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify renders unreviewable his argument that the trial court erred by failing to restrict the State\u2019s proposed cross-examination to the subject about which he intended to testify is a question of first impression. However, numerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>federal jurisdictions have applied the <em>Luce </em>rule to similar arguments. <em>See United States v. Ferrer, </em>441 Fed. Appx. 867, 869 (3d Cir. 2011) (determining that the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify at trial precluded the appellate court from reviewing his argument that the trial court should not have denied his motion <em>in limine </em>to restrict the scope of the government\u2019s cross-examination of him); <em>United States v. Bond, </em>87 F.3d 695, 700-01 (5th Cir. 1996) (finding unreviewable the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court erroneously decided that if he testified \u201cregarding the terms of his plea bargain, he would waive his privilege against self-incrimination with regard to all grounds asserted in his motion to withdraw\u201d his plea, because he did not testify); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>Nos. 94-5088, 94-5099, 1995 WL 530088, at *4-5 (4th Cir. Aug. 31, 1995) (unpublished) (ruling that, by choosing not to testify, the defendant failed to preserve for the court\u2019s review whether the trial court violated his constitutional privilege against compelled self-incrimination when it ruled that, if he testified for a limited purpose at sentencing, the government could cross-examine him about \u201ceverything\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>United States v. Nivica, </em>887 F.2d 1110, 1115-17 (1st Cir. 1989) (concluding that the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred when it denied his request for a pretrial ruling that would have limited the government to cross-examining him only upon matters about which he testified on direct examination and about his credibility was foreclosed because he never, in fact, testified); <em>cf. United States v. Wilson, </em>307 F.3d 596, 598-601 (7th Cir. 2002) (holding unreviewable the defendant\u2019s assertion that his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent was violated by the trial court\u2019s conditional ruling to allow the government to introduce evidence of his \u201cselective silence\u201d if he referred to the \u201cassociate\u201d he had originally mentioned to a federal agent because, although the defendant testified, he did not, in fact, mention the associate (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Moreover, at least two state courts have also applied <em>Luce </em>to circumstances that are similar to those in this case. <em>See Jackson v. State, </em>992 S.W.2d 469, 479-80 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999) (en banc) (declining to review the appellant\u2019s assertion that the trial court erred when it ruled that the State could cross-examine him about certain offenses if he testified in the punishment phase of his trial for the limited purpose of raising mitigation issues because he did not testily); <em>People v. Whitehead, </em>508 N.E.2d 687, 693-94 (Ill. 1987) (ruling that because neither the witness nor the defendant testified, the court could not review whether the trial court erred by denying the defendant\u2019s motions <em>in limine </em>seeking to limit the State\u2019s cross-examination).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">We find persuasive the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>United States v. Turner, </em>674 F.3d 420 (5th Cir. 2012). The defendant in that case brought a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number><em>in limine </em>requesting that the federal district court rule upon whether his testimony about his federal charges \u201cwould waive his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination as to\u201d a robbery \u201cfor which he faced only state charges.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>674 F.3d at 433. The district court ruled that, if the defendant testified about the federal charges, he could be cross-examined about the state robbery charges because his testimony about those charges would be relevant to, and probative of, his credibility and his \u201cintent, identity, motive, plan, knowledge, and modus operandi.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted). The defendant did not testify. <em>Id. </em>Although the defendant argued that the district court\u2019s ruling was erroneous, the appellate court concluded that his failure to testify rendered his argument unreviewable. <em>Id. </em>at 433-34. The court explained that \u201cwithout any record of what [the defendant] would have said, [it] cannot review the relevance and appropriateness of a hypothetical cross-examination on a particular subject.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The defendant argues that <em>Turner </em>is distinguishable because the defendant in that case \u201cwanted[ ] to give testimony only on some discrete matters bearing on a given charge,\u201d whereas the defendant in this case sought \u201cto give testimony on any and all matters bearing\u201d on the June resisting arrest charge. The defendant\u2019s characterization of <em>Turner </em>is mistaken. The defendant in <em>Turner </em>sought to testify about one set of charges without being cross-examined about another set of charges. <em>Id. </em>at 433. Similarly, in this case, the defendant sought to testily about the June resisting arrest charge without being cross-examined about the August charges. The court in <em>Turner </em>ruled that if the defendant testified about one set of charges, he would waive his privilege against compelled self-incrimination as to the other charges. <em>See id. </em>Likewise, the court here ruled that if the defendant testified about the June resisting arrest charge, he would waive his privilege against compelled self-incrimination as to the August charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Here, the defendant did not testify. Moreover, even if we assume that a detailed proffer as to the defendant\u2019s intended testimony would have sufficed, the defendant did not make such a proffer. <em>See Blackstock, </em>147 N.H. at 797. <em>But see Bruneau, </em>131 N.H. at 115; <em>Croft, </em>142 N.H. at 78-79. We hold that this record renders unreviewable the defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court violated his privilege against compelled self-incrimination as protected by the State and Federal Constitutions when it failed to restrict the State\u2019s cross-examination to the subject about which he intended to testify. Absent a record of what the defendant would have said during direct examination and of the State\u2019s proposed cross-examination of him, we cannot meaningfully determine whether the trial court\u2019s failure to restrict the scope of the State\u2019s cross-examination was unconstitutional. Meaningful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>review is impossible in this case because the defendant\u2019s precise testimony and the State\u2019s anticipated cross-examination remain \u201cunknowable.\u201d <em>Luce, </em>469 U.S. at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Alternatively, the defendant argues that the trial court \u201cerred in denying the alternative relief of severance of the June charge from the August charges.\u201d He asserts that, pursuant to former Superior Court Rule 97-A (superseded by New Hampshire Rule of Criminal Procedure 20), he had a \u201cright\u201d to severance of the two bases for the motion to impose (the June resisting arrest charge and the August charges) because the June charge was not \u201crelated\u201d to the August charges and severance was in the \u201cinterests of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The defendant\u2019s reliance upon the rule regarding severance of criminal offenses for trial is misplaced. The alleged June and August acts were not \u201coffenses\u201d for which the defendant was to be tried. Rather, they constituted the State\u2019s evidence that he had violated the good-behavior condition of his previously suspended sentences, regardless of whether those acts resulted in criminal convictions. <em>See State v. Gibbs, </em>157 N.H. 538, 540-42 (2008). Under these circumstances, Superior Court Rule 97-A is of no avail to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">In effect, the defendant asserts that the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d required the trial court to treat the State\u2019s motion to impose as if it were two motions \u2014 one motion based upon the June resisting arrest charge and the other based upon the August charges. However, \u201c[t]he trial court has broad discretion in managing the proceedings before it.\u201d <em>State v. Larose, </em>157 N.H. 28, 39 (2008) (quotation omitted). Given the State\u2019s allegation that, as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct in June and August, he \u201cwas not on good behavior,\u201d we cannot say that the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion by declining to treat the State\u2019s motion to impose as two motions and by declining to hear them in separate hearings. <em>See State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 296 (2001) (explaining our unsustainable exercise of discretion standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b260-9\">Dalianis, C.J., and Lynn and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
