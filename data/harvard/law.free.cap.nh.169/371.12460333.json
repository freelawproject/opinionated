Boyle, as trustee of the 150 Greenleaf Avenue Realty Trust, appeals a decision of the New Hampshire Transportation Appeals Board (TAB) affirming the denial of his application for a permit to construct a driveway onto a state highway. The TAB based its decision upon sections 7(a) and 7(e) of the New Hampshire Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) \u201cPolicy for the Permitting of Driveways and Other Accesses to the State Highway System.\u201d <em>See </em>Policy for the Permitting of Driveways and Other Accesses to the State Highway System (N.H. DOT declaratory ruling no. 2000-01; issued March 10, 2000) (hereinafter referred to and cited as the \u201cDriveway Policy\u201d or \u201cN.H. Driveway Policy\u201d). Section 7(a) of the Driveway Policy states that a \u201cdriveway construction permit <em>shall be issued </em>if the application and supporting information demonstrates that the <em>safety of the traveling public can be adequately protected.\u201d </em>N.H. Driveway Policy \u00a7 7(a) (emphases added). By contrast, section 7(e) of the Driveway Policy provides that a \u201cdriveway permit <em>shall be denied </em>if the proposed driveway will cause an <em>unreasonable hazard </em>to the traveling public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7(e) (emphases added). Here, although the TAB concluded that the petitioner\u2019s proposed driveway would adequately protect the safety of the traveling public, because it also determined that there was sufficient support for the hearings examiner\u2019s conclusion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>proposed driveway would cause an unreasonable hazard to the traveling public, it upheld the hearings examiner\u2019s denial of the petitioner\u2019s permit application.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">On appeal, the petitioner challenges the finding of an unreasonable hazard, arguing that it is impossible for a driveway to adequately protect the safety of the traveling public and simultaneously cause an unreasonable hazard to the traveling public. Thus, the petitioner asserts that the TAB erred when, after concluding that the proposed driveway would adequately protect the safety of the traveling public \u2014 a determination that has not been appealed \u2014 it affirmed the denial of his permit application. We agree with the petitioner, and, therefore, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The pertinent facts follow. The petitioner owns a 18-acre parcel of land, on which he operates an automobile dealership. The parcel is located in Portsmouth at the intersection of the U.S. Route 1 Bypass and Greenleaf Avenue. It has over 800 feet of frontage on the Bypass. Currently, the parcel has access to the Bypass only by way of Greenleaf Avenue. Thus, in 2010, as part of a plan to add a second automobile dealership to the parcel, the petitioner filed an application with the DOT for a permit to construct a driveway with direct access to the Bypass. The petitioner wanted to use both his existing Bypass access and the proposed driveway as entrances and exits for the current and proposed dealerships.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">In 2011, the District Engineer, Douglas DePorter, denied the petitioner\u2019s permit application. DePorter explained that the \u201creason for the denial included the fact that the [petitioner] has historically had access to [the] Route 1 By-Pass via Greenleaf Avenue,\u201d and that the \u201crequested direct access to [the] U.S. Route 1 Bypass would introduce a new conflict point along a highly traveled roadway.\u201d According to DePorter, the access by way of Greenleaf Avenue is \u201ca safer alternative\u201d than the proposed driveway because Greenleaf Avenue \u201cconsists of lower traffic volumes and lower speeds, with the added benefit of a traffic signal to access [the] Route 1 By-Pass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">The petitioner appealed to the DOT commissioner. Pursuant to New Hampshire Administrative Rule, Tra 202.01(a), the commissioner appointed a hearings examiner to adjudicate the appeal. The hearings examiner upheld the denial of the petitioner\u2019s permit application, concluding that the \u201cdenial is in keeping with the purpose\u201d of the Driveway Policy: to \u201cmaximize safety and . . . minimize conflict points.\u201d She also observed that \u201cthere would likely be a different discussion\u201d had the petitioner been \u201clandlocked\u201d with no access to the Bypass.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">The petitioner appealed to the TAB. In its decision, the TAB referenced sections 7(a) and 7(e) of the Driveway Policy, noting that, although DePorter had testified before the hearings examiner that \u201cthe proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>driveway provided adequate safety to the traveling public,\u201d he also testified that \u201cthe proposed driveway posed an unreasonable hazard in light of the existing access the [petitioner\u2019s] property has on Greenleaf Avenue.\u201d <em>See </em>N.H. Driveway Policy \u00a7 7(a), (e). Observing that it \u201cis hard to envision . . . that the traveling public can simultaneously be adequately protected and yet somehow be subject to unreasonable hazard by virtue of this particular driveway permit,\u201d the TAB concluded that the petitioner \u201cneed not show that the proposed driveway provide [s] maximum safety,\u201d but rather only that the \u201csafety of the traveling public can be adequately protected.\u201d The TAB determined that the petitioner met his \u201cburden of establishing that the traveling public can be adequately protected.\u201d It then remanded the matter for the hearings examiner to determine whether, \u201ctaking into account the relative impact on the traveling public of the existing and proposed access,\u201d the petitioner\u2019s permit application for the proposed driveway should be denied because the proposed driveway would cause an \u201cunreasonable hazard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\">Upon remand, the hearings examiner determined that the proposed driveway would \u201ccreate[ ] an unreasonable hazard for the traveling public.\u201d The hearings examiner explained that the proposed driveway would \u201cadd[ ] additional conflict points to an already busy State highway, fail[ ] to remove or improve existing conflict points, fail[ ] to remove or improve the existing driveway, and in general, decreas[e] safety to the overall highway system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">The petitioner again appealed to the TAB. The TAB observed that it \u201cis seemingly nonsensical that simultaneously with\u201d finding that the proposed driveway would adequately protect the safety of the traveling public, the DOT \u201ccould also find that the proposed driveway somehow constitutes an unreasonable hazard to the traveling public.\u201d The TAB also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">The Board is sympathetic to the predicament faced by [the petitioner], [The petitioner] seeks to expand a business and to do so in a way that adds a driveway with direct access onto a highway seemingly better suited to handle traffic than the current Greenleaf Avenue. On the surface the design of the driveway appears to flow with existing traffic patterns and the additional vehicles entering onto the state highway do not appear to create any hazard beyond that which is generally a part of a growing population. In all respects [the petitioner\u2019s] request for the driveway seems reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Notwithstanding these comments, the TAB upheld the hearings examiner\u2019s conclusion that the proposed driveway would cause an unreasonable hazard to the traveling public. The TAB explained that, given the hearings examiner\u2019s findings regarding an unreasonable hazard, it could not con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>elude that the denial of the permit application was \u201carbitrary, capricious, unlawful, or unreasonable.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">On appeal, the petitioner challenges the finding that the proposed driveway would cause an unreasonable hazard, and asserts that it is legally and factually \u201cimpossible for something to simultaneously be adequately safe and an unreasonable hazard.\u201d The petitioner also argues that, given that the DOT has not appealed the TAB\u2019s conclusion that the proposed driveway would adequately protect the safety of the traveling public, the DOT is required, under section 7(a) of the Driveway Policy, to issue a permit for the proposed driveway. In response, the DOT argues that section 7(e) of the Driveway Policy covers broader concerns than section 7(a), and, thus, the two sections are not in conflict. According to the DOT, accepting the petitioner\u2019s position would render \u201csuperfluous\u201d section 7(e) of the Policy. The DOT also argues that, when read as a whole, the Driveway Policy \u201cdoes not require issuance of a permit solely on a showing of adequate protection.\u201d Finally, the DOT asserts that its interpretation and application of the Driveway Policy should be granted deference, especially in light of the \u201cextensive factual findings\u201d made by the hearings examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The initial question that we must answer is whether, under the Driveway Policy, a proposed driveway can adequately protect the safety of the traveling public and simultaneously cause an unreasonable hazard to the traveling public. RSA chapter 541 governs our review of the TAB decision. <em>See </em>RSA 21-L:18 (2012); RSA 541:2 (2007). Pursuant to RSA 541:13 (2007), a party seeking to set aside a decision of the TAB has the burden of demonstrating that the decision is \u201cclearly unreasonable or unlawful.\u201d The TAB decision will not be \u201cset aside or vacated except for errors of law,\u201d unless we are \u201csatisfied, by a clear preponderance of the evidence,\u201d that the TAB decision \u201cis unjust or unreasonable.\u201d RSA 541:13. The hearings examiner\u2019s findings of fact are presumed <em>prima facie </em>lawful and reasonable, <em>id., </em>and we review rulings on issues of law <em>d,e novo, see Appeal of Hillsborough County Nursing Home, </em>166 N.H. 731, 733 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\"> Resolving this threshold question requires statutory and regulatory interpretation. \u201cWe use the same principles of construction in interpreting administrative rules as we use with statutes.\u201d <em>Bovaird v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Admin. Servs., </em>166 N.H. 755, 758 (2014) (quotation omitted). We note that we have treated the Driveway Policy in the same manner as an administrative rule. <em>See Appeal of N.H. Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>152 N.H. 565, 569-76 (2005). \u201cWhen construing statutes and administrative regulations, we first examine the language used, and, where possible, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to words used.\u201d <em>Bovaird, </em>166 N.H. at 758 (quotation omitted). \u2018Words and phrases in a statute are construed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>according to the common and approved usage of the language unless from the statute it appears that a different meaning was intended.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 759 (quotation omitted). \u201cAdditionally, we interpret disputed language of a statute or regulation in the context of the overall statutory or regulatory scheme and not in isolation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cWe seek to effectuate the overall legislative purpose and to avoid an absurd or unjust result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\"> The DOT has \u201cbroad power to regulate driveways and other means of access to State highways and has made it unlawful for anyone to construct or alter any entrance onto a State highway without complying with the terms of a permit obtained from the DOT.\u201d <em>Appeal of N.H. Dep</em>'t <em>of Transportation, </em>152 N.H. at 568 (quotation and brackets omitted); <em>see </em>RSA 236:18 (Supp. 2015). RSA 236:13 \u201crequires a person to obtain a permit from the DOT before constructing driveway access to a class I or class III highway or to the State-maintained portion of a class II highway,\u201d which includes the Bypass. <em>Appeal of N.H. Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>152 N.H. at 568; <em>see </em>RSA 236:13, I-II. Because RSA 236:13 merely \u201cprovides the DOT with baseline parameters to consider when determining whether and under what conditions to grant such a permit,\u201d the DOT has the authority to adopt rules to \u201cfill in details to effectuate the purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>Appeal of N.H. Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>152 N.H. at 568-69, 571 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">In March 2000, the DOT adopted the Driveway Policy. It provides that the purpose of the driveway permitting process is to \u201c[pjrovide maximum safety and protection to the traveling public through the orderly control of traffic movement,\u201d maintain \u201cthe serviceability of affected highways,\u201d and \u201c[mjinimize conflict points.\u201d N.H. Driveway Policy \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">In this case, the TAB concluded that the petitioner\u2019s proposed driveway would adequately protect the safety of the traveling public, yet also found there to be sufficient support for the hearings examiner\u2019s conclusion that the proposed driveway would cause an unreasonable hazard to the traveling public. Whether these two conclusions can coexist turns on the specific language of the Driveway Policy. We, therefore, examine the terms \u201csafety\u201d and \u201cunreasonable hazard\u201d as used in sections 7(a) and 7(e). Because neither \u201csafety\u201d nor \u201cunreasonable hazard\u201d is defined in the Driveway Policy or in RSA 236:13, we look to the terms\u2019 \u201ccommon usage, using the dictionary for guidance.\u201d <em>K.L.N. Construction Co. v. Town of Pelham, </em>167 N.H. 180, 185 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u201csafe,\u201d in pertinent part, as \u201cfreed from harm, injury, or risk\u201d and \u201caffording protection from danger.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>1998 (unabridged ed. 2002). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201csafe\u201d as \u201c[n]ot exposed to danger; not causing danger.\u201d BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY 1536 (10th ed. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">By contrast, Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines a \u201chazard\u201d as \u201ca possible source of peril, danger, duress, or difficulty.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1041 (unabridged ed. 2002). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary provides that a \u201chazard\u201d is a \u201c[djanger or peril; especially], a factor contributing to a peril.\u201d BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY 834 (10th ed. 2014). \u201c[U]nreasonable\u201d is defined as \u201cexceeding the bounds of reason or moderation.\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 2507 (unabridged ed. 2002); <em>see also </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1772 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \u201cunreasonable\u201d as \u201c[n]ot guided by reason; irrational or capricious\u201d). Accordingly, we interpret an \u201cunreasonable hazard\u201d \u2014 as that term is used in the Driveway Policy \u2014 to be a peril that is excessively dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\"> Thus, a proposed driveway cannot adequately protect the safety of the traveling public and, at the same time, create an unreasonable hazard. Therefore, the TAB erred when, after concluding that the petitioner had met his burden of demonstrating that the proposed driveway would adequately protect the safety of the traveling public, it, nevertheless, upheld the hearings examiner\u2019s conclusion that the proposed driveway would also cause an unreasonable hazard to the traveling public. <em>See Appeal of Lemire-Courville Associates, </em>127 N.H. 21, 32 (1985) (explaining that \u201ccontradictory findings on material issues, made on the basis of a given evidentiary record, are necessarily capricious and insufficient to support a judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">In this case, under the Driveway Policy, the findings compel incompatible outcomes: the driveway permit <em>\u201cshall be issued\u201d </em>because \u201cthe safety of the traveling public can be adequately protected,\u201d and it <em>\u201cshall be denied\u201d </em>because the \u201cproposed driveway will cause an unreasonable hazard to the traveling public.\u201d N.H. Driveway Policy \u00a7 7(a), (e) (emphases added); <em>see In the Matter of Bazemore &amp; Jack, </em>153 N.H. 351, 354 (2006) (\u201cIt is a general rule of statutory construction that ... the word \u2018shall\u2019 makes enforcement of a provision mandatory.\u201d). Thus, logically, one of these mandatory outcomes must yield.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Here, it is significant that the DOT has not appealed the finding that the proposed driveway will adequately protect the safety of the traveling public. Rather, the DOT argues only that the application must be denied because, under section 7(e), the proposed driveway will cause an unreasonable hazard to the traveling public. Given that the two findings are mutually exclusive, and that the DOT has not challenged the finding concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>safety, we conclude that the finding regarding an unreasonable hazard cannot stand. Accordingly, we reverse the TAB decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">We need not address the DOT\u2019s remaining arguments because they rebut assertions made by the petitioner that we have not discussed. <em>See State v. Kardonsky, </em>169 N.H. 150, 154 (2016). Finally, if the DOT disagrees with our interpretation of the Driveway Policy, it is free to revise the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b422-6\">Dalianis, C.J., and Hicks, Conboy, and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
