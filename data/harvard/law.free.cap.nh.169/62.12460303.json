We affirm because we conclude that, although error, the juror\u2019s dismissal was not prejudicial because an impartial jury ultimately rendered the verdict in the defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The record supports the following facts. During jury selection for the defendant\u2019s trial, the trial court asked prospective jurors the following question: \u201cHave you or a close family member ever been accused of [sexual assault]?\u201d The following exchange occurred between one of the prospective jurors and the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">[JUROR]: You mentioned being directly connected with somebody that has been accused or convicted.... [M]y cousin\u2019s son [has] also been accused and is preparing to go to trial. I don\u2019t know [if] it will affect or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAiG\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"51\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAIoAAAAzAQAAAABgOa10AAAAN0lEQVR4nGP8z4AGDjKhizAwjAoNF6EnDAgEFbrHgEC4NSoxIBBUSIQBgaBCHAwIRB8PjQpBAAB3bgom/KGGlQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"138\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">THE COURT: So, would any of those experiences have any effect on your ability to be fair and impartial in deciding this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcQ\">[JUROR]: No. Each one is an individual and you got to go by the evidence. I learned that a long time ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">THE COURT: Okay. So you can be fair and impartial and decide the case based solely on the evidence presented and the law as I instruct you on it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">[JUROR]: Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-10\">THE COURT: Yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\">[JUROR]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">The State then further questioned the juror:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-13\">[STATE]: Okay. So the fact that this 10 year old [in your relative\u2019s case] made up a story about a sexual assault, wouldn\u2019t that color your views when listening to another child if they were to say that they were sexually assaulted by someone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-14\">[JUROR]: Not necessarily. It depends on how the child was raised, it depends on if the parents stress honesty with the child and all things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-15\">[STATE]: But you\u2019re not going to hear necessarily how the child was raised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-16\">[JUROR]: No, I\u2019m not. I\u2019d have to go by the evidence presented.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACQG\">[STATE]: And \u2014 but if the evidence presented is limited to just her testimony and the testimony of the other witnesses, wouldn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>your experience with [your relative] color your view as to what constitutes a reasonable doubt versus \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">[JUROR]: I would have to take what was said at face value. I would have to \u2014 because I don\u2019t know the parties involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Having used all of its peremptory challenges, the State asked the trial court to dismiss the juror for cause, arguing that her ability to \u201cfairly and accurately judge this case\u201d was \u201ctoo close for comfort.\u201d The trial court asked the juror if she \u201cwould still be able to evaluate the credibility of the alleged victim and every witness based on the factors\u201d in the present case; the juror responded, \u2018Tes.\u201d The trial court found the juror qualified to sit on the jury, and declined to dismiss her for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">During a subsequent pre-trial evidentiary hearing, the State again asked that the juror be struck for cause because the State had learned that the attorney representing the juror\u2019s relative worked in the same public defender\u2019s office as the defendant\u2019s attorney. The trial court denied the State\u2019s request, noting that the juror \u201cwas quite firm in her expressions that she could be fair and impartial and indifferent,\u201d and observing that, because the juror \u201cwasn\u2019t aware ... and ha[d] no reason to be aware of\u2019 the professional relationship between the attorneys, the juror\u2019s connection to the defendant\u2019s counsel was \u201cattenuated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">On the second day of trial, the State again asked to dismiss the juror for cause, arguing that, during her opening statement, defense counsel made a \u201cdirect appeal to [the juror\u2019s] prior experience with her [relative].\u201d Defense counsel had stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">This is the kind of charge that brings all kinds to mind. People on the jury want to sometimes put in their own meanings, thoughts, bring their own background, fetishes, or passion about the very nature of this kind of charge. But when everything is said and done, again, this case will have done something very simple. This case is about a little girl who wanted attention and boy did she get it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-11\">We all know, we\u2019ve all met, we\u2019ve had first-hand information of people who make things up for reasons that aren\u2019t all together clear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">Defense counsel explained that she had merely provided a \u201cgeneral layout of the case,\u201d denying that her remarks were directed specifically to the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-13\">The trial court granted the State\u2019s request to remove the juror for cause, observing that although it had found the juror impartial at the time of jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>selection, defense counsel\u2019s opening statement was an appeal to the juror\u2019s personal experiences with her relative. The trial court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">[I]n the circumstances presented, I am now finding that [the juror] can no longer be fair, impartial, and unbiased; that is, that she can no longer be indifferent as it relates to this particular case where certainly, according to the Defense\u2019s opening, and the evidence introduced thus far at trial on cross-examination of the State\u2019s witnesses, one of the, perhaps, an important part of the Defendant\u2019s defense is that [the victim], for whatever reason, is making this stuff up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">After a three-day trial, the jury convicted the defendant on two counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">The defendant argues that the trial court erred when it dismissed the juror for cause after the jury had been sworn and the trial had begun. He asserts that because the trial court found the juror\u2019s affirmations that she could remain impartial credible, and because there is no evidence that the juror\u2019s impartiality was impacted by subsequent events, the juror remained qualified to serve and should not have been removed. The State counters that the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the juror was proper given the \u201ccumulative effect ... of all of the potential factors that weighed against [the juror\u2019s] impartiality,\u201d including defense counsel\u2019s opening statement and the professional connection between the attorney for the juror\u2019s relative and the defendant\u2019s attorney. Moreover, the State argues that, even if the dismissal was error, it does not warrant reversal because an impartial jury rendered the verdict, and, therefore, the defendant cannot show that he was prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">\u201cIt is a fundamental precept of our system of justice that a defendant has the right to be tried by a fair and impartial jury.\u201d <em>State v. Addison, </em>161 N.H. 300, 303 (2010) (quotation omitted). Generally, a juror is presumed to be impartial. <em>Id. </em>To be found impartial, a juror \u201cneed not come into the trial with no information or impression of the nature of the case. It is sufficient if the juror can lay aside her impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\u201d <em>State v. Weir, </em>138 N.H. 671, 676 (1994) (quotation and brackets omitted). When a juror\u2019s impartiality is questioned, the trial court has a duty to determine whether the juror is indifferent. <em>Addison, </em>161 N.H. at 303. \u201cIt is well settled that whether a prospective juror is free from prejudice is a determination to be made in the first instance by the trial court on <em>voir dire.\u201d Id. </em>\u201cThe manner in which <em>voir dire </em>is conducted is wholly within the sound discretion of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted). \u201cIf it appears that any juror is not indifferent, the juror shall be set aside on that trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u201cThe trial court\u2019s determination of the impartiality of the jurors selected is essentially a question of demeanor and credibility and, thus, is entitled to special deference.\u201d <em>State v. Tabaldi, </em>165 N.H. 306, 312-13 (2013). \u201cWe will not disturb the trial court\u2019s ruling absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion or a finding that the trial judge\u2019s decision was against the weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313 (quotation omitted). When we determine whether a ruling made by a judge is a proper exercise of judicial discretion, we are deciding whether the record establishes an objective basis sufficient to sustain the discretionary judgment made. <em>State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 296 (2001). \u201cTo show an unsustainable exercise of discretion, the defendant must demonstrate that the court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>State v. Perri, </em>164 N.H. 400, 408 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">We first address whether the trial court erred when it dismissed the juror for cause mid-trial. We conclude that the record does not establish an objective basis sufficient to sustain the trial court\u2019s finding. First, during jury selection, the juror repeatedly stated that she could remain impartial, and there is nothing in the record to suggest that the trial court doubted the veracity of her repeated affirmations. <em>See Tabaldi, </em>165 N.H. at 313 (upholding trial court\u2019s determination that juror was impartial after juror \u201caffirmatively ... sa[id] that she would not try [the] case on the basis of [the defendant\u2019s] reputation or his past\u201d (quotations and brackets omitted)). Moreover, the record does not show that the professional connection between the attorney for the juror\u2019s relative and the defendant\u2019s attorney affected the juror\u2019s ability to be impartial. <em>Cf. State v. White, </em>105 N.H. 159, 161 (1963) (concluding that trial court did not err when it dismissed a juror who \u201cat one time had employed one of the defendant\u2019s attorneys\u201d and was a \u201csteady client\u201d of an associate of that attorney). To the contrary, as the trial court observed, the juror \u201cwasn\u2019t aware . . . and ha[d] no reason to be aware of\u2019 the professional relationship between the attorneys, and, thus, any connection she might have had to the defendant\u2019s counsel was \u201cattenuated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Additionally, the record does not support the trial court\u2019s finding that defense counsel\u2019s comment during her opening statement \u2014 that \u201c[w]e all know . . . people who make things up\u201d \u2014 affected the juror\u2019s ability to remain impartial. During her opening statement, defense counsel merely advanced a common theory of defense \u2014 that the alleged victim is lying. This statement falls well within the bounds of proper advocacy. <em>See </em>2A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>McNamara, New Hampshire Practice: Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a732.11, at 10 (2010) (opening statements allow \u201ccounsel to explain the defendant\u2019s theory of the case to the jury\u201d); <em>State v. Morais, </em>819 A.2d 424, 429 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2003) (observing that prosecutor \u201cappropriately called upon all jurors to draw from their personal experiences and common sense\u201d). We note that the trial court did not question the juror to determine whether counsel\u2019s statement affected her impartiality, nor does the record show that there was an objective basis sufficient to sustain the trial court\u2019s determination that, \u201cin the circumstances presented,\u201d the juror could \u201cno longer be fair, impartial, and unbiased.\u201d <em>Cf. Tabaldi, </em>165 N.H. at 313 (upholding trial court\u2019s determination that juror was impartial because record showed that trial court asked juror \u201ca number of questions,\u201d including whether she could \u201caffirmatively . . . say\u201d that she could be impartial (quotation omitted)). Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred when it dismissed the juror for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">We now turn to whether the trial court\u2019s erroneous dismissal of the juror requires reversal of the defendant\u2019s convictions. The defendant argues that we must reverse because the trial court, through error, allowed the State\u2019s \u201cmeritless mid-trial cause challenge\u201d to improperly \u201cshape the jury\u2019s composition.\u201d Citing our decision in <em>State v. Sullivan, </em>157 N.H. 124 (2008), the defendant asserts that the erroneous mid-trial dismissal of a juror in and of itself \u2014 without regard to its impact on the impartiality of the jury that ultimately rendered the verdict \u2014 requires reversal. The State counters that even if the trial court erred when it dismissed the juror, an impartial jury decided the defendant\u2019s case, and, therefore, reversal is not required because there was no prejudice. We agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Sullivan </em>is misplaced. In that case, the trial judge dismissed a juror after deliberations had begun \u201cas a result of [the] cumulative effect\u201d of the juror\u2019s behavior, including the juror\u2019s refusal to follow the court\u2019s instructions. <em>Sullivan, </em>157 N.H. at 136-37, 140 (quotation omitted). On appeal, we held that the trial court erred when it dismissed the juror because the juror\u2019s inability \u201cto carefully consider the evidence presented at trial, and to deliver a fair and true verdict on the charges against the defendant in accordance with the law outlined by the trial court\u201d did not \u201cappear in the record as a demonstrable reality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137 (quotation omitted), 139-40. We reversed the defendant\u2019s convictions, explaining that \u201cthe non-meritorious discharge of a <em>deliberating </em>juror is a violation of a fundamental constitutional right\u201d because \u201cthe defendant had a vested interest in [a properly impaneled juror\u2019s] <em>continued participation in deliberations </em>that should not have been disturbed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>Here, the trial court dismissed the juror on the second day of trial, rather than during deliberations. Thus, <em>Sullivan </em>is distinguishable because, here, the removal of the juror did not disrupt deliberations. <em>See id. </em>at 137-41. Indeed, the defendant \u201cdoes <em>not </em>argue that the jury that <em>did </em>sit on his case was not impartial.\u201d <em>State v. Addison, (Capital Murder), </em>165 N.H. 381, 449 (2013). \u201cAccordingly, [his] right of trial by an impartial jury is not implicated in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Rather, as the State correctly observes, the defendant has shown only that \u201cthe effect of the trial court\u2019s ruling\u201d was \u201cto diminish the jury panel from fourteen impartial jurors to thirteen, and the number of alternate jurors from two to one.\u201d Therefore, the defendant has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating prejudice. <em>See id. </em>(observing that, generally, a criminal defendant alleging juror bias bears the burden to demonstrate actual prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Thus, because the defendant has not demonstrated \u2014 or even argued \u2014 that the jury that convicted him was not impartial, we conclude that reversal is not warranted. <em>See Perri, </em>164 N.H. at 408. Any issue raised in the defendant\u2019s notice of appeal that he has not briefed is deemed waived. <em>See State v. Blackmer, </em>149 N.H. 47, 49 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b112-6\">Dalianis, C.J., and Hicks, Conboy, and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
