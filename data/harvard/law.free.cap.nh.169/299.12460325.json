He argues that the trial court erred: (1) in granting the petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss based upon the defense of recrimination; (2) in failing to award him more than half of the marital estate; and (8) in failing to retroactively modify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>temporary support orders based upon the petitioner\u2019s allegedly understated income. Because we hold that a party\u2019s actions after the divorce petition has been filed can be used as a basis for the defense of recrimination, and that the respondent withdrew his request to modify the temporary support orders, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The trial court found, or the record supports, the following facts. The parties were married on July 27, 2002, and had two children prior to their separation in 2011. The petitioner filed for divorce in December 2011, alleging both fault and irreconcilable differences as grounds for divorce. <em>See </em>RSA 458:7, V (2004); :7-a (Supp. 2015). The respondent cross-petitioned for divorce on fault-based grounds, due to the petitioner\u2019s alleged adultery, <em>see </em>RSA 458:7, II (2004), and irreconcilable differences.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Approximately eleven months after the petitioner filed for divorce, the respondent began a sexual relationship with another woman. The petitioner filed a motion to dismiss, alleging recrimination by the respondent. The trial court granted the motion over the respondent\u2019s objection. In 2015, the court entered a final decree of divorce citing irreconcilable differences as the cause of the marital breakdown. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">The respondent appeals the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the fault-based ground in his cross-petition for divorce. Specifically, he argues that his infidelity, which occurred eleven months after the parties\u2019 separation, could not be used as a basis for the defense of recrimination. The petitioner argues that the trial court did not err in granting the motion to dismiss because the respondent was not an \u201cinnocent party\u201d within the meaning of the statute. RSA 458:7 (2004). The petitioner raises a preservation issue regarding this argument, but we hold that the issue is properly presented because the respondent\u2019s notice of appeal alleged that the trial court erred in granting the petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>See </em>Sup. Ct. R. 16(3)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">In considering the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion to dismiss, \u201cour standard of review is whether the allegations in the [respondent\u2019s] pleadings are reasonably susceptible of a construction that would permit recovery.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Kenick &amp; Bailey, </em>156 N.H. 356, 358 (2007). \u201cWe assume the [respondent\u2019s] pleadings to be true and construe all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom most favorably to [him].\u201d <em>Id. </em>We note that the trial court considered the undisputed claim that the respondent began a sexual relationship with another woman after the petitioner filed for divorce, and neither party argues that the trial court erred in doing so. <em>Cf. Hill v. Dobrowolski, </em>125 N.H. 572, 573 (1984) (considering facts outside the pleadings where both parties and trial court did so).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">Resolution of this issue requires us to engage in statutory interpretation. We review a trial court\u2019s interpretation of a statute <em>de novo. See In the Matter of Hampers &amp; Hampers, </em>166 N.H. 422, 433 (2014). \u201cWe are the final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>arbiter of the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe interpret legislative intent from the statute as written, and we will not consider what the legislature might have said or add words that the legislature did not include.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, \u201c[w]e interpret statutes in the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">RSA 458:7 states that \u201c[a] divorce from the bonds of matrimony shall be decreed in favor of <em>the innocent party </em>for any of\u2019 the enumerated causes including \u201c[a]dultery of either party.\u201d RSA 458:7 (emphasis added). \u201c[I]n-nocent\u201d means \u201cfree from guilt,\u201d and \u201c[o]ur court has stated flatly that a spouse who is guilty of an offense against the other spouse, which would be grounds for divorce, cannot himself obtain\u201d a divorce under RSA 458:7. <em>Rockwood v. Rockwood, </em>105 N.H. 129, 131 (1963) (quotations omitted). \u201cIn other words, recrimination is a defense against a spouse who is not innocent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\"> \u201cGenerally, although the misconduct of the plaintiff occurs after the commencement of his or her suit, it is as fully effective to bar the right to a [fault-based] divorce therein as if it had occurred previous to the commencement of the suit.\u201d 24 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Divorce and Separation </em>\u00a7 162, at 868 (2008). This general proposition is reflected in the plain language of RSA 458:7, which states that a divorce \u201cshall be decreed in favor of the innocent party.\u201d RSA 458:7. The statute necessarily requires that one be an \u201cinnocent party\u201d at the time of the decree. <em>Id. </em>The statute makes no exception for fault-based grounds that arise prior to the final decree, regardless of whether they arise before or after the filing of the divorce petition. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, the trial court correctly considered the respondent\u2019s post-petition conduct when deciding the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Here, it is undisputed that the respondent was still married when he began a sexual relationship with a woman who was not his wife. <em>See In the Matter of Blanchflower &amp; Blanchflower, </em>150 N.H. 226, 227 (2003) (defining adultery as \u201cvoluntary sexual intercourse between a married man and someone other than his wife\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>see also In the Matter of Dube &amp; Dube, </em>163 N.H. 575, 579-80 (2012) (holding that husband\u2019s infidelity precluded him from claiming status as an \u201cinnocent party\u201d under RSA 458:7). Thus, we are not persuaded that the trial court erred by granting the petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">The respondent argues that the defense of recrimination is unavailable to the petitioner because his adultery did not cause the breakdown of the marriage. However, recrimination does not turn upon which party\u2019s conduct caused the marital breakdown. Rather, the \u201cright to set up one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>matrimonial offense in bar of another is an application of the equitable rule that one who invokes the aid of a court must come into it with a clear conscience and clean hands.\u201d <em>Brewies v. Brewies, </em>178 S.W.2d 84, 85 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1943) (quotation omitted); <em>De Burgh v. De Burgh, </em>250 P.2d 598, 605 (Cal. 1952) (noting that the defense of recrimination is encompassed within the unclean hands doctrine). Thus, it need only be shown that a spouse is not an \u201cinnocent party\u201d because he or she \u201cis guilty of an offense against the other spouse, which would be grounds for divorce.\u201d <em>Rockwood, </em>105 N.H. at 131 (quotation omitted). Causation is not an element of the defense of recrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The respondent also asserts that \u201c[i]t is not reasonable to suggest, in these times of protracted discovery and litigation, that a party to a divorce must remain celibate for the duration of the proceedings\u201d to obtain a fault-based divorce. However, this argument is made in the wrong forum. \u201cMatters of public policy are reserved for the legislature, and we therefore leave to it the task of addressing the [respondent\u2019s] concerns.\u201d <em>Petition of Kilton, </em>156 N.H. 632, 645 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Given our conclusion that the trial court did not err in dismissing the respondent\u2019s fault-based divorce cross-petition, we need not address his argument that the court should have awarded him more than half of the marital estate. That argument is premised upon his erroneous contention that the trial court should not have granted the petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss his cross-petition for a fault-based divorce. <em>See Chabot v. Chabot, </em>126 N.H. 793, 795 (1985) (\u201c[I]f the plaintiff does not prove fault on which divorce can be granted and the court grants a divorce on the ground of irreconcilable differences, fault would not be considered on the questions of property division or alimony.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The respondent next argues that the trial court erred by failing to grant his motion to modify its temporary support orders, due to the petitioner\u2019s alleged underreporting of her income. The petitioner argues that because the respondent withdrew this motion in the trial court, the court did not err. We agree with the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">The respondent filed his motion to modify in March 2018. At that time, the trial court ruled that the motion would be considered during the final hearing. However, on June 26, 2014, more than year later, the court held a hearing on pending motions, including the modification motion. At that hearing, respondent\u2019s counsel stated that the respondent \u201cnever attempted to modify\u201d the temporary support orders based upon the petitioner\u2019s \u201cgrossly under reported financial affidavit.\u201d When counsel for the petitioner pointed out the respondent\u2019s March 2018 motion, respondent\u2019s counsel replied that \u201c[i]t was withdrawn, Judge, never presented.\u201d The court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>order on the pending motions, which adjusted the parties\u2019 temporary support obligations based upon other considerations, does not mention the issue of the petitioner\u2019s allegedly underreported income. The court added that its order \u201cresolve[d] all pending motions before the Court.\u201d Respondent\u2019s trial counsel later claimed that he had not withdrawn the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">We are not persuaded by any of the respondent\u2019s arguments that the issue regarding the petitioner\u2019s alleged underreported income is properly before us. He argues that the \u201cissue of withdrawal... was waived\u201d because the petitioner \u201cdid not cross-appeal.\u201d However, the respondent fails to explain this bare assertion; thus, we reject it as undeveloped. <em>See Auger v. Town of Strafford, </em>156 N.H. 64, 68 (2007). The respondent, who is represented by different counsel on appeal, also questions what motive trial counsel could have had to withdraw the motion and argues that \u201cat most there was some sort of misunderstanding.\u201d However, trial counsel\u2019s motives are irrelevant: the record shows that counsel made an unambiguous representation to the court that he had, in fact, withdrawn the motion. Therefore, we are not persuaded that the court erred when it did not address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Finally, \u201cany issues raised in the notice of appeal, but not fully briefed, are deemed waived.\u201d <em>Mountain View Park, LLC v. Robson, </em>168 N.H. 117, 121 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b348-8\">Dalianis, C.J., and Conboy, Lynn, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
