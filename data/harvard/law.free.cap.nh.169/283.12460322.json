We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b328-17\">The record reflects the following facts. In May 2012, the defendant kidnapped the victim, who, at the time, was pregnant with his child. The child was born soon after. In March 2013, the defendant pleaded guilty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>six criminal charges for which prison sentences were imposed. Three of the sentences were imposed \u201cstand committed,\u201d requiring the defendant to be imprisoned immediately. The remaining three sentences were suspended for twelve years from the date of the defendant\u2019s eventual release from prison. All six of the defendant\u2019s sentences included the following provision, which we term the \u201cno-contact\u201d provision for the purpose of this appeal: \u201cThe defendant shall have no contact with [the victim] ... or any members of her immediate family, by mail, phone, email, text message, social networking or through third parties. The defendant shall have no contact with these persons in any manner whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">In August 2014, the defendant filed a petition in the circuit court to establish a parenting plan for his and the victim\u2019s child. In the petition, the defendant averred that he was the child\u2019s biological father and that he \u201cwould like a [mediator [a]ppointed to help [him and the victim] to create a Parenting Plan.\u201d The defendant also averred that he had had no contact with the child and that there was \u201ccurrently a restraining order in full effect.\u201d He requested that the court send the victim \u201c[a]ll copies of Motions, Notification[s], [and] Financial Affidavits\u201d on his behalf. He did not mention the no-contact provision of his sentences. According to the defendant, and not apparently disputed by the State, the victim accepted service of the petition at the courthouse, after having been contacted by the court. Thereafter, she filed a petition to terminate the defendant\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">On December 2, the State moved to impose a portion of the defendant\u2019s suspended sentences. Although the State conceded that the defendant\u2019s parental rights had not been terminated, it argued that he had violated the no-contact provision of those sentences by filing the parenting petition. Following a hearing on the State\u2019s motion, the trial court ruled on the record that the no-contact provision was clear and unambiguous and that, by filing the parenting petition, the defendant willfully violated it. Accordingly, the court granted the State\u2019s motion, imposing two to four years of the defendant\u2019s suspended sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred when it found that he violated the no-contact provision of his suspended sentences. He contends that because he could not reasonably have known that filing the parenting petition would violate the no-contact provision, imposing a portion of his suspended sentences infringed upon his state and federal due process rights. <em>See </em>N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 15; U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV. We first address the defendant\u2019s arguments under the State Constitution, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>relying upon federal law only to aid our analysis. <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983). We review questions of constitutional law <em>de novo. State v. French, </em>163 N.H. 1, 3 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u201cDue process requires a sentencing court to make clear at the time of sentencing in plain and certain terms what punishment it is exacting as well as the extent to which the court retains discretion to impose punishment at a later date and under what conditions the sentence may be modified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and emphasis omitted). \u201cThe sentencing order must clearly communicate to the defendant the exact nature of the sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cWe have recognized that termination of freedom by revocation of a suspended sentence involves constitutional liberty interests protected by the [State] Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>State v. Budgett, </em>146 N.H. 135, 137-38 (2001) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Some sentencing terms are implied and \u201cneed not be explicitly stated to give fair warning to the [defendant], such as that if [he] commits a crime, he will lose the privilege of his conditional liberty.\u201d <em>State v. Kay, </em>162 N.H. 237, 242 (2011). However, \u201c[w]hen the deprivation of a defendant\u2019s conditional liberty rests upon the commission of a non-criminal act, he must be given some warning in order to ensure that he understands, in plain and certain terms, the conditions of his sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cDue process mandates that a defendant be given actual notice that such conduct could result in the revocation of his conditional liberty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo hold otherwise would effectively modify the terms of the original sentencing order and result in fundamental unfairness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The interpretation of a sentencing order is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">On the surface, the disposition of this case might appear straightforward. The sentencing order plainly prohibits the defendant from having <em>any </em>contact \u201cin any manner whatsoever\u201d with the victim or her immediate family, including contact through third parties; by filing the parenting petition, the defendant caused such contact to occur. But we cannot simply say \u201cend of story\u201d and resolve the case on this basis because there are broader constitutional principles at stake. Here, the sentencing order did not give the defendant fair warning that filing the parenting petition constituted \u201ccontact\u201d such that his suspended sentences could be imposed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\"> The no-contact provision implicates two of the defendant\u2019s constitutionally-protected rights: (1) his right of access to the courts; and (2) his fundamental liberty interest in parenting his child. <em>See Goodnow v. Perrin, </em>120 N.H. 669, 673 (1980) (\u201cThere is no doubt that prisoners have a constitutional right of access to the courts . . . .\u201d (quotation omitted)); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>Petition of Kerry D., </em>144 N.H. 146, 149 (1999) (State Constitution protects an individual\u2019s fundamental liberty interest in parenting); <em>Troxel v. Granville, 53</em>0 U.S. 57, 66 (2000) (plurality opinion) (Federal Constitution protects the fundamental right to parent). Yet, the no-contact provision references neither right. Nor was either right mentioned in the plea colloquy or at any other time during the original sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Moreover, a condition that the defendant relinquish his constitutional right of access to the courts to enforce his fundamental liberty interest in parenting is not akin to the condition \u201cof any suspended sentence . . . , whether expressly stated or not,... that the defendant shall not violate the law.\u201d <em>Budgett, </em>146 N.H. at 138 (quotation omitted). Such condition is not \u201cso basic and fundamental that any reasonable person would be aware of [it].\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Unlike a condition that a defendant will lose the privilege of his conditional liberty if he commits a crime, a condition that a defendant will lose that privilege if he accesses the courts to preserve his parenting rights must \u201cbe explicitly stated to give [him] fair warning.\u201d <em>Kay, </em>162 N.H. at 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Although the record is unclear as to whether the defendant was subject to a domestic violence protective order when he filed the parenting petition, even if he were, he could not have reasonably understood that filing the petition violated that order. Pursuant to RSA 173-B:5-a, 11(c) (2014), \u201c[a] no-contact provision in a [domestic violence] protective order . . . shall not be construed to . . . [p]revent a defendant or defendant\u2019s counsel from sending the plaintiff copies of any legal pleadings filed in court relating to the domestic violence petition or related civil or criminal matters.\u201d Applicable court rules similarly provide that \u201c[a] no-contact order in a domestic violence, stalking, or similar matter shall not be deemed to prevent either party from filing appearances, motions, and other appropriate pleadings with the court.\u201d Fam. Div. R. 1.23(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Under all of the circumstances of this case, we hold that the defendant could not reasonably have understood that the no-contact provision of his suspended sentences precluded him from exercising his constitutional right to access the courts to protect his fundamental right to parent. <em>See Kay, </em>162 N.H. at 242 (concluding that when the sentencing order \u201cplainly\u201d required the defendant to pay child support and informed him that compliance was to occur through his probation officer, the defendant must \u201creasonably have understood\u201d that his probation officer had the authority to establish the amount of periodic payments and to require him to remain in contact); <em>cf. State v. Foote, </em>149 N.H. 323, 325 (2003) (\u201cIt is well established that when waiving a constitutional right, one must do so voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently with sufficient awareness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>relevant circumstances and likely consequences.\u201d (quotation and brackets omitted)). We conclude that the no-contact provision of the defendant\u2019s suspended sentences failed to give him fair warning that his conditional liberty could be forfeited by the commission of an act that not only was not criminal, but was also constitutionally protected \u2014 namely, the filing of a parenting petition in circuit court. <em>See Kay, </em>162 N.H. at 242. Thus, the defendant may not be punished for invoking that right. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights as guaranteed by the State Constitution when it imposed a portion of his suspended sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Because we have determined that the trial court\u2019s order violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights under the State Constitution, we need not reach the parties\u2019 arguments under the Federal Constitution; <em>see Ball, </em>124 N.H. at 237, or their other remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b332-7\">Dalianis, C.J., and Hicks, Conboy, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
