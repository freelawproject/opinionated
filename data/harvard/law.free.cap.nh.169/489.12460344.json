On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred when it excluded evidence alleging that the victim had expressed to her prior partners an interest in bondage-related sexual activities. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">The relevant facts follow. A Strafford County grand jury indicted the defendant on seven charges relating to the victim\u2019s October 2012 death. The State charged two alternative-theory counts of first degree murder, one alleging a purpose to kill and the other alleging a knowing murder while committing felonious sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">The central disputed issue at the defendant\u2019s trial concerned the circumstances of the victim\u2019s death. The State contended that the defendant, enraged by the victim\u2019s refusal to participate in a sexual encounter with him and his girlfriend, attacked the victim from behind while she was watching a movie, strangling her with a rope. The State further asserted that, after the victim had died, the defendant sexually assaulted her.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">By contrast, the defense theory was that the victim died during a consensual sexual encounter with the defendant and his girlfriend. According to that theory, the victim allowed the defendant and his girlfriend to put a \u201charness\u201d around her and then had consensual sexual intercourse with the defendant, while his girlfriend accidently smothered her. The defense theory was based upon the story that the defendant\u2019s girlfriend had initially told the defense team in October 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Before trial, the defendant filed a motion to introduce evidence alleging that the victim, then a 19-year-old college student, had previously expressed interest in bondage-related sexual activities. The defense sought to admit evidence alleging that the victim had expressed interest in such activities to her prior sexual partner in May 2010, approximately two and one-half years before her murder. The defense also sought to admit evidence alleging that she had expressed the same interest more recently to her then-current sexual partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The defendant argued that, without the evidence alleging that the victim had previously expressed interest in bondage-related sexual activity, \u201cany claims that [the victim] would consent\u201d to bondage-related activities with the defendant and his girlfriend \u201cwould seem objectively counterintuitive and implausible.\u201d The defendant\u2019s pretrial motion also sought to introduce evidence of specific instances of the victim\u2019s alleged prior sexual conduct. However, at the trial court hearing on the motion, defense counsel clarified that counsel sought only to introduce evidence of the victim\u2019s alleged \u201copenness\u201d to bondage-related sexual activities and would not seek to introduce evidence alleging specific instances of her prior consensual sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The trial court denied the motion, pursuant to New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 412. <em>See </em>N.H. R. Ev. 412. The court explained that, under Rule 412, \u201cinquiry into the prior consensual activities of victims is generally prohibited,\u201d but that \u201c[i]n certain instances,... protection of the victim and her privacy rights must yield to a defendant\u2019s right to due process and to confront accusers.\u201d (Quotation and brackets omitted.) \u201cThus,\u201d the court further explained, \u201ca defendant must be given the opportunity to demonstrate that due process requires admission of a victim\u2019s prior sexual conduct,\u201d by demonstrating that the evidence \u201cis relevant\u201d and that \u201cits probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect on the victim.\u201d (Quotations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The court first found that the evidence alleging the victim\u2019s prior expressions of interest in bondage-related sexual activities was not relevant to show that the victim consented to engage in such activities with the defendant and his girlfriend. The court also determined that, even if it were to accept the defendant\u2019s theory that the evidence had some relevance to show that the victim would consent to engage in bondage-related sexual activities with the defendant and his girlfriend, its probative value was outweighed by prejudice to the victim and her family.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">On four occasions during the trial, the defendant argued that the State had opened the door to the evidence alleging that the victim had previously expressed interest in bondage-related sexual activities. On each occasion, the trial court disagreed and precluded the defendant from introducing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>challenged evidence. Ultimately, the jury convicted the defendant on both alternative theory first degree murder charges, and he was sentenced on one. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">We first address the defendant\u2019s assertion that the trial court erred when it denied his pretrial motion to introduce evidence alleging that the victim had previously expressed interest in bondage-related sexual activities. The defendant argues that the trial court erred by applying Rule 412 to the challenged evidence. Alternatively, the defendant contends that, even if Rule 412 applies to the evidence, the trial court erred by determining that the evidence was irrelevant to a material issue and that, even if relevant, the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by its prejudicial effect on the victim and her family, and that excluding the evidence under Rule 412 violated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">We review the trial court\u2019s ruling for an unsustainable exercise of discretion, and will reverse only if it was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of the defendant\u2019s case. <em>State v. Kim, </em>153 N.H. 322, 327 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Rule 412 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-8\">(a) Except as constitutionally required, and then only in the manner provided in (b), below, evidence of prior consensual sexual activity between the victim and any person other than the defendant shall not be admitted into evidence in any prosecution or in any pretrial discovery proceeding undertaken in anticipation of a prosecution under the laws of this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-9\">(b) Upon motion by the defense filed in accordance with the then applicable Rules of Court, the defense shall be given an opportunity to demonstrate, during a hearing in chambers, in the manner provided for in Rule 104:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA81\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"43\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAPEAAAArAQAAAACBFVPtAAAAQklEQVR4nGP8z4APNDLhlWZgGJUflR+VJyT/Ewlhk//RgECkmc/4n4GBgeEnOwKhAGj+ZUVC2MxnQkKk2T8qjx8AACz0ETUjwzvkAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"242\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-10\">(2) <em>Use of Evidence At Tr</em>ial: that due process requires the admission of the evidence proffered by the defense which would be otherwise excluded under subsection (a), above, and the probative value in the context of the case in issue outweighs its prejudicial effect on the victim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">N.H. R. Ev. 412. The defendant contends that Rule 412 does not apply to the challenged evidence because the evidence at issue concerns alleged statements of interest, not specific instances of the victim\u2019s alleged sexual conduct. For the purposes of this appeal, we assume without deciding that the defendant is correct. Nonetheless, the trial court properly excluded the challenged evidence on the ground that it lacked probative value, or, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>other words, was irrelevant to establish that the victim consented to engage in bondage-related sexual activities with the defendant and his girlfriend. <em>See </em>N.H. R. Ev. 401, 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">To be admissible at trial, evidence must be relevant; that is, it must have a \u201c \u2018tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Higgins, </em>149 N.H. 290, 297 (2003) (quoting N.H. R. Ev. 401). The defendant argues that the challenged evidence is relevant because it \u201cundermine[s] a significant obstacle to the jury\u2019s acceptance\u201d of the defense theory that the victim\u2019s sexual encounter with the defendant and his girlfriend was consensual. The defendant asserts that the \u201csignificant obstacle\u201d to the jury\u2019s acceptance of the defense theory is its presumption that the victim had \u201cordinary attitudes about sexual practices\u201d and \u201cwould have no interest in engaging in [bondage-related sexual] techniques under any circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The defendant acknowledges that \u201c[i]n jury selection, many prospective jurors agreed that, in the absence of information, they would make no assumptions about whether a person might have an interest in [bondage-related sexual activities].\u201d However, he argues that \u201cby the time of deliberations, the jurors knew a great deal about [the victim\u2019s] many admirable qualities,\u201d and that, therefore, \u201cthere is a significant risk that [they] would presume . . . that she would share the culturally-typical aversion to [bondage-related sexual activities] and .. . would not under any circumstances willingly participate in it.\u201d The relevance of the challenged evidence, he contends, \u201clay in its capacity to neutralize\u201d the presumption that the victim \u201cwas a normal person\u201d who would not consent to bondage-related sexual activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">We find <em>Higgins, </em>149 N.H. at 297, instructive. In that case, the defendant sought to question the victim about \u201cwhether she previously had consented to acts of bondage, sadomasochism or sodomy in exchange for drugs or money.\u201d <em>Higgins, </em>149 N.H. at 295. The defendant contended \u201cthat this line of inquiry was relevant to his defense theory that the victim consented to being restrained and to engaging in anal intercourse with him because she was previously willing to engage in acts she otherwise found objectionable in order to gain money to support her drug habit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We rejected the defendant\u2019s relevance argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">To be admissible at trial, evidence must be relevant; that is, it must have a tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence. We find no merit to the defendant\u2019s contention that prior acts of anal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>intercourse, bondage and sadomasochism in the course of the victim\u2019s prostitution would have made it more probable that she allowed him to restrain her with handcuffs, shackles and rope and consented to anal intercourse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">Consent to sexual conduct with one person in no way implies consent to such activity with another. Each decision to consent is a new act, a choice made on the circumstances prevailing in the present, not governed by the past. Whether a woman previously engaged in a particular type of sexual activity, such as anal intercourse or sadomasochistic role-play, with another person has no bearing, in and of itself, on whether she agreed to do so with the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAdq\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"58\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAHcAAAA6AQAAAACihPuVAAAAQUlEQVR4nGP8z4AM/jMxoIJR/ih/kPH/O0ARgwIDAxMDw78HUPT/A1b1TApQxCjAwMDEwMDoAEUMCxgYGAd5+gcATCwRr0pnSTMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"119\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">We recognize that circumstances may arise which may make a prostitute\u2019s past consensual sexual activity relevant to her bias, prejudice or motive to fabricate. In this case, the defendant argues only that the evidence sought would have been offered to show her propensity to engage in sodomy, bondage and sadomasochism and thus, make it more probable that she would have consented to engage in such conduct with him, a position we reject under the circumstances of this case. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant failed to establish that his proposed line of inquiry during the deposition process could have led to any relevant information which would have aided the jury in ascertaining any specific fact contested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 297-98 (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Like the defendant in <em>Higgins, </em>the defendant here seeks to introduce the challenged evidence to show that the sexual encounter at issue was consensual. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertions, the only relevance of the challenged evidence in this case is that it shows the victim\u2019s alleged propensity to consent to bondage-related sexual activities. Just as the propensity evidence in <em>Higgins </em>was not relevant to show that the encounter between the victim and the defendant in that case was consensual, so too the propensity evidence in this case is not relevant to establish that the encounter between the victim, the defendant, and his girlfriend was consensual. As we explained in <em>Higgins, </em>\u201c[cjonsent to sexual conduct with one person in no way implies consent to such activity with another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 297. Similarly, the fact that the victim allegedly previously expressed to prior partners an interest in bondage-related sexual activity does not make it more probable that she consented to her encounter with the defendant and his girlfriend. <em>Id. </em>at 297-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>We next address the defendant\u2019s arguments that the trial court erred when it failed to find that the State had opened the door to the previously excluded evidence of the victim\u2019s alleged interest in bondage-related sexual activities. The \u201copening the door\u201d doctrine comprises two doctrines governing the admissibility of evidence. <em>State v. Gaudet, </em>166 N.H. 390, 396 (2014) (quotation omitted). The first doctrine, \u201ccurative admissibility,\u201d applies when inadmissible prejudicial evidence has been erroneously admitted, and the opponent seeks to introduce testimony to counter the prejudice. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The second doctrine, \u201cspecific contradiction,\u201d is more broadly applied to situations in which one party has introduced admissible evidence that creates a misleading advantage and the opponent is then permitted to introduce previously suppressed or otherwise inadmissible evidence to counter the misleading advantage. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Here, we are concerned only with the specific contradiction doctrine. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">For this doctrine to apply, the initial evidence must have reasonably misled the fact finder in some way. <em>Id. </em>The rule, thus, prevents a party from successfully excluding evidence favorable to his opponent and then selectively introducing some of this evidence for his own advantage, without allowing the opponent to place the evidence in proper context. <em>Id. </em>The fact that the \u201cdoor has been opened\u201d does not permit all evidence to \u201cpass through\u201d because the doctrine is intended to prevent prejudice and is not to be subverted to allow for the injection of prejudice. <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cThe trial court is in the best position to gauge the prejudicial impact of particular testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Accordingly, we will not upset the trial court\u2019s ruling on whether the State opened the door to prejudicial rebuttal evidence absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The defendant argues that, on four occasions during the trial, the State, in effect, asserted that the victim \u201cin fact was not the kind of person who would consent to [bondage-related] sexual practices,\u201d thus, opening the door to evidence that she had expressed to prior partners an interest in such activities. Based upon our review of the four occasions upon which the defendant relies, we conclude that the trial court did not unsustainably exercise its discretion when it ruled that the State did not, on those occasions, open the door to admission of the evidence at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">On the first occasion, the State, during its opening statement, asserted that, according to the defendant, the victim \u201cdied during a consensual sexual encounter gone bad\u201d and that, even though she \u201cwas in a committed and exclusive relationship,\u201d she \u201cconsented to dangerous and brutal sex with the [defendant, who she barely knew, and with [his girlfriend], who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>was a work acquaintance.\u201d The State further contended that the defense theory was that \u201c[t]he victim agreed to be bound, gagged, strangled, hit, violently sexually exploited by an almost complete stranger, and by a coworker acquaintance who she saw outside of work only once.\u201d This theory, the State asserted, was \u201c[a]n insult to [the jury\u2019s] commonsense and to [the victim\u2019s] memory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">On the second occasion, the State elicited testimony from one of the victim\u2019s friends that the victim did not tell him either that \u201cshe was sexually attracted to [the defendant\u2019s girlfriend]\u201d or that she and the defendant\u2019s girlfriend had \u201ctalked about sex\u201d and bondage-related sexual activities one night.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">On the third occasion, the State elicited testimony from the defendant\u2019s girlfriend that she and the defendant had never used the \u201cextreme degree\u201d of bondage involved in the defense theory of the case. Although the State also elicited the girlfriend\u2019s testimony that her story to the defense team had been \u201cridiculous,\u201d the trial court struck this response from the record and instructed the jury that the response was not evidence in the case and could not be considered \u201cin any way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">On the last occasion, during its cross-examination of one of the defendant\u2019s friends, the State elicited testimony that, he, like the defendant, enjoyed Japanese anime, videogames that involved fantasy and role playing, and, like the victim, he enjoyed the book and the television show, \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d The following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">Q You\u2019re into all this other stuff like [the defendant] so you must be into [bondage-related sexual activities], right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\">A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-11\">Q It\u2019s a fairly simple, logical error isn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-12\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-13\">Q It\u2019s faulty deduction, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-14\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-15\">Q It\u2019s faulty deduction that leads to erroneous conclusions, right -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-16\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-17\">Q \u2014 to misperceptions and misjudgments, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-18\">A Sure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-19\">The defendant contends that on each of the above occasions, the State created the misimpression that the victim was repelled by bondage-related sexual activities, and, therefore, opened the door to evidence alleging that she was, in fact, interested in such activities. Based upon our review of the record, we conclude that the trial court was not compelled to interpret the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>evidence as the defendant interprets it. Rather, it was reasonable for the trial court to have found, in each of the instances upon which the defendant relies, that the State did not create the misimpression that the victim was repelled by bondage-related activities. Accordingly, we uphold the trial court\u2019s determination that the State did not open the door to the challenged evidence. All issues that the defendant raised in his notice of appeal, but did not brief, are deemed waived. <em>See State v.
