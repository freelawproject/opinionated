Colligan, Esq.) and approved by the Circuit Court <em>(Weaver, </em>J.) enforcing the college contribution provision contained in the parties\u2019 2008 divorce decree, based upon a finding that the petitioner\u2019s offer to co-sign loans with his children did not meet his obligation under the decree to equally contribute to their college expenses. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">The relevant facts follow. The parties were married in 1998. They divorced in 2008, when their son and daughter were minors. Included in the decree were several provisions that required the parents to share expenses equally on behalf of their children. For example, the decree required the parents to: \u201cequally divide any camp, daycare and extracurricular activity fees\u201d; \u201cequally be responsible for the [guardian ad litem] fees\u201d; and \u201ceach be responsible for 50% of any and all uninsured medical, dental . . . and other health care expenses.\u201d The decree also required the parties to \u201cequally contribute to any private and post[-]secondary educational expenses of their children, after the child has exhausted all forms of scholarships, loans, grants, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">Before entering college, the children applied for scholarships through their high schools and for financial aid through their colleges\u2019 financial aid process. Both children accepted the loans and grants for which they qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">At the time of the trial court\u2019s order, the respondent, Paula Oligny, had taken out $28,075.52 in parent loans for the daughter\u2019s freshman year and first half of her sophomore year, and $8,450.00 for the first half of the son\u2019s freshman year of college. Meanwhile, the petitioner had made no financial contributions to the children\u2019s college tuition.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">In lieu of making payments, or taking out a loan on his own, the petitioner offered to co-sign loans for his children for the balance due for their college educations, apparently concluding that such offers fulfilled his obligation under the college contribution provision of the divorce decree. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>response, the respondent moved that the trial court find the petitioner in contempt for refusing to pay his share of the college expenses pursuant to the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In August 2015, a child support hearing was held to address, among other things, the college contribution provision. At the hearing, the petitioner asserted that, under his interpretation of the provision, the children were required to first seek subsidized or unsubsidized federal loans on their own, and then seek co-signed loans with a parent. Only after the children exhausted the first two sources of loans, did the petitioner believe that the parents were required to either contribute \u201cdirect[ly] through cash\u201d or through some \u201cother type[ ] of borrowing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">After the hearing, the hearing officer issued a recommended order that was approved by the trial court. In the order, the court found the college contribution provision to be \u201cvalid and enforceable.\u201d See <em>In the Matter of Donovan &amp; Donovan, </em>152 N.H. 55, 63-64 (2005) (holding that support orders issued prior to February 2, 2004, may require parents to contribute to their children\u2019s college education). The trial court determined that the children had \u201cavailed themselves of the available scholarships, grants and loans\u201d and had \u201ctaken out loans and grants consistent with what they qualified for under federal financial aid guidelines.\u201d Consequently, the court concluded that \u201cthe balance due is the responsibility of the parents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The court rejected the petitioner\u2019s argument that his offer to co-sign loans satisfied his obligation under the decree. The court stated that \u201c[t]o accept this argument would have the effect of abrogating his responsibility under the [college contribution provision] and lead to an unjust result.\u201d Accordingly, the court determined that the petitioner is responsible for 50% of the amount of loans, costs, interest, and fees that the respondent has incurred. The petitioner filed a motion to reconsider, which the court denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">On appeal, the sole issue for our review is whether the trial court correctly interpreted the college contribution provision in the parties\u2019 divorce decree. As a threshold matter, the parties dispute the applicable standard of review. According to the petitioner, we should review this matter <em>de novo. </em>By contrast, the respondent claims that we should review this matter under our unsustainable exercise of discretion standard. We agree with the petitioner. The issue before us is a matter of the interpretation of a divorce decree. \u201cThe interpretation of the language of a divorce decree, like the interpretation of other written documents, is a question of law, reviewed by this court <em>de novo.\u201d Estate of Frederick v. Frederick, </em>141 N.H. 530, 531 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>In ascertaining the meaning of a divorce decree, we look to the plain meaning of the language viewed in the context of the entire decree. <em>Bonneville v. Bonneville, </em>142 N.H. 435, 438 (1997). \u201cSubsidiary clauses are construed so as not to conflict with the primary purpose of the decree.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The college contribution provision provides that \u201cthe parties shall equally contribute to any private and post[-]secondary educational expenses of their children, after the child has exhausted all forms of scholarships, loans, grants, etc.\u201d By its plain language, the college contribution provision requires that the children first \u201cexhaust[ ] all forms of . . . loans,\u201d and that the parents thereafter \u201cequally contribute\u201d to the remaining educational expenses. This is a condition precedent to the parents\u2019 contribution. Therefore, the parental obligation is only triggered once the child\u2019s obligation is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The petitioner argues that the plain meaning of the phrase \u201call forms of . . . loans\u201d includes co-signed loans, and that, consequently, the children are required to apply for co-signed loans before his direct contribution obligation arises. Although we agree with the petitioner that a co-signed loan is a form of loan, we disagree with his contention that it is a form of loan that <em>the child </em>can exhaust. The parents and children have different responsibilities under the college contribution provision, independent of each other. The provision plainly requires that <em>the child </em>\u201cexhaust[ ] all forms of. . . loans.\u201d It does not require, as the petitioner suggests, that <em>the child and the parent </em>exhaust additional options available to them. Cosigned loans cannot be acquired by a child alone; they require the involvement of another. To the extent that the petitioner argues that our interpretation of the college contribution provision is limited by the arguments that the respondent raised in the trial court, he is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The petitioner next argues that the phrase \u201call forms of... loans\u201d should be interpreted as applying to a broader range of loans because the provision includes the abbreviation \u201cetc.\u201d We agree with the petitioner that the use of the abbreviation \u201cetc.\u201d signals that the college contribution provision\u2019s enumerated list of financial resources is not exclusive. Nonetheless, viewing the provision as a whole, we disagree with the petitioner that co-signed loans fall within the provision\u2019s parameters.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">The college contribution provision is one of several provisions in the decree requiring the parents to share equally in their children\u2019s expenses. For example, the decree also requires the parties to \u201cequally divide any camp, daycare and extracurricular activity fees,\u201d \u201cequally be responsible for [guardian ad litem] fees,\u201d and \u201cbe responsible for 50% of any and all uninsured medical, dental, . . . and other health care expenses.\u201d Viewed in the context of the decree as a whole, we conclude that the purpose of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>college contribution provision was to ensure that both parents share equally in their children\u2019s college expenses, not to shift the burden of additional debt onto the child. Therefore, we agree with the trial court that co-signing is \u201cinconsistent with the language of the provision\u201d because it \u201cput[s] the full burden of payment on the children while alleviating [the parents\u2019] responsibility to contribute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\">The petitioner also asserts that the college contribution provision does not require the parents to cover all remaining expenses after the children\u2019s obligations are fulfilled. We disagree. The college contribution provision states that \u201cthe parties shall equally contribute to any . . . expenses.\u201d The word \u201cshall\u201d specifies that the parties\u2019 equal contribution to the children\u2019s college expenses is mandatory. <em>See McCarthy v. Wheeler, </em>152 N.H. 643, 645 (2005) (\u201cThe use of the word \u2018shall\u2019 is generally regarded as a command; although not controlling, it is significant as indicating the intent that the statute is mandatory.\u201d). The use of the term \u201cany\u201d suggests that the parents must equally contribute to <em>all remaining expenses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">The petitioner also argues that the trial court improperly relied upon a \u201cpolicy rationale\u201d that the legislature rejected in 2004 when it repealed the authority of trial courts to require divorcing parents to contribute to their children\u2019s college expenses. <em>See In the Matter of Donovan &amp; </em>Donovan, 152 N.H. at 61. We need not address the merits of this argument because we have reviewed the trial court\u2019s interpretation <em>de novo. See Estate of Frederick, </em>141 N.H. at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b581-6\">Dalianis, C.J., and Conboy, Lynn, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
