We consider whether the court erred in ruling that the plea is time-barred under RSA 479:25, II (Supp. 2015) and RSA 479:25, II-a (2013). We hold that it did not, and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">Dowgiert\u2019s pleadings include, or the record supports, the following facts. In 2005, Dowgiert refinanced a mortgage loan on his home with Decision One Mortgage Company, LLC (Decision One). Dowgiert gave a promissory note to Decision One and a mortgage to Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (MERS) as nominee of Decision One. In 2007, Decision One ceased to exist. In 2011, MERS assigned the mortgage to the bank. Dowgiert defaulted on the mortgage, and, on or around September 3, 2013, the bank foreclosed on the mortgage and purchased Dowgiert\u2019s property at the foreclosure sale. On or around September 25, 2013, the bank filed the foreclosure deed with the Rockingham County Registry of Deeds. During this time, Dowgiert was incarcerated and did not receive notice of the foreclosure. Accordingly, he failed to petition the superior court for an order enjoining the foreclosure prior to the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">In July 2014, the bank filed a possessory action in the circuit court to remove Dowgiert from the property. Dowgiert, as a self-represented party, filed a plea of title asserting that the bank did not have the authority to foreclose on the mortgage and that, therefore, the foreclosure was invalid. Pursuant to RSA 540:17 (2007), the court ordered Dowgiert to file his plea in the superior court \u201cby the first Tuesday in October, 2014.\u201d From the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>record, it appears that Dowgiert failed to do so. More than a week after the deadline, on October 16, the bank moved in the circuit court for judgment in its favor. Dowgiert failed to object, and the court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">More than a month later, on November 21, Dowgiert, represented by counsel, moved in the circuit court for an order vacating the judgment and allowing him two weeks to file his plea of title in the superior court. The court held a hearing on the motion and determined that, \u201c[u]nder a totality of the circumstances, and after consideration of all arguments,\u201d the motion should be granted. The court ordered Dowgiert to file his plea in the superior court by the \u201cfirst Tuesday in May 2015.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Dowgiert filed his plea of title in the superior court on April 24, 2015. In it, he alleged that the bank did not have the authority to foreclose on his property. Specifically, he asserted that the bank had lacked legal title to the mortgage because: (1) \u201cDecision One ceased to exist prior to the assignment and purported negotiation of the Note\u201d; (2) \u201cthe Mortgage assignment was three years late, thereby not conforming with\u201d certain deadlines in the Pooling and Service Agreement (PSA); (8) the \u201cNote [was not] transferred through [the] specific assignment chain\u201d required by the PSA; and (4) there was no evidence that the bank possessed the \u201coriginal \u2018blue-ink\u2019 note at the time of foreclosure.\u201d Dowgiert also alleged that he had not received notice of the foreclosure because he had been incarcerated; thus, \u201che could not [have filed] a petition to enjoin the [foreclosure] prior to the [sale].\u201d When Dowgiert filed his plea in the superior court, nearly one year and eight months had elapsed since the bank purchased the property at the foreclosure sale, and nearly one year and seven months had elapsed since the bank recorded the foreclosure deed. The bank moved to dismiss Dowgiert\u2019s plea, arguing that it was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The court granted the bank\u2019s motion. It ruled that the claims in the plea concerning the bank\u2019s title to the mortgage are barred under RSA 479:25, II because Dowgiert failed to bring them prior to the foreclosure sale. The court also ruled that, because Dowgiert did not bring his claim about the foreclosure notice \u201cwithin a year and a day of the recording of the foreclosure deed,\u201d it is barred under RSA 479:25, II-a. Dowgiert appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">In reviewing the court\u2019s grant of the motion to dismiss, our standard of review is whether the allegations in Dowgiert\u2019s pleadings are reasonably susceptible of a construction that would permit recovery. <em>See Plaisted v. LaBrie, </em>165 N.H. 194, 195 (2013). We assume that Dowgiert\u2019s pleadings are true and construe all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to him. <em>See id. </em>We then engage in a threshold inquiry that tests the facts in the pleadings against the applicable law, and if the allegations constitute a basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>for legal relief, we must hold that it was improper to grant the motion to dismiss. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">To resolve the issues before us, we must engage in statutory interpretation. The interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. Favazza v. Braley, </em>160 N.H. 349, 351 (2010). In matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiters of the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>Id. </em>In construing its meaning, we first examine the language found in the statute, and when possible, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to the words used. <em>Id. </em>We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include. <em>Strike Four v. Nissan N. Am., </em>164 N.H. 729, 735 (2013). We interpret statutory provisions in the context of the overall statutory scheme. <em>Favazza, </em>160 N.H. at 351. Absent an ambiguity, we will not look beyond the language of the statute to discern legislative intent. <em>See New Hampshire Health Care Assoc. v. Governor, </em>161 N.H. 378, 385 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Dowgiert\u2019s principal argument is that RSA 479:25, II and II-a do not apply to his plea of title. RSA 479:25 sets forth the procedures for mortgage foreclosure through the power of sale. <em>See </em>RSA 479:25 (Supp. 2015). Those procedures require, among other things, that the foreclosing party give notice of the foreclosure to the mortgagor. <em>See </em>RSA 479:25,1. RSA 479:25, II requires that notice be \u201cserved upon the mortgagor or sent by registered or certified mail to his last known address ... at least 25 days before the [foreclosure] sale.\u201d RSA 479:25, II. The statute also requires that, in the notice, the foreclosing party advise the mortgagor of his right to \u201cpetition the superior court ... to enjoin the scheduled foreclosure sale.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The statute establishes a timeframe for the mortgagor to exercise his right to petition the superior court. The mortgagor must \u201cinstitute such petition . . . prior <em>to sale.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Failure to do so \u201cshall thereafter <em>bar any action or right of action </em>of the mortgagor based on the validity of the foreclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). A separate time limitation applies to any challenge to the foreclosure notice. RSA 479:25, II-a states that <em>\u201c[n]o claim </em>challenging the form of notice, manner of giving notice, or the conduct of the foreclosure sale shall be brought by the mortgagor . . . <em>after one year and one day </em>from the date of the recording of the foreclosure deed for such sale.\u201d RSA 479:25, II-a (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Dowgiert argues that his plea is not \u201can action, right of action, or claim \u2014 all of which would be barred by\u201d RSA 479:25, II or II-a. Instead, he contends, the plea is a \u201cdefense,\u201d and, as such, the statutory limitations periods do not apply. Dowgiert further argues that, generally, statutes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>limitation or repose, such as RSA 479:25, II and II-a, do not apply to defenses. Thus, Dowgiert asserts, the trial court \u201cerred by dismissing [his] Plea of Title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\"> We hold that Dowgiert\u2019s plea is an \u201caction or right of action,\u201d RSA 479:25, II, not a defense, and, therefore, RSA 479:25, II applies to the plea to the extent that, in the plea, Dowgiert challenges the bank\u2019s authority to foreclose. RSA 540:17 and :18 (2007) set forth the procedures that the circuit court must follow when a defendant raises an issue of title in a plaintiffs circuit court action. <em>Friedline v. Roe, </em>166 N.H. 264, 266 (2014). RSA 540:17 specifically addresses the plea of title:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">If the defendant shall plead a plea which may bring in question the title to the demanded premises he shall forthwith recognize to the plaintiff, with sufficient sureties, in such sum as the court shall order, to enter <em>his action </em>in the superior court for the county at the next return day, and to prosecute <em>his action </em>in said court, and to pay all rent then due or which shall become due pending <em>the action, </em>and the damages and costs which may be awarded against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">RSA 540:17 (emphases added). Even though the statute sets forth the procedure by which a plea of title may be filed in response to a circuit court action, the legislature did not characterize the plea as a defense. The legislature instead characterized it as a separate \u201caction\u201d that the defendant must \u201center . . . and .. . prosecute\u201d in the superior court. <em>Id.; see Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp. v. Willette, </em>168 N.H. 512, 516 (2016) (\u201cRSA 540:17 .. . places the burden to institute the action in the superior court on the defendant.\u201d (quotation omitted)). Dowgiert\u2019s plea is therefore an action, not a defense. Because, in the plea, Dowgiert challenges the bank\u2019s authority to foreclose, RSA 479:25, II applies; the statute bars a mortgagor from bringing, after the foreclosure sale, \u201cany action or right of action . . . based on the validity of the foreclosure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">We further hold that RSA 479:25, II-a applies to the contention in Dowgiert\u2019s plea that the foreclosure notice was inadequate because he did not receive it while he was incarcerated. This contention is a \u201cclaim challenging the form of notice\u201d or the \u201cmanner of giving notice\u201d under the statute, and, thus, it applies.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> RSA 479:25, II-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Dowgiert filed his plea in the superior court in April 2015 \u2014 after the September 2013 foreclosure sale, and more than one year and one day after the bank recorded the foreclosure deed in September 2013. Because Dowgiert failed to file his plea within either of the statutory timeframes set forth in RSA 479:25, II and II-a, the trial court correctly ruled that the plea is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">To conclude otherwise would permit an \u201cend-run\u201d around the statutes \u2014 a result that the legislature could not have intended. <em>See Appeal of Town of Salem, </em>168 N.H. 572, 578 (2016) (interpreting a statute to preclude a common law right of action that would have otherwise allowed parties to \u201ccreate an end-run around [a] legislative grant of exclusive enforcement jurisdiction\u201d). Under Dowgiert\u2019s interpretation, even a mortgagor with notice could wait until well after the sale to challenge the foreclosure in an action filed in response to a possessory action. The mortgagor could also wait to challenge the foreclosure notice in that same action even if more than a year and a day had passed since the recording of the foreclosure deed. Given that the statutes unambiguously set forth timeframes after which these types of \u201caction[s]\u201d and \u201cclaim[s]\u201d are barred, the legislature could not have intended for a mortgagor to elude the timeframes merely by characterizing the same types of actions and claims as \u201cdefenses\u201d against the possessory action of the owner after foreclosure. RSA 479:25, II, II-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Dowgiert next argues that, even if the statutory time limitations apply, he complied with RSA 479:25, II-a with respect to his notice claim because he raised that claim in the plea of title that he filed in the circuit court \u201cmore than one month before the limitations period ran.\u201d According to Dowgiert, \u201cfiling a Plea of Title in the [circuit court] before [RSA 479:25, II-a\u2019s] limitation[s] period expires is sufficient to preserve a defendant\u2019s right to defend a possessory action . . . even if the possessory action is not transferred to Superior Court until after [RSA 479:25, II-a\u2019s] limitations period expires.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\"> We disagree. Generally, a limitations period does not toll until a party files his action in a court of competent jurisdiction. <em>See Jackson v. Astrue, </em>506 F.3d 1349, 1358 (11th Cir. 2007) (citing several cases in which the court held that \u201cfiling in a court without competent jurisdiction did not toll the [relevant] statute of limitations\u201d (quotation omitted)). Here, the circuit court is not the court of competent jurisdiction over Dowgiert\u2019s plea because \u201cit does not have jurisdiction to resolve issues of title,\u201d which issues \u201cmust be resolved in superior court.\u201d <em>Friedline, </em>166 N.H. at 266, 267 (quotation omitted). Thus, RSA 479:25, II-a could not have been tolled until Dowgiert filed his plea in the superior court, which he did in April 2015 \u2014 months after the limitations period had expired upon the foreclosure sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Dowgiert asserts that, \u201cbecause filing the Plea of Title in Superior Court[ ] acts to transfer the possessory action to Superior Court <em>as if originally brought there, </em>the initial filing date of the Plea of Title in the [circuit court] should control.\u201d This assertion mischaracterizes the relevant procedural law. When a defendant raises a plea of title and \u201cfiles such recognizance as ordered by the [circuit] court, the [plaintiffs] possessory action in the [circuit court] is stayed.\u201d <em>Willette, </em>168 N.H. at 515 (quotation omitted). And, \u201c[i]f the defendant fails to enter [his] action in the superior court, then the possessory proceedings in the [circuit court] may resume.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cRSA 540:17 ... <em>does not require the [circuit court] to transfer or otherwise enter the action in superior court </em>but, rather, places the burden to institute the action in the superior court on the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and ellipsis omitted) (emphasis added). Thus, when Dowgiert filed his plea of title in the superior court, the bank\u2019s possessory action remained in the circuit court. The possessory action was not, as Dowgiert contends, transferred to the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Dowgiert also misinterprets the phrase \u201cas if [the action] were originally begun there.\u201d RSA 540:18 states that, \u201c[a]fter the filing of such plea and the entry of such recognizance no further proceedings shall be had before the [circuit] court, but the action <em>may </em>be entered and prosecuted in the superior court <em>in the same manner as if it were originally begun there.\u201d Id. </em>(emphases added). Implicit in Dowgiert\u2019s argument is the notion that \u201caction\u201d in RSA 540:18 refers to the same \u201caction\u201d as that in RSA 540:17 \u2014 the plea of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">However, the plain language of RSA 540:18 shows that \u201caction\u201d refers instead to the plaintiffs possessory action. RSA 540:18 contains three provisions relating to the filing of title claims. The first is the \u201cfiling of such plea and the entry of such recognizance\u201d in the superior court. RSA 540:18. Then, \u201c[a]fter the filing\u201d of the plea of title, \u201cno further proceedings shall be had before the [circuit court].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, RSA 540:18 states that, even though the circuit court proceedings have halted, \u201cthe <em>action </em>may be entered and prosecuted in the superior court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Because, under the statute, the defendant must have already filed the plea of title in the superior court before the opportunity to enter and prosecute the \u201caction\u201d arises, the \u201caction\u201d cannot be the same as the \u201cplea.\u201d Rather, it must refer to the possessory action. <em>Id. </em>Given the statutory framework, we conclude that the legislature could not have intended for \u201caction\u201d to refer to the defendant\u2019s plea of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Moreover, the provisions of RSA 540:18 must be read in conjunction with the provisions of RSA 540:17. Under RSA 540:17, the \u201caction\u201d <em>must </em>be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>entered and prosecuted in the superior court after the defendant \u201cplead[s] a plea which may bring in question the title to the demanded premises\u201d in the circuit court. RSA 540:17. In contrast, under RSA 540:18, the \u201caction <em>may </em>be entered and prosecuted ... in the same manner as if it were originally begun\u201d in the superior court. RSA 540:18 (emphasis added); <em>cf. Appeal of Coos County Comm\u2019rs, </em>166 N.H. 379, 386 (2014) (\u201cThe general rule of statutory construction is that the word \u2018may\u2019 makes enforcement of a statute permissive and that the word \u2018shall\u2019 requires mandatory enforcement.\u201d (quotation omitted)). Because filing the \u201caction\u201d in the superior court under one statute is mandatory and filing the \u201caction\u201d under the other statute is not, the statutes must refer to different proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\">Moreover, RSA 540:18 states that, after the defendant files the plea and enters recognizance, \u201cno further proceedings shall be had before the [circuit court].\u201d RSA 540:18. Once proceedings have been stayed in the circuit court, one of two things could occur concerning the possessory action. Either the possessory action could remain stayed in the circuit court pending the outcome of the superior court\u2019s adjudication of the plea of title, <em>see Willette, </em>168 N.H. at 515-16, or the possessory action \u201cmay be entered and prosecuted ... in the same manner as if it were originally begun\u201d in the superior court, RSA 540:18, and the superior court could consolidate and adjudicate the plea and the possessory action in one proceeding. <em>Cf. Gibson v. LaClair, </em>135 N.H. 129, 130 (1991) (reversing on other grounds an order of the superior court \u201cgranting a writ of possession in favor of the plaintiff\u2019 after the plaintiffs \u201cunderlying eviction action\u201d was \u201cremoved to the superior court when the defendant entered a plea of title\u201d). Because, under the statutory scheme, the possessory action <em>may </em>be adjudicated in either the superior or the circuit court, the \u201caction\u201d that <em>\u201cmay </em>be entered and prosecuted in the superior court\u201d under RSA 540:18 must be the posses-sory action. RSA 540:18 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Accordingly, we reject Dowgiert\u2019s argument that \u201cthe initial filing date of the Plea of Title in the [circuit court] should control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Because Dowgiert failed to file his plea of title in the superior court within the timeframes set forth in RSA 479:25, II and II-a, the plea is not reasonably susceptible of a construction that would permit recovery. <em>See Plaisted, </em>165 N.H. at 195. We therefore affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b252-7\">Dalianis, C.J., and Conboy, Lynn, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b249-9\"> We reject Dowgiert\u2019s argument that his plea was not barred under RSA 479:25, II because he did not receive notice of the foreclosure while he was incarcerated.
