Letarte, appeals his conviction by a jury on one count of aggravated felonious sexual assault, <em>see </em>RSA 632-A:2, I(j)(2) (2016), and one count of felony indecent exposure, <em>see </em>RSA 645:1, II(a) (Supp. 2014) (amended 2015). On appeal, he argues that the Superior Court <em>(Bom,stein, </em>J.) erred when it precluded him from introducing extrinsic evidence to impeach the victim\u2019s testimony on a collateral matter during her cross-examination by defense counsel, <em>see </em>N.H. R. Ev. 608(b), and when it denied his motion to vacate the verdict and schedule a new trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">The jury could have found the following facts. The defendant is the biological father of the victim. The charges stem from an incident that occurred in February 2012. The victim, who was then approximately 13 years old, was having a friend sleep at her house. The victim and her friend became intoxicated on alcohol that the defendant had provided them. When the victim woke up in the early morning, she felt the defendant\u2019s fingers inside her vagina and, when she told him to stop, he masturbated in her presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">The defendant was tried in October 2014. During his opening statement, defense counsel told the jury that the victim had accused the defendant of sexually assaulting her \u201cso she could deflect attention from her own misconduct that day.\u201d Defense counsel said that \u201cthis is . . . not an unusual move for [the victim]\u201d because she had \u201cthreatened to do the same thing to another family member.\u201d For ease of reference, we refer to the family member as \u201cthe witness.\u201d Defense counsel explained that the witness would tell the jury that when the victim and her mother were staying at his house, he \u201cnoticed that [the victim] appeared to be intoxicated\u201d and \u201cthat his liquor cabinet had been broken into.\u201d According to defense counsel, the witness would also testify that, when he told her that she and her mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>had to leave, to avoid being removed from the home, the victim said to her mother, \u201c[A]ll I have to do is say that [the witness] attempted to rape me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The State objected, arguing that the witness\u2019s proposed testimony was inadmissible. Defense counsel countered that the proposed testimony was probative of the victim\u2019s credibility. Defense counsel explained that he sought not only to cross-examine the victim about the alleged incident involving the witness, but also to introduce the witness\u2019s testimony to impeach her if she denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The trial court ruled that the proposed cross-examination was permissible and stated, that \u201cat least at this point[,]... reference to such evidence in opening arguments is permissible and it would be anticipated that the extrinsic evidence would be admissible as well.\u201d The trial court explained that, if the parties \u201cwant to have a further hearing out of the presence of the jury tomorrow morning . . . [where the witness] testifies . . . , we can certainly do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Defense counsel then continued his opening statement, repeating that accusing a family member of sexual assault \u201cis not an unusual move\u201d for the victim because she had told her mother that \u201call\u201d she had to do \u201cis call the police and tell them that [the witness] attempted to rape [her] and he will be the one out of the house.\u201d Defense counsel asserted that \u201c[t]here\u2019s a pattern[;] [i]f [the victim] doesn\u2019t like the situation, she\u2019ll go to extreme lengths to rid herself of people, including [making] . . . false allegations of sexual assault, false allegations to either ... the police or investigators, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going on here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">When the victim testified on direct examination, she was not asked, and did not testily, about the witness incident or about any other alleged incident not involving the defendant. On cross-examination, however, in response to questioning by defense counsel, the victim denied threatening to tell the police that the witness had sexually assaulted her. She also denied telling the witness that she \u201cwould tell the police that he raped\u201d her.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">The court then heard additional argument from the parties regarding whether the witness should be allowed to testify so as to impeach the victim\u2019s testimony. The State objected to the witness\u2019s proposed testimony on the ground that its admission violated New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 608(b) because it constituted extrinsic evidence offered to impeach a witness on a collateral matter. <em>See </em>N.H. R. Ev. 608(b) (providing, in pertinent part, that \u201c[s]pecific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness\u2019 credibility, . . . may not be proved by extrinsic evidence\u201d); <em>see also State v. Hopkins, </em>136 N.H. 272, 276 (1992) (explaining the collateral issue rule). The State also observed that the witness incident occurred more than a year after the incident involving the defendant. Defense counsel countered that the witness\u2019s testimony fell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>within an exception to Rule 608(b)\u2019s bar to extrinsic evidence, which we adopted in <em>State v. Ellsworth, </em>142 N.H. 710, 718-19 (1998), and which applies to allegedly false allegations of sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The trial court preliminarily concluded that the <em>Ells worth </em>exception was the proper lens through which to view the proposed testimony. Thus, over the State\u2019s continued objection, the trial court conducted a hearing, outside of the jury\u2019s presence, to determine whether the witness\u2019s testimony met that exception. The witness testified that he and the victim had fought because he thought that she had broken into his liquor cabinet and stolen his liquor. He testified that he told the victim that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want her drinking in [his] home and she got very upset about it.\u201d When the witness went into the kitchen, he saw the victim and her mother talking and heard the victim tell her mother \u201cthat all she needed to do was to call the police and tell them that [he] had sexually molested her and they would take [him] out of the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Defense counsel then argued that the witness\u2019s testimony was admissible pursuant to the <em>Ellsworth </em>exception to Rule 608(b)\u2019s bar to extrinsic evidence because he had submitted \u201cclear proof\u2019 that, had the victim actually made the accusation she threatened to make, it \u201cwould\u2019ve been false.\u201d Alternatively, defense counsel argued that the testimony was admissible under <em>State v. Vandebogart, </em>139 N.H. 145, 165-67 (1994), to show that the victim \u201cwas lying on the stand.\u201d The trial court ruled that the witness\u2019s testimony did \u201cnot fit within\u201d the <em>Ellsworth </em>exception and was also inadmissible under <em>Vandebogmt. </em>As a result, the witness was not called for the defense. Defense counsel objected to the ruling, explaining that counsel had \u201crelied on . . . the Court\u2019s representation . . . that this was an Ellsworth case\u201d in crafting his opening statement, cross-examining witnesses, and presenting the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">After the trial had concluded, the defendant filed a motion to vacate the verdict and for a new trial based upon what he termed the court\u2019s \u201clast minute determination that the <em>Ellsworth </em>exception did not apply\u201d to the witness\u2019s testimony. In the motion, defense counsel reiterated that he had relied upon the trial court\u2019s \u201cstatements that the evidence regarding . . . [the witness] would be admissible pursuant to <em>Ellsworth,\u201d </em>and, because of that reliance, had \u201chighlighted and stressed this evidence to the jury in opening statements\u201d and in his cross-examination of the victim. Defense counsel argued that the trial court\u2019s \u201c[i]nconsistent application\u201d of its prior ruling that the <em>Ellsworth </em>exception applied to the witness\u2019s testimony \u201cworked a reversible prejudice to [the] defense\u201d and deprived the defendant of his right \u201cnot only to due process but also to a fair trial\u201d pursuant to Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Following a hearing, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The court found that because defense counsel summarized the witness\u2019s proposed testimony to the jury in his opening statement before the State had objected and before the court, ultimately, had ruled that the witness\u2019s testimony was inadmissible, the defendant could not claim to have been prejudiced. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The defendant argues that the trial court erred when it: (1) precluded him from introducing the witness\u2019s testimony to impeach the victim\u2019s testimony on cross-examination; and (2) denied his motion to vacate and for a new trial. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\n<em>A. Ellsworth Exception</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">The defendant first asserts that the witness\u2019s testimony was admissible under the <em>Ellsworth </em>exception to Rule 608(b)\u2019s bar to extrinsic evidence. We review a trial court\u2019s decision on the admissibility of evidence under our unsustainable exercise of discretion standard. <em>State v. Towle, </em>167 N.H. 315, 320 (2015). \u201cFor the defendant to prevail under this standard, he must demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s decision was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In applying our unsustainable exercise of discretion standard of review, we determine only \u201cwhether the record establishes an objective basis sufficient to sustain the discretionary judgment made.\u201d <em>State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 296 (2001). \u201cOur task is not to determine whether we would have found differently,\u201d but is only \u201cto determine whether a reasonable person could have reached the same decision as the trial court on the basis of the evidence before it.\u201d <em>Benoit v. Cerasaro, </em>169 N.H. 10, 21 (2016) (quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">Rule 608(b) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-10\"><em>Specific instances of conduct. Specific instances of the conduct of a, witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness \u2019 credibility, </em>other than conviction of crime as provided in Rule \u00a7 609, <em>may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. </em>They may, however, in the discretion of the court, if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross examination of the witness (1) concerning the witness\u2019 character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or (2) concerning the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of another witness as to which character the witness being cross-examined has testified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">(Emphases added.) Thus, under Rule 608(b), although a cross-examiner may inquire into conduct that is probative of the witness\u2019s character for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>truthfulness or untruthfulness, the examiner, generally, must take the answer as the witness gives it. <em>Hopkins, </em>136 N.H. at 276. The examiner may not introduce extrinsic evidence, such as calling other witnesses, to prove conduct of a witness that is probative of that witness\u2019s character for truthfulness or untruthfulness. <em>See </em>N.H. R. Ev. 608(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">One way to think of Rule 608(b) is that it is an exception to Rule 404(b)\u2019s general prohibition against introducing character evidence for the purpose of showing that a person has a propensity to behave in a certain way, and, therefore, behaved in that way on a particular occasion. <em>See </em>Johnson, <em>Prior False Allegations of Rape: Falsus in Uno, Falsus in Omnibus?, </em>7 Yale Journal of Law &amp; Feminism 243, 250-51 (1995). Rule 608(b) permits inquiry of the witness about a prior instance of lying for the purpose of showing that the witness has the character trait of being a liar (a propensity to lie) and, therefore, her testimony should not be believed by the fact finder. <em>See id. </em>But the rule specifically limits the manner of eliciting this character evidence to inquiry on cross-examination and prohibits proof of the lie through extrinsic evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 251. If the witness denies having lied on the prior occasion, the cross-examiner cannot introduce extrinsic evidence to contradict the witness\u2019s testimony on the point. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">In <em>Ellsworth, </em>because of constitutional concerns, we explained that, in sexual assault cases, Rule 608(b)\u2019s bar to extrinsic evidence \u201cshould not be interpreted so strictly as to preclude the admission of extrinsic evidence that is probative of a material issue.\u201d <em>Ellsworth, </em>142 N.H. at 719. We cautioned that such extrinsic evidence \u201cshould be admitted only where the allegations [of sexual assault] are similar, and the proffered evidence is highly probative of the material issue of the complainant\u2019s motives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have since clarified that to introduce extrinsic evidence of prior allegations of sexual assault, the defendant must demonstrate that the allegations were \u201cdemonstrably false,\u201d which we have interpreted to mean \u201cclearly and convincingly untrue.\u201d <em>State v. Miller, </em>155 N.H. 246, 250 (2007) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The defendant argues that \u201c[bjecause the <em>Ellsworth </em>[exception] applies\u201d to the witness\u2019s testimony, we \u201cmust find that the [trial] court erred in excluding [it].\u201d We disagree. <em>Ellsworth </em>is a narrow exception that applies <em>only </em>to prior demonstrably false accusations of sexual assault. The witness\u2019s testimony did <em>not </em>concern such an accusation. Indeed, whatever probative value extrinsic evidence of a prior false accusation of sexual assault may have concerning a victim\u2019s credibility, a mere threat to make such an accusation has even less probative value. Arguably, people are more likely to make threats than they are to carry out such threats. Here, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>assuming that the victim made the threat attributed to her by the witness, there is no suggestion that she ever carried out the threat by actually accusing him of sexually assaulting her. That being the case, the <em>Ells worth </em>exception does not apply, and the trial court did not unsustainably exercise its discretion by limiting the defendant to exploring the matter through cross-examination of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\n<em>B. Vomdebogart</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The defendant next contends that the witness\u2019s testimony was admissible to rebut the victim\u2019s testimony on cross-examination pursuant to our opinion in <em>Vomdebogart. </em>In <em>Vmdebogart, </em>we upheld the trial court\u2019s decision to allow the State to \u201ccall a rebuttal witness to contradict the defendant\u2019s testimony on collateral issues\u201d on cross-examination. <em>Vandebogart, </em>139 N.H. at 165. The defendant contends that \u201c[b]ut for the substitution of the [victim] in the place of the defendant, and the defense in the place of the prosecution, this case presents an identical situation\u201d to that in <em>Vmdebogart. </em>We interpret the defendant\u2019s argument to be that, just as the prosecution in <em>Vandebogart </em>was allowed to impeach with extrinsic evidence the testimony of the defendant in that case as to a collateral matter, he should have been allowed to use extrinsic evidence to impeach the testimony of the victim as to a collateral matter. Notably, the defendant does not argue that the witness\u2019s testimony is admissible under any other evidentiary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">\n<em>1. Vmdebogart in Context</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Before addressing the merits of the defendant\u2019s argument, we place <em>Vandebogart </em>in the proper context. Strictly speaking, <em>Vmdebogart </em>is not a Rule 608(b) case. Rather, it concerns impeachment of a witness by contradiction. \u201cImpeachment by contradiction refers to impeachment with evidence that the target witness made a factual error in his testimony.\u201d R. Park &amp; T. Lininger, The New Wigmore A Treatise on Evidence: Impeachment and Rehabilitation \u00a7 4.1, at 197 (2012). It \u201cis a well-recognized tool for exposing a witness\u2019 lack of credibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Fonseca, </em>435 F.3d 369, 375 (D.C. Cir. 2006). \u201cMost commonly, the contradiction is shown through the testimony of another witness\u201d; in other words, the contradiction is shown through extrinsic evidence. Park &amp; Lininger, <em>supra, </em>at 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Impeachment by contradiction is not covered by Rule 608(b). <em>See Morgan v. Covington TP., </em>648 F.3d 172, 179 (3d Cir. 2011) (discussing Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b)); <em>see also United States v. Castillo, </em>181 F.3d 1129, 1132 (9th Cir. 1999) (same); <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>979 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>1024, 1033-34 (5th Cir. 1992) (same). Whereas Rule 608(b) concerns the use of extrinsic evidence of \u201c[sjpecific instances of the conduct of a witness\u201d offered \u201cfor the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness\u2019 . . . <em>character for truthfulness,\u201d </em>N.H. R. Ev. 608(b) (emphasis added), impeachment by contradiction concerns the use of extrinsic evidence to contradict <em>specific testimony given under oath, see Morgan, </em>648 F.3d at 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Put another way, \u201cRule 608(b) prohibits the use of extrinsic evidence of conduct to impeach a witness\u2019.. . general veracity,\u201d while \u201cimpeachment by contradiction permits courts to admit extrinsic evidence that specific testimony is false, because [it is] contradicted by other evidence.\u201d <em>Castillo, </em>181 F.3d at 1132; <em>see State v. Cannon, </em>146 N.H. 562, 567 (2001) (stating that \u201c[ejxtrinsic evidence is permissible . . . when it directly contradicts a witness\u2019s testimony because such evidence does not attack the witness\u2019s general credibility, but rather the truthfulness of the specific testimony\u201d); <em>State v. Mello, </em>137 N.H. 597, 600 (1993) (explaining that Rule 608(b) \u201cis directed at the use of [extrinsic evidence] to impeach a witness\u2019s general credibility\u201d and is not directed at the use of such evidence to impeach when a defendant gives \u201ca knowingly false answer under oath\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">\u201cImpeachment by contradiction is permitted by Rule 607,\u201d <em>United States v. Greenidge, </em>495 F.3d 85, 99 (3d Cir. 2007), which provides that \u201c[t]he credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party, including the party calling the witness,\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 607. <em>See </em>C. Wright &amp; V. Gold, 27 Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 6096, at 655 (2007) (\u201cWhile the Evidence Rules do not explicitly recognize contradiction as a basis for attacking credibility, the admissibility of contradiction evidence can be inferred from the relevance rules and Rule 607.\u201d (footnotes omitted)). \u201cThe court, in deciding whether to allow an instance of impeachment by contradiction, engages in a Rule 403 analysis.\u201d <em>Greenidge, </em>495 F.3d at 99; <em>accord Castillo, </em>181 F.3d at 1133. Thus, although evidence that impeaches a witness by contradiction is relevant because it undermines the witness\u2019s credibility, it may be excluded under Rule 403 \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d <em>Fonseca, </em>435 F.3d at 375 (quotation omitted); <em>see </em>N.H. R. Ev. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">\n<em>2. Use of Extrins ic Ev idence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">The general rule is that a witness may <em>not </em>be impeached by contradiction through extrinsic evidence as to a collateral matter. <em>See </em>Wright &amp; Gold, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 6096, at 659; <em>see also United States v. Perez-Perez, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>72 F.3d 224, 227 (1st Cir. 1995) (explaining that \u201clargely for reasons of efficiency, extrinsic evidence to impeach is only admissible for contradiction where the prior testimony being contradicted was itself material to the case at hand\u201d). \u201cThe objective\u201d of the collateral issue rule \u201cis to avoid a \u2018trial within a trial,\u2019 that is, to avoid the litigation of issues that are collateral to the case at hand.\u201d <em>Hopkins, </em>136 N.H. at 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\u201cA matter is collateral if the impeaching fact could not have been introduced into evidence for any purpose other than the contradiction.\u201d <em>Calhoun v. Ramsey, </em>408 F.3d 375, 382 (7th Cir. 2005) (quotation omitted). Thus, generally speaking, \u201cone may not contradict for the sake of contradiction; the evidence must have an independent ground for admission.\u201d <em>United States v. Bonner, </em>302 F.3d 776, 785 (7th Cir. 2002) (quotation and ellipsis omitted); <em>accord United States v. Schwyhart, </em>123 F. App\u2019x 62, 66 (3d Cir. 2005); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>243 F.3d 1103, 1107 (8th Cir. 2001). Such independent grounds include proving a substantive fact in the case or proving that a witness was biased or lacked personal knowledge. <em>See </em>Wright <em>&amp; </em>Gold, <em>supra </em>at 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The opening-the-door doctrine is an exception to the general ban on the use of extrinsic evidence to impeach a witness\u2019s testimony on a collateral matter. <em>See id. </em>at 665; <em>see also Jones v. Southern Pacific R.R., </em>962 F.2d 447, 450 (5th Cir. 1992). Thus, when a witness \u201copens the door\u201d to a collateral issue, extrinsic evidence may be admissible to impeach her by contradiction. <em>See Jones, </em>962 F.2d at 450; <em>see also Mello, </em>137 N.H. at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In some jurisdictions, the opening-the-door exception applies <em>only </em>to a witness\u2019s testimony on direct examination. <em>See </em>Wright <em>&amp; </em>Gold, <em>supra </em>at 667-68. In those jurisdictions, extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to impeach a witness\u2019s cross-examination testimony as to a collateral matter. <em>See, e.g., Caruso v. State, </em>645 So. 2d 389, 394-95 (Fla. 1994); <em>State v. Gibson, </em>113 P.3d 423, 430 (Or. 2005) (en banc). \u201cThe policy behind this rule is to prevent the cross-examiner from injecting collateral matters into the trial by setting the witness up and then allowing the very party that injected the matter into the trial to impeach the witness\u2019s credibility with extrinsic evidence relating to those collateral matters.\u201d <em>Jezdik v. State, </em>110 P.3d 1058, 1063-64 (Nev. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">By contrast, in other jurisdictions the opening-the-door exception may be applied to a witness\u2019s cross-examination testimony when that testimony is \u201ctruly volunteered.\u201d <em>Castillo, </em>181 F.3d at 1134 n.1. Additionally, in the context of constitutional claims, federal courts have ruled that extrinsic evidence may be admissible to impeach a criminal defendant\u2019s cross-examination testimony as to collateral matters provided that the questions on cross-examination are \u201cclosely . . . connected with matters explored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>during direct\u201d examination. <em>United States v. Morla-Trinidad, </em>100 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1996) (discussing the impeachment exception to the exclusionary rule under the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution); <em>see also United States v. Havens, </em>446 U.S. 620, 622-23, 626-27 (1980) (deciding, as a constitutional matter, that the trial court did not err by allowing the government to impeach with extrinsic evidence the criminal defendant\u2019s testimony on direct examination that he was not involved in drug smuggling and the similar statements he \u201cmade in response to proper cross-examination reasonably suggested by\u201d the direct examination).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Courts are cautious when allowing extrinsic evidence to impeach a witness\u2019s cross-examination testimony on collateral matters. <em>See United States v. Kincaid-Chauncey, </em>556 F.3d 923, 932-33 (9th Cir. 2009), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Skilling v. United States, </em>561 U.S. 358 (2010). This is, in part, because \u201cwhen the testimony to be contradicted is offered under cross-examination, impeachment by contradiction is far less likely to achieve its intended purpose of rooting out perjury because opposing counsel may manipulate questions to trap an unwary witness into \u2018volunteering\u2019 statements on cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Moreover, \u201cit is often difficult to determine whether testimony is invited\u201d by leading questions on cross-examination or whether it is \u201cvolunteered,\u201d similar to when a defendant volunteers an irrelevant fact on direct examination. <em>Id. </em>at 933 (quotation omitted). Accordingly, the rule in some jurisdictions is that impeachment by contradiction with extrinsic evidence is allowed \u201conly in rare situations where it is clear that testimony on cross-examination\u201d as to a collateral matter \u201cwas truly volunteered.\u201d <em>Castillo, </em>181 F.3d at 1134 n.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">In <em>Vandebogart, </em>we aligned ourselves with those jurisdictions that have permitted extrinsic evidence to impeach a criminal defendant\u2019s testimony on cross-examination as to collateral matters. <em>See Vandebogart, </em>139 N.H. at 165-67. We said that, with regard to the opening-the-door doctrine, we saw \u201cno reason to distinguish the defendant\u2019s statements on direct examination from his responses to questions asked on cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167. Thus, although the extrinsic evidence was offered to impeach the defendant\u2019s testimony on cross-examination as to collateral issues, we upheld the trial court\u2019s decision to allow it. <em>Id. </em>at 165, 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Although we discussed Rule 608(b) in our decision, the evidence at issue in that case did not actually fall within the specific prohibition of that rule. In <em>Vandebogart, </em>the information elicited from the defendant on cross-examination \u2014 concerning how he got to know the witness, what he told her about his fianc\u00e9e, and when he had last seen her \u2014 did not demonstrate that he had lied on prior occasions and, therefore, had the character trait <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>of untruthfulness. <em>Id. </em>at 165. Rather, if his testimony on those points was false, extrinsic evidence contradicting the testimony and, thus, proving its falsity would not merely allow the jury to draw the circumstantial inference that the defendant was generally a liar; it would demonstrate directly that the defendant had lied in his trial testimony. We recognized this distinction when, in upholding the trial court\u2019s decision to admit the extrinsic evidence, we wrote that the rebuttal evidence \u201cdid not attack the defendant\u2019s general credibility, but rather the truthfulness of his testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">For the purposes of this appeal, we assume that <em>Vandebogart </em>applies when, as in this case, a criminal defendant seeks to rebut with extrinsic evidence a victim\u2019s testimony on cross-examination about a collateral issue. <em>Compare Cannon, </em>146 N.H. at 566-67 (citing <em>Vandebogart </em>and upholding the trial court\u2019s decision to limit a witness\u2019s testimony offered to rebut the victim\u2019s testimony on cross-examination as to what appears to have been a collateral issue because the defendant failed to demonstrate that the trial court had unsustainably exercised its discretion), <em>with State v. Kelly, </em>160 N.H. 190, 202-03 (2010) (not citing <em>Vandebogart </em>and concluding that defense counsel was not entitled to impeach complainant\u2019s testimony with extrinsic evidence demonstrating that her testimony on cross-examination was false). We also assume without deciding that the witness\u2019s testimony concerned a collateral matter because the defendant does not argue otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\n<em>3. Application, to this Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The defendant contends that, once the victim denied threatening to tell the police that the witness sexually assaulted her, \u201cthe defense had the right, under <em>Vandebogart, </em>to present extrinsic evidence to impeach that denial.\u201d We disagree that <em>Vandebogart </em>establishes that a party has a \u201cright\u201d to present extrinsic evidence to impeach a witness\u2019s testimony on cross-examination. In that case, we merely upheld a trial court\u2019s discretionary decision to allow such impeachment. <em>See Vandebogart, </em>139 N.H. at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Moreover, this case is readily distinguishable from <em>Vandebogart. </em>In contrast to the cross-examination of the defendant in <em>Vandebogart, </em>the evidence which the defendant sought to elicit from the victim falls squarely within the terms of Rule 608(b). The defendant cross-examined the victim about what he claimed was her threat to falsely accuse the witness of sexually assaulting her for the purpose of attacking her general credibility by showing that she had a propensity to lie. The defense theory was that, because the victim was a liar when she allegedly threatened to accuse the witness of sexual assault, she was also a liar when she alleged, \u201cin great detail,\u201d that the defendant had sexually assaulted her. <em>Ellsworth, </em>142 N.H. at 717. Although the defendant argues that the purpose of eliciting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>victim\u2019s testimony about the witness incident was to demonstrate her \u201cmotive\u201d to fabricate allegations of sexual assault, the probative value of that evidence \u201cnecessarily involves the victim\u2019s alleged bad character and predisposition or propensity to lie.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The trial court acted within its discretion in permitting the defendant to pursue such cross-examination. But when the victim denied making the prior threat, Rule 608(b)\u2019s prohibition came into play and prohibited the defendant from introducing extrinsic evidence to contradict her testimony. <em>See Perez-Perez, 72 </em>F.3d at 227. As noted previously, were we to permit the introduction of extrinsic evidence to contradict the victim\u2019s testimony about a matter inquired into on cross-examination only because of its bearing on her general credibility for truthfulness, we would render Rule 608(b) a nullity. This we refuse to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">In this case, the trial court reasonably could have decided that, because the defendant was allowed to cross-examine the victim about the witness incident so as to attack her general character for untruthfulness, it would have undermined the purposes of Rule 608(b) to allow him also to use extrinsic evidence to impeach that testimony. <em>See </em>C. Wright <em>&amp; </em>V. Gold, 28 Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 6119, at 127 (2012) (observing that \u201c[t]he admissibility of misconduct evidence to contradict can be entwined logically with the admissibility of such evidence to prove untruthfulness,\u201d so that when \u201ca witness is questioned about alleged misconduct probative of untruthfulness and ... the witness denies the misconduct[,] . . . [i]f the extrinsic evidence is freely admissible to contradict, the purpose of Rule 608(b) is utterly destroyed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\"><em>C. Motion to Vacate Verdict and for </em>a <em>New Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">We next consider the defendant\u2019s assertion that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to vacate the jury\u2019s verdict and for a new trial. The defendant argues that \u201c[hjaving initially ruled that the defense could elicit [the witness\u2019s] testimony subject to specified conditions,\u201d the court committed reversible error when it then \u201cretract[ed] that permission\u201d after the defense had relied upon it. (Underlining omitted.) He asserts that the court\u2019s correction of its initial ruling that the <em>Ells worth </em>exception applies to the witness\u2019s testimony meant that his counsel was unable to deliver on the promise he made to the jury during his opening statement to produce the witness testimony. He contends that the trial court\u2019s so-called \u201cabout-face violated [his] rights to due process and a fair trial, guaranteed by\u201d Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution and \u201cthe Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">We decline to address the merits of the defendant\u2019s argument, in part, because he has not sufficiently developed it for our review. <em>See State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number><em>v. Blackmer, </em>149 N.H. 47, 49 (2003). For instance, he does not explain how the trial court\u2019s ultimate decision to correct its earlier, erroneous, provisional ruling constitutes a deprivation of due process. <em>See Merrimack Valley Wood Prods. v. Near, </em>152 N.H. 192, 203 (2005) (explaining that \u201c[t]here can be no question of the inherent power of the [trial court] to review its own proceedings to correct error or prevent injustice\u201d (quotation omitted)). We note that the two cases upon which the defendant relies in his brief are not due process cases and are factually distinguishable. <em>See State v. Demond-Surace, </em>162 N.H. 17 (2011) (concerning whether defendant was prejudiced by prosecutor\u2019s improper comment); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>629 F.2d 650 (10th Cir. 1980) (concerning whether the trial court committed reversible error by failing to comply with a federal procedural rule requiring it to inform counsel of its proposed action upon jury instruction requests before counsel argued to the jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Moreover, as the appealing party, the defendant has the burden of demonstrating that the trial court committed reversible error when it corrected its earlier, provisional, erroneous ruling that the <em>Ellsworth </em>exception applied to the witness testimony. <em>See Gallo v. Traina, </em>166 N.H. 737, 740 (2014). Based upon our review of the trial court\u2019s ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the jury verdict and for a new trial, the defendant\u2019s challenges to it, the record submitted on appeal, and the applicable law, we conclude that the defendant has not demonstrated reversible error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b513-6\">Hicks, Conboy, Lynn, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
