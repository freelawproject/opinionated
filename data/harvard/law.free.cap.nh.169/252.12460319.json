Legal Frame work</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">The issue before us is the constitutionality of New Hampshire Administrative Rules, He-W 654.04(c). The rule requires DHHS to include a child\u2019s federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) in the calculation of a family\u2019s eligibility for benefits under the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program (TANF), as administered by the State\u2019s Financial Assistance to Needy Families program (FANF). We hold that the rule violates the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. <em>See </em>U.S. CONST, art. VI, cl. 2. For context, we provide a brief overview of the applicable federal and state statutes and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">\n<em>A Federal Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">\n<em>1. SSI</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">The SSI program, codified as Title XVI of the Social Security Act, is a needs-based federal assistance program that sets a \u201cguaranteed minimum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>income level\u201d for individuals \u201cwho have attained age 65\u201d or who \u201care blind or disabled.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Zebley, </em>493 U.S. 521, 524 (1990) (quotations omitted); <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 (2012). SSI payments are funded by the federal government and administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA). <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383 (2012 &amp; Supp. II 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">For a child to be eligible for SSI payments, the child must be blind or disabled and have limited income and resources. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(a)(1) (2012). A child is \u201cdisabled\u201d if he or she has a \u201cphysical or mental impairment\u201d that results in \u201cmarked and severe functional limitations,\u201d and which can be expected either to result in death or to last continuously for at least one year. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(C)(i) (2012). The requirement that the child have limited income and resources is met when the child has less than a certain amount in assets, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1205(a), (c) (2015), and \u201ccountable income\u201d below the federal financial benefit rate, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7416.1110-416.1182 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">For SSI beneficiaries who are unable to manage their own payments \u201cdue to a mental or physical condition or due to their youth,\u201d the beneficiary\u2019s payments are directed to a third-party \u201crepresentative payee.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.601(b) (2015); <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(a)(2)(A)(ii)(I) (2012). The statute directs the representative payee to use SSI funds \u201cfor the use and benefit\u201d of the child. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(a)(2)(A)(ii)(I). A representative payee who \u201cconverts such payment, or any part thereof, to a use other than for the use and benefit of\u2019 the child commits \u201cmisuse of benefits.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(a)(2)(A)(iv) (2012). A representative payee who commits \u201cmisuse of benefits\u201d is subject to a range of civil and criminal penalties. <em>See, e.g., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383a(a)(4) (2012) (fine and/or imprisonment of up to 5 years); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1383(a)(2)(H)(i) (2012) (restitution); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1383a(b) (2012) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The statute authorizes the SSA to implement regulations in administering the SSI program, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(a) (2012), including prescribing \u201cthe meaning of the term \u2018use and benefit\u2019 for purposes\u201d of preventing misuse of benefits, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1383(a)(2)(A)(iv) (2012). The SSA has promulgated \u201c[d]etailed regulations governing] a representative payee\u2019s use of [SSI] benefits.\u201d <em>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Keffeler, </em>537 U.S. 371, 376 (2003). A representative payee who receives SSI funds on behalf of a disabled child must \u201c[u]se the benefits received on [the child\u2019s] behalf only for [the child\u2019s] use and benefit in a manner and for the purposes [the representative payee] determines ... to be in [the child\u2019s] best interests.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.635(a) (2015). SSI funds that \u201care used for the [child\u2019s] current maintenance\u201d are considered to \u201chave been used for the use and benefit of the [child].\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.640(a) (2015). \u201cCurrent maintenance includes costs incurred in ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>taining food, shelter, clothing, medical care and personal comfort items.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, the representative payee must \u201c[ejnsure that [the child is] receiving treatment to the extent considered medically necessary and available for the condition that was the basis for providing benefits if [the child is] under age 18.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.635(g) (2015) (citation omitted). Any funds not spent on the child\u2019s current maintenance must be \u201cconserved or invested on behalf of the [child].\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.645(a) (2015). Representative payees are required to submit an annual accounting to the SSA informing the agency how much of the SSI benefit was spent on the beneficiary\u2019s care and support, and how much was saved. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.665 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\n<em>2. TANF</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The TANF program, codified as Title IV-A of the Social Security Act, provides federal block-grant funding to states to create public assistance programs that offer, among other things, cash assistance to needy families with children. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 601-629m (2012 &amp; Supp. II 2014). Congress enacted TANF in 1996 to replace the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (AFDC). <em>See </em>Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-193, 110 Stat. 2105 (1996). \u201cUnlike AFDC, TANF is not an open-ended entitlement program.\u201d <em>Arizona v. Shalala, </em>121 F. Supp. 2d 40, 45 (D.D.C. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Under TANF, each participating state designs its own public assistance program. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602 (2012). A state TANF program should advance four goals: (1) providing assistance to needy families \u201cso that children may be cared for in their own homes\u201d; (2) ending the dependence of needy parents on government benefits \u201cby promoting job preparation, work, and marriage\u201d; (3) preventing and reducing the number of out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and (4) encouraging \u201cthe formation and maintenance of two-parent families.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 601(a)(1)-(4) (2012). A state may use its federal block-grant funds \u201cin any manner that is reasonably calculated to accomplish\u201d those purposes. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 604(a)(1) (2012). States are directed to \u201cset forth objective criteria for the delivery of benefits and the determination of eligibility and for fair and equitable treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 602(a)(1)(B)(iii) (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\"><em>B. New Hampshire Law </em>\u2014 <em>FANF</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">New Hampshire uses its federal TANF block grant to operate several public assistance programs, including a program to provide cash assistance to families with dependent children, through the State\u2019s FANF program. <em>See </em>RSA 167:77-:93 (2014 &amp; Supp. 2015); N.H. Admin. Rules, He-W 601.04(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>To determine eligibility for FANF assistance, DHHS first determines the \u201cassistance group,\u201d which is the group of individuals who live together and who are considered as a unit in making FANF eligibility determinations. <em>See </em>RSA 167:79, II (2014). The statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">The following persons shall be included in the assistance group, unless such person receives foster care or adoption assistance, if living in the same household or temporarily absent from the household: any dependent child and all minor blood-related, step, or adoptive brothers and sisters, and all natural, step, or adoptive parents of such children, including cohabitating adults who share a minor child. In the case of a minor parent, the assistance unit may also include all natural, step, or adoptive parents of the minor parent and all minor blood-related, step or adoptive brothers and sisters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-6\"><em>Id. </em>DHHS has issued rules that further define the \u201c[a]ssistance group\u201d as \u201cthe individuals living together . . . whose needs, income and/or resources are considered and combined together when determining eligibility or the amount of benefits for financial or medical assistance.\u201d N.H. ADMIN. Rules, He-W 601.01(u).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">DHHS then calculates the assistance group\u2019s available income and resources in order to determine whether the group is eligible for FANF benefits. The statute provides that \u201c[eligibility for assistance shall be based in part on the available countable earned and unearned income of the persons in the assistance group.\u201d RSA 167:80, I (2014). DHHS is required to include \u201c[a]ll forms of earned and unearned income\u201d of any member of the assistance group, unless that type of income is specifically excluded by statute. RSA 167:80, III; <em>see </em>RSA 167:80, IV. Income that shall be excluded includes, among other things, \u201cFederal, state, and local means-tested assistance other than means-tested assistance that is defined as included by . . . rules adopted [by DHHS].\u201d RSA 167:80, IV(h) (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">The case before us is based upon changes in 2012 and 2013 to RSA chapter 167 and its regulations. Prior to its amendment in 2012, RSA 167:79, II expressly excluded persons receiving \u201cstate supplemental assistance or supplemental security benefits under Title XVI of the Social Security Act\u201d from the assistance group. <em>See </em>RSA 167:79, II (Supp. 2011). Effective January 2012, RSA chapter 167 was amended to require that SSI recipients be included in the FANF assistance group. <em>See </em>Laws 2011, ch. 272:2.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Effective June 2013, DHHS promulgated Rule He-W 654.04(c) providing that \u201c[p]ursuant to RSA 167:80, IV(h), supplemental security income . . . shall be counted as unearned income for FANF ... when computing income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>pursuant to He-W 652.02 and He-W 654.02.\u201d N.H. Admin. Rules, He-W 654.04(c). Pursuant to this rule, DHHS includes the SSI income of SSI recipients as countable income for purposes of determining the amount, if any, of FANF assistance for a FANF assistance group.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\n<em>II. Factual and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The parties stipulated to the following facts. Hendrick is the mother of six children, two of whom receive SSI benefits. Hendrick is the \u201crepresentative payee\u201d for those two children\u2019s SSI benefits. In February 2014, the Hendrick assistance group received a monthly FANF benefit of $847.80, in addition to the SSI benefits received by the two children. Beginning in March 2014, DHHS included Hendrick and her six children in the FANF assistance group, and also included the two children\u2019s monthly, recurring SSI benefits of $654.00 as unearned income. DHHS informed Hendrick by notice dated February 25, 2014, that beginning March 15, 2014, her FANF cash assistance would be reduced to a monthly payment of $259.20. Thereafter, in April 2014, DHHS determined that Hendrick was no longer eligible for FANF assistance because her assistance group\u2019s total income exceeded the income limit. In making this determination, DHHS included the two children\u2019s recurring SSI benefits as countable unearned income. Hendrick, therefore, no longer receives FANF assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Birmingham is the mother of three children, one of whom receives SSI benefits. Birmingham is the \u201crepresentative payee\u201d for her child\u2019s SSI benefits. The Birmingham family applied for FANF assistance in July 2014. In determining Birmingham\u2019s eligibility for FANF assistance, DHHS included her child\u2019s monthly, recurring SSI benefit as countable unearned income in its FANF benefit calculation. Beginning August 15, 2014, the Birmingham assistance group received monthly FANF cash assistance of $17.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">The plaintiffs brought this lawsuit on behalf of themselves and their children, seeking a declaratory judgment that DHHS\u2019s \u201cinclusion of children\u2019s SSI in FANF assistance group income is unlawful and void\u201d pursuant to applicable federal law. In addition, the plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that Rule He-W 654.04 \u201cis invalid because it impairs [their] legal rights.\u201d The plaintiffs sought a permanent injunction enjoining DHHS from including children\u2019s SSI in FANF assistance group income and an award of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cbecause this litigation will result in a substantial benefit to the public.\u201d We note that the plaintiffs \u201cseek invalidation of [Rule] He-W 654.04(c) only with respect to its inclusion of children\u2019s SSI as income to the [FANF] assistance group.\u201d The plaintiffs do not seek to invalidate Rule He-W 654.04(c) insofar as it counts an adult\u2019s SSI as income to the FANF assistance group.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>The parties cross-moved for summary judgment. The plaintiffs argued that under controlling federal law, children\u2019s SSI must be used by a representative payee only for the benefit of the child with disabilities, not for the benefit of the FANF assistance group, and that state law to the contrary is invalid pursuant to the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. <em>See </em>U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. DHHS asserted that the inclusion of the children\u2019s SSI in calculating FANF eligibility does not interfere with the federal requirement that SSI benefits be expended for the use and benefit of the beneficiary. The trial court concluded that DHHS\u2019s inclusion of SSI benefits in the calculation of FANF eligibility is lawful. The court reasoned that \u201c[njothing in the statute or corresponding regulations deprive[s] the representative payee of the ability to use the SSI funds for the beneficiary\u2019s current maintenance\u201d and that the representative payee may use SSI for the beneficiary\u2019s benefit \u201ceven if that income is included in [DHHS\u2019s] calculation of FANF benefits.\u201d Accordingly the trial court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and granted the defendant\u2019s cross-motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\n<em>III. Standards of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts in its summary judgment ruling. <em>EnergyNorth Natural Gas v. City of Concord, </em>164 N.H. 14, 15 (2012). We consider all of the evidence presented in the record, and all inferences properly drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>at 15-16. If our review of that evidence discloses no genuine issue of material fact and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, then we will affirm the grant of summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The issue before us raises a question of federal preemption; preemption is essentially a matter of statutory interpretation and construction. <em>Id. </em>Statutory interpretation is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Id. </em>We interpret federal law in accordance with federal policy and precedent. <em>See Dube v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>166 N.H. 358, 364 (2014). When interpreting a statute, we begin with the language of the statute itself, and, if possible, construe that language according to its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Id. </em>When the language of the statute is clear on its face, its meaning is not subject to modification. <em>Id. </em>We will neither consider what Congress might have said, nor add words that it did not see fit to include. <em>Id. </em>at 364-65. We interpret statutes in the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation. <em>EnergyNorth, </em>164 N.H. at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>\n<em>IV. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that Rule He-W 654.04(c) is invalid because under federal law a representative payee must use a child\u2019s SSI only for the child with disabilities, not for the FANF assistance group. They assert that DHHS\u2019s \u201cpolicy of treating children\u2019s SSI as FANF assistance group income violates the Social Security Act\u2019s purposes of: 1) ensuring a minimal level of federal support for children with serious disabilities; and 2) mandating that the representative payee spend the child\u2019s SSI benefits only for the use and benefit, and in the best interests, of the SSI recipient child.\u201d (Citation omitted.) DHHS argues that the inclusion of SSI benefits in FANF determinations does not interfere with the federal requirement that SSI benefits be expended for \u201cthe use and benefit\u201d of the beneficiary. (Bolding and capitalization omitted.) It asserts that the requirement that income be used for the benefit of a specific child does not preclude its use for common expenses or its inclusion in a welfare benefit calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">After briefing and oral argument, we invited the Solicitor General of the United States to file an <em>amicus </em>brief addressing two questions: (1) whether it is unlawful for the State to terminate, reduce, or deny a household\u2019s TANF because a child with disabilities in the household receives SSI benefits; and (2) whether inclusion of the child\u2019s SSI as TANF assistance group income violates the federal Social Security Act and regulations. The Solicitor General submitted a brief on behalf of the United States asserting that \u201cRule He-W 654.04(c) conflicts with the federal Social Security Act and implementing regulations.\u201d The Solicitor General argues that federal law requires representative payees to use SSI funds solely for the \u201cuse and benefit\u201d of the beneficiary, and that \u201cby deeming SSI benefits available to the entire household, Rule He-W 654.04(c) conflicts with federal requirements\u201d and is therefore preempted. (Bolding and capitalization omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The federal preemption doctrine is based upon the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. <em>See Arizona v. United States, </em>132 S. Ct. 2492, 2500 (2012). Article VI provides that federal law \u201cshall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. \u201cThere can be no dispute that the Supremacy Clause invalidates all state laws that conflict or interfere with an Act of Congress.\u201d <em>Rose v. Arkansas State Police, </em>479 U.S. 1, 3 (1986) (per curiam); <em>see Mutual Pharmaceutical Co., Inc. v. Bartlett, </em>133 S. Ct. 2466, 2473 (2013) (state laws that conflict with federal law are without effect). In addition, \u201c[t]he statutorily authorized regulations of a [federal] agency will pre-empt any state or local law that conflicts with such regulations or frustrates the purposes thereof.\u201d <em>City of New York </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>v. FCC, </em>486 U.S. 57, 64 (1988); <em>see Koor Communication v. City of Lebanon, </em>148 N.H. 618, 621 (2002) (\u201cFederal regulations have the same preemptive force as federal statutes.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">\u201cPre-emption may be either expressed or implied.\u201d <em>Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Assn., </em>505 U.S. 88, 98 (1992) (plurality opinion). \u201cEven without an express provision for preemption,... state law must yield to a congressional Act in at least two circumstances.\u201d <em>Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, </em>530 U.S. 363, 372 (2000). \u201cWhen Congress intends federal law to occupy the field, state law in that area is preempted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cAnd even if Congress has not occupied the field, state law is naturally preempted to the extent of any conflict with a federal statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn actual conflict exists when \u2018it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishments and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wenners v. Great State Beverages, </em>140 N.H. 100, 104 (1995) (quoting <em>English v. General Electric Co., </em>496 U.S. 72, 79 (1990)); <em>see Koor Communication, </em>148 N.H. at 621. \u201cWhat is a sufficient obstacle is a matter of judgment, to be informed by examining the federal statute as a whole and identifying its purpose and intended effects ...\u201d <em>Crosby, </em>530 U.S. at 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Relying primarily upon <em>Sneed v. Saenz, </em>16 Cal. Rptr. 3d 563, 577-80 (Ct. App. 2004), a case interpreting Title II of the Social Security Act, DHHS argues that the requirement that SSI income be used for the benefit of a specific child does not preclude its use for common expenses or its inclusion in a state welfare benefit calculation. According to DHHS, <em>Sneed </em>supports a ruling that Rule He-W 654.04(c) \u201cdoes not violate the \u2018use and benefit\u2019 provision of representative payee law because it only requires SSI to be included in calculating FANF benefits, not to satisfy the needs of others in the household.\u201d <em>Sneed, </em>however, is not controlling in these circumstances. Because we determine that the federal regulations governing Social Security Disability Income (SSDI) benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act are substantively different from the federal regulations governing SSI benefits under Title XVI of the Social Security Act, we reject DHHS\u2019s underlying premise that the \u201cuse and benefit\u201d provisions with regard to SSDI and SSI \u201cmirror one another.\u201d <em>See In the Matter of Lister &amp; Lister, </em>162 N.H. 48, 51 (2011) (recognizing that SSDI benefits and SSI benefits have different purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Under Title II, SSDI \u201cbenefits are paid on behalf of a wage earner who pays into the Social Security system.\u201d <em>Sneed, </em>16 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 577; <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-499 (2012 &amp; Supp. II 2014). \u201c[SSDI] payments represent money which an employee has earned during his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>employment and also that which his or her employer has paid for the employee\u2019s benefit into a common trust fund under the Social Security Act.\u201d <em>Burns v. Edwards, </em>842 A.2d 186, 191 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2004); <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(b) (2012). \u201c[SSDI] payments are for the purpose of replacing income lost because of the employee\u2019s inability to work upon becoming disabled.\u201d <em>Burns, </em>842 A.2d at 191 (quotation omitted). \u201cStated another way, [SSDI] payments are a substitute for earned income and are thereby non-means-tested benefits.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Regulations promulgated by SSA that govern SSDI benefits provide that a representative payee has a responsibility to \u201c[u]se the benefits received [on the beneficiary\u2019s] behalf only for [the beneficiary\u2019s] use and benefit in a manner and for the purposes [the representative payee] determines ... to be in [the beneficiary\u2019s] best interests.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.2035(a) (2015). The regulations further specify that SSA \u201cwill consider that payments [it] certifies] to a representative payee have been used for the use and benefit of the beneficiary if they are used for the beneficiary\u2019s current maintenance. Current maintenance includes cost incurred in obtaining food, shelter, clothing, medical care, and personal comfort items.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.2040(a)(1) (2015). Notably, the regulations provide an exception to the current maintenance provision, expressly stating that \u201c[n]otwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if a beneficiary is a member of a [TANF] assistance unit, we do not consider it inappropriate for a representative payee to make the benefit payments available to the [TANF] assistance unit.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.2040(a)(2) (2015). Thus, federal SSDI regulations specifically provide that if a beneficiary is a member of a TANF assistance unit, a representative payee may make the SSDI benefit payments available to the entire TANF assistance unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">In contrast to SSDI payments, \u201cSSI benefits are not a substitute for lost income due to disability; rather, they are a supplement to the recipient\u2019s income.\u201d <em>Burns, </em>842 A.2d at 191. An SSI recipient\u2019s benefits \u201care the amount necessary to raise the recipient\u2019s income to the prescribed minimum level,\u201d whereas \u201cthe amount of a [SSDI] recipient\u2019s benefits is keyed to how much that person has paid into the Social Security system over time.\u201d <em>Tennessee DHS ex rel. Young v. Young, </em>802 S.W.2d 594, 597 (Tenn. 1990). The SSI program is intended \u201c \u2018to assist those who cannot work because of age, blindness, or disability\u2019 by \u2018setting a Federal guaranteed minimum income level for aged, blind, and disabled persons.\u2019 The SSI program provides a subsistence allowance, under federal standards, to the Nation\u2019s needy, aged, blind, and disabled.\u201d <em>Lyon v. Bowen, </em>802 F.2d 794, 796 (5th Cir. 1986) (quoting <em>Schweiker v. Wilson, </em>450 U.S. 221, 223 (1981)) (brackets and ellipses omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Although there is some facial similarity between the \u201cuse and benefit\u201d provisions in the regulations for Title II (SSDI) and those for Title XVI (SSI), the regulations expressly allow SSDI benefits to be used to support the beneficiary\u2019s assistance group, and the SSI regulations do not. Rather, under the plain language of the regulations, a child\u2019s SSI benefits may be spent only on that child\u2019s current maintenance, <em>i.e., </em>the child\u2019s food, shelter, clothing, medical care and personal comfort items, unlike SSDI benefits, which may be used for the current maintenance of persons in the assistance unit other than, or in addition to, the SSDI beneficiary. Accordingly, we disagree with DHHS that there is a uniform rule in the various welfare benefit programs whereby \u201ca state may treat an entire family as the relevant unit for public assistance, and that, in determining the amount of assistance for the family, a state may take into account income received by any members of the family.\u201d To the extent DHHS relies upon <em>Bowen v. Gilliard, </em>483 U.S. 587 (1987), to support this proposition, we are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Furthermore, Congress intended the SSI program to provide an additional source of federal funds, separate from funds available to needy families with children under the TANF program, to provide disabled children with the minimum amount necessary to satisfy their basic needs. <em>See Kyle v. Kyle, </em>582 N.E.2d 842, 846 (Ind. Ct. App. 1991) (concluding that SSI benefits received by a disabled child \u201care intended to supplement other income, not substitute for it\u201d because \u201cCongress determined that disabled children generally have greater needs than nondisabled children\u201d); <em>see also State, ex rel. Child Support Enfor. v. Kost, </em>964 S.W.2d 528, 531 (Mo. Ct. App. 1998) (\u201cSSI benefits are granted to provide parents of disabled children additional funds to offset the additional financial burden incumbent with children who are disabled\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Indeed, as to the calculation of a disabled child\u2019s SSI benefits, the regulations specifically exclude any TANF payments the child\u2019s parent receives \u201cand any income which was counted or excluded in figuring the amount of that payment\u201d and \u201c[a]ny of the income of [the child\u2019s]... parent that is used ... to determine the amount of [the TANF] program\u2019s benefit to someone else.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.1161(a)(2), (3) (2015). In addition, if the child lives in a \u201cpublic assistance household in which every member receives some kind of public income-maintenance payments\u201d including TANF, SSA finds that the child \u201c[is] not receiving in-kind support and maintenance from members of the household.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1142(a)(1), (b) (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The only other jurisdictions to address this issue have reached similar conclusions. In <em>V.R. v. Ohl, </em>No. 3:98-CV-1176 (S.D. W. Va. Feb. 3, 1999), the court concluded that a policy instituted under West Virginia\u2019s TANF <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>program that counted a child\u2019s SSI payments as household income in determining eligibility for TANF benefits \u201cpresents an obstacle to fulfillment of Congress\u2019s requirement that representative payees use SSI benefits only for the use and benefit of the child beneficiary.\u201d <em>Ohl, </em>slip op. at 22. The court noted that in replacing AFDC with TANF, \u201cCongress did not repeal any of the statutory provisions that make it clear that SSI benefits paid to representative payees are to be used only for the benefit of the beneficiary nor explicitly alter the fundamental purpose behind the SSI program \u2014 to assist families in meeting <em>additional </em>disability-related costs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n.17 (emphasis added). Likewise, in <em>Eneliko v. Dreyfus, </em>No. C11-0312JLR (W.D. Wash. Feb. 28, 2011), the court determined that a rule proposed by the Washington State Department of Health and Human Services that would deem the SSI income of disabled children available to non-disabled household members for purposes of deciding the family\u2019s eligibility under the state\u2019s TANF program was \u201cin direct conflict with or obstructed] the purposes of federal law.\u201d <em>Eneliko, </em>slip op. at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Furthermore, according to the Solicitor General, \u201c[o]f the 51 jurisdictions (all States plus the District of Columbia) that participate in TANF, only two \u2014 New Hampshire and Wisconsin \u2014 count a disabled child\u2019s SSI benefits as if they were income available to the entire TANF assistance group.\u201d <em>See </em>Erika Huber et al., The Urban Institute, Welfare Rules Databook: State TANF Policies as of July 2014, Final REPORT 66-67 (Aug. 2015), http://wrd.urban.org/wrd/data/databooks/ 2014%20Welfare%20Rules%20Databook%20(FINAL).pdf.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Although several states count SSI recipients as members of the assistance group for TANF purposes, those states do not count such recipients\u2019 SSI funds as income available to the assistance group. <em>Id. </em>at nn.3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">We agree with the Solicitor General that the Supremacy Clause does not permit the State to redirect federal benefits as required by Rule He-W 654.04(c). The rule, by counting a disabled child\u2019s SSI benefits as income available to the child\u2019s \u201cassistance group,\u201d treats the child\u2019s benefits as a source of income for the entire household. The rule, thereby, reduces a household\u2019s TANF benefit by one dollar for every dollar in SSI that is received by a disabled child in the household. Because the rule \u201cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,\u201d <em>Arizona, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2501 (quotation omitted), we hold that Rule He-W 654.04(c) is preempted by federal law and, thus, invalid to the extent that it requires inclusion of children\u2019s SSI as income to the TANF assistance group for the purpose of determining eligibility for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>TANF benefits. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, including a review of the plaintiffs\u2019 pending request for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b309-6\">Hicks, Conboy, Lynn, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
