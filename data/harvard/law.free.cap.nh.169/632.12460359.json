Jakle, administrator of the estate of Kathleen Mullin, appeals an order of the Circuit Court (Quigley, J.) denying her motion for declaratory judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-17\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b677-18\">The pertinent facts are as follows. The decedent, Kathleen Mullin, a resident of Hancock, New Hampshire, died intestate on November 26, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>2014. Her heirs at law are her three siblings: Michael Mullin, J. Stanley Mullin, Jr., and the appellant. All of the heirs at law are California residents, as is the appellee Laura Bushley. From 2008 until her death, the decedent lived in Hancock and owned real property there valued at $285,000. She also owned real property in California, where she had lived for many years prior to 2008, as well as personal property valued at $2,581,164 at the time of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Although the decedent did not have a will, in 2012, while in California, she executed a trust document (Trust) that had been drafted by a California attorney. Schedule A of the Trust lists as Trust property some of the decedent\u2019s personal property and all of her real property. She also executed an \u201cAssignment of Property to Trust\u201d (Assignment) that purported to transfer to the Trust all of her real property and some of her personal property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Trust contains the following choice of law provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-6\">The laws of the State of California in force from time to time shall govern the validity, construction, and administration of this Trust, except that all matters relating to real property shall be governed by the laws of the situs of that real property. This article shall apply regardless of any change of residence of the Trustee or any beneficiary, or the appointment or substitution of a Trustee residing or doing business in another state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Prior to her death, the decedent was the beneficiary of the Trust. The terms of the Trust provide that, upon the decedent\u2019s death, approximately 88 percent of the Trust property is to be distributed to charitable organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Laura Bushley, the appellee, is trustee of the Trust. After the decedent\u2019s death, the appellee became administrator of the Trust. That same month, the appellee filed in the circuit court a petition for estate administration, which was subsequently granted. In May 2015, the appellee resigned as estate administrator and the appellant was appointed as the successor administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">In July, the appellant filed an Inventory of Fiduciary listing the decedent\u2019s estate as consisting of approximately $2.5 million worth of real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>estate and personal property. In August, the appellee filed an objection to the Inventory, claiming that it listed property that was owned by the Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">In October, the appellee commenced an action in the California Superior Court. Titled a \u201cPetition for Order Transferring Title to Real and Personal Property to Living Trust\u201d (Petition), it referenced the ongoing probate proceedings in New Hampshire, but asserted that, under California law, the Assignment was sufficient to transfer the decedent\u2019s property to the Trust. The appellee also asserted in the petition that the California court \u201chas authority and general subject matter jurisdiction over the decedent\u2019s property\u201d and \u201cthe power to resolve claims over title\u201d to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Shortly thereafter, the appellant filed a motion for declaratory judgment in the circuit court to determine title to the decedent\u2019s property. In the motion, the appellant requested that the court declare: (1) that it had \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to determine all claims to the title of property listed on the Inventory\u201d; (2) that the \u201csitus of the property listed on the Inventory is New Hampshire\u201d; and (8) that both \u201clegal and equitable title to the property . . . was held by Kathleen Mullin at the time of her death.\u201d The appellee objected to the motion, arguing, among other things, that a declaratory judgment could be rendered only after the filing of an equity petition, the completion of discovery, and the presentation of evidence. The appellee also argued that the validity of the decedent\u2019s transfers to the Trust should be determined \u201cby a court in California, under California law,\u201d with the exception of the transfer of the New Hampshire real estate, which the appellee acknowledged could be decided by the California court under New Hampshire law.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The circuit court denied the appellant\u2019s motion, ruling: (1) that the court was \u201cunable to make a ruling on the requests of the [appellant] regarding the legal and equitable title to the property or to declare that the situs of the property ... is New Hampshire without appropriate testimony and evidence\u201d; (2) that jurisdiction over the Trust was \u201cproperly before\u201d the California court, and that California law must apply except with respect to the New Hampshire real estate; and (8) that the California court was \u201ca more convenient forum\u201d to hear the matter because \u201c[e]vidence and witnesses would more easily be available\u201d there, the decedent \u201clived in California for many years and utilized services of a California attorney and California financial advisor,\u201d the Trust \u201cwas drafted in California,\u201d and the \u201ctrustee and all three heirs-at-law, including the [appellant], are residents of California.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">On appeal, the appellant argues that the circuit court erred by ruling that the courts of New Hampshire do not have exclusive jurisdiction to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>claims regarding the property of the decedent, who was domiciled in New Hampshire at the time of her death. Next, the appellant challenges the circuit court\u2019s ruling that the choice of law provision in the Trust dictates that California law governs claims to the decedent\u2019s New Hampshire personal property. Finally, the appellant contends that the court erroneously concluded that California is a more convenient forum for adjudicating the claims over the decedent\u2019s property. We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The appellant first asserts that the circuit court erred by \u201crefusing to declare that [it] has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the underlying dispute\u201d; namely, the validity of the purported <em>inter vivos </em>transfer of the decedent\u2019s property to the Trust. The appellant argues that the circuit court had \u201cexclusive\u201d <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction over the decedent\u2019s New Hampshire assets because those assets were either located in the state, or were the personal property of a deceased New Hampshire resident. The appellant argues that, by ruling that it did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the decedent\u2019s assets, the court acted contrary to over 150 years of precedent and New Hampshire\u2019s strong public policy in favor of the expeditious settlement of the estates of its residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">On issues related to the circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction, we apply a <em>de novo </em>standard of review. <em>See Attorney General, Dir. of Charitable Trusts v. Loreto Publ\u2019ns, </em>169 N.H. 68, 71 (2016) (noting that we review <em>de novo </em>whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction); <em>Univ. Sys. of N.H. Bd. of Trs. v. Dorfsman, </em>168 N.H. 450, 453 (2015) (reviewing <em>de novo </em>the question of whether a court had jurisdiction to consider a university\u2019s appeal of an arbitration decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\"> We agree with the appellant\u2019s contention that jurisdiction in an <em>in rem, </em>proceeding is ordinarily established in the state where the property is located, or, in the case of personal property, the state where the decedent was domiciled. <em>See In re Estate of Rubert, </em>139 N.H. 273, 276 (1994). However, the appellant goes further, arguing that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Markham v. Allen, </em>326 U.S. 490 (1946), and <em>Kline v. Burke Constr. Co., </em>260 U.S. 226 (1922), dictate that no other court can assume <em>in rem, </em>jurisdiction over the same <em>res. </em>Those cases, however, merely elucidated the appropriate division of state and federal jurisdiction under the federal Judiciary Act of 1789 with regard to probate matters. <em>Markham, </em>326 U.S. at 494; <em>Kline, </em>260 U.S. at 229. Specifically, the Court stated in <em>Kline </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-9\">[W]here a federal court has first acquired jurisdiction of the subject-matter of a cause, it may enjoin the parties from proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>ing in a state court of concurrent jurisdiction where the effect of the action would be to defeat or impair the jurisdiction of the federal court. Where the action is in rem the effect is to draw to the federal court the possession or control, actual or potential, of the res, and the exercise by the state court of jurisdiction over the same res necessarily impairs, and may defeat, the jurisdiction of the federal court already attached. The converse of the rule is equally true, that where the jurisdiction of the state court has first attached, the federal court is precluded from exercising its jurisdiction over the same res to defeat or impair the state court\u2019s jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-5\"><em>Kline, </em>260 U.S. at 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Although the appellant points to a ruling by the Nevada Supreme Court, interpreting Nevada law, that extended Kline\u2019s first-to-the-courthouse rationale to a situation in which multiple states possess concurrent jurisdiction over a probate matter, <em>see Bergeron v. Loeb, </em>675 P.2d 397, 400-01 (Nev. 1984), we decline to apply such reasoning in this case. That New Hampshire possesses jurisdiction to probate the decedent\u2019s estate does not mean that jurisdiction is necessarily exclusive, nor does it <em>require </em>the court to exercise its jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the contrary, a court may decline to exercise jurisdiction for a variety of reasons. <em>See Bartlett v. Dumaine, </em>128 N.H. 497, 516-18 (1986). For instance, another court with concurrent jurisdiction may be a more convenient forum to decide the particular matter, or proceedings pertaining to the same matter may be pending in another state. <em>See id.; </em>George G. Bogert <em>et al., </em>The Law of Trusts and Trustees \u00a7 294, at 244 (2d ed. rev. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\"> In the instant case, both considerations are present. Although we acknowledge that New Hampshire has a strong public policy in favor of the expeditious settlement of the estates of its residents, as the appellant asserts, we have held that there is an \u201cequally strong policy favoring the orderly administration of trusts.\u201d <em>Bartlett, </em>128 N.H. at 518 (holding that a New Hampshire court should have declined jurisdiction over a petition regarding a trust with connections to both Massachusetts and New Hampshire). We note that, contrary to the appellant\u2019s suggestion, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>circuit court did not rule that it was not the proper forum to probate the decedent\u2019s estate. Rather, we interpret the court\u2019s order as ruling merely that the California court has jurisdiction to decide what, if any, property of the decedent had been properly transferred to the Trust; once that determination has been made, the circuit court could <em>then </em>exercise its jurisdiction to probate whatever property of the decedent remained in her estate. Under the circumstances presented here, we conclude that the circuit court did not err in concluding that the California court had jurisdiction to determine what property belonged to the Trust and in not proceeding with the probate of the decedent\u2019s estate until after that determination has been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The appellant next contends that the circuit court erred by relying solely upon a choice of law provision found in the Trust, which she argues is irrelevant because the phrase \u201cvalidity, construction, and administration of [the] Trust\u201d in the Trust\u2019s choice of law provision does not apply to the \u201cquestion of the validity and effectiveness of a transfer of property to the Trust.\u201d Rather, the appellant argues, the court should have based its decision on \u201cvarious factual considerations, including the situs of the property, the [d]ecedent\u2019s place of residence, the [d]ecedent\u2019s intention, and contacts with and the competing interests of the competing forums.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">As a preliminary matter, we note that in the absence of specification of the law of California, by which the rights of the parties are governed, we may apply the law of the forum on the assumption that the law of California is the same as that here in force. <em>See Garapedian, Inc. v. Anderson, </em>92 N.H. 390, 393 (1943) (in absence of evidence of New Jersey law, which governed rights of parties in case, court applied New Hampshire law); <em>Dancart Corp. v. St. Albans Rubber Co., </em>124 N.H. 598, 601 (1984) (\u201cForeign law is presumed to accord with the common law of this state in the absence of contrary evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">We have held that the decedent\u2019s intent is to be given effect with respect to \u201cthe determination of where and under the laws of what state the trusts created with the residue of her estate are to be administered.\u201d <em>In re Farnsworth Estate, </em>109 N.H. 15, 16-17 (1968). There is no reason for not applying this same principle to the <em>inter vivos </em>trust at issue here. The terms of the Trust state explicitly that the \u201claw of the State of California ... shall govern the validity, construction, and administration of this Trust, except that all matters relating to real property shall be governed by the laws of the situs of that real property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>The appellant argues that the words \u201cvalidity,\u201d \u201cconstruction,\u201d and \u201cadministration\u201d refer to the \u201cinternal affairs\u201d of the Trust only, and do not govern the present case, which she characterizes as a dispute involving a \u201cthird party\u201d \u2014 the decedent\u2019s estate \u2014 rather than the Trust\u2019s \u201cinternal affairs.\u201d The appellant cites no authority, and we are aware of none, that supports her interpretation. On the contrary, we conclude that the term \u201cvalidity\u201d can encompass questions relating to whether the documents creating a trust were executed in accordance with the formalities required by the applicable jurisdiction, whether a transfer of property to a trust created in another state is valid, and whether a trust violates state property rules. <em>See </em>Bogert <em>et al., supra </em>\u00a7 293, at 253-54. This dispute turns upon the validity of the decedent\u2019s <em>inter vivos </em>transfers to her own Trust, and specifically whether those transfers conform to the requirements established by the relevant statutes of New Hampshire and California. Thus, the choice of law provision in the Trust is controlling, and we uphold the circuit court\u2019s decision implementing the decedent\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The appellant\u2019s final contention is that the circuit court erred in its <em>forum, non conveniens </em>analysis by considering only the \u201clocation of the witnesses and whether the law of another jurisdiction may apply\u201d when it should have also considered \u201ca host of other factors.\u201d The appellant argues that the presence of witnesses in California was more than outweighed by the various public interests of New Hampshire, thereby rendering the circuit court\u2019s analysis incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">\u201cThe dismissal of a case due to <em>forum, non conveniens </em>is generally within the discretion of the [circuit] court.\u201d <em>Stankunas v. Stankunas, </em>133 N.H. 643, 646 (1990). Thus, we will overturn the circuit court\u2019s decision only if we find an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>Digital Equipment Corp. v. Int\u2019l Digital Systems Corp., </em>130 N.H. 362, 365 (1988); <em>cf. State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 296 (2001). To show that the circuit court\u2019s decision is not sustainable, the appellant must \u201cdemonstrate that the court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of [her] case.\u201d <em>Lambert, </em>147 N.H. at 296 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\"> We have cited with approval the factors enumerated by the United States Supreme Court for applying the doctrine of <em>forum, non, conveniens. Leeper v. Leeper, </em>116 N.H. 116, 118 (1976) (citing <em>Gulf Oil v. Gilbert, </em>330 U.S. 501, 508 (1947)). These include: (1) \u201cthe private interest of the litigant\u201d; (2) the \u201crelative ease of access to sources of proof\u2019; (3) the \u201cavailability of compulsory process\u201d; (4) \u201cthe cost of obtaining attendance of willing witnesses\u201d; (5) \u201cthe possibility of view of premises if appropriate\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>(6) \u201cthe question of enforceability of the foreign judgment\u201d; and (7) \u201cother concerns relating to the public interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the circuit court considered, either explicitly or implicitly, the majority of these considerations in reaching its decision. The court observed that it would be easier to access evidence and witnesses in California. The court also pointed to the extensive connections of the decedent, the Trust, and all of the parties to California, implicating \u201cconcerns relating to the public interest,\u201d the \u201cenforceability of a foreign judgment,\u201d and even the \u201cprivate interests]\u201d of the litigants. <em>Leeper, </em>116 N.H. at 118. Because the record amply supports the court\u2019s conclusion that these factors weigh heavily in favor of the selection of California as the more convenient forum, we cannot say that the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion in ruling that New Hampshire was an inconvenient forum to litigate the question of the validity of the decedent\u2019s transfer of assets to the Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b684-6\">Hicks, Conboy, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-10\"> Specifically, the assignment included, \u201cpersonal and household effects of every kind, including but not limited to furniture, fixtures, appliances, furnishings, antiques, pictures, china, silverware, glass, books, jewelry, wearing apparel, tools, pets and companion animals, which I now own or which I may own in the future,\u201d as well as \u201cmotor vehicles, boats, mobile homes, recreational vehicles; all [insurance] policies,\u201d and \u201call bank accounts, certificates of deposit, mutual and money market funds of all kinds, securities, bonds, agency and custody accounts, notes, real estate wherever located . . . business interests, and any and all other assets wherever located.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b681-8\"> The appellant cites language in <em>Robinson v.
