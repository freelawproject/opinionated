We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">The relevant facts follow. Alpha Delta has been a fraternity for students at Dartmouth College (College) since the 1840s. According to the printout from Alpha Delta\u2019s website included in the certified record, in 1846 the installation of the national organization of Alpha Delta Phi took place in a College professor\u2019s office. The fraternity subsequently changed its name to Alpha Delta, \u201cto symbolize the return to the literary traditions, which were purely Dartmouth in nature.\u201d The fraternity \u201cset up operations in Dartmouth Hall until 1911, when a new house was built to the west of the College Green.\u201d In 1920, Alpha Delta sold that house and built its current structure, which it has used continuously since as housing for approximately 18-22 College undergraduate students who are members of the fraternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-13\">In 1981, the Town enacted its first zoning ordinance. At that time, Alpha Delta\u2019s property was located in the \u201cEducational District\u201d in which an \u201c[ejducational use, or dormitory . . . incidental to and controlled by an educational institution\u201d was permitted as of right. Between 1981 and the mid-1970s, the property was located in various zoning districts where its use by Alpha Delta as a fraternity was allowed as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>In 1976, the Town enacted its current zoning ordinance, under which the property is located within the \u201cInstitution\u201d district. A student residence in the Institution district is allowed only by special exception. The ordinance defines a \u201cstudent residence\u201d in the Institution district as \u201c[a] building designed for and occupied by students and operated in conjunction with another institutional use, which may include individual living units with social rooms and kitchen facilities for any number of students.\u201d Alpha Delta has never sought a special exception for the use of its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">On April 13, 2015, the College notified Alpha Delta by letter that, due to the fraternity\u2019s violation of the school\u2019s standards of conduct, it had revoked recognition of the fraternity as a student organization. The College found that over two nights in November 2014, during a time when the fraternity was under suspension by the College, 11 new members of the fraternity were branded with the Alpha Delta fraternity letters, which had \u201ccaused physical harm and ... a subsequent threat to [the members\u2019] continuing safety.\u201d The College also found that the practice of branding new members \u201cis an overtly condoned and long-standing practice of the organization.\u201d The letter stated that \u201cderecognition\u201d revoked the following privileges: \u201crecruitment of Dartmouth College undergraduates; recognition as a \u2018college approved\u2019 residential facility; use of College facilities or resources; participation in any College activities such as intramurals; and provision of insurance coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">In addition, the College notified Alpha Delta that it would be removed from the College\u2019s rooming system under which student room rents are paid through the College, and would no longer be under the jurisdiction or protection of the College\u2019s department of safety and security. The letter stated that \u201c[a]s the Alpha Delta chapter will no longer be recognized by the College as a student organization . . ., the [Town] zoning requirements are likely to apply differently.\u201d The College stated that it would \u201cnotify the [Town] that Alpha Delta no longer has a relationship with Dartmouth College\u201d and that it was the College\u2019s \u201cunderstanding that under the Town zoning ordinance no more than three unrelated people will be allowed to reside on the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">On April 23, the Town\u2019s zoning administrator notified Alpha Delta by letter of its decision that, because the College had derecognized Alpha Delta, Alpha Delta\u2019s use of the property violated the zoning ordinance. The letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-8\">The Adopted Zoning Ordinance requires that student residences in the \u201cI\u201d Institution zoning district be operated in conjunction with another institutional use.... Because it has been derecognized by Dartmouth College, the facility is no longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>operated in conjunction with an institutional use. The continued use of the property as a residence is therefore a violation of the zoning ordinance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Accordingly, the zoning administrator informed Alpha Delta that \u201c[t]he continued occupancy of the property [by at least 18 individuals] must cease immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">On April 29, Alpha Delta appealed the zoning administrator\u2019s decision to the ZBA. Prior to the hearing, the College submitted a letter to the ZBA explaining that \u201c[a]s a result of its derecognition, the Alpha Delta organization no longer has any official status relative to Dartmouth College and the College\u2019s relationship to [Alpha Delta] ... is no different from its relationship to any other Hanover property owner.\u201d The letter further explained that \u201c[a]ll . . . College services to [the property] that could be terminated consistent with safety and student welfare have already been terminated,\u201d including \u201croutine safety checks or walk-throughs of the property\u201d by the College\u2019s department of safety and security. Other services were in the process of being terminated, including Internet service provided by the College and the property\u2019s fire alarm connection to the Town\u2019s police and fire departments through the College\u2019s \u201cdialer system.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) In addition, the letter stated that \u201cAlpha Delta is no longer part of the student residential life system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Following a hearing, the ZBA issued a written decision affirming the zoning administrator\u2019s determination that Alpha Delta\u2019s use of its property as a student residence violated the zoning ordinance. The ZBA rejected Alpha Delta\u2019s argument that, to the extent the zoning administrator had adopted recognition/derecognition status as a zoning requirement, Alpha Delta should be considered \u201cgrandfathered\u201d from such a requirement because the existence and nature of recognition by the College had varied before the zoning ordinance was adopted. The ZBA explained that Alpha Delta\u2019s argument \u201cmisconstrues the nature of the Zoning Administrator\u2019s finding of a violation.\u201d The ZBA stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-8\">The Zoning Administrator did not adopt a private institution\u2019s \u2018recognition\u2019 standards as part of the Zoning Ordinance. Rather she (and this Board) have considered the facts surrounding this particular instance of the College\u2019s action of \u2018de-recognition\u2019 to determine whether or not those facts show that [Alpha Delta\u2019s] use of its property continues to meet a voter-approved Town requirement which unarguably is contained in the Ordinance \u2014 namely the requirement that a student residence in the \u201cI\u201d district must be \u201coperated in conjunction with another institutional use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>The ZBA concluded that, because Alpha Delta \u201cfailed to present any evidence that the fraternity ever operated in a manner which was not \u2018in conjunction with\u2019 [the] College, prior to the adoption of that zoning requirement,\u201d Alpha Delta did not sustain \u201cits burden of showing that its property is lawfully nonconforming.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">In addition, the ZBA rejected Alpha Delta\u2019s argument that the \u201cin conjunction with\u201d requirement was met as long as the residents in the fraternity\u2019s building are all students of the College. The ZBA considered that other zoning districts allow \u201cfamily\u201d dwelling units \u201cwhose residents are also all, or primarily, [College] students, but where the property has no ties at all to the College.\u201d Unlike the Institution district that allows a student residence for \u201cany number of students,\u201d the \u201cfamily\u201d dwelling units are restricted to no more than three unrelated persons. Given those different restrictions, the ZBA reasoned that \u201cfundamental health and safety concerns validly justify the disparate treatment of the number of unrelated persons living in a \u2018family\u2019 dwelling unit \u2014 by contrast with a \u2018Student Residence\u2019 \u2014 even though both types of residences may be occupied by [College] students.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Thus, recognizing that \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018in conjunction with another institutional use\u2019 certainly has to have some meaning,\u201d the ZBA concluded that the purpose of the requirement was to address health and safety concerns. The ZBA reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-7\">[i]t was rational and reasonable for the voters of Hanover, in enacting the Zoning Ordinance, to consider that students in a \u2018student residence\u2019 which is \u2018operated in conjunction with another institutional use\u2019 will potentially have their health and safety overseen to some degree by that other institution (in this case by Dartmouth), whereas students residing elsewhere do not benefit from that same protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">The ZBA found that, as a result of derecognition, Alpha Delta had lost all health and safety oversight by the College, including that Alpha Delta was no longer recognized as a College-approved residential facility and was no longer \u201cunder the jurisdiction or protection\u201d of the College\u2019s department of safety and security. Accordingly, the ZBA concluded that Alpha Delta\u2019s property was no longer \u201coperated in conjunction with another institutional use\u201d and its use of the property as a student residence violated the zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">After the ZBA denied its request for rehearing, Alpha Delta appealed to the superior court. Following a hearing, the trial court affirmed the ZBA\u2019s decision. The court rejected Alpha Delta\u2019s assertion \u201cthat it is grandfathered from the \u2018operated in conjunction with another institutional use\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>requirement . . . simply because it has used [the property] as a student residence continuously since prior to the enactment of the Ordinance.\u201d The trial court reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-5\">[t]he issue is not. .. whether Alpha Delta\u2019s use of the property to house [College] students is grandfathered. Rather, the issue is whether its use of the property in a manner that is not \u201cin conjunction with another institutional use\u201d is grandfathered. In order to prove that it was grandfathered from the \u201cin conjunction with\u201d requirement, Alpha Delta, therefore, needed to show that it operated [the property] in a manner that was not \u201cin conjunction with another institutional use\u201d at the time the \u201cin conjunction with\u201d requirement was adopted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Concluding that the record supported the ZBA\u2019s finding that Alpha Delta \u201cfailed to present any evidence that the fraternity ever operated in a manner which was not \u2018in conjunction with\u2019 [the] College, prior to the adoption of that zoning requirement,\u201d the trial court upheld the ZBA\u2019s decision as \u201cneither legally erroneous nor unreasonable.\u201d (Quotation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">The trial court also disagreed with Alpha Delta\u2019s assertion that because \u201c \u2018the only people who reside at [the property] are and have been [College] students currently attending [the] College, and the only people who can belong to the Corporation and participate in operating the property are [College] alumni,\u2019 \u201d the ZBA erred in its interpretation of the \u201cin conjunction with another institutional use\u201d requirement. Considering the plain meaning of the word \u201cconjunction\u201d and interpreting the phrase \u201cin conjunction with\u201d in the context of the zoning ordinance as a whole, the court agreed with the ZBA that the purpose of the requirement \u201cwas to ensure that a student residence maintain the proper relationship to, or association with, the College,\u201d including \u201chealth and safety oversight by the College.\u201d The trial court found that there \u201cis more than sufficient evidence\u201d to support the ZBA\u2019s finding that the potential for health and safety oversight by the College has been eliminated as a result of derecognition. The court also found that Alpha Delta \u201coffered <em>no </em>evidence of any association or relationship with the College following derecognition apart from the fact that the residents of [the property] are ... College students.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">Judicial review of zoning cases is limited. <em>Greene v. Town of Deering, </em>151 N.H. 795, 797 (2005). The party seeking to set aside a zoning board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>adjustment\u2019s decision has the burden to show that it is unlawful or unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>We will uphold the trial court\u2019s decision on appeal unless it is unsupported by the evidence or legally erroneous. <em>Lone Pine Hunters\u2019 Club v. Town of Hollis, </em>149 N.H. 668, 669 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">For its part, the trial court, in reviewing the decision of a zoning board of adjustment, is limited to a determination of whether, on the balance of the probabilities, the decision was unlawful or unreasonable. RSA 677:6 (2016); <em>see Lone Pine Hunters\u2019 Club, </em>149 N.H. at 669-70. To the extent the zoning board made findings upon questions of fact properly before the court, those findings are deemed <em>prima facie </em>lawful and reasonable. <em>Lone Pine Hunters\u2019 Club, </em>149 N.H. at 670; <em>see </em>RSA 677:6. The review by the trial court is not to determine whether it agrees with the zoning board\u2019s findings, but to determine whether there is evidence upon which they could have been reasonably based. <em>Lone Pine Hunters\u2019 Club, </em>149 N.H. at 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">On appeal, Alpha Delta argues that the trial court erred by: (1) finding Alpha Delta in violation of the zoning ordinance because its property, \u201cas a matter of law is \u2018grandfathered\u2019 and not a \u2018Student Residence\u2019 as that term is defined in\u201d the ordinance; and (2) affirming the ZBA\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201cin conjunction with\u201d to mean \u201cthe <em>potential </em>for health and safety oversight by that other institution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">\n<em>A. Nonconforming Uses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">A nonconforming use is a lawful use existing since prior to the adoption of a zoning ordinance prohibiting such use, and that does not conform to the requirements of the ordinance. <em>See Town of Salem v. Wickson, </em>146 N.H. 328, 330 (2001); <em>see also Hurley v. Town of Hollis, </em>143 N.H. 567, 571 (1999) (explaining that \u201ca zoning ordinance does not apply to structures or uses of the property that existed at the time the ordinance was enacted\u201d (quotation and brackets omitted)). \u201cThe right to maintain nonconforming uses is meant to protect property owners from a retrospective application of zoning ordinances, so that property owners may continue using and enjoying their property when their uses were lawful prior to the enactment of a zoning ordinance or amendment thereto.\u201d <em>New London Land Use Assoc. v. New London Zoning Board, </em>130 N.H. 510, 516 (1988). The creation of a lawful nonconforming use depends upon the facts existing at the time the change in the zoning ordinance created the nonconforming use. <em>Wickson, </em>146 N.H. at 330-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">Nonconforming uses are protected by RSA 674:19 (2016) and by Part I, Articles 2 and 12 of the New Hampshire Constitution. <em>Ray\u2019s Stateline Market v. Town of Pelham, </em>140 N.H. 139, 143 (1995); <em>see Town of Seabrook </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number><em>v. Vachon Management, </em>144 N.H. 660, 664 (2000) (stating that the State Constitution and state statute \u201cboth recognize that an established use of land is not disturbed by a subsequent land restriction\u201d). \u201cTo qualify for such protection, a nonconforming use must lawfully exist at the time the restriction is adopted and have continually existed since that time.\u201d <em>Vachon Management, </em>144 N.H. at 664. The burden to prove a lawful nonconforming use is on the party asserting that right. <em>See Town of Wolfeboro v. Smith, </em>131 N.H. 449, 457 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Alpha Delta argues that because its \u201cuse of its property as a fraternity pre-existed all zoning ordinances and [Alpha Delta] has never sought or obtained a Special Exception to operate as a Student Residence,\u201d it has proven that its use \u201clegally existed prior to the adoption of a zoning provision prohibiting the use.\u201d Therefore, Alpha Delta asserts, it \u201cuses its property as a lawful non-conforming fraternity\u201d not subject to the current zoning restrictions \u201cthat call for a Student Residence to operate in conjunction with another institutional use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">As applied to a student residence in the Institution district, the zoning ordinance imposes three separate use requirements. First, the ordinance requires that a student residence operate \u201cin conjunction with another institutional use\u201d in the same district. Second, the ordinance requires that a student residence obtain a special exception. Third, as with all uses in the Institution district, a student residence \u201cmust relate to the uses of the institution having ownership interest in land in the district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Both the ZBA and the trial court assumed, and the parties do not dispute, that Alpha Delta\u2019s use of the property as a student residence was lawful without a special exception because Alpha Delta was using its property as a student residence before the special exception requirement was enacted. Thus, in 1976, when the current ordinance was enacted, Alpha Delta\u2019s use of its property was lawfully <em>nememform.mg </em>with respect to the special exception requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Both the ZBA and the trial court found that Alpha Delta failed to establish that it was operating in a manner <em>neit </em>in conjunction with the College in 1976 when the \u201cin conjunction with\u201d requirement was enacted. Alpha Delta does not challenge this finding on appeal. Thus, when the amended zoning ordinance was enacted, Alpha Delta\u2019s use of its property as a student residence was <em>conforming </em>with respect to the requirement that the residence be operated in conjunction with the College.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">Despite acknowledging that its use of the property is, and always has been, a student residence housing approximately 18-22 College undergraduate students who are members of the fraternity, Alpha Delta, nonetheless, argues that \u201cas a matter of law, [its] property is \u2018grandfathered\u2019 and not a student residence as that term is defined in . . . the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>amended zoning ordinance.\u201d (Capitalization and bolding omitted.) According to Alpha Delta, such use \u201ccomes into existence only via the application for and actual issuance of a special exception\u201d and, therefore, Alpha Delta\u2019s use is lawfully nonconforming because it \u201chas never sought nor obtained a special exception to operate as a student residence.\u201d (Capitalization and bolding omitted.) However, Alpha Delta\u2019s arguments \u2014 that in order to be a student residence it was required to obtain a special exception \u2014 are based upon a faulty assumption. As set forth above, Alpha Delta\u2019s use of its property was \u201cgrandfathered\u201d in that it was relieved of the requirement that a student residence obtain a special exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">In addition, those arguments misconstrue the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision. The issue before both the ZBA and the trial court was not whether Alpha Delta\u2019s lack of a special exception rendered its use as a student residence nonconforming; it is undisputed that Alpha Delta is lawfully nonconforming with respect to the special exception requirement. Rather, the issue was whether Alpha Delta\u2019s use as a student residence, following the College\u2019s derecognition of the fraternity in 2015, continued to comply with the zoning requirement that a student residence in the Institution district operate in conjunction with another institutional use.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Citing a 2014 zoning board decision regarding the Kappa Kappa Kappa fraternity (Tri-Kap), Alpha Delta argues that, because the ZBA in that case \u201cruled that a lawful non-conforming fraternity can never be a student residence as defined in [the ordinance] unless the landowner has obtained a special exception,\u201d the ZBA is bound by <em>stare decisis </em>to reach the same conclusion in this case. (Capitalization and bolding omitted.) According to Alpha Delta, the Tri-Kap decision supports its position that the \u201cin conjunction with\u201d language <em>\u201conly </em>applies to those property owners who have been granted a Special Exception to operate as a \u2018Student Residence.\u2019 \u201d Assuming, without deciding, that the ZBA is bound by the principle of <em>stare decisis, </em>we disagree that the Tri-Kap decision is relevant to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">The Tri-Kap decision supports our construction of the zoning ordinance as applied to Alpha Delta. In Tri-Kap, the ZBA found that Tri-Kap\u2019s use of its property as a student residence was a lawful nonconforming use under the zoning ordinance because, like Alpha Delta, it existed as a student residence prior to the adoption of the requirement that a student residence obtain a special exception. Moreover, the issue in Tri-Kap had nothing to do with the \u201cin conjunction with\u201d language in the ordinance. Rather, the decision was about whether Tri-Kap needed a variance or a special exception to expand the footprint of its building and to expand its use. Contrary to Alpha Delta\u2019s assertions, the Tri-Kap decision does not stand for the proposition that a special exception must be obtained in order for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>fraternity to be a student residence under the zoning ordinance and thereby become subject to the \u201cin conjunction with\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">We are likewise not persuaded by the other zoning board decisions cited by Alpha Delta in support of its argument that the ZBA should be \u201cestopped\u201d from determining that the zoning ordinance requires that Alpha Delta \u201coperate a Student Residence in conjunction with the College to allow the continued use of its Property.\u201d None of those decisions address the \u201cin conjunction with\u201d language and, therefore, are not relevant to the issue before us. To the extent that Alpha Delta is arguing that these zoning decisions are proof of selective enforcement by the Town of its zoning ordinance, we agree with the ZBA that \u201c[t]he mere fact that a Town may have been lax in its enforcement in the past does not prohibit enforcement in the present.\u201d <em>See Anderson v. Motorsports Holdings, </em>155 N.H. 491, 499 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Finally, Alpha Delta contends that it did not \u201cwaive its rights as a lawful, nonconforming use simply by any voluntary association with Dartmouth College.\u201d (Capitalization and bolding omitted.) Alpha Delta argues that \u201c[t]he ZBA, affirmed by the trial court, suggested that by \u2018opting into\u2019 the College\u2019s stricter post-1980\u2019s regulatory regime, [Alpha Delta] in effect waived all of the grandfathering rights it had possessed since the 1920s, because [Alpha Delta] did not present evidence that it had not operated \u2018in conjunction with\u2019 the College prior to 1981.\u201d We disagree with both Alpha Delta\u2019s characterization of the ZBA\u2019s finding and its interpretation of the legal principles applicable to preexisting nonconforming uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\"> A lawful nonconforming use is a use in fact existing on the land at the time of adoption of the ordinance. <em>See New London Land Use Assoc., </em>130 N.H. at 515-16. As the trial court correctly stated, \u201cIn order to prove that it was grandfathered from the \u2018in conjunction with\u2019 requirement, Alpha Delta . . . needed to show that it operated [the property] in a manner that was not \u2018in conjunction with another institutional use\u2019 at the time the \u2018in conjunction with\u2019 requirement was adopted.\u201d The ZBA found, and the trial court affirmed, that Alpha Delta \u201cfailed to present any evidence that the fraternity <em>ever </em>operated in a manner which was not \u2018in conjunction with\u2019 [the] College, prior to the adoption of that zoning requirement.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because Alpha Delta was lawfully operating a student residence \u201cin conjunction with\u201d the College <em>in 1976, </em>it was not until the College derecognized the fraternity in 2015 that Alpha Delta\u2019s use of the property violated the Town\u2019s zoning requirement that a student residence operate in conjunction with another institutional use.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>\n<em>II. In Conjunction, With Another Institutional Use</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Alpha Delta next argues that the ZBA\u2019s \u201cinterpretation that the phrase \u2018in conjunction with\u2019 means ... \u2018the <em>potential </em>for health and safety oversight by that other institution\u2019 is unconstitutionally vague, speculative, legally erroneous, contrary to the plain language of the ordinance, . . . and [is] arbitrary and capricious.\u201d Alpha Delta asserts that the ZBA \u201cdiscovered\u201d the meaning of the words \u201cin conjunction with\u201d \u201cin order to justify that [Alpha Delta] was in violation of the Ordinance.\u201d (Quotation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">We observe, however, that the interpretation of a zoning ordinance is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. Anderson, </em>155 N.H. at 494. \u201cBecause the traditional rules of statutory construction generally govern our review, the words and phrases of an ordinance should be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494-95. \u201cWhen the language of an ordinance is plain and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the ordinance itself for further indications of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 495. \u201cMoreover, we will not guess what the drafters of the ordinance might have intended, or add words that they did not see fit to include.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The meaning of a zoning ordinance is determined \u201cfrom its construction as a whole, not by construing isolated words or phrases.\u201d <em>Feins v. Town of Wilmot, </em>154 N.H. 715, 719 (2007) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">The phrase \u201cin conjunction with\u201d is not defined in the zoning ordinance and, therefore, we ascribe to the words their plain and ordinary meaning. <em>See Appeal of Town of Nottingham, </em>153 N.H. 539, 553 (2006). \u201cConjunction\u201d is defined as \u201cthe act of conjoining or state of being conjoined: UNION, ASSOCIATION, COMBINATION.\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD New International Dictionary 480 (unabridged ed. 2002). Thus, under the unambiguous meaning of the word \u201cconjunction,\u201d Alpha Delta must have some union, association or combination with the College.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">The ZBA found that \u201cin fact, [Alpha Delta] has failed to present any evidence contradicting the College Counsel\u2019s statement that \u2018the College\u2019s relationship to [Alpha Delta] ... is now no different from its relationship to any other Hanover property owner.\u2019 \u201d (Brackets omitted.) The trial court affirmed the ZBA\u2019s determination, and concluded that \u201cAlpha Delta offered <em>no </em>evidence of any association or relationship with the College following derecognition.\u201d We agree that the record supports the trial court\u2019s affir-mance of the ZBA\u2019s finding that upon the College\u2019s revocation of its recognition of Alpha Delta as a student organization, Alpha Delta has no association with the College and thus is no longer \u201coperating in conjunction with\u201d the College.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>Based upon our review of the relevant law and the record before us, we hold that the trial court\u2019s decision was neither unsupported by the evidence nor legally erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s determination that the use of Alpha Delta\u2019s property as a student residence violates the Town\u2019s zoning ordinance. To the extent that Alpha Delta\u2019s brief raises additional arguments, we conclude that they warrant no further discussion. <em>See Vogel v.
