We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The following facts are taken from the trial court\u2019s order or otherwise found in the record. In 1998, pursuant to a plea agreement, the petitioner pleaded guilty to second degree murder and attempted escape. Pursuant to the agreement, he was sentenced to 28 years to life. Some 15 years later, in April 2018, the petitioner was transferred from the New Hampshire State Prison to a Florida prison. In June 2018, he filed a habeas corpus petition as a self-represented party. After the appointment of counsel, the petitioner supplemented his habeas corpus petition with an IAC claim, alleging that he was \u201cdenied his right to the effective assistance of counsel\u201d because his trial attorneys \u201cfailed to ensure that he made a knowing waiver of his rights\u201d by not telling him when he pleaded guilty that he could be transferred to a prison outside of New Hampshire. (Bolding and capitalization omitted.) The State moved to dismiss the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">After a telephonic hearing, the trial court dismissed the petitioner\u2019s IAC claim, ruling that, because \u201cthe possibility of being sent out of state is a collateral consequence,\u201d and the \u201cfail[ure] to inform a client of the collateral consequences of his conviction ... does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel,\u201d he could not \u201cdemonstrate [that] his trial attorneys were ineffective by failing to warn him that he could serve his time out of state.\u201d (Emphasis and capitalization omitted.) This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">\u201cOn an appeal from an order granting a motion to dismiss, we assume the truth of both the facts alleged in the [petitioner\u2019s] pleadings and all reasonable inferences therefrom as construed most favorably to the [petitioner].\u201d <em>Cross v. Warden, N.H. State Prison, </em>138 N.H. 591, 593 (1994). \u201cWe need not, however, accept allegations . . . that are merely conclusions of law.\u201d <em>Suprenant v. Mulcrone, </em>163 N.H. 529, 530 (2012); <em>see Cross, </em>188 N.H. at 598. \u2018We then engage in a threshold inquiry, testing the facts alleged in the pleadings against the applicable law.\u201d <em>Suprenant, </em>163 N.H. at 530-31. \u201cWe will uphold the trial court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss if the facts pleaded do not constitute a basis for legal relief.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">The petitioner\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel rests upon Part I, Article 15 of the State Constitution and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution. We first address the petitioner\u2019s claim under the State Constitution and rely upon federal law only to aid our analysis. <em>State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Our State and Federal Constitutions guarantee a criminal defendant reasonably competent assistance of counsel. <em>State v. Sharkey, </em>155 N.H. 638, 640 (2007); <em>see </em>U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV; N.H. Const. pt. I, art. 15. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>Generally, to resolve an IAC claim, we apply the two-pronged <em>Strickland </em>test, which requires a criminal defendant to demonstrate that his or her defense counsel provided constitutionally deficient performance that resulted in prejudice. <em>State v. Whittaker, </em>158 N.H. 762, 768 (2009); <em>see Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). However, when the alleged deficient performance is defense counsel\u2019s failure to inform a client of a particular consequence of a guilty plea, we first determine whether <em>Strickland </em>applies at all. <em>See Wellington v. Comm\u2019r, Dept. of Corrections, </em>140 N.H. 399, 400-02 (1995). To do so, we examine whether the particular consequence was direct or collateral to the plea. <em>See id. </em>If collateral, the <em>Strickland </em>test does not apply. <em>See id. </em>at 402. If direct, the protections against IAC are triggered and we undertake a <em>Strickland </em>analysis. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 402 (holding that the <em>Strickland </em>test does not apply to IAC claims involving collateral consequences).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The petitioner argues that this framework contravenes the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 364-66 (2010), and our decision in <em>State v. Ortiz, </em>163 N.H. 506, 512-14 (2012). According to the petitioner, <em>Padilla, </em>and <em>Ortiz </em>render the distinction between direct and collateral consequences immaterial to an IAC claim. He contends that the distinction applies only in the context of determining whether a trial court has violated a criminal defendant\u2019s due process rights by accepting his or her guilty plea without advising a defendant of the potential consequences. Consequently, he argues that his IAC claim concerning his trial counsel\u2019s failure to inform him of a collateral consequence should be evaluated under the <em>Strickland </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">For the purposes of this appeal, we assume without deciding that we would adopt <em>Padilla, </em>in construing the State Constitution and that we would apply it retroactively to the petitioner\u2019s IAC claim. <em>But see Chaidez v. United States, </em>133 S. Ct. 1103, 1107-11 (2013) (holding that <em>Padilla </em>applies only prospectively under the Federal Constitution). Nevertheless, we disagree with the petitioner\u2019s assertion that <em>Padilla, </em>is controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">In <em>Padilla, </em>the Supreme Court neither mandated nor rejected the \u201cdistinction between direct and collateral consequences to define the scope of constitutionally \u2018reasonable professional assistance\u2019 required under <em>Strickland.\" Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 365. To the contrary, the Court established that deportation is a singular exception to the direct/collateral consequences model because deportation is \u201cuniquely difficult to classify as either.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366. Thus, in <em>Padilla, </em>the Supreme Court held that an attorney\u2019s failure to warn a client that a guilty plea would result in deportation could constitute IAC and that such a claim should be evaluated under the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>Id. </em>at 365-66. In <em>Chaidez, </em>the Court explained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>that \u201cin <em>Padilla </em>[it] did not eschew the direct-collateral divide across the board,\u201d but rather \u201crelied on the special \u2018nature of deportation\u2019... to show that \u2018[t]he collateral versus direct distinction [was] ill-suited\u2019 \u201d to dispose of the claim in <em>Padilla. Chaidez, </em>133 S. Ct. at 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Our decision in <em>Ortiz </em>did not involve an IAC claim. <em>Ortiz, </em>163 N.H. at 507. Rather, it concerned a due process challenge to a trial court\u2019s plea colloquy. <em>Id. </em>In that case, we held that \u201cour state\u2019s constitutional due process protections do not require trial courts to advise defendants of. . . potential [immigration] consequences during plea colloquies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514. In doing so, we noted in dicta that \u201cdefense counsel may be ineffective in relation to a guilty plea due to professional duties for the representation of their individual clients that set a standard different \u2014 and higher \u2014 than those traditionally imposed on trial courts conducting plea hearings for defendants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512 (quotation omitted). Furthermore, we noted that the IAC analysis and the due process analysis \u201cdiffer markedly.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The petitioner here argues that this dicta \u201cimplicitly overruled\u201d our prior cases establishing the inapplicability of the <em>Strickland </em>test to IAC claims based upon failure of counsel to advise of collateral consequences. <em>See Wellington, </em>140 N.H. at 402. However, our statements in <em>Ortiz </em>were made in response to the petitioner\u2019s argument, based upon the holding in <em>Padilla, </em>that deportation should not be subject to the direct/collateral consequences model in the context of a due process challenge alleging error by the trial court. <em>Ortiz, </em>163 N.H. at 511. We neither explicitly nor implicitly overruled our prior decisions regarding the standard applicable to alleged errors by trial counsel. <em>See id. </em>at 511-12; <em>see also Wellington, </em>140 N.H. at 401-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Alternatively, the petitioner argues that, although some collateral consequences may \u201cbe categorically excluded from the range of matters about which a lawyer must provide advice,\u201d interstate prison transfer, like deportation, is not among them. He asserts that interstate prison transfer is, like deportation, a \u201cparticularly severe penalty\u201d that is \u201cintimately related to the criminal process,\u201d and \u201cmost difficult to divorce\u201d from the underlying conviction. <em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 365, 366 (quotation omitted). He argues that interstate prison transfer constitutes a \u201csevere penalty\u201d because of the \u201cimpact\u201d that such transfers have upon inmates\u2019 families living near the prison in the \u201csending state.\u201d (Quotation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Interstate prison transfer is qualitatively different from deportation; deportation affects a protected liberty interest, whereas interstate prison transfer does not. <em>See Flores-Chavez v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 1150, 1161 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding that \u201can [a]lien facing deportation confronts the loss of a significant liberty interest\u201d); <em>Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, </em>178 F.3d 1139, 1146 (11th Cir. 1999); <em>cf. Olim v. Wakinekona, </em>461 U.S. 238, 248 (1983) (explaining that interstate prison transfer \u201cdoes not deprive an inmate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>any liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause\u201d). Moreover, interstate prison transfer is not \u201cintimately related to the criminal process\u201d; it may or may not occur, whereas deportation is \u201cnearly an automatic result\u201d of many convictions. <em>Padilla, </em>559 U.S. at 365, 366. Thus, we are not persuaded by the petitioner\u2019s attempt to liken interstate prison transfer to deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">We hold that, as a matter of law, interstate prison transfer is a collateral consequence of a guilty plea. Accordingly, we conclude that, even if the petitioner showed that his trial counsel failed to advise him of the potential for interstate prison transfer, such failure would not constitute constitutionally infirm assistance. Because the Federal Constitution offers the petitioner no greater protection than does the State Constitution under these circumstances, we necessarily reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution. <em>See Wellington, </em>140 N.H. at 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b705-6\">Dalianis, C.J., and Bassett, J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
