Cluff-Landry, appeals an order of the Superior Court <em>(Garfunkel, </em>J.) granting the motion to dismiss of the defendant, Roman Catholic Bishop of Manchester d/b/a St. Christopher School (the school). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-15\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b715-16\">We assume the following facts, as alleged in the plaintiffs complaint, to be true. In 2008, the plaintiff was hired by the school\u2019s former principal to work at the school for the 2008-2009 academic year as a pre-kindergarten (Pre-K) teacher and a teacher of visual arts. Her teaching contract was renewed annually in 2009, 2010, and 2011. The principal left the school at the end of the 2010-2011 school year, and in August 2011, the school hired a new principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-17\">Two new students enrolled in the Pre-K program at the beginning of the 2011-2012 academic year, each of whom exhibited defiant behaviors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>including \u201cdaily kicking, hitting, slapping, punching, spitting, biting, screaming, throwing things, and verbal abuse.\u201d One of these students left the school in October 2011, but the other student remained in the Pre-K program.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">In November 2011, the plaintiff reported to the principal \u201cher concerns that the school was not adequately set up to handle [the student] due to his unsafe behaviors and the school\u2019s inability to keep the other students safe, and that the behavior was in violation of the student-parent handbook.\u201d In response to the plaintiffs concerns, the principal \u201csimply laughed.\u201d The plaintiff continued to complain to the principal about the student, but the principal took no action. The principal \u201cinsisted that the defiant student was just very young and simply needed to repeat Pre-K.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Thereafter, the principal began taking actions that the plaintiff characterizes as retaliation against her. For example, the plaintiff describes a January 27, 2012 incident, when the principal entered the plaintiffs classroom approximately 45 minutes before the start of the school day, while the plaintiff was readying the room, and \u201cbegan talking in a very loud voice\u201d about an incident that occurred the previous day involving the defiant student. Despite the plaintiff telling the principal that she was not present for the incident, the principal \u201ccontinued to talk in a loud voice\u201d to the plaintiff repeating, \u201cI\u2019ve got to get to the bottom of this.\u201d (Quotations omitted.) The plaintiff left and went to sit in her car; upon returning to the classroom at the time she would normally report to work, she was told that the principal had called a substitute teacher to replace her for the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Later that month, after the parents of a student complained that the defiant student was bullying their daughter, the principal expelled the defiant student. Thereafter, the principal\u2019s alleged retaliation toward the plaintiff \u201cescalated.\u201d On February 3, the principal issued the plaintiff a \u201cletter of insubordination\u201d for the events on January 27. On February 22, the principal placed the plaintiff on a \u201cTeacher Improvement Plan.\u201d In March, the principal began observing the plaintiff teach in the classroom. On April 13, the principal gave the plaintiff her \u201cLesson Observation\u201d report in which she stated that the plaintiff: \u201cneeds to work on her ability to develop strategies for student behavior issues,\u201d \u201cmust take responsibility for what happens in her classroom, as far as student behavior,\u201d and \u201chas difficulty working with other teachers and teacher aids when they are in her classroom.\u201d (Quotations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">On April 15, the principal sent the plaintiff a letter that stated: \u201cPlease be advised that I am unable to offer you a teaching position at St. Christopher School for the school year 2012-2013. Accordingly, any and all mutual contractual teaching obligations will expire on or before June 30,2012.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>plaintiff continued to work for the remainder of the 2011-2012 academic year. Her last day of work was on June 15, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Thereafter, \u201cconcerned [the school] was giving her a bad reference when [she] was applying for jobs,\u201d the plaintiff hired a \u201creference company,\u201d Allison &amp; Taylor, Inc. (A&amp;T), \u201cto do a reference check.\u201d On August 5, 2014, A&amp;T contacted the principal. During the conversation, the principal told A&amp;T that the plaintiff: \u201cdidn\u2019t really leave on good terms,\u201d \u201cdidn\u2019t get along with her peers and had trouble in the classroom,\u201d \u201cwas put on a plan in the end\u201d and her contract was not renewed. (Quotations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">In May 2015, the plaintiff sued the school, alleging: (1) a violation of the New Hampshire Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act, RSA chapter 275-E:2 (2010 &amp; Supp. 2016) (Act), by failing to renew her contract after she reported violations of school and public policies; (2) wrongful discharge, for failing to renew her contract; and (8) slander, based upon the principal\u2019s comments to A&amp;T. The school moved to dismiss, arguing that: (1) the plaintiffs factual allegations are insufficient to support a violation of the Act; (2) the wrongful discharge claim is barred by the statute of limitations, and also fails because the plaintiffs employment was governed by a one-year contract; and (8) the alleged defamatory statements are not actionable because the plaintiff consented to their publication. Following a hearing, the trial court granted the school\u2019s motion. The plaintiff unsuccessfully sought reconsideration, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">\n<em>II. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss, we consider \u201cwhether the allegations in the plaintiffs pleadings are reasonably susceptible of a construction that would permit recovery.\u201d <em>Sanguedolce v. Wolfe, </em>164 N.H. 644, 645 (2013). We assume the plaintiffs pleadings to be true and construe all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to her. <em>Id. </em>However, we need not assume the truth of statements in the plaintiffs pleadings that are merely conclusions of law. <em>Id. </em>We then engage in a threshold inquiry that tests the facts in the complaint against the applicable law, and if the allegations constitute a basis for legal relief, we must hold that it was improper to grant the motion to dismiss. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">\n<em>III. Whistleblowers\u2019 Protection Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">The plaintiff first argues that the trial court erred in dismissing her whistleblower claim under the Act. The plaintiff asserts that she \u201csufficiently alleged violations\u201d of the Act because she \u201creported assaults of students and teachers, an unsafe workplace that was unsafe for students,\u201d and that the Act \u201ccovers such reports, particularly where the Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>has a duty to step in and prevent assaults, bullying, and injuries to staff.\u201d (Bolding omitted.) The school counters that, in her complaint, the plaintiff \u201cmade no mention of any law or rule but focused solely on the school\u2019s policies,\u201d and that \u201c[tjhere was no . . . allegation . . . suggesting that the Plaintiff believed any actual law or rule was violated by the four-year-old or the school.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The Act provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">No employer shall harass, abuse, intimidate, discharge, threaten, or otherwise discriminate against any employee regarding compensation, terms, conditions, location, or privileges of employment because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">(a) The employee, in good faith, reports or causes to be reported, verbally or in writing, what the employee has reasonable cause to believe is a violation of <em>any law or rule adopted under the laws of this state, </em>a <em>political subdivis ion of this state, or the United States.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">RSA 275-E:2, I(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">To survive the motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must have alleged facts in her complaint that show that: (1) she \u201cengaged in an act protected by\u201d the Act; (2) she \u201csuffered an employment action proscribed by\u201d the Act; and (3) \u201cthere was a causal connection between the protected [conduct] and the proscribed employment action.\u201d <em>Appeal of Seacoast Fire Equip. Co., </em>146 N.H. 605, 608 (2001). RSA 275-E:2 \u201cdoes not require an actual violation of a law or rule but only that an employee reasonably believe that such a violation has occurred.\u201d <em>Appeal of Smithfield Dodge, </em>145 N.H. 23, 26 (2000). \u201cWhether an employee had \u2018reasonable cause to believe\u2019 is an objective question; namely, whether a reasonable person might have believed that the employer was acting unlawfully.\u201d <em>Appeal of Osram Sylvania, </em>142 N.H. 612, 618 (1998) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">A private employer\u2019s internal policies or procedures do not constitute a \u201claw or rule\u201d adopted under the laws of a state or the United States for purposes of a whistleblower claim. <em>See, e.g., Nichols v. Metro. Center for Independent Living, </em>50 F.3d 514, 517 (8th Cir. 1995) (explaining that an employee\u2019s complaint concerned a change in her employer\u2019s management policies, not a violation of the law within the meaning of Minnesota\u2019s whistleblower retaliatory discharge statute; \u201cthe public does not have an interest in a business\u2019s internal management problems\u201d (quotation and brackets omitted)); <em>University of Houston v. Barth, </em>403 S.W.3d 851, 856 (Tex. 2013) (holding that a university\u2019s internal administrative policies cannot form the basis for a report of a violation of law because they are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>\u201crules adopted under a statute\u201d as required by the Texas Whistleblower Act (quotation and brackets omitted)); <em>Mullins v. Dallas Independent School Dist., </em>357 S.W.3d 182, 188 (Tex. App. 2012) (stating that complaints alleging violations of an employer\u2019s internal procedures and policies will not support a claim under the state\u2019s statute); <em>cf. Frevert v. Ford Motor Co., </em>614 F.3d 466, 474 (8th Cir. 2010) (explaining that employee\u2019s allegations in his writ of \u201cviolations of Company policy\u201d were insufficient to establish a common law claim for wrongful termination against public policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The plaintiffs complaint alleges that she \u201creasonably believed\u201d that she reported violations of the \u201cschool\u2019s policies and procedures\u201d and violations of \u201cother public policies such as assault.\u201d According to her allegations, in November 2011, the plaintiff reported to the principal \u201cher concerns that the school was not adequately set up to handle [the defiant student] due to his unsafe behaviors and the school\u2019s inability to keep the other students safe, and that the behavior was in violation of the student-parent handbook.\u201d The complaint further alleges that the plaintiff \u201ccontinued to complain to [the principal] about the disruption in the classroom and the unsafe environment due to the defiant student\u2019s behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">We agree with the trial court that, to the extent the plaintiffs whistleblower claim is based upon her reports of violations of the school\u2019s internal policies, such as the school\u2019s student-parent handbook, she has failed to allege facts that show that she engaged in an act protected by the Act. <em>Cf. Appeal of Seacoast Fire Equip. Co., </em>146 N.H. at 606-07 (employee reported illegal dumping of fire extinguisher residue and wage law violations); <em>Appeal of Fred Fuller Oil Co., </em>144 N.H. 607, 609 (2000) (employee reported employer\u2019s violation of statutes and regulations limiting the number of hours a commercial driver may work); <em>Appeal of Osram Sylvania, </em>142 N.H. at 614-15 (employee filed a safety complaint that temperatures at the employer\u2019s production plant were excessive in violation of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">We also agree with the trial court that, to the extent the plaintiffs claim is based upon her report of an \u201cassault,\u201d a reasonable employer would not have understood her complaint to constitute a \u201creport\u201d that the child had violated the simple assault statute, RSA 631:2-a (2016). <em>See Appeal of Fred Fuller Oil Co., </em>144 N.H. at 611 (we consider a \u201creport\u201d under the Act to have been made \u201cif a reasonable employer would have understood from an employee\u2019s complaint that the employee was reciting a violation of law\u201d). As the trial court reasoned,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\">[t]he disruptive student at issue in this case was four years old. The complaint does not suggest in any way that the plaintiff made clear to [the principal] that she believed the four-year old\u2019s conduct was a violation of a criminal statute. Simply put, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>reasonable principal would not believe that an experienced teacher\u2019s complaints of a four-year-old student\u2019s disruptive behavior should be construed as a report of a violation of the law. In fact, in the complaint, the plaintiff states that she only referenced the student-parent handbook and the school\u2019s internal policies \u2014 and not the criminal code \u2014 when she made the complaints.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The plaintiff further asserts that because, \u201c[w]hen reporting an alleged violation, an employee is not required to expressly identify the law allegedly violated,\u201d her \u201creports should reasonably have been understood\u201d by the school to encompass violations of \u201cDepartment of Education regulations,\u201d the Pupil Safety and Violence Prevention statute, <em>see </em>RSA ch. 193-F (2008 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2016), and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, <em>see </em>RSA ch. 281-A (2010 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2016). (Bolding omitted.) Although the plaintiff concedes that RSA chapter 193-F applies only to public schools, she contends that \u201cNew Hampshire Board of Education rules\u201d require non-public accredited schools \u201cto adopt grievance policies\u201d concerning bullying, citing, specifically, New Hampshire Administrative Rules, Ed 403.01(a)(2)(o)(1). (Bolding omitted.) However, that rule simply requires that, as part of the application for initial approval as a non-public school for attendance purposes, an applicant must provide a letter of intent that includes, among other things, a \u201ccopy of the school\u2019s grievance policy including .. . procedures to address complaints\u201d concerning bullying. N.H. Admin. R., Ed 403.01(a)(2)(o)(1). Even assuming that rule applies in this case, the plaintiff does not argue that the school failed to comply with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">We, likewise, reject the plaintiffs contention that she reasonably believed she was reporting a violation of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law. RSA 281-A:64,1, requires that employers provide employees with \u201csafe employment,\u201d including \u201cfurnishing personal protective equipment, safety appliances and safeguards\u201d and \u201cadopting work methods and procedures which will protect the life, health, and safety of the employees.\u201d RSA 281-A:64, I (Supp. 2016). The trial court explained that \u201c[t]he general purpose of RSA 281-A:64, I is to force employers to provide employees with proper equipment and attire, as well as to create safety protocols to combat inherently unsafe working conditions.\u201d The trial court correctly reasoned that it \u201ccannot infer from the face of her complaint that the plaintiff believed she was reporting a violation of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Statute,\u201d that the plaintiff did not allege in her complaint that \u201cthe four-year-old student\u2019s \u2018assaults\u2019 jeopardized her safety or the safety of other employees,\u201d and that \u201cunder the pleaded facts, no reasonable employer would believe that the plaintiff was complaining of a violation of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>The plaintiff did not plead any facts in her complaint to support her argument that a reasonable employer would have understood that she was reporting a violation of anything other than the school\u2019s \u201cpolicies and procedures\u201d and \u201cother public policies such as assault.\u201d At most, the plaintiff has alleged issues related to internal management matters. The trial court gave the plaintiff an opportunity to amend her complaint \u201cto clarify [her] claims or to correct deficiencies before dismissal has preclusive effect,\u201d but she declined to do so. Accordingly, limiting our review to the well-pleaded allegations of fact in the plaintiffs complaint, and construing all reasonable inferences from them in her favor, <em>see Ojo v. Lorenzo, </em>164 N.H. 717, 724 (2013), we conclude that the facts she alleged do not, as a matter of law, establish that she \u201cengaged in an act protected by\u201d the Act. <em>Appeal of Seacoast Fire Equip. Co., </em>146 N.H. at 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">\n<em>IV. Wrongful Discharge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The plaintiff next argues that the trial court erred in granting the school\u2019s motion to dismiss her wrongful discharge claim because it is barred by the three-year statute of limitations. <em>See </em>RSA 508:4, I (2010) (\u201call personal actions . . . may be brought only within 3 years of the act or omission complained of\u2019). She asserts that her cause of action \u201cdid not begin to accrue until at least June 15, 2012 when she was separated from work, and therefore she timely filed her claim on May 13, 2015.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">\u201cStatutes of limitation place a limit on the time in which a plaintiff may bring suit after a cause of action accrues.\u201d <em>Beane v. Dana S. Beane &amp; Co., </em>160 N.H. 708, 712 (2010) (quotation and ellipsis omitted). A cause of action arises, thereby triggering the running of the three-year period, once all of the elements necessary for that claim are present. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">The plaintiffs complaint alleges that she was wrongfully discharged by the school because her \u201cteaching contract should have been renewed for the following academic year and into the future,\u201d but that \u201c[a]s a result of [her] actions, and refusals to act contrary to policy and law, [she] was non-renewed (i.e. discharged) from her employment on or about June 30, 2012.\u201d The trial court, in dismissing her claim, reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-8\">[i]n this case, the plaintiffs wrongful discharge claim is premised on the School\u2019s decision not to renew her contract. The plaintiff was notified on April 15, 2012, that her contract would not be renewed for the 2012-2013 school year. On that date, she also knew, or, based upon her complaint, had reason to believe, that the School\u2019s decision was in bad-faith and was based on her decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>to report the behavior of the disruptive student. Thus, on April 15, [2012], the plaintiffs wrongful discharge claim, to the extent she ever had one, accrued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">We agree. The plaintiffs claim, as framed in her complaint, is based upon her contract being \u201cnon-renewed\u201d by the school. Her cause of action, therefore, accrued on April 15, 2012, when all of the elements necessary for the claim were present. <em>See Beane, </em>160 N.H. at 712. We are not persuaded by her characterization of her claim as one for wrongful termination. <em>See Jeffery v. City of Nashua, </em>163 N.H. 683, 688 (2012) (noting in dicta that, in contrast to a constructive discharge claim as to which the cause of action accrues when the employee tenders his or her resignation, in a wrongful termination action, the claim accrues upon the employee\u2019s separation from employment). Because the plaintiff did not initiate her action until May 13, 2015, approximately one month after the limitations period had run, the trial court correctly concluded that her claim was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">\n<em>V. Slander</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">Finally, the plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in granting the school\u2019s motion to dismiss her slander claim on the basis that she \u201cinvited the slander by hiring a reference company to find out what the [school] was stating about her,\u201d because, according to the plaintiff, \u201c[t]here is no exception for \u2018invited\u2019 slander in New Hampshire law.\u201d (Bolding omitted.) \u201cTo survive the motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must have alleged facts that would show that the defendant failed to exercise reasonable care in publishing a false and defamatory statement of fact about [her] to a third party.\u201d <em>Sanguedolce, </em>164 N.H. at 645-46 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">The plaintiff alleges in her complaint that she \u201chired . . . [A&amp;T] to do a reference check\u201d and that A&amp;T spoke with the principal, who stated that the plaintiff \u201cdidn\u2019t really leave on good terms,\u201d \u201cdidn\u2019t get along with her peers and had trouble in the classroom,\u201d \u201cwas put on a plan in the end\u201d and her contract was not renewed. (Quotations omitted.) These allegedly defamatory statements were, she claims, \u201cmade to one or more third parties, who understood the statements\u2019 defamatory meaning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">The trial court dismissed the plaintiffs claim, explaining that \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that \u2018invited defamation,\u2019 or the issuance of a defamatory statement wherein the injured party precipitated the statement\u2019s release, is not actionable.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) The court reasoned that, \u201cin this case, the plaintiff admits in her complaint that she hired A&amp;T to \u2018do a reference check\u2019,\u201d and, \u201c[although not explicitly stated in the complaint, one can infer from it that the plaintiff directed A&amp;T to contact the school.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Thus, the trial court concluded that \u201cany statements made by [the principal] to A&amp;T are not actionable as slander because they were invited by the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The school argues that the plaintiff \u201c[does] not cite to one decision supporting her position that she should be permitted to bring an action when she procures statements made to her agent that she considers defamatory.\u201d As the school correctly states, the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by \u201cdecisions from state and federal courts across the country uniformly holding a plaintiff may not bring a claim for slander when she invites or procures the very statements that form the basis of the claim.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Kelewae v. Jim Meagher Chevrolet, Inc., </em>952 F.2d 1052, 1054, 1055 (8th Cir. 1992) (holding that when plaintiff requested his stepson and a friend each telephone the defendant posing as a prospective employer, the defendant\u2019s \u201callegedly defamatory statements . . . cannot form the basis of a defamation suit because the statements were solicited by agents of the plaintiff\u2019); <em>Litman v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. </em>Co., 739 F.2d 1549, 1560 (11th Cir. 1984) (when the plaintiff invited the alleged defamation, the statement is not a \u201cpublication\u201d under Florida law); <em>Long v.

Busbin, </em>289 S.E.2d 514, 515 (Ga. 1982) (holding that there can be no recovery for invited libel; \u201c[i]t is enough that the complainant requests or consents to the presence of a third party and solicits the publication of matter which he knows or has reasonable cause to suspect will be unfavorable to him\u201d); <em>Pressley v. Continental Can Co., Inc., </em>250 S.E.2d 676, 678 (N.C. Ct. App. 1979) (stating that \u201c[a] publication of a libel, procured or invited by the plaintiff, is not sufficient to support an action for defamation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">We agree with these authorities and conclude that, because the principal\u2019s allegedly defamatory statements were invited by the plaintiff in that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>as she admits in her complaint, she hired A&amp;T to obtain them, the trial court properly dismissed her slander claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The plaintiff also argues that the trial court erred when it \u201cfailed to draw the inference, based on facts [she] alleged,\u201d that it was \u201clikely that [the principal] made similar statements to others.\u201d (Capitalization and bolding omitted.) The trial court rejected this argument, explaining that \u201c[i]n evaluating the sufficiency of claims of slander, courts have required that the complaint adequately identify the allegedly defamatory statements, the person who made the statements, the time when the statements were made, and the third parties to whom the statements were published.\u201d (Quotation and brackets omitted.) Here, because \u201c[t]he complaint only makes sufficiently specific allegations with regard to the statements made to A&amp;T,\u201d the trial court concluded that the plaintiffs claim that it was \u201clikely\u201d the principal made \u201csimilar statements to others,\u201d \u201cis pure speculation not accompanied by sufficiently pleaded facts.\u201d <em>See Knox v. Cnty. of Ulster, </em>No. 1:11-CV-0112 (GTS/CFH), 2013 WL 286282, at *15 (N.D.N.Y. Jan. 24, 2013) (granting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss plaintiffs slander claim where plaintiff failed to specifically identify who made the statement, to whom the statement was made or when it was made); <em>Doug Grant, Inc. v. Create Bay Casino Corp., </em>3 F. Supp. 2d 518, 538 (D.N.J. 1998) (explaining that, in a complaint charging defamation, plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to identify the allegedly defamatory words, their utterer and the fact of their publication; a \u201cvague conclusory allegation is not enough\u201d (quotation omitted)), <em>aff'd as modified, </em>232 F.3d 173 (3d Cir. 2000); <em>McGuire v. Adkins, </em>226 So. 2d 659, 661 (Ala. 1969) (concluding that a slander claim is insufficient where the complaint fails to state where and to whom the slander was published).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The plaintiffs complaint fails to identify any specific statement made by the defendant about her to any specific third parties other than A&amp;T. Without any facts in her complaint identifying who the \u201cothers\u201d were, when the statements were made, or the substance of the statements, the plaintiff has failed to \u201callege [ ] facts that would show that the defendant failed to exercise reasonable care in publishing a false and defamatory statement of fact about [her] to a third party.\u201d <em>Sanguedolce, </em>164 N.H. at 645-46 (quotation omitted). Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s finding that, to the extent the plaintiffs slander claim is premised upon the statements made to parties other than A&amp;T, the complaint fails to sufficiently state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b724-8\">Dalianis, C.J., and Hicks, Lynn, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
