We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b557-16\">The pertinent facts are as follows. Prior to November 6, 2018, the plaintiff served as the Deputy County Attorney for Rockingham County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>under County Attorney Reams. On that date, the defendant, claiming to act under authority granted by RSA 7:6 (2013), 7:11 (2013), and 7:34 (2013), suspended the criminal law enforcement authority of the county attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Simultaneously, the defendant placed the plaintiff on paid suspension. At the defendant\u2019s request, the Rockingham County Commissioners barred Reams from entering his office. It appears from the plaintiffs allegations and a memorandum of law filed by the county commissioners in a related case that the plaintiff also was barred from the Rockingham County Attorney\u2019s Office at the defendant\u2019s behest. Also at the defendant\u2019s request, the superior court appointed an assistant attorney general to serve as interim county attorney for Rockingham County. <em>See </em>RSA 7:33 (2013). The defendant, acting in conjunction with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, conducted a criminal investigation of Reams that lasted until approximately March of 2014. The plaintiff resigned his position as deputy county attorney on January 17, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">While the criminal investigation was ongoing, Reams instituted lawsuits against the defendant and the county commissioners, asserting that their actions were unlawful and seeking reinstatement to his position as county attorney and access to his office. Based, in part, on the ongoing criminal investigation, the Superior Court <em>(McNamara, </em>J.) denied Reams\u2019s requests for preliminary injunctive relief and to conduct discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">On March 11, 2014, the defendant and the county commissioners filed a complaint asking the superior court to remove Reams from office pursuant to RSA 661:9, IV (2008). On March 26, the defendant informed the trial court that the criminal investigation had been concluded and that no criminal charges had been or would be brought against Reams. Because the criminal investigation was concluded, the trial court determined that there was no need for discovery in Reams\u2019s lawsuits seeking reinstatement to office.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">By order of April 10, 2014, the court ruled that Reams\u2019s continued suspension from office was unlawful, and that he must be reinstated as Rockingham County Attorney and allowed access to his office. The court stayed its order for thirty days so as to permit the attorney general and the county commissioners to appeal and request a further stay from this court. The attorney general and the county commissioners did appeal to this court and sought an extension of the stay \u2014 relief which we denied.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 18, 2014, both proceedings were settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>On April 17, 2014, the plaintiff submitted a request for disclosure of the defendant\u2019s records concerning the investigation of Reams. Specifically, the plaintiff sought the following materials:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">\u2022 investigative reports, interview notes, memos, emails, recordings or other records relied upon as the basis for suspending the plaintiffs law enforcement authority;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">\u2022 a recitation of all information possessed by the defendant on November 6, 2013, that led him to conclude that a criminal investigation of Reams should be initiated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">\u2022 all information, documents and records that justified the assignment of a state trooper to the Rockingham County Courthouse over the evening of November 6 - 7, 2013, to prevent tampering with records;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-8\">\u2022 information clarifying whether the county commissioners barred him from his office on their own initiative or at the request of the attorney general;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-9\">\u2022 copies of any and all warrants, consents, or reports pertaining to the search of the plaintiffs office and the seizure of items therefrom, a listing of the seized items, and return of said items to the plaintiff;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-10\">\u2022 records, interviews or reports reflecting any acts of discrimination that occurred at the Rockingham County Attorney\u2019s Office during the years 2012 and 2013;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-11\">\u2022 any and all information related to a 2012 call to the Attorney General\u2019s Office by Rockingham County Commissioner Barrows with respect to a referral to the County Human Resources Department of a retaliation claim against a County Attorney\u2019s Office employee for an earlier discrimination complaint made by the employee\u2019s girlfriend (also a County Attorney\u2019s Office employee) against Reams, as well as information concerning leaks about the Human Resources investigation made to the press and/or to State Representative Laura Pantelakos; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-12\">\u2022 any and all documents, interviews or records showing that Reams had retaliated against any County Attorney\u2019s Office employee as a result of the 2012 County Human Resources Department investigation or showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>that there was reason to believe employees of the County Attorney\u2019s Office would be retaliated against if Reams was allowed to return to his position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">In a second request to the defendant, dated April 24, 2014, the plaintiff sought additional materials, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">\u2022 all records, reports or interviews related to Reams\u2019s alleged modification of the supervisory duties of a County Attorney\u2019s Office employee who, in 1999, had complained to the Attorney General\u2019s Office about the sexual harassment of female employees by Reams, as well as records regarding Reams\u2019s alleged actions in causing this employee to be terminated from another job she held after leaving the County Attorney\u2019s Office; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">\u2022 the return to the plaintiff of the personal and supervisory notes he had compiled during his tenure as Deputy County Attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">The defendant timely responded to the requests, indicating that he would require a minimum of 30 days to compile and review the requested records. <em>See </em>RSA 91-A:4, IV (2013). When no further response was received from the defendant for a period of approximately seven months, the plaintiff instituted the present action. The defendant moved to dismiss, acknowledging that he had not timely supplemented his initial response, but arguing that he had otherwise acted reasonably and had not improperly withheld any information. The defendant represented that, as of December 20, 2014, he had begun the first phase of a \u201crolling production\u201d of materials that consisted of the disclosure of 1293 pages of documents. The defendant requested that the court review <em>in camera </em>materials that he had submitted or proposed to submit in redacted form, so as to determine the propriety of the redactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">By order dated January 14, 2015, the trial court ruled that the defendant had violated the Right-to-Know Law by failing to timely supplement his response to the plaintiffs requests. As relief, the court awarded the plaintiff his costs. However, the court declined to review redacted documents <em>in camera. </em>Instead, it directed the defendant to provide a \u201cthorough affidavit\u201d supporting his redactions, which the court indicated it would review to determine whether the defendant had sustained his burden of proof.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>The defendant responded by filing a final status report, affidavit, and request for dismissal on February 13, 2015. The affidavit, by Associate Attorney General Anne Edwards, identified the following nine legal bases upon which information had been withheld or redacted: (1) personnel information, under RSA 91-A:5, IV; (2) medical information, under RSA 91-A:5, IV; (3) grand jury records, under RSA 91-A:5, I; (4) financial information, under RSA 91-A:5, IV; (5) \u201c[ijndividual citizens\u2019 private information,\u201d the disclosure of which would constitute an invasion of privacy, under RSA 91-A:5, IV; (6) drafts, under RSA 91-A:5, IX; (7) notes, under RSA 91-A:5, VIII; (8) attorney work product, under RSA 91-A:5, IV and VII; and (9) confidential records, under RSA 91-A:5, IV and RSA 651:5. A master list of Bates-numbered documents, submitted as an exhibit to the affidavit, indicated which one or more of the foregoing legal bases for exemption was claimed for each document or category of documents listed. Finally, the defendant requested that the case be dismissed because, it claimed, it had \u201cnow responded fully to Mr. Reid\u2019s request and the Court Order\u201d of January 14, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\">The plaintiff objected, and requested, among other things, additional time \u201cto review the voluminous materials and provide a more comprehensive status report.\u201d The request for additional time was granted and, thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion to compel production of a complete index of records and a motion to compel production of unredacted documents. In his motion to compel production of documents, the plaintiff specifically challenged only one of the defendant\u2019s asserted bases of exemption; namely, the exemption claimed under RSA 91-A:5, IV for \u201cpersonnel information.\u201d The defendant objected to both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">On July 10, 2015, the trial court denied the plaintiffs motions. The court denied the motion for production of a more detailed index \u201c[bjecause the defendant has already complied with a previous court order requiring production of an index.\u201d It denied the motion to compel production of unredacted documents on the basis that the documents sought were exempt from disclosure under the Right-to-Know Law. Specifically, the court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">Here, the records at issue relate to the defendant\u2019s investigation into misconduct alleged to have been committed by Reams. This investigation, which was conducted jointly with Rockingham County, consisted of interviews with present and former employees. The subject directly involved the Rockingham County Attorney\u2019s Office\u2019s personnel practices, including specific instances of conduct involving employee discipline and certain reports to the Rockingham County . . . human resources office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>The court concluded that \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s redactions fall within the purview of RSA 91-A:5, IV.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\"> On appeal, the plaintiff argues: (1) that the trial court\u2019s ruling violates Part I, Article 8 of the New Hampshire Constitution; (2) that the trial court erred in determining that the investigative records at issue were \u201c[rjecords pertaining to internal personnel practices,\u201d RSA 91-A:5, IV (2018), because the attorney general\u2019s investigation cannot be considered \u201cinternal\u201d; and (8) that the trial court erred in finding that the attorney general\u2019s investigation of Reams was \u201cconducted jointly with Rockingham County.\u201d \u201cBecause we decide cases on constitutional grounds only when necessary,\u201d <em>Chatman v. Strafford County, </em>163 N.H. 320, 322 (2012), we will first address the plaintiffs second argument, which raises an issue of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">The interpretation of a statute is to be decided ultimately by this court. The ordinary rules of statutory construction apply to our review of the Right-to-Know Law, and we accordingly look to the plain meaning of the words used. To advance the purposes of the Right-to-Know Law, we construe provisions favoring disclosure broadly and exemptions narrowly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-8\"><em>Union Leader Corp. v. City of Nashua, </em>141 N.H. 473, 475 (1996) (quotation and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">At issue is the interpretation of RSA 91-A:5, IV, which provides, in pertinent part, an exemption from disclosure under the Right-to-Know Law for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-10\">Records pertaining to internal personnel practices; confidential, commercial, or financial information; test questions, scoring keys, and other examination data used to administer a licensing examination, examination for employment, or academic examinations; and personnel, medical, welfare, library user, videotape sale or rental, and other files whose disclosure would constitute invasion of privacy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">RSA 91-A:5, IV. The trial court, relying upon our decisions in <em>Union Leader Corp. v. Fenniman, </em>136 N.H. 624 (1993), and <em>Hounsell v. North Conway Water Precinct, </em>154 N.H. 1 (2006), found that the subject of the investigative records at issue \u201cdirectly involved the Rockingham County Attorney\u2019s Office\u2019s personnel practices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">The plaintiff argues that the trial court erroneously \u201capplied a subject matter exemption contrary to the plain language of RSA 91-A:5[,] IV.\u201d In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>particular, the plaintiff contends that the \u201coperative term\u201d in the exemption at issue is \u201cinternal,\u201d and argues that the trial court both \u201cfailed to give weight\u201d to that term and interpreted the statute so as to render the term superfluous. Fundamentally, the plaintiffs argument is that records of the defendant\u2019s investigation of Reams do not \u201cpertain[ ] to <em>internal </em>personnel practices,\u201d RSA 91-A:5, IV (emphasis added), because \u201c[t]he Attorney General is simply not the County Attorney\u2019s employer.\u201d We agree with the plaintiffs statutory interpretation and, therefore, we vacate and remand for further proceedings. To explain our reasoning, however, we must first examine the two cases upon which the trial court relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The first is <em>Fenniman, </em>in which the plaintiff sought the disclosure under the Right-to-Know Law of \u201ccertain investigatory documents under the control of\u2019 the Dover Police Department and its chief. <em>Fenniman, </em>136 N.H. at 625. The documents had been \u201ccompiled during an internal investigation of a department lieutenant accused of making harassing phone calls.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that the documents fell within the exemption for \u201c[rjecords pertaining to internal personnel practices\u201d under RSA 91-A:5, IV. <em>Id. </em>at 626 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">We noted that \u201c[t]his particular portion of . . . [the statute had] not been construed by this court and is neither explained nor defined by the statute,\u201d and, therefore, we relied upon the plain meaning of the words used. <em>Id. </em>We stated that \u201c[although we generally interpret the exemptions in RSA chapter 91-A restrictively to further the purposes of the Right-to-Know Law, the plain meanings of the words \u2018internal,\u2019 \u2018personnel,\u2019 and \u2018practices\u2019 are themselves quite broad.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 626 (citation omitted). <em>But cf., e.g., Union Leader Corp. v. N.H. Housing Fin. Auth., </em>142 N.H. 540, 552 (1997) (stating that \u201c[a]n expansive construction of the[ ] terms [\u2018confidential, commercial, or financial\u2019 in RSA 91-A:5, IV] must be avoided, since to do otherwise would allow the exemption to swallow the rule and is inconsistent with the purposes and objectives of RSA chapter 91-A\u201d (quotation and brackets omitted)). We then concluded that the files at issue \u201cplainly \u2018pertainf ] to internal personnel practices\u2019 because they document procedures leading up to internal personnel discipline, a quintessential example of an internal personnel practice.\u201d <em>Fenniman, </em>136 N.H. at 626. We further held that \u201c[although we have often applied a balancing test to judge whether the benefits of nondisclosure outweigh the benefits of disclosure, such an analysis is inappropriate where, as here, the legislature has plainly made its own determination that certain documents are categorically exempt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 627 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">As the foregoing demonstrates, in interpreting the \u201cinternal personnel practices\u201d exemption in <em>Fenniman, </em>we twice departed from our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>customary Right-to-Know Law jurisprudence by declining to interpret the exemption narrowly and declining to employ a balancing test in determining whether to apply the exemption. In addition, we did not interpret the portion of RSA 91-A:5, IV at issue in the context of the remainder of the statutory language \u2014 in particular, the language exempting \u201cpersonnel... and other files whose disclosure would constitute invasion of privacy.\u201d RSA 91-A:5, IV; <em>see Appeal of Cover, </em>168 N.H. 614, 618 (2016) (noting that when interpreting a statute, \u201cwe do not consider words and phrases in isolation, but rather within the context of the statute as a whole\u201d (quotation omitted)). Thus, we did not examine whether a broad, categorical interpretation of \u201cinternal personnel practices\u201d might render the exemption for \u201cpersonnel . . . files whose disclosure would constitute invasion of privacy\u201d in any way redundant or superfluous. <em>See Winnacunnet Coop. Sch. Dist. v. Town of Seabrook, </em>148 N.H. 519, 525-26 (2002) (noting that \u201c[w]hen construing a statute, we must give effect to all words in [the] statute and presume that the legislature did not enact superfluous or redundant words\u201d); <em>cf. Shapiro v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>153 F. Supp. 3d 253, 280 (D.D.C. 2016) (noting that \u201cExemption 6 [of the federal Freedom of Information Act], which shields \u2018personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal [privacy]\u2019. . . would have little purpose if agencies could simply invoke Exemption 2 [which shields, <em>inter alia, </em>records that relate solely to internal personnel rules and practices] to protect any records that are used only for \u2018personnel\u2019-related purposes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Moreover, although the practice of consulting decisions from other jurisdictions interpreting similar statutes is common in our Right-to-Know Law jurisprudence, we did not conduct such an inquiry in <em>Fenniman. See, e.g., Murray v. N.H. Div. of State Police, </em>154 N.H. 579, 581 (2006) (noting that in interpreting the Right-to-Know Law, \u201c[w]e also look to the decisions of other jurisdictions, since other similar acts, because they are <em>in pari, materia, </em>are interpretatively helpful, especially in understanding the necessary accommodation of the competing interests involved\u201d (quotation omitted)). Specifically, we have looked to federal law, <em>see, e.g., Montenegro v. City of Dover, </em>162 N.H. 641, 650 (2011), having noted that \u201c[t]he exemption provisions of our right-to-know law, RSA 91-A:5, IV (supp.), are similar to the Federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.A. [\u00a7] 552(b)(2), (4) and (6),\u201d <em>Mans v. Lebanon School Bd., </em>112 N.H. 160, 162-63 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) exemption contained in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(2) is worded similarly to the portion of RSA 91-A:5, IV at issue here; specifically, it exempts from disclosure under the FOIA matters \u201crelated solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(2) (2012). Nevertheless, our construction of the \u201cinternal personnel practices\u201d exemption in RSA 91-A:5, IV is markedly broader than the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of that exemption\u2019s federal counterpart. <em>See Dept. of Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 369-70 (1976) (noting that \u201cthe general thrust of the [5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(2)] exemption is simply to relieve agencies of the burden of assembling and maintaining for public inspection matter in which the public could not reasonably be expected to have an interest\u201d);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Milner v. Department of Navy, </em>562 U.S. 562, 566 (2011) (reaffirming the narrow scope of Exemption 2 by rejecting a line of federal cases recognizing a so-called \u201cHigh 2\u201d exemption for \u201cany predominantly internal materials whose disclosure would significantly risk circumvention of agency regulations or statutes\u201d (quotations, citation, footnote and brackets omitted)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">We continued our broad interpretation of RSA 91-A:5, IV\u2019s \u201cinternal personnel practices\u201d exemption in the second case relied upon by the trial court: <em>Hounsell v. North Conway Water Precinct. Hounsell </em>involved a Right-to-Know Law request for an investigative report prepared for the defendant North Conway Water Precinct (precinct) by outside investigators. <em>Hounsell, </em>154 N.H. at 2-3. Specifically, following an allegation by a precinct employee \u201cthat he had been threatened and harassed by a co-worker,\u201d the precinct\u2019s legal counsel \u201cretained Jack Hunt and John Alfano to investigate the complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. Hunt and Alfano interviewed precinct employees and then \u201cprepared a report in which they summarized the investigation and made findings and recommendations (Hunt-Alfano report).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">We affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of the Right-to-Know petition, <em>id. </em>at 7, holding, in relevant part, that, \u201cas in <em>Fenniman, </em>the Hunt-Alfano report, which was generated in the course of an investigation of claimed employee misconduct, was a record pertaining to \u2018internal personnel practices.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. We also rejected the petitioners\u2019 contention that \u201cthe investigation lost its \u2018internal status\u2019 because,\u201d among other things, \u201cthe precinct contracted with outside investigators.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. We found that argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>\u201cunpersuasive .. . because nothing in the plain language of RSA 91-A:5, IV restricts a public body or agency from asserting an exemption under these circumstances, and the petitioners have presented no legal authority in support of their contentions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Against this legal backdrop, we now consider whether the \u201cinternal personnel practices\u201d portion of RSA 91-A:5, IV exempts the materials at issue. Neither party has asked us to reconsider <em>Fenniman </em>or <em>Hounsell, </em>and we will not do so <em>sua. sponte. </em>At this juncture, <em>stare decisis </em>impels us to follow <em>Fenniman </em>and <em>Hounsell </em>in treating \u201cprocedures leading up to internal personnel discipline\u201d \u2014 in particular, an investigation into employee misconduct \u2014 as a personnel practice. <em>Fenniman, </em>136 N.H. at 626. Nevertheless, we decline to extend <em>Fenniman </em>and <em>Hounsell </em>beyond their own factual contexts and, in further interpreting RSA 91-A:5, IV herein, we return to our customary standards for construing the Right-to-Know Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The plaintiff distinguishes <em>Hounsell </em>by noting that in that case, \u201cthe investigators had been retained by the employer and acted on behalf of the employer.\u201d He argues that \u201c[t]he mere fact that an investigation could result in disciplinary action, standing alone, is not enough to qualify an investigation as a record pertaining to \u2018internal personnel practices.\u2019 We agree that <em>Hounsell </em>is distinguishable and that the distinction turns upon the statutory term \u201cinternal.\u201d RSA 91-A:5, IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">\u201cWhen interpreting a statute, we first look to the plain meaning of the words used and will consider legislative history only if the statutory language is ambiguous.\u201d <em>Union Leader Corp. v. N.H. Retirement Sys., </em>162 N.H. 673, 676 (2011) (quotation omitted). In <em>Fenniman, </em>we stated that \u201cthe plain meanings of the words \u2018internal,\u2019 \u2018personnel,\u2019 and \u2018practices\u2019 are . . . quite broad,\u201d but went no further in defining or examining those terms. <em>Fenniman, </em>136 N.H. at 626. Looking now to how the words are used in the statute, we note that the terms \u201cinternal\u201d and \u201cpersonnel\u201d modify the word \u201cpractices,\u201d thereby circumscribing the provision\u2019s scope. <em>Cf. Milner, </em>562 U.S. at 569 (observing that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(2) uses the term \u201c \u2018personnel\u2019 ... as an adjective ... to modify \u2018rules and practices\u2019 \u201d and that the term is \u201cthe one that most clearly marks the provision\u2019s boundaries\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">In construing the term \u201cpersonnel\u201d as used in the FOIA, the Supreme Court noted that \u201c[w]hen used as an adjective, . . . th[e] term refers to human resources matters. \u2018Personnel,\u2019 in this common parlance, means \u2018the selection, placement, and training of employees and ... the formulation of policies, procedures, and relations with [or involving] employees or their representatives.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1687 (1966)). The Court accordingly determined that \u201c[a]n agency\u2019s \u2018personnel rules and practices,\u2019 \u201d for purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>exemption 2 of the FOIA, \u201care its rules and practices dealing with employee relations or human resources.. .. They concern the conditions of employment in federal agencies \u2014 such matters as hiring and firing, work rules and discipline, compensation and benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570. In general, then, the term \u201cpersonnel\u201d relates to employment. Indeed, this is the meaning we implicitly gave the term in <em>Fenniman </em>and <em>Hounsell. See, e.g., Hounsell, </em>154 N.H. at 4 (noting that, \u201cas in <em>Fenniman, </em>the Hunt-Alfano report, which was generated in the course of an investigation of claimed <em>employee </em>misconduct, was a record pertaining to \u2018internal personnel practices\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">\u201cInternal\u201d is defined to mean \u201cexisting or situated within the limits ... Of something.\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 1180 (unabridged ed. 2002). Employing the foregoing definitions, we construe \u201cinternal personnel practices,\u201d to mean practices that \u201cexist[ ] or [are] situated within the limits\u201d of employment. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, while we follow <em>Fenniman </em>and <em>Hounsell </em>in treating an investigation into employee misconduct as a personnel practice, we now clarify that the investigation must take place within the limits of an employment relationship. In other words, the investigation must be conducted by, or as in <em>Hounsell, </em>on behalf of,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the employer of the investigation\u2019s target. <em>See Hounsell, </em>154 N.H. at 2, 4-5. Such a construction is not only consistent with the plain language of RSA 91-A:5, IV, but also follows our practice of \u201cresolv[ing] questions regarding the Right-to-Know law with a view to providing the utmost information in order to best effectuate the statutory and constitutional objective of facilitating access to all public documents.\u201d <em>N.H. Retirement Sys., </em>162 N.H. at 676 (quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The plaintiff argues that the investigation into Reams\u2019s alleged misconduct was not an \u201cinternal\u201d one because it was conducted by the defendant, who was not Reams\u2019s employer. The defendant neither directly asserts that he was Reams\u2019s employer nor explicitly concedes that he was not. Rather, the defendant contends that the attorney general\u2019s interests \u201cin the effective operation of the [Rockingham County Attorney\u2019s Office] do not differ from the interests of an employer.\u201d The defendant further asserts that the plaintiffs \u201cargument that the records are not exempt because the [Attorney General\u2019s Office] did not employ the witnesses at issue is ... in error because an investigation into management and operational issues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>impact the office\u2019s prosecutorial effectiveness is within the [Attorney General\u2019s Office\u2019s] statutory authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">We have not previously decided whether the county attorneys are employees of the attorney general. <em>Cf. State v. Dexter, </em>136 N.H. 669, 673 (1993) (finding it unnecessary to decide, even assuming attorney\u2019s fees were recoverable for county attorney\u2019s alleged bad faith litigation, whether such fees would be \u201cproperly recoverable from the State or the county\u201d). In <em>Samaha v. Grafton County, </em>126 N.H. 583 (1985), we held that the plaintiff, when employed as clerk of superior court sitting in Grafton County, \u201cwas not an employee of Grafton County.\u201d <em>Samaha, </em>126 N.H. at 586. We reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-6\">In determining whether an employer-employee relationship exists, courts generally consider factors such as managerial and fiscal control. During his service there, the county did not have the right to exercise fiscal or managerial control over the plaintiff, nor the power to set his salary, hire or fire him. These functions were performed by the superior court, acting as a body. RSA 499:1, :12. N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 82.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-8\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Considering the factors we employed in <em>Samaha. </em>with respect to the instant case, we note that the attorney general does not hire county attorneys. Rather, each county attorney is \u201celected biennially by the voters of the county.\u201d RSA 7:33 (2013); <em>see also </em>RSA 653:1, V (2016). Vacancies or temporary absences in the office of county attorney are filled either by the superior court or by majority vote of the members of the county convention, in accordance with the provisions of RSA 7:33 and RSA 661:9 (2016). Nor does the attorney general have the authority to fire a county attorney. <em>See Eames v. Rudman, </em>115 N.H. 91, 93 (1975) (noting that attorney general has no power to remove the county attorney from office). The attorney general may \u201ctemporarily suspend [a] county attorney from exercising his criminal law enforcement authority,\u201d but the \u201cpower to remove [a] county attorney from office ... is vested in the superior court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, 93; RSA 661:9, IV (providing that \u201c[a]ny officer of a county . . . may be removed by the superior court for official misconduct\u201d). Finally, the attorney general neither sets nor pays the county attorneys\u2019 salaries. <em>See </em>RSA 23:7 (2000) (providing, in part, that \u201c[e]very county convention shall have the power to establish salaries, benefits and other compensation paid to elected county officers including the county attorney\u201d); RSA 23:5 (2000) (providing that \u201c[t]he salaries of county attorneys . . . shall be paid from the county treasury in equal payments as determined by the county commissioners\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>As the defendant points out, however, the attorney general does possess some supervisory authority over county attorneys. <em>See Wyman v. Danais, </em>101 N.H. 487, 490 (1958). RSA 7:6 provides, in part, that \u201c[t]he attorney general shall have and exercise general supervision of the criminal cases pending before the supreme and superior courts of the state, and with the aid of the county attorneys, the attorney general shall enforce the criminal laws of the state.\u201d RSA 7:6. \u201cRSA 7:11 provides that officers charged with enforcing criminal law \u2018shall be subject to the control of the attorney general whenever in the discretion of the latter he shall see fit to exercise the same.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wyman, </em>101 N.H. at 489 (quoting RSA 7:11) (emphasis omitted); <em>see </em>RSA 7:11. Similarly, RSA 7:34 specifies that \u201c[t]he county attorney of each county shall be under the direction of the attorney general.\u201d RSA 7:34. \u201cConstrued together,\u201d the above-cited provisions \u201cdemonstrate a legislative purpose to place ultimate responsibility for criminal law enforcement in the Attorney General, and to give him the power to control, direct and supervise criminal law enforcement by the county attorneys in cases where he deems it in the public interest.\u201d <em>Wyman, </em>101 N.H. at 490. Nevertheless, the prosecution of criminal cases under the supervision of the attorney general is not the sole duty or function of a county attorney. \u201cAlthough the county attorney . . . may be engaged primarily in criminal prosecutions, his duties and functions also include civil litigations for the county and other miscellaneous civil matters.\u201d <em>New Hampshire Bar Ass\u2019n v. LaBelle, </em>109 N.H. 184, 185 (1968) (citation omitted); <em>see </em>RSA 7:84 (providing that \u201c[i]f no other representation is provided, under the direction of the county commissioners [the county attorney] shall prosecute or defend any suit in which the county is interested\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Because the relationship between the attorney general and a county attorney lacks the usual attributes of an employer-employee relationship, such as the \u201cpower to set [the] salary, hire or fire,\u201d <em>Samaha, </em>126 N.H. at 586, we agree with the plaintiff that the defendant was not Reams\u2019s employer. We further conclude that the attorney general\u2019s supervisory authority over criminal law enforcement by the county attorney is not sufficient, in light of the absent characteristics noted above, to warrant treating the defendant as Reams\u2019s employer for purposes of the \u201cinternal personnel practices\u201d exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">We need not decide, and express no opinion upon, whether the Rockingham County Commissioners could be considered Reams\u2019s employer for purposes of the \u201cinternal personnel practices\u201d exemption as applied in <em>Hounsell, </em>nor must we address the plaintiffs argument that the trial court erred in finding that the defendant\u2019s investigation of Reams was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>\u201cconducted jointly with Rockingham County.\u201d As noted above, an investigation is \u201cinternal,\u201d as applied in <em>Hounsell, </em>if conducted on behalf of the employer of the investigation\u2019s target. <em>See Hounsell, </em>154 N.H. at 2, 4-5. Mere joint participation is not sufficient. <em>Cf. id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The defendant makes no argument on appeal that it acted as agent or outside counsel to the Rockingham County Commissioners such that its investigation should be treated as conducted on their behalf for purposes of the \u201cinternal investigation exemption\u201d as applied in <em>Hounsell. </em>Rather, although the defendant maintains that it viewed its investigation as \u201ca joint investigation with Rockingham County,\u201d it \u201cdoes not claim that the fact that the investigation was conducted with Rockingham County is what justifies the application of RSA 91-A:5, IV\u2019s personnel exemptions.\u201d Accordingly, because a finding of joint participation with the county commissioners would not affect our decision, we decline to address the plaintiffs third claim of error; moreover, because the trial court applied RSA 91-A:5, IV\u2019s \u201cinternal personnel practices\u201d exemption to records of an investigation conducted outside the limits of an employment relationship, we vacate its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The defendant nevertheless contends that \u201cthe protection provided by the RSA chapter 91-A personnel exemptions is not for the benefit of the employer, but for the benefit of protecting the privacy rights of the employee.\u201d Thus, he argues: \u201c[T]he fact that the [Attorney General\u2019s Office\u2019s] investigation occurred does not divest the affected [Rockingham County Attorney\u2019s Office] employees of their right to have their personnel information protected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The defendant\u2019s argument does not alter our above conclusion, but, rather, highlights that whether the disputed material may be withheld should more properly be addressed under the portion of RSA 91-A:5, IV that exempts \u201cpersonnel, medical, . . . and other files whose disclosure would constitute invasion of privacy.\u201d RSA 91-A:5, IV; <em>see N.H. Right to Life v. Dir., N.H. Charitable Trusts Unit, </em>169 N.H. 95, 110 (2016) (noting that \u201c[t]his section of the Right-to-Know Law means that financial information and personnel files and other information necessary to an individual\u2019s privacy need not be disclosed\u201d (quotation omitted)). Similarly, we decline to consider at this time the defendant\u2019s contention that the \u201ctransfer of personnel information from the [Rockingham County Attorney\u2019s Office] to the [Attorney General\u2019s Office] does not alter the fact that the information is substantively personnel in nature,\u201d because we believe that argument, too, is more suited to an analysis under the \u201cpersonnel, medical . . . and other files\u201d exemption. RSA 91-A:5, IV; <em>cf. U.S. Dept. of State v. Washington Post Co., </em>456 U.S. 595, 601 (1982) (stating, in broadly construing the term \u201csimilar files\u201d in the FOIA\u2019s Exemption 6, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>\u201cinformation about an individual should not lose the protection of Exemption 6 merely because it is stored by an agency in records other than \u2018personnel\u2019 or \u2018medical\u2019 files\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">As previously noted, the defendant claimed a number of exemptions for the information he withheld or redacted, including an exemption for a category of materials he called \u201cPersonnel Information.\u201d (Bolding omitted.) The defendant asserted: \u201cUnder RSA 91-A:5, IV, records related to internal personnel practices are exempt from disclosure under Right to Know. In addition, personnel records are also exempt.\u201d Thus, it appears that the defendant claimed exemption under both personnel-related exemptions in RSA 91-A:5, IV \u2014 the exemption for \u201c[rjecords pertaining to internal personnel practices\u201d \u2014 and the exemption for \u201cpersonnel. . . files whose disclosure would constitute invasion of privacy.\u201d RSA 91-A:5, IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The trial court also seems to have recognized two personnel-related exemptions, as it noted that RSA 91-A:5, IV exempts \u201c \u2018[rjecords pertaining to internal personnel practices,\u2019 as well as employees\u2019 personnel files.\u201d The court\u2019s decision, however, appears to be based exclusively on the \u201cinternal personnel practices\u201d exemption, and it is not evident that the court considered whether any of the disputed materials were exempt as \u201cpersonnel .. . files whose disclosure would constitute invasion of privacy.\u201d RSA 91-A:5, IV. Accordingly, on remand, the parties may litigate whether any of the disputed materials fall within the latter exemption and we leave it to the trial court to make that determination in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">For the benefit of the parties and the court on remand, we provide the following guidance. Although we have not specifically interpreted the exemption for \u201cpersonnel . . . files whose disclosure would constitute invasion of privacy,\u201d RSA 91-A:5, IV, we have had occasion to \u201cdefine with some specificity the statutory exemption for \u2018confidential, commercial, or financial information\u2019 \u201d in the same provision. <em>N.H. Housing Fin. Auth., </em>142 N.H. at 552. We noted that \u201c[w]e have interpreted our statute ... as requiring analysis of both whether the information sought is \u2018confidential, commercial, or financial information,\u2019 and whether disclosure would constitute an invasion of privacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, we now hold that the determination of whether material is subject to the exemption for \u201cpersonnel... files whose disclosure would constitute invasion of privacy,\u201d RSA 91-A:5, IV, also requires a two-part analysis of: (1) whether the material can be considered a \u201cpersonnel file\u201d or part of a \u201cpersonnel file\u201d; and (2) whether disclosure of the material would constitute an invasion of privacy. <em>Cf., e.g., Rugiero v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>257 F.3d 534, 550 (6th Cir. 2001) (describing similar two-part test for exemption under the FOIA for personnel, medical and similar files); <em>Rocque v. Freedom of Information Com\u2019n, </em>774 A.2d 957, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>963-64 (Conn. 2001) (describing similar two-part test for exemption under Connecticut\u2019s Freedom of Information Act for personnel, medical or similar files). Accordingly, in analyzing the \u201cpersonnel . . . files\u201d exemption on remand, the trial court must first determine whether any of the disputed material is, or is contained in, a personnel file. If not, the \u201cpersonnel . . . files\u201d exemption does not apply.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Abbott v. Dallas Area Rapid Transit, </em>410 S.W.3d 876, 883-84 (Tex. App. 2013) (noting that exemption under Texas Public Information Act for \u201c \u2018information in a personnel file, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\u2019 \u201d did not apply to information at issue where there was \u201cno evidence in the record before us that [Dallas Area Rapid Transit\u2019s] investigation report [regarding an employee\u2019s racial discrimination complaint against two co-employees] is in the interviewees\u2019 personnel files\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\"> The analysis of whether the exemption for \u201cpersonnel . . . files\u201d applies next requires determining whether disclosure of any material meeting the first prong of the inquiry would constitute an invasion of privacy. We now clarify that, unlike materials pertaining to \u201cinternal personnel practices,\u201d for which we eschewed the customary balancing test in <em>Fenniman, </em>\u201cpersonnel . . . files\u201d are not automatically exempt from disclosure. RSA 91-A:5, IV. For those materials, \u201cth[e] categorical exemption[ ] [in RSA 91-A:5, IV] mean[s] not that the information is <em>per se </em>exempt, but rather that it is sufficiently private that it must be balanced against the public\u2019s interest in disclosure.\u201d <em>N.H. Housing Fin. Auth., </em>142 N.H. at 553 (discussing RSA 91-A:5, IV exemption for \u201cconfidential, commercial, or financial information\u201d). Specifically, \u201c[w]e engage in a three-step analysis when considering whether disclosure of public records constitutes an invasion of privacy under RSA 91-A:5, IV.\u201d <em>N.H. Right to Life, </em>169 N.H. at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The three-step analysis is well-established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">First, we evaluate whether there is a privacy interest at stake that would be invaded by the disclosure.... If no privacy interest is at stake, the Right-to-Know Law mandates disclosure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Second, we assess the public\u2019s interest in disclosure. Disclosure of the requested information should inform the public about the conduct and activities of their government. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">Finally, we balance the public interest in disclosure against the government\u2019s interest in nondisclosure and the individual\u2019s privacy interest in nondisclosure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-6\"><em>Lambert v. Belknap County Convention, </em>157 N.H. 375, 382-83 (2008) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The defendant does not appear to assert a privacy interest on behalf of Reams,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but rather cites \u201cthe privacy rights of the former and present [Rockingham County Attorney\u2019s Office] employees who provided their [employment-related] information, including allegations of sexual harassment, pregnancy discrimination, discipline, and retaliation to [Attorney General\u2019s Office] investigators.\u201d Looking to cases from other jurisdictions for guidance, <em>see Murray, </em>154 N.H. at 581, we note that federal courts applying the FOIA have recognized that \u201c[witnesses who cooperate with internal investigations concerning alleged employee violations do have privacy interests at stake.\u201d <em>Fine v. U.S. Dept. of Energy, </em>823 F. Supp. 888, 897 (D.N.M. 1993); <em>see also Cappabianca v. Commissioner, U.S. Customs Service, </em>847 F. Supp. 1558, 1564 (M.D. Fla. 1994) (noting that \u201c[witnesses and co-workers have legitimate privacy interests in the nondisclosure of their identities and in keeping their participation in an investigation confidential\u201d). In addition, a <em>public </em>interest in nondisclosure has been noted where records relate to the investigation of alleged wrongdoing by public employees. Thus, in analyzing the FOIA exemption for \u201c \u2018investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes,\u2019 \u201d whose production would \u201c \u2018constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,\u2019 \u201d the court in <em>Fine </em>recognized \u201ca strong public interest in protecting the privacy of persons who have cooperated with internal investigations of possible improper conduct by fellow employees.\u201d <em>Fine, </em>823 F. Supp. at 907-08 (quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C)(1977)). Although these cases provide helpful guidance, we note that they are arguably distinguishable from this case because, as explained above, the investigation by the attorney general\u2019s office was not an \u201cinternal\u201d one.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">We have not yet considered the nature of any privacy interest that might be asserted under the precise circumstances at issue here. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>privacy inquiry under the comparable provision of the FOIA (Exemption 6), however, has been noted to be \u201cessentially the same,\u201d <em>Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

Judicial Watch, Inc., </em>365 F.3d at 1125 (also noting, however, that the Supreme Court has construed the 7C exemption to be broader than Exemption 6).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">We addressed a law enforcement exemption under the Right-to-Know Law in <em>City of Nashua, </em>where we recognized \u201cthat there may be strong privacy interests ... in law enforcement investigatory records.\u201d <em>City of Nashua, </em>141 N.H. at 477. We cited cases from other jurisdictions noting that disclosure of such records could subject individuals to stigma, embarrassment, and reputational injury. <em>Id. </em>at 477-78. Similarly, the FOIA\u2019s Exemption 6 has been held to apply to the \u201ckinds of facts [that] are regarded as personal because their public disclosure could subject the person to whom they pertain to embarrassment, harassment, disgrace, loss of employment or friends.\u201d <em>Brown v. Federal Bureau of Investigation, </em>658 F.2d 71, 75 (2d Cir. 1981) (determining whether documents were \u201csimilar files\u201d under Exemption 6 of the FOIA); <em>see also Washington Post Co., </em>456 U.S. at 599 (noting that legislative history suggests that the \u201cprimary purpose ... [of] Exemption 6 was to protect individuals from the injury and embarrassment that can result from the unnecessary disclosure of personal information\u201d). Thus, in determining whether any privacy interests are at stake in the disputed materials, the trial court should consider whether disclosure would subject an individual to the kind of embarrassment or reputational harm described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Moreover, \u201c[w]hether information is exempt from disclosure because it is private is judged by an objective standard and not by a party\u2019s subjective expectations.\u201d <em>N.H. Retirement Sys., </em>162 N.H. at 679 (quotation omitted); <em>cf. Lambert, </em>157 N.H. at 383 (noting that candidate for an elected office \u201ccould not have reasonably expected to keep his or her \u2018application\u2019 private\u201d). As <em>Lambert </em>suggests, however, the nature of the information itself may bear upon whether it can be considered private for purposes of RSA 91-A:5, IV. <em>See Lambert, </em>157 N.H. at 383. Thus, information that, under an objective standard, would be expected to become public in due course, should not give rise to the same privacy interest as information for which public exposure would, objectively, never be anticipated. Here, it may be that certain information regarding allegations of misconduct potentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>rising to the level of criminal actions by an elected official could objectively have been expected to become public as or after an investigation ran its course.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">We recognize case law holding that \u201c[a] clear privacy interest exists with respect to such information as names, addresses, and other identifying information even where such information is already publicly available,\u201d <em>Rugiero, </em>257 F.3d at 550, and that \u201c[a] witness does not waive his or her interest in personal privacy [even] by testifying at a public trial,\u201d <em>Sellers v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>684 F. Supp. 2d 149, 160 (D.D.C. 2010) (discussing the FOIA exemption for records compiled for purposes of law enforcement). Nevertheless, we note that the privacy interest in a witness\u2019s or investigation interviewee\u2019s name and identifying information will likely differ from the privacy interest in the substantive information the witness or interviewee imparts. <em>Cf. CREW v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>978 F. Supp. 2d 1, 11 (D.D.C. 2013) <em>(CREW I) </em>(finding, with respect to investigative files on senator\u2019s alleged criminal actions taken to cover up an extramarital affair, that third parties mentioned in files, such as informants, witnesses, and investigators, \u201clack a privacy interest in the <em>substance </em>of the files, unless the substance could reveal their identities\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In contrast to <em>CREW I, id., </em>however, and given the nature of Reams\u2019s alleged misconduct, we cannot say as a matter of law that third party witnesses and interviewees in this case will have <em>no </em>privacy interest in <em>any </em>of the substantive information. <em>Cf. Rocque, </em>774 A.2d at 959 (agreeing with trial court \u201cthat the identity of the complainant in the sexual harassment investigation at issue . . . [and] certain other information concerning the investigation is exempt from disclosure\u201d but \u201climiting] the exempt portions of the records to those comprising sexually descriptive information\u201d). On the other hand, even information imbued with a legitimate privacy interest is subject to disclosure if, on balance, that interest is outweighed by the public\u2019s cognizable interest in disclosure. <em>Cf. CREW I, </em>978 F. Supp. 2d at 12 (noting that \u201c[although the [defendant, Department of Justice (DOJ),] argues that Senator Ensign\u2019s alleged misconduct \u2018is of a highly personal nature,\u2019 the public has a substantial interest in DOJ\u2019s decision not to prosecute him, considering the circumstances\u201d). Accordingly, we emphasize that a fact-specific inquiry is required in each case. <em>Cf. Rocque, </em>774 A.2d at 959 (disagreeing with \u201ctrial court\u2019s ruling that the identity of a complainant in a sexual harassment complaint and related information are <em>always </em>exempt from disclosure, irrespective of the particular facts of a case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Turning to the second step of the balancing test, the plaintiff claims a \u201cpublic interest in determining if the Attorney General had grounds to unilaterally remove an elected official... [and] in disclosing the information relied upon by the Attorney General.\u201d We recognize that \u201c[t]he public has a significant interest in knowing that a government investigation is comprehensive and accurate.\u201d <em>Fine, </em>823 F. Supp. at 898. We also note that the rank of the official being investigated and the seriousness of the alleged misconduct will bear upon the strength of the public interest. <em>Cf. Coleman v. Lappin, </em>680 F. Supp. 2d 192, 199 (D.D.C. 2010) (stating that \u201c[t]he Court ordinarily considers, when balancing the public interest in disclosure against the private interest in exemption, the rank of the public official involved and the seriousness of the misconduct alleged\u201d (quotation and brackets omitted)). Thus, for instance, the court in <em>CREW v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>840 F. Supp. 2d 226 (D.D.C. 2012) <em>(CREW II), </em>found it \u201cdifficult to understand how there could not be a substantial public interest in disclosure of documents regarding the manner in which the [Department of Justice] handled high profile allegations of public corruption about an elected official.\u201d <em>CREW II, </em>840 F. Supp. 2d at 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The legitimacy of the public\u2019s interest in disclosure, however, is tied to the Right-to-Know Law\u2019s purpose, which is \u201cto provide the utmost information to the public about what its government is up to.\u201d <em>N.H. Right to Life, </em>169 N.H. at 111 (quotation omitted). \u201cIf disclosing the information does not serve this purpose, disclosure will not be warranted even though the public may nonetheless prefer, albeit for other reasons, that the information be released.\u201d <em>Lamy v. N.H. Pub. Utils. Comm\u2019n, </em>152 N.H. 106, 111 (2005) (quotation omitted). Conversely, \u201can individual\u2019s motives in seeking disclosure are irrelevant to the question of access.\u201d <em>Lambert, </em>157 N.H. at 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The third step requires balancing \u201cthe public interest in disclosure against the government\u2019s interest in nondisclosure and the individual\u2019s privacy interest in nondisclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We have stated that \u201c[t]he legislature has provided the weight to be given one side of the balance! ] [by] declaring the purpose of the Right-to-Know Law in\u201d the statute itself. <em>City of Nashua, </em>141 N.H. at 476. Specifically, the preamble to RSA chapter 91-A provides: \u201cOpenness in the conduct of public business is essential to a democratic society. The purpose of this chapter is to ensure both the greatest possible public access to the actions, discussions and records of all public bodies, and their accountability to the people.\u201d RSA 91-A:1 (2013). Thus, \u201c[w]hen a public entity seeks to avoid disclosure of material under the Right-to-Know Law, that entity bears a heavy burden to shift the balance toward nondisclosure.\u201d <em>City of Nashua, </em>141 N.H. at 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>The foregoing considerations are not intended to be either comprehensive or exhaustive, and we leave it to the trial court, in the first instance, to determine and weigh the applicable interests as the case may require on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">In light of the foregoing, our decision is not undermined by the defendant\u2019s contention, and the trial court\u2019s consonant finding, that this case implicates the policy concern noted in Hounsell; namely, that \u201cdisclosure of records underlying, or arising from, internal personnel investigations would deter the reporting of misconduct by public employees, or participation in such investigations, for fear of public embarrassment, humiliation, or even retaliation.\u201d <em>Hounsell, </em>154 N.H. at 5. We are confident that the proper balancing of the employees\u2019 interests in privacy and the State\u2019s interest in nondisclosure against the public\u2019s interest in disclosure under our established test adequately addresses any concerns about deterrence. <em>Cf. Goode v. N.H. Legislative Budget Assistant, </em>148 N.H. 551, 556 (2002) (acknowledging \u201ca possibility that an audit investigation may be compromised if interviewees are reluctant to disclose information to investigators\u201d out of concern \u201cthat their responses could be released to the public,\u201d but finding that this possibility did \u201cnot. .. outweigh[ ] the public\u2019s interest in disclosure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">In light of our decision, we need not address the plaintiffs constitutional argument. <em>See Chatman, </em>163 N.H. at 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">\n<em>Vacated and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b577-8\">Hicks, Conboy, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b558-9\"> <em>See Rockingham County Attorney v.

Our order did, however, stay processing of the appeal pending the conclusion of the removal action in the superior court. We ruled that if the court\u2019s final decision in the removal action was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>appealed to this court, we would consolidate the appeals in both cases, and that if the removal action was not appealed, we would then reactivate the appeal in Case No. 2014-0247 at the request of the appellants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b560-10\"> The court also denied the plaintiffs request for the assessment of a civil penalty, finding that the defendant had not acted in bad faith.

While this statement may appear to suggest a broader interpretation of Exemption 2 than that in <em>Rose, </em>it has been noted that \u201c[t]he modest difference in judicial approaches taken in the <em>Rose </em>and <em>Milner </em>decisions does not come close to undermining the <em>Rose </em>holding.\u201d <em>Shapiro, </em>153 F. Supp. 3d at 279.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b567-7\"> In <em>Hounsell, </em>the precinct\u2019s legal counsel \u201cretained\u201d the outside third parties \u201cto investigate [an employee\u2019s] complaint of harassment\u201d by a co-worker. <em>Hounsell, </em>154 N.H. at 2.

In particular, the defendant claimed an exemption for \u201crecords whose disclosure would constitute an invasion of privacy.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) To the extent that claim was intended to be an invocation of the exemption for <em>\u201cother </em>files whose disclosure would constitute invasion of privacy,\u201d we express no opinion upon the scope or application of that claimed exemption and our decision herein has no effect upon the defendant\u2019s ability to assert such a claim on remand.
