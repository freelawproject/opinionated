Benoit and Kathleen A. Nawn-Benoit, appeal from an order of the Superior Court (Colburn, J.) granting the summary judgment motion filed by defendants Ronald N. and Rita A. Delude, and denying the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">\n<em>I. Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b56-14\">The summary judgment record reflects the following pertinent facts. In 1974, a developer created plans for the Profile Estates Subdivision (subdivision), a development in Merrimack. The plans, recorded in the Hills-borough County registry of deeds, created 70 lots and a seven-acre parcel of \u201cCommon Land for Profile Estates, Phases I and II\u201d (Common Land) (capitalization omitted). The developer also recorded a \u201cDeclaration of Covenants\u201d for the subdivision (Declaration). According to the Declaration, the developer desired to \u201ccreate ... a residential community with permanent open spaces and other common facilities for the benefit of [that] community.\u201d With the exception of five lots, all of the lots, including the Common Land, are subject to the Declaration. The developer included reference to the Declaration in each deed conveyed to the original purchaser of a lot in the subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-15\">The Declaration provides that all of the lots subject to it \u201cshall be held, transferred, sold, conveyed and occupied subject to the covenants, restric<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>tions, easements, charges and assessments\u201d set forth therein. The Declaration requires each record owner of the lots subject to it to join the \u201cPROFILE ESTATES HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION\u201d (Association). The Association \u201cis to be formed by the Owners for the purpose of maintaining and administering the Common [Land] and facilities thereon, administering and enforcing the restrictions, and collecting and disbursing the assessments and charges.\u201d The developer \u201cmay retain the legal title\u201d to the Common Land until the developer is of the opinion that the Association \u201cis able to maintain the same,\u201d but \u201cmust convey legal title to the Association when fifty-one percent (51%) of the Lots have been sold.\u201d The cost of maintaining the Common Land \u201cshall be borne by the [d]eveloper or its successors in title until the transfer of said Common [Land] to the Association and thereafter the cost of maintenance shall be borne by said Association.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Each record owner of the properties subject to the Declaration is given \u201ca right and easement of enjoyment in and to\u201d the Common Land, \u201cand such easement shall be appurtenant to and shall pass with the title to every lot.\u201d The Common Land is \u201crestricted to recreational, conservation and park uses for all of the Owners\u201d and no structures shall be erected on the Common Land \u201cexcept as incident to said uses.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">The Declaration provides that the restrictions contained in it shall run with, and bind the land, and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Association, or the Owner of any land subject to this Declaration, their respective legal representatives, heirs, successors, and assigns, for a term of ten (10) years from the date this Declaration is recorded, after which time said restrictions shall be extended for successive periods of ten (10) years unless an instrument signed by the then Owners of two-thirds (2/8) of the Lots has been recorded, agreeing to change said restrictions in whole or in part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The Declaration further provides that the failure of the Association or any owner \u201cto enforce any covenant or restriction\u201d contained therein \u201cshall in no event be deemed a waiver of the right to do so thereafter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">All of the lots in the subdivision were subsequently sold, but the Association was never formed, and the developer retained title to the Common Land. The developer, however, failed to pay the property taxes and the Common Land was sold at a tax sale in August 1979 to R. Robert Gaumont, Jr., who owned and lived in Lot 51 in the subdivision, adjacent to the Common Land. Gaumont recorded the tax sale deed in September 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>In August 2001, Gaumont sold Lot 51 to the plaintiffs by warranty deed. The deed to Lot 51 stated that the conveyance was \u201c[sjubject to and with the benefit of\u2019 the Declaration. On the same date, Gaumont sold the Common Land to the plaintiffs for less than $100 by quitclaim deed. Since buying the Common Land, the plaintiffs have paid approximately $40,000 in taxes on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">In July 2014, over the objections of several lot owners in the subdivision, the plaintiffs obtained a variance to build a single-family residence on the Common Land. In January 2015, the plaintiffs brought a petition against the residents of the subdivision seeking: (1) a declaratory judgment that the Declaration is unenforceable; (2) an order that they have acquired title to the Common Land \u201cfree and clear of the Declaration through adverse possession\u201d; and (3) to the extent that the Declaration is deemed enforceable, an order requiring the defendants to form the Association, purchase the Common Land from the plaintiffs \u201cat its fair market value,\u201d and reimburse them for their \u201cout-of-pocket expenses ..., including real estate taxes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Two residents, the defendants before us, moved for summary judgment \u201con behalf of all\u201d of the defendants on the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and the plaintiffs cross-moved for summary judgment on their request for a declaratory judgment. The trial court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denied the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-motion, and concluded that \u201c[bjecause the undisputed material facts and the applicable law apply equally to the [plaintiffs\u2019] claims asserted against all of the other [defendant]-lot owners, they are likewise entitled to summary judgment.\u201d The court subsequently denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">\n<em>II. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">\u201cIn reviewing the trial court\u2019s rulings on cross-motions for summary judgment, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to each party in its capacity as the nonmoving party and, if no genuine issue of material fact exists, we determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Bovaird v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Admin. Servs., </em>166 N.H. 755, 758 (2014) (quotation omitted). \u201cIf our review of that evidence discloses no genuine issue of material fact and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, then we will affirm the grant of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>\n<em>III. Enforceability of the Declarat ion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in ruling that the Declaration is enforceable. They assert that the tax sale extinguished the Declaration: (1) under the \u201ctax assessment theory\u201d; (2) because the Association was never formed and rights under the Declaration never vested; and (3) upon default of redemption by the Association. The trial court considered, and rejected, each of these arguments, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u201cOrdinarily, a tax sale does not divest easements charged on the property sold.\u201d <em>Gowen v. Swain, </em>90 N.H. 383, 387 (1939) (quotation omitted); <em>see Marshall v. Burke, </em>162 N.H. 560, 564 (2011) (holding that a tax sale does not extinguish prescriptive easements that have ripened into vested property rights prior to recording of the tax deed); <em>see also Buchholz v. Waterville Estates Assoc., </em>156 N.H. 172, 175 (2007) (concluding that condominium covenants that run with the land survive a tax sale); <em>cf. Burke v. Pierro, </em>159 N.H. 504, 514-15 (2009) (when 20-year prescriptive period had not run before town acquired title to the lot, the tax sale created a new title).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The plaintiffs acknowledge this case law. Nonetheless, relying upon cases from other jurisdictions, they first argue that, in this case, we should apply the \u201ctax assessment theory\u201d and conclude that the tax sale extinguished the easements because \u201cthe value of the easements and restrictions has never been assessed against the dominant estates,\u201d and the Common Land \u201chas always been assessed at fair market value as a buildable lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">We agree with the trial court that the tax sale did not extinguish the Declaration as a matter of law. We also agree with the court\u2019s conclusion that, pursuant to <em>Gowen </em>and <em>Marshall, </em>\u201c[w]hether or not the assessors accurately assessed the dominant and servient estate[s\u2019] value is immaterial, because it is presumed that assessors take into account the effect restrictions have on the valuation of property.\u201d We recognized in <em>Go-wen </em>that \u201c[pjresumably assessors take into account this effect of easements on value in making their appraisals.\u201d <em>Gowen, </em>90 N.H. at 387. \u201c[I]f, acting in ignorance of the existence of an easement, they overvalue the servient estate, the mistake is correctible by abatement proceedings unless circumstances exist which render abatement inequitable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Thus, \u201cwhile assessors are <em>presumed </em>to take account of the impact of easements on the value of properties, the practical reality is that the actual burden of insuring that this occurs is placed on the property owner through the tax abatement process.\u201d <em>Marshall, </em>162 N.H. at 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">Second, the plaintiffs argue that the tax sale extinguished the Declaration because the Association was never formed and rights under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Declaration never vested. They assert that under the language of the Declaration, the Declaration was \u201csubject to\u201d the express condition precedent that title to the property was supposed to be owned by the Association, but because the owners never elected to form an Association, \u201c[the defendants\u2019] right to enforce the easements and restrictions had never vested, and the tax sale extinguished the Declaration.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) The defendants counter that considering the language of the Declaration as a whole, it \u201cmakes clear that its easements and restrictions vested upon recordation and therefore survived the tax sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Under its plain language, the Declaration vested upon being recorded in the registry of deeds in 1974. The Declaration states that the Common Land \u201cis and shall be held . . . subject to the covenants, restrictions, easements, charges and assessments\u201d as set forth therein. Those restrictions \u201cshall run with, and bind the land, and shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Association, <em>or the Owner of any land subje ct to this Declaration . . </em>. for a term of ten (10) years <em>from the date this Declarat ion is recorded, </em>after which time said restrictions shall be extended for successive periods of ten (10) years.\u201d (Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">In addition, rejecting the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the Declaration creates a condition precedent \u2014 the creation of the Association and transfer of legal title to it \u2014 the trial court reasoned that \u201creading the document as a whole, it is apparent that the Declaration contemplated the creation of the Association, and transfer of legal title to it, as events that would occur, if at all, after the Declaration was recorded.\u201d As the trial court correctly noted, \u201c[ijndeed the Declaration anticipates the possibility that less than 51% of the Lots would be sold, in which case the Developer is not required to transfer legal title to the Association but would be, however, responsible for\u201d the cost of maintenance of the Common Land. Moreover, the trial court reasoned, \u201cin the absence of an Association, lot owners are permitted to enforce the Declaration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">We conclude that, read in their entirety, the easements and restrictions set forth in the Declaration vested upon being recorded in the registry of deeds and, therefore, the Declaration was not extinguished by the tax sale that took place five years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\"> Third, the plaintiffs argue that the tax sale extinguished the Declaration because the defendants, having received actual and constructive notice of the tax sale, failed to exercise their right of redemption pursuant to RSA 80:32 (2012). However, because as a matter of law the tax sale did not extinguish the Declaration, there were no interests for the defendants to redeem and, thus, redemption is not applicable. The plaintiffs argue that because the defendants\u2019 rights in the Common Land \u201care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>derivative of their ownership of the entire fee interest in the Property, as opposed to, a mere easement,\u201d \u201c[u]pon default of redemption, the tax sale extinguished [the defendants\u2019] ownership rights in the Property, and their corresponding rights under the Declaration were equally extinguished.\u201d These arguments, however, were not raised in the trial court. Accordingly, we decline to address them on appeal. <em>See Dukette v. Brazas, </em>166 N.H. 252, 255 (2014) (explaining that parties generally may not have judicial review of matters not raised before the trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\n<em>IV. Laches</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The plaintiffs argue that the Declaration is unenforceable under the doctrine of laches. They assert that \u201cthe facts of this case overwhelmingly] support a finding that the [defendants] sat on their rights for more than 35 years\u201d in that they \u201cnever sought to use the Property as common land, never sought to form the Association, and never sought to enforce the Declaration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\"> \u201cLaches is an equitable doctrine that bars litigation when a potential plaintiff has slept on his rights.\u201d <em>Appeal of Prof\u2019l Fire Fighters of Hudson, </em>167 N.H. 46, 57 (2014) (quotation omitted). \u201cLaches, unlike limitation, is not a mere matter of time, but is principally a question of the inequity of permitting the claim to be enforced \u2014 an inequity founded on some change in the conditions or relations of the parties involved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and ellipsis omitted). \u201cBecause it is an equitable doctrine, laches will constitute a bar to suit only if the delay was unreasonable and prejudicial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cThe trial court has broad discretion in deciding whether the circumstances justify the application of laches; we will not overturn its decision unless it is unsupported by the evidence or erroneous as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Village Green Condo. </em>Ass<em>\u2019n v. Hodges, </em>167 N.H. 497, 505 (2015).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">Based upon the evidence presented, the trial court found that at no time before July of 2014, when the [plaintiffs] received a variance for the Common Land, did the [defendants] become aware of any misconduct by the [plaintiffs] that would require them to exercise and enforce their rights under the Declaration. The misconduct necessary to place the [defendants] on notice would unavoidably involve activity that was contrary to the restrictions and rights set forth in the Declaration. Despite their differences, the [plaintiffs\u2019] and [defendants\u2019] affidavits make clear that nothing was ever built or developed on the Common Land in violation of the Declaration. The evidence shows that the Common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Land has remained unchanged since the [plaintiffs] purchased it. Although the [plaintiffs] alleged that [the Common Land] has never been used as common land and that only one individual ever received permission to use the Common Land to cut firewood, they do not affirmatively state that they prohibited other lot owners from entering upon and using the Common Land for recreational purposes. The closest the [plaintiffs] come to alleging that they prohibited others from using [the Common Land] comes in the form of a single instance when they called the police after hearing what they believed to be people trespassing on the Common Land.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">(Citations omitted.) Accordingly, the trial court concluded that the plaintiffs \u201chave not met their burden of showing that the [defendants] became aware of the misconduct and then slept on their rights; rather, the undisputed facts show that the delay was merely a result of the [defendants\u2019] lack of awareness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Based upon our review of the record, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by the evidence and are not erroneous as a matter of law. Furthermore, the Declaration itself provides that the failure of the Association or any owner \u201cto enforce any covenant or restriction\u201d contained therein \u201cshall in no event be deemed a waiver of the right to do so thereafter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The plaintiffs also argue that the trial court failed to take all reasonable inferences of fact in their favor, specifically as to Gaumont\u2019s statement in his affidavit that he bought the Common Land \u201cto ensure it remained undeveloped common land for the enjoyment of . . . the other residents.\u201d The plaintiffs assert that the only reasonable inferences that can be drawn from this statement are that Gaumont \u201cbelieved the tax sale extinguished the Declaration,\u201d and that Gaumont \u201cbelieved the other [residents had no right to use the [Common Land] after the tax sale.\u201d However, the trial court specifically addressed this argument when it denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration. The trial court correctly stated that the plaintiffs\u2019 argument is \u201cdirectly contradicted by ... Gaumont\u2019s affidavit. Assuming... Gaumont\u2019s subjective beliefs are relevant, he stated in his affidavit that he purchased the [Common Land] subject to all easements and covenants. Moreover, a reasonable inference may be drawn from . . . Gaumont\u2019s affidavit that his purchase was to further ensure the [subdivision] residents\u2019 ability to use the [Common Land].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>\n<em>V. Conveyance to the Association</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred when it ordered the defendants to form the Association and the plaintiffs to convey the property to the Association for no consideration. They assert that \u201cNew Hampshire law is clear that the nature of the title conveyed through a tax sale is that of fee simple,\u201d but that \u201c[t]he question of whether or not an easement survives a tax sale is a wholly different issue than whether or not the title that was conveyed by the tax sale was in fee simple or that of a defeasible fee by virtue of a covenant to convey.\u201d Thus, according to the plaintiffs, \u201cthe affirmative covenants contained within the Declaration which impose obligations upon them to maintain and convey the [Common Land], without some corresponding reciprocal benefit, must have been extinguished by the tax sale.\u201d The trial court rejected this argument. Taking the plaintiffs\u2019 argument as asserting that the court \u201cimplicitly determined their title to the [Common Land] was a defeasible fee and not held in fee simple,\u201d the trial court stated that it \u201cmade no such determination.\u201d Rather, it \u201cordered the [plaintiffs] to transfer the [Common Land] based on the Declaration\u2019s requirement to convey it after more than 51% of the [subdivision] properties were sold. Therefore, [the plaintiffs\u2019] title status was not relevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">In addition, the plaintiffs argue that the trial court\u2019s order constitutes \u201can unconstitutional taking without just compensation in violation of Part 1, Article 12 of the New Hampshire Constitution and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\u201d The trial court rejected this argument, noting that the plaintiffs \u201cdid not develop [it] beyond a conclusory statement and failed to cite any authority for their position.\u201d On appeal, the plaintiffs have likewise failed to develop this argument sufficiently for our review and, accordingly, we decline to address it. <em>See Lennartz v. Oak Point Assocs., </em>167 N.H. 459, 464 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\n<em>VI. Equitable Relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">The plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in the exercise of its equitable powers in failing to craft an equitable remedy. They assert that \u201c[u]nder the unique circumstances of this case,\u201d fairness requires that, in addition to ordering that the Association be formed and hold title to the Common Land, the Common Land should be purchased from them by the residents of the subdivision at its fair market value and the plaintiffs reimbursed for all of their out-of-pocket expenses relative to the Common Land, including real estate taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">We review the trial court\u2019s decision whether to grant equitable relief for an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>Conant v. O\u2019Meara, </em>167 N.H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>644, 649 (2015). In doing so, we determine \u201cwhether the record establishes an objective basis sufficient to sustain the discretionary judgment made.\u201d <em>State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 296 (2001). \u201cThe court has broad and flexible equitable powers which allow it to shape and adjust the precise relief to the requirements of the particular situation.\u201d <em>Chase v. Ameriquest Mortgage Co., </em>155 N.H. 19, 24 (2007) (quotation omitted). \u201cA court of equity will order to be done that which in fairness and good conscience ought to be or should have been done. It is the practice of courts of equity ... to administer all relief which the nature of the case and facts demand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The party asserting that a trial court order is unsustainable \u201cmust demonstrate that the ruling was unreasonable or untenable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>Foley v. Wheelock, </em>157 N.H. 329, 332 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The trial court determined that the plaintiffs \u201care not entitled to the equitable relief they seek because the Declaration prohibits it.\u201d The Declaration provides that the cost of maintenance of the Common Land \u201cshall be borne by the [d]eveloper or its successors in title until the transfer of said Common [Land] to the Association and thereafter the cost of maintenance shall be borne by said Association.\u201d As the trial court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">It is undisputed that the [plaintiffs] are the Developer\u2019s successors in title and that the Association was never formed. It follows that the [plaintiffs] have been, and remain responsible for, the \u201ccost of maintenance\u201d of the Common Land until such time as the Association is formed. Also, under the terms of the Declaration, the [defendants] are not required to purchase the Common Land deed from the [plaintiffs]; rather, the [plaintiffs] must \u201cconvey legal title\u201d to the Association.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Furthermore, the trial court reasoned that the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cown conduct cuts against the equitable relief they seek.\u201d \u201cWhen equitable as distinguished from legal relief is sought, equitable as distinguished from legal defenses have to be considered.\u201d <em>Nashua Hospital v. Gage, </em>85 N.H. 335, 343 (1932) (quotation omitted). \u201cThe conduct of the plaintiff may disentitle him to relief; his acquiescence in what he complains of or his delay in seeking relief may of itself be sufficient to preclude him from obtaining it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">The undisputed evidence supports that the Declaration was recorded in the registry of deeds when the plaintiffs purchased both Gaumont\u2019s property and the Common Land. Therefore, the plaintiffs purchased the Common Land with constructive notice of the easements and restrictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>encumbering it. <em>See C F Invs. v. Option One Mortgage Corp., </em>163 N.H. 313, 316 (2012) (explaining that \u201cproperly recorded instruments are deemed to give notice to prospective purchasers of any outstanding claims against property\u201d). In addition, the trial court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">More significantly, not only does the [plaintiffs\u2019] deed for . . . Gaumont\u2019s property ... specifically reference the Declaration, the [plaintiffs] also purchased the seven-acre Common Land by way of quitclaim deed for less than $100. Such a small cost for such a large piece of real estate should have alerted the [plaintiffs] to the restrictions and easements placed on the Common Land. Despite knowledge of the Declaration, the plaintiffs paid taxes on the Common Land for thirteen years without complaint. Only after seeking a variance to build on the property, to which several lot owners protested, did they seek to quiet title to the Common Land or equitable relief in the form of compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u201c[O]ur task is not to determine whether we would have found differently ...\u201d <em>In re Adam M., </em>148 N.H. 83, 84 (2002). Our only function on review is to determine whether a reasonable person could have reached the same decision as the trial court on the basis of the evidence before it. <em>See id. </em>We conclude that the record establishes an objective basis sufficient to sustain the discretionary judgment made. <em>See Lambert, </em>147 N.H. at 296. Accordingly, the plaintiffs have failed to establish that the court\u2019s order constitutes an unsustainable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\n<em>VII. Tax Abatement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred when it concluded that they should have obtained a tax abatement when \u201cthere was a complete absence of evidence or argument submitted to the trial court that the [plaintiffs] would, in fact, have been entitled to a tax abatement.\u201d We disagree with the plaintiffs\u2019 characterization of the trial court\u2019s order. The trial court did not conclude that the plaintiffs should have obtained a tax abatement. The plaintiffs argued that the tax sale extinguished the Declaration because the value of the easements and covenants were neither subtracted from the Common Land nor assessed as part of the dominant estates of the residents of the subdivision. In addressing this argument, the trial court simply noted that New Hampshire law is that any mistake on the part of the assessors in overvaluing the servient estate is correctable by abatement proceedings, \u201cunless circumstances exist which render abatement proceedings inequitable.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) Assuming without deciding that the Common Land was overvalued and the assessors failed to take into account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>restrictions encumbering it, the trial court found that the plaintiffs knew of the easements and covenants because they were recorded and cited in the plaintiffs\u2019 deed to lot 51. The court also found that the plaintiffs knew or should have known that the Common Land was subject to the easements and covenants because they purchased it for less than $100 by a quitclaim deed.
