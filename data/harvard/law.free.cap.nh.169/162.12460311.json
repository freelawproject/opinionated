(Signal), appeals a ruling of the Superior Court <em>(Bornstein, </em>J.) granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant, City of Lebanon (City), in this action by Signal for, among other things, breach of contract. The City cross-appeals a portion of the trial court\u2019s order interpreting the contract. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">The following facts were recited in the trial court\u2019s order, are contained in the record, or are taken from our decision in a prior appeal in this case. <em>See Signal Aviation Servs. v. City of Lebanon, </em>164 N.H. 578 (2018). Signal leases 8.91 acres at the Lebanon Municipal Airport (airport) as assignee of a Lease and Operating Agreement (LOA). The City owns the airport and is the lessor under the LOA. The LOA grants Signal the nonexclusive right and obligation to provide fixed based operator (FBO) services at the airport. FBO services include \u201caircraft ground guidance and ramp service, aircraft parking and storage, aircraft maintenance and repair service, flight training, sale and rental of aircraft, flight services and charter operations, and maintenance in operation of facilities for the comfort and convenience of pilots and passengers.\u201d (Quotation and ellipsis omitted.) In granting this nonexclusive right, the City agreed in paragraph 3M(2) of the LOA that \u201c[a]ny other operator of aeronautical endeavors or activities will not be permitted to operate on the Airport under rates, terms [or] conditions which are more favorable than those set forth in this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">In 2006, the City increased the assessed value of the land leased by Signal, not including the improvements, from $77,400 to $868,800, resulting in a corresponding increase in Signal\u2019s property tax liability. <em>Id. </em>at 580. Signal applied for an abatement of taxes for the years 2006 and 2007. <em>Id. </em>Following denial by the City\u2019s assessors, Signal appealed to the New Hampshire Board of Tax and Land Appeals (BTLA). <em>Id. </em>The BTLA dismissed the appeals because Signal failed to present evidence of the property\u2019s market value. <em>Id. </em>Signal did not appeal that decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">Signal then brought the instant action claiming, among other things, breach of contract. Its writ alleged that the City \u201cmaterially breached its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>obligations under the [LOA] by providing more favorable and disproportionate tax assessments and taxation schemes under agreements with other entities at the Airport providing commercial aeronautical services there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\">The City filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that Signal\u2019s exclusive remedy for disproportionate taxation was through the statutory abatement process and, consequently, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant the relief sought. <em>Id. </em>at 581. The trial court granted the City\u2019s motion and Signal appealed. <em>Id. </em>at 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">On appeal, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s order in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>We held that \u201cto the extent that Signal\u2019s breach of contract claim sought relief from \u2018disproportionate taxation,\u2019 its claim [was] unavailing,\u201d as it was, \u201cin effect, a claim for abatement of taxes . . . [which] may be pursued only through the tax abatement statutory scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583. We also held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">However, to the extent that Signal\u2019s breach of contract claim sought relief from \u201cunequal treatment,\u201d specifically with respect to the amount of taxable land the City attributes to Signal and to other airport tenants with which the City contracts, Signal may pursue this claim without complying with the tax abatement statutory process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 583-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">On remand, the City moved for summary judgment on what remained of Signal\u2019s breach of contract claim. The trial court noted that Signal\u2019s objection specified four tenants, or categories of tenants, that were allegedly taxed disproportionately. First, Signal claimed that Magic Bird Contracting, Inc. (Magic Bird) and Lebanon Hangar Associates, Ltd. (Lebanon Hangar) are taxed more favorably than Signal. Second, Signal argued that tenants at the Executive Ramp, where the City had constructed T-hangars and tie-down spaces \u201cto provide the public with . . . parking spaces for private aircraft,\u201d receive more favorable tax treatment. (Quotation omitted.) Third, Signal contended that tenants at the Airport Terminal are taxed disproportionately. Finally, Signal claimed that the City\u2019s exemption from taxes constitutes unequal treatment for purposes of paragraph 8M(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">The trial court granted the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and Signal now appeals. The City cross-appeals, challenging a portion of the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the LOA. On April 21, 2016, we requested supplemental briefing from the parties on the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">With respect to the issue of taxation, do paragraphs 3M(2) and 3D, taken together, ensure only that all operators of aeronautical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>endeavors or activities permitted to operate on the airport will be required to pay such taxes as are lawfully levied or assessed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\">Does the City\u2019s operation of the Executive Ramp violate paragraphs 3M(2) and 3D as so construed?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Having received supplemental briefs from both parties, we now resolve the issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Our standard of review is well-settled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s rulings on cross-motions for summary judgment, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to each party in its capacity as the nonmoving party and, if no genuine issue of material fact exists, we determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. If our review of that evidence discloses no genuine issue of material fact and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, then we will affirm the grant of summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-8\"><em>Granite State Mgmt. &amp; Res. v. City of Concord, </em>165 N.H. 277, 282 (2013) (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">In addition, this appeal requires us to review the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the LOA. Our review is <em>de novo </em>\u201c[b]ecause the proper interpretation of a written agreement is ultimately a question of law for this court.\u201d <em>Gen. Linen Servs. v. Franconia Inv. Assocs., </em>150 N.H. 595, 597 (2004). We will sustain the trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions unless they are lacking in evidentiary support or tainted by error of law. <em>Id. </em>Our standards regarding contract interpretation are also well-established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-10\">It is axiomatic that we give an agreement the meaning intended by the parties when they wrote it. When interpreting a written agreement, we give the language used by the parties its reasonable meaning, considering the circumstances and context in which the agreement was negotiated, when reading the document as a whole. Absent ambiguity, the parties\u2019 intent will be determined from the plain meaning of the language used. Only when the parties reasonably disagree as to its meaning will the agreement\u2019s language be deemed ambiguous. If the agreement\u2019s language is ambiguous, it must be determined what the parties, under an objective standard, mutually understood the ambiguous language to mean.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-11\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-12\">Signal argues that the trial court erred in: (1) ruling that the City is not an \u201coperator of aeronautical endeavors or activities\u201d for purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>paragraph 3M(2) of the LOA; (2) ruling that the City has no authority to not assess taxes on the premises leased to Signal; (3) ruling that Signal cannot raise the claims that it has been treated differently with respect to the amount of land attributed to it for taxation as compared to the amount attributed to Lebanon Hangar, Magic Bird, and the tenants at the airport\u2019s Airport Terminal; and (4) finding that all airport tenants are taxed for the entire amount of land they lease. In its cross-appeal, the City challenges \u201cthe trial court\u2019s ruling that paragraph 3M(2) is generally inclusive of the subject of real estate taxation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Signal first challenges the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the City is not an \u201coperator of commercial endeavors or activities\u201d under paragraph 3M(2). (Quotation and underlining omitted.) It argues that the trial court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">failed to recognize that the Lease language in question has its origin in the economic non-discrimination provisions of . . . FAA grant assurances . . . [under which] the City must. . . treat itself as an operator of aeronautical endeavors and not have more favorable terms or conditions than other operators leasing at the Airport when the City is in competition with those operators.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) grant assurances are written assurances, given by airport sponsors, such as the City, \u201cas a condition of receiving federal funds for airport improvements,\u201d in which the sponsor pledges that it \u201cwill make the airport available for public use without unjust discrimination and will subject FBOs who use the airport in a similar manner to the same charges.\u201d <em>Gary Jet Center, Inc. v. Gary/Chicago Intern. Airport Authority, </em>No. 2:13-CV-453 JVB, 2014 WL 1329412, at *2 (N.D. Ind. Apr. 2, 2014). Signal cites two provisions of the City\u2019s grant assurances dealing with economic nondiscrimination. The first, assurance 22(c), provides that \u201c[e]ach fixed-base operator at the airport shall be subject to the same rates, fees, rentals and other charges as are uniformly applicable to all other fixed-base operators making the same or similar uses of such airport and utilizing the same or similar facilities.\u201d The second, assurance 22(g), provides that \u201c[i]n the event the sponsor itself exercises any of the rights and privileges referred to in this assurance, the services involved will be provided on the same conditions as would apply to the furnishing of such services by commercial aeronautical service providers authorized by the sponsor under these provisions.\u201d Signal contends that the City, as the airport sponsor, has \u201cprovided] aeronautical services at the Airport\u201d in competition with Signal, including, but \u201cnot necessarily limited to, the leasing of [hangar], tie-down and operational space.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">The City asserts that the definitions of the terms used in paragraph 3M are contained in the Airport Rules promulgated by the City and argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>these definitions are incorporated into the LOA and \u201ccontrol how paragraph 8M is to be construed.\u201d The term \u201cOperator,\u201d for instance, is defined in the Airport Rules as \u201cany Entity who has applied for and received written permission to engage in a Commercial Activity at or from the Airport, and ha[s] entered into and executed the required Lease/operating agreement with the City.\u201d (Underlining omitted.) The City argues, and the trial court agreed, that paragraph 3M(2) cannot be construed to include the City as an \u201coperator\u201d because \u201cdoing so would require the City to enter into agreements with itself.\u201d Rather, the City contends, \u201c[t]his paragraph can only refer to third parties (private entities <em>besides </em>Signal and the City).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Although the trial court found that \u201c[t]he parties do not dispute that the Agreement incorporates by reference the City\u2019s rules and regulations for the operation of the airport,\u201d we are not convinced that such incorporation was so broad as to supply the definitions for the terms used in paragraph 3M.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Paragraph 3E of the LOA obligates <em>Signal </em>to \u201ccomply with all federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations which may apply to the conduct of the business contemplated, including rules and regulations promulgated by the City.\u201d We do not read this language to unambiguously incorporate the definition of \u201coperator\u201d into a separate provision of the LOA that circumscribes <em>the City\u2019s </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">We agree with Signal, moreover, that the City\u2019s FAA assurances are relevant to interpreting the LOA. Paragraph 13 of the LOA provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">This Agreement shall be subject and subordinate to the provisions of any existing or future agreement between the City and the United States, or any agency thereof, relative to the operation or maintenance of the Airport, the execution of which has been or may be required as a condition precedent to the expenditure of federal funds for the development or operation of the Airport.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">In light of this broader incorporation of the FAA assurances, we decline to affirm the trial court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe City is not an \u2018operator of aeronautical endeavors or activities\u2019 under any reading of [paragraph 3M(2)]; it is simply a lessor of real estate at the Airport.\u201d The FAA has defined aeronautical activity as \u201cany activity that involves, makes possible, or is required for the operation of aircraft or that contributes to or is required for the safety of such operations . . . including] . . . aircraft <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>storage.\u201d <em>BMI Salvage Corp. v. F.A.A., </em>No. 11-12583, 2012 WL 2924025, at **3 (11th Cir. July 19, 2012) (quotation omitted). It is undisputed that the City leases T-hangars and tie-down spaces at the Executive Ramp to private aircraft owners. Thus, we conclude that the City conducts \u201caeronautical endeavors or activities\u201d at the airport. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the City is unambiguously excluded as an \u201coperator\u201d under paragraph 3M and, for purposes of this opinion, we assume, without deciding, that the City is an \u201coperator of aeronautical endeavors or activities\u201d under paragraph 3M(2). This assumption is relevant to our ultimate disposition, as set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"> Signal next contends that the trial court erred in concluding that the City lacks authority to assess no taxes on the premises it leased to Signal. \u201cThe assessment and collection of taxes must be based on legislative authority.\u201d <em>N.E. Tel &amp; Tel Co. v. City of Rochester, </em>144 N.H. 118, 120 (1999) <em>(Rochester I). </em>The allocation of the tax burden at issue here is mandated by statute. <em>See id. </em>RSA 72:6 provides that \u201c[a]ll real estate, whether improved or unimproved, shall be taxed except as otherwise provided.\u201d RSA 72:6 (2012). City-owned real estate is exempted under RSA 72:23, which provides that the \u201c[l]ands and the buildings and structures thereon and therein ... owned by ... a New Hampshire city,\u201d RSA 72:23,1(a) (2012), are exempt from taxation unless otherwise provided by statute. RSA 72:23 (2012); <em>see Wooster v. Plymouth, </em>62 N.H. 193, 209 (1882) (explaining that the property of municipal corporations \u201cis exempted from state taxation, because, like the property of the state, it is public\u201d). RSA 72:23, I(b), in turn, \u201cotherwise provid[es]\u201d with respect to property that a city leases to others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-4\">All leases and other agreements, the terms of which provide for the use or occupation by others of real or personal property owned by the state or a city, town, school district, or village district, entered into after July 1, 1979, <em>shall </em>provide for the payment of properly assessed real and personal property taxes by the party using or occupying said property no later than the due date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">RSA 72:23, 1(b) (emphasis added); <em>see Verizon New England v. City of Rochester, </em>151 N.H. 263, 266-67 (2004) <em>(Rochester II) </em>(holding that, according to the unambiguous, plain language of RSA 72:23, I(b), \u201cleases and other agreements which permit the use or occupation of public property must provide for the payment of properly assessed real estate taxes\u201d); <em>Rochester I, </em>144 N.H. at 122 (explaining that leased property excepted, under RSA 72:23, I(b), from RSA 72:23, I(a)\u2019s municipal tax exemption remains taxable under RSA 72:6 and that RSA 72:23, I(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>\u201csimply requires the [municipality] to shift the tax burden imposed by RSA 72:6 to [its lessee] by making tax liability a condition of\u2019 the lease). Accordingly, paragraph 3D of the LOA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-4\">[Signal] shall meet all expenses and payments in connection with the use of the Premises and the rights and privileges herein granted, including taxes, permit fees, license fees and assessments lawfully levied or assessed upon the Premises or property at any time situated therein and thereon. [Signal] may, however, at its sole expense and cost, contest any tax, fee or assessment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">We have held that \u201c[t]owns have no power to assess any tax not authorized by statute, nor to change or modify the public law regulating taxation.\u201d <em>Mack v. Jones, </em>21 N.H. 393, 395 (1850). Thus, in <em>Piper v. Meredith, </em>83 N.H. 107 (1927), we held that even if the plaintiff could prove that the town contracted with the plaintiffs predecessor in interest that he \u201cand his successors should occupy the premises forever without the payment of taxes,\u201d it \u201cwould not entitle [the plaintiff] to the relief for which he prays in this petition, <em>i.e., </em>that the tax assessed against him be abated.\u201d <em>Piper, </em>83 N.H. at 112, 113 (quotation omitted). We concluded that \u201c[t]he contract, if proved, would be illegal and void, for a town cannot, by grant or stipulation in a conveyance, exempt land from taxation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113. In accordance with these precedents, we agree with the trial court that the City has no power to contract with Signal not to tax the leased property. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Signal nevertheless argues that \u201c[w]hether or not the City has legal authority to enter into a contract to not tax land, that is what the City did.\u201d <em>It dies Lebanon Hangar Associates, Ltd. v. City of Lebanon, </em>No. 215-2007-EQ-0025 (N.H. Super. Ct. Mar. 7, 2013), which we affirmed by unpublished order, <em>Lebanon Hangar Associates, Ltd. v. City of Lebanon, </em>No. 2013-0319 (N.H. Apr. 17, 2014). <em>Lebanon, Hangar Associates </em>involved an arbitrator\u2019s decision reforming a lease at the Lebanon Airport. <em>Lebanon Hangar Assocs. v. City of Lebanon, </em>163 N.H. 670, 672 (2012). The arbitrator concluded that Lebanon Hangar \u201cis not and has not been obligated to pay real estate taxes to the City under the lease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We noted that \u201c[t]he evidence of the parties\u2019 intentions upon which the arbitrator could have relied\u201d consisted in part of \u201ctwo letters, exchanged between the parties around the time of the execution of the lease, expressing both parties\u2019 expectation that taxes would be assessed on the leased building and structures on the land, but not on the City-owned land itself.\u201d <em>Lebanon Hangar Associates, </em>No. 2013-0319, at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The arbitrator considered purportedly conflicting case law in New Hampshire on the subject of taxation of property leased by a municipality; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>namely, <em>Appeal of Reid, </em>143 N.H. 246 (1998), on the one hand, and <em>Rochester I, Rochester II, </em>and <em>Verizon New England v. City of Rochester, </em>156 N.H. 624 (2007), on the other. <em>See Lebanon Hangar Associates, </em>No. 2013-0319, at 5-6. We declined to resolve the purported conflict; rather, under the standard of review applicable to arbitrators\u2019 awards, <em>see </em>RSA 542:8 (2007), we determined that we could not \u201cconclude that the arbitrator committed \u2018plain mistake\u2019 in holding that RSA 72:23,1(b) \u2018does not prevent reformation of a lease such that the lessee is not required to pay taxes on the leased land.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lebanon Hangar Associates, </em>No. 2013-0319, at 6; <em>see Masse v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>136 N.H. 628, 632 (1993) (noting that \u201cRSA 542:8 allows the superior court to alter an arbitrator\u2019s decision only for \u2018plain mistake,\u2019 or to vacate it for \u2018fraud, corruption, or misconduct\u2019 \u201d). Accordingly, in addition to being a non-precedential, unpublished decision, <em>Lebanon, Hangar Associates </em>is distinguishable on the basis of its procedural posture and the deferential standard of review we applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">In any event, we do not find <em>Reid </em>incompatible with our subsequent case law. In <em>Reid, </em>we \u201clook[ed] to the plain meaning of RSA 72:23, I,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and conclude[d] that in order for leaseholds for a term of years to be taxable under RSA 72:23, the lease agreement with the town must include a provision for the payment of property taxes.\u201d <em>Reid, </em>143 N.H. at 252. We determined that the leaseholds at issue were not taxable because \u201cthe leases d[id] not include the tax provision required by RSA 72:23, I.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u201c[C]aution[ing] against imputing too much weight to comments of proponents of bills offered in legislative committee hearings,\u201d we \u201creject[ed] the town\u2019s argument that <em>committee notes </em>of comments made by the bill\u2019s proponents regarding a 1979 amendment to the statute demonstrate that RSA 72:23 requires lessees of public property to be taxed on their leasehold interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) (quotation omitted); <em>cf. Rochester II, </em>151 N.H. at 266-67 (interpreting the plain language of RSA 72:23, I(b)). To the extent that language could be read as being inconsistent with our treatment of RSA 72:23 in <em>Rochester I, Rochester II, </em>and <em>Verizon New England, </em>we note that the <em>Reid </em>language is dicta. We concluded the discussion of that argument by stating: \u201cBecause the issue is not before us, however, we express no opinion as to the validity of leases that do not include a provision providing for the payment of properly assessed taxes as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>required by the enforcement provision of RSA 72:23, I(b).\u201d <em>Reid, </em>143 N.H. at 253. Here, the LOA contained a provision \u2014 paragraph 3D \u2014 that required Signal to pay all lawfully levied or assessed taxes. Thus <em>Reid </em>is inapposite to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">As noted previously, a contract that purports to exempt taxable land from taxation \u201cwould be illegal and void.\u201d <em>Piper, </em>83 N.H. at 113. We therefore decline to construe paragraph 3M(2) to require the City to not tax Signal on the leased premises and, accordingly, we reject Signal\u2019s second claim of error. We are aware of a line of cases indicating that a municipality could contract to reimburse its lessee for taxes paid. <em>See Hampton v. Hampton Beach Improvement, Co., </em>107 N.H. 89, 99 (1966) (stating that while \u201c[t]he town could not lawfully exempt [leased] real estate from taxation . . . [it] could validly contract with the lessee to pay any taxes as a consideration for the lessee\u2019s undertakings in the lease\u201d); <em>Hampton etc. Co. v. Hampton, </em>77 N.H. 373, 374 (1914) (same); <em>cf. Town of Ossipee v. Whittier Lifts Trust, </em>149 N.H. 679, 686 (2003) (concluding that license for use of state-owned communications tower provided \u201cthat the State would reimburse Whittier Communications for any taxes it pays relating to its use of the tower\u201d). As the LOA here contains no such provision, however, that line of cases is also inapposite. Moreover, we express no opinion as to whether the City could include such a provision in airport leases subject to its FAA assurances.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Signal next challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling that Signal could not proceed on its claims that it has been treated differently with respect to the amount of taxable land attributed to it as compared to the amounts attributed to Magic Bird, Lebanon Hangar, and the tenants at the airport\u2019s Airport Terminal. The court ruled that Signal had not raised these claims in its original pleadings and could not raise them for the first time on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Pleadings are construed liberally in this jurisdiction. <em>See Robbins v. Seekamp, </em>122 N.H. 318, 322 (1982). \u201cPleadings ought to be simple, concise and indicate the theory on which the plaintiff is proceeding so that the opposing party can adequately defend.\u201d <em>Morency v. Plourde, </em>96 N.H. 344, 345-46 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">We conclude that the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the City on Signal\u2019s claims related to the Airport Terminal tenants, Magic Bird, and Lebanon Hangar because we agree with the City that \u201cSignal never alleged a breach with respect to the amount of taxable land attributed to any tenants except in relation to those at the Executive Ramp.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Signal\u2019s writ alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">30. Signal is obligated to pay taxes on a large portion of the airport property, even though a significant portion of the taxed lot is undeveloped or open for public use and access.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">31. The method used by the City to attribute taxable land to tenants at the <em>Executive Ramp </em>leaves a significant portion of the land comprising the <em>Executive Ramp </em>untaxed and amounts to different terms and conditions <em>for tenants there </em>as opposed to the terms and condition^] under which Signal operates at the Airport, as well as providing the City with a competitive advantage over Signal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">(Emphases added.) There appears to be no dispute that the Airport Terminal tenants, Magic Bird, and Lebanon Hangar are not tenants at the Executive Ramp. The deposition testimony of Signal\u2019s prior vice president and chief operating officer indicates that the Airport Terminal is at the West Ramp and that Lebanon Hangar is located at the South Ramp. Magic Bird\u2019s location is not evident in the record, but Signal\u2019s answers to interrogatories state that the City began leasing space at its newly-constructed Executive Ramp in 2008 \u2014 two years after Signal alleges that the City taxed Magic Bird\u2019s leased land at zero dollars. Accordingly, there appears to be no genuine dispute of material fact as to the location of each of these tenants outside the Executive Ramp. Because Signal\u2019s allegations regarding disparate attribution of taxable land apply only to tenants at the Executive Ramp, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the City on Signal\u2019s claims as to the Airport Terminal tenants, Magic Bird, and Lebanon Hangar.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Signal nevertheless argues that the trial court construed Signal\u2019s claims too narrowly and failed to incorporate prior allegations into its contract claim. Signal contends that its factual allegations were \u201cjust specific enough to support each underlying claim\u201d and that it purposefully \u201creferred to tenants in a general context\u201d so as \u201cto be inclusive of all tenants providing commercial aeronautical services and the City itself.\u201d Thus, Signal\u2019s breach of contract claim alleged that \u201c[t]he City has materially breached its obligations under the [LOA] by providing more favorable and disproportionate tax assessments and taxation schemes under agreements with other entities at the Airport providing commercial aeronautical services there.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Signal argues that the tenants at the Airport Terminal, as well as Magic Bird and Lebanon Hangar, \u201cfit the defined class of \u2018other entities at the Airport providing commercial aeronautical services there.\u2019 \u201d It contends that its argument is stronger with respect to Magic Bird and Lebanon Hangar because more specific allegations concerning them were incorporated by reference into its contract claim. Signal argues that the trial court erred by \u201cunfairly and inappropriately . . . associating] those allegations with individual tax claims dismissed earlier by the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Signal\u2019s writ alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">22. . . . Magic Bird . . . was <em>assessed </em>$0 (zero dollars) for the land upon which its improvements were constructed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">23.. . . Lebanon [Hangar] . . . was <em>assessed </em>at $283,000 for the 4.6 acres of leased land upon which its improvements were constructed (approximately $61,000/acre).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA4B\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"41\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAKUAAAApAQAAAAB8ItTUAAAARElEQVR4nGP8z4AJfjJhEWRgGBUd0aInYOgJsugeGLqH1wSG/////z8OQ4//////////Hwz//////x6GvkNFGUdcmgQAaR8zV8Seu8IAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"166\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">26. The leased land for each of [Signal\u2019s, Magic Bird\u2019s, and Lebanon Hangar\u2019s] described parcels is similar in location, available and permitted use, and airport access, and should all be <em>assessed </em>at relatively the same value per acre.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">(Emphases added.) We agree with the City and the trial court that these allegations relate to Signal\u2019s claim, which we held to be \u201cunavailing,\u201d <em>Signal Aviation Servs., </em>164 N.H. at 583, that it \u201cwas being <em>disproportionately assessed </em>as compared to other entities operating and leasing land at the Airport.\u201d We find no indication in the above allegations, or in any others in Signal\u2019s writ, that Signal claimed disproportionate attribution of taxable land to it as compared with such attributions to Magic Bird and Lebanon Hangar.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">Furthermore, although pleadings are liberally construed in this jurisdiction, <em>Robbins, </em>122 N.H. at 322, \u201c[t]he defendant is entitled to be informed of the theory on which the plaintiffs are proceeding.\u201d <em>Morency, </em>96 N.H. at 346. We cannot conclude that a claim alleging \u201cmore favorable and disproportionate tax assessments and taxation schemes under agreements with other entities at the Airport providing commercial aeronautical services there\u201d adequately informed the City that Signal sought to proceed on a theory of disproportionate attribution of taxable land with respect to the Airport Terminal tenants, Magic Bird, and Lebanon Hangar. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the City on these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">Signal next challenges the trial court\u2019s conclusion that all tenants at the airport, including the Airport Terminal tenants, Magic Bird, and Lebanon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Hangar, are, like Signal, \u201ctaxed for the entire amount of land or space that each such tenant leases.\u201d This conclusion was an alternative ground for granting summary judgment to the City \u201ceven if Signal could now present its unequal treatment claims concerning [Lebanon Hangar], Magic Bird, and the Airport Terminal tenants at this late date.\u201d Because we have affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling that Signal could not first raise these claims at the summary judgment stage, we decline to address the court\u2019s alternative ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\">We now turn to the City\u2019s cross-appeal. The trial court rejected the City\u2019s argument that paragraph 3M(2) of the LOA \u201capplies only to the <em>\u2018operating </em>terms and conditions at the airport\u2019 and not \u2018to the subject of taxes.\u2019 \u201d Noting that the provision contains no \u201climiting or qualifying language\u201d that would restrict its scope, the court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-4\">[T]he plain and unambiguous language of the provision applies generally to all rates, terms and conditions, including the subject of real estate taxation. This interpretation is consistent with the purpose of the provision, which is to ensure that Signal may operate on a level playing field with respect to any competing \u201coperators.\u201d The extent of Signal\u2019s tax burden directly affects the topography of Signal\u2019s playing field vis-a-vis any other \u201coperators of aeronautical endeavors or activities\u201d at the Airport.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">We agree with the trial court that inclusion of taxation is consistent with paragraph 3M\u2019s purpose to assure Signal a level playing field with respect to other operators of aeronautical endeavors or activities at the airport. The City argues, however, that \u201cthe trial court overlooked the very nature and purpose of that paragraph within its context, particularly when paragraph 3D specifically addresses taxes consistent with State law.\u201d It first asserts that paragraph 3M is \u201cgoverned and defined\u201d by the Airport Rules \u201cregarding <em>how, and in what manner, </em>commercial operations at the Airport can be performed.\u201d It again contends that the Airport Rules \u201care the source of definitions for the terms found in the paragraph and [are] clearly incorporated by reference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">We have expressed reservation as to whether the LOA incorporates the definitions contained in the Airport Rules. In any event, the City\u2019s argument is based not upon what is contained in the Airport Rules, but rather, what is not. The City notes that the topic of taxation is never mentioned in the Airport Rules. \u201cThe scope, nature and purpose of the Rules evince no intent to address that subject, which is not surprising,\u201d the City argues, because the rules grant the \u201cauthority to manage the Airport and all operations therein and thereon\u201d to the Airport Manager, who \u201cwould have no authority to adjust, negotiate, waive, assess or enforce taxes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>with respect to any tenancy at the Airport.\u201d The latter authority, the City asserts, lies with the board of assessors. The City then contends that paragraph 3M should be interpreted in light of this legal framework, in which taxes are dealt with under a statutory scheme wholly separate from the regulation of aeronautical operations at the airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Failure to keep these regulatory domains separate, the City argues, \u201ccreates a conflicting scheme between tax and contract laws that could generate many inequities between tenants at the Airport and elsewhere.\u201d For example, the City argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">[If paragraph 3M] applies to taxes, at what point is one tenant\u2019s real estate tax a \u201crate, term or condition\u201d that is more favorable than another\u2019s? . . . Well-settled tax law provides a remedy for disproportionate taxation when one taxpayer\u2019s assessment is compared to the general level of assessment in the entire community. However, if paragraph 3M(2) is inclusive of taxes, one taxpayer\u2019s assessment could be compared unfavorably to just one other tenant at the Airport and allegations of breach could be leveled, and then the appropriate remedy could come into conflict with State law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">(Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">We perceive no such conflict. Paragraph 3M(2) provides that no \u201cother operator of aeronautical endeavors or activities will ... be permitted to operate on the Airport under rates, terms [or] conditions which are more favorable <em>than those set forth in\u201d </em>the LOA. (Emphasis added.) No tax \u201crate\u201d is set forth in the LOA. The only \u201cterm[ ]\u201d or \u201ccondition[ ]\u201d in the LOA that deals with taxation is paragraph 3D, which requires Signal to \u201cmeet all expenses and payments in connection with the use of the Premises and the rights and privileges herein granted, including <em>taxes, </em>permit fees, license fees and assessments lawfully <em>levied or assessed </em>upon the Premises or property at any time situated therein and thereon.\u201d (Emphases added.) Thus, with respect to taxation, paragraph 3M(2) merely obligates the City to require all other operators to pay all lawfully levied or assessed taxes. We note that the City itself asserts that \u201cState tax laws ... require municipalities to assess all taxpayers (whether a tenant or not) equitably and to treat all similarly situated taxpayers in a similar manner.\u201d Accordingly, we are not persuaded to adopt the City\u2019s interpretation of paragraph 3M(2) with respect to taxation and accordingly we deny its cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\"> Nevertheless, although we deny the City\u2019s cross-appeal, our analysis of the City\u2019s arguments, taken to its logical conclusion, also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>disposes of Signal\u2019s appeal. We have concluded that paragraph 3M(2), so far as it concerns taxation, merely obligates the City to require all other operators to pay all lawfully levied or assessed taxes. Because we have assumed, without deciding, that the City is an \u201coperator of aeronautical endeavors or activities\u201d under paragraph 3M(2), we read that paragraph to require the City, as lessor, to ensure that it, as an \u201cother operator,\u201d also pays all lawfully levied or assessed taxes. As noted above, however, City-owned property is statutorily exempt from taxation and, thus, no property taxes are \u201clawfully levied or assessed\u201d against the City. Thus, the City\u2019s nonpayment of taxes does not violate paragraph 3M(2). Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the City. <em>See State v. Cook, </em>158 N.H. 708, 713 (2009) (noting that \u201c[w]e will not reverse a trial court decision when it reaches the correct result and valid alternative grounds exist to reach that result\u201d (ellipsis omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b221-5\">Dalianis, C.J., and Conboy and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-8\"> The City notes that the Airport Rules themselves provide that \u201c[t]hese Minimum Standards shall be appended to and considered part of all present and future Lease/operating agreements with the City at the Airport.\u201d Nevertheless, the Minimum Standards portion of the Airport Rules does not itself contain the definitions of terms and the City has not directed us to a factual finding that the Minimum Standards were appended to the LOA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b215-7\"> We noted in <em>Reid </em>that RSA 72:23, I, had been amended several times during the period in which \u201cthe petitioners\u2019 individual leases were signed\u201d and that, therefore, \u201cdifferent versions of the statute appl[ied].\u201d <em>Reid, </em>143 N.H. at 250.
