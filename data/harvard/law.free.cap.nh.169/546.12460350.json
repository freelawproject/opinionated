He argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that he knowingly endangered the child\u2019s welfare by purposely violating a duty of care he owed to the child. <em>See id. </em>We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">Viewing the evidence presented at the adjudicatory delinquency hearing in the light most favorable to the State, <em>see In re D.B., </em>164 N.H. 46, 48 (2012), the trial court could find the following facts. The juvenile\u2019s mother works the overnight shift as a nurse\u2019s aide, and regularly leaves the juvenile in charge of his younger brother while she is at work. The juvenile\u2019s mother testified that the younger brother \u201csleeps very well at night, so he usually doesn\u2019t wake up\u201d while she is gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-12\">At approximately 10:45 p.m. on February 20, 2016, the juvenile\u2019s mother left the juvenile, then sixteen years old, and the juvenile\u2019s brother, then four years old, alone at the family\u2019s apartment in Nashua. She testified that, when walking to her vehicle, she observed a car containing \u201ca few ... young teenagers\u201d pull into the area. She then went back inside the apartment to tell the juvenile that he was not to have anyone in the house while she was gone. She told him that if there were people in the house when she came home, she would have them arrested. She then went to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-13\">A few hours later, the juvenile\u2019s mother came back to the apartment to check on the juvenile and his brother. According to her testimony, when she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>returned home, she observed several \u201cyoung teenagers\u201d swiftly exiting the apartment. When she went inside, the residence was \u201cfull of smoke\u201d and \u201csmell[ed] like marijuana,\u201d and there were empty beer cans in the living room. She believed that the juvenile was \u201cdrunk and probably high.\u201d Concerned for the safety of her younger son, she went to check on him. The child was still asleep in the bedroom \u2014 next to the living room \u2014 where she had left him before leaving for work.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Consistent with her earlier warning, the juvenile\u2019s mother called the police. Officers Fitzpatrick and Reinold of the Nashua Police Department responded to the call. When they arrived at the family\u2019s apartment, the juvenile\u2019s mother invited the officers inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">According to Fitzpatrick\u2019s testimony, upon entering, he observed that the apartment, which is approximately 600 square feet in size, \u201cwas very densely littered with the smell of freshly burnt marijuana and alcoholic beverages.\u201d Reinold testified that he noticed that the burnt marijuana smell was \u201cquite strong\u201d and that it permeated the apartment. In the kitchen, the officers observed that the floor was sticky and wet with what appeared to be beer. They also observed beer cans in the sink, on the kitchen countertops, on the floor, and in the living room. Fitzpatrick testified that ashes were \u201clittered throughout the countertops, the rug flooring of the apartment, the kitchen area, the kitchen sink area, [and] the kitchen linoleum flooring.\u201d He observed an empty pack of cigarettes, and \u201ctwo clear glassine baggies that had the distinct smell of unburnt marijuana.\u201d He also observed two empty packs of cigars and some loose tobacco. Based on his training and experience, Fitzpatrick believed that the teenagers had hollowed out the cigars and used the wrappers to smoke marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Fitzpatrick then asked the juvenile\u2019s mother whether there was any other indication that the juvenile had hosted an underage drinking party. She directed his attention to a closet, which contained an empty 80-pack of beer, an empty bottle of pineapple vodka, and an unlabeled prescription bottle containing tinfoil. When he opened the prescription bottle, Fitzpatrick was \u201coverwhelmed with the smell of marijuana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">The officers attempted to speak with the juvenile, who was seated on the couch in the living room. Based on the juvenile\u2019s appearance and behavior, both officers believed that the juvenile was under the influence of alcohol and marijuana. According to Reinold, the juvenile had \u201c[mjumbling, slurring speech.\u201d Fitzpatrick testified that the juvenile\u2019s \u201cposture was kind of slouched down\u201d and that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t really lift his head ... towards [the officers] to speak with [them].\u201d According to the officers\u2019 testimony, the juvenile\u2019s eyes were \u201cred, glassy,\u201d \u201cdroopy,\u201d and bloodshot. The officers asked the juvenile if he could look up at them, and, according to Fitzpatrick, the juvenile \u201cwasn\u2019t able to do [so].\u201d Additionally, Reinold testified that, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>response to the officers\u2019 questions, the juvenile \u201cmostly just kept saying \u2018no, no, no.\u2019 \u201d (Internal quotation marks added.) However, at one point, the juvenile said, \u201c \u2018I don\u2019t know how any of this stuff got here, no idea.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Reinold then spoke with the juvenile\u2019s mother in the bedroom. He observed that the child was asleep in the bed. Although there were no beer cans or any other illegal substances visible within the bedroom, Reinold observed that the bedroom \u201csmell[ed] of marijuana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">The juvenile\u2019s mother informed Reinold that the juvenile had been in charge of caring for the child. Because of the juvenile\u2019s impairment, neither of the officers would have left the juvenile alone at the apartment. Additionally, neither officer believed that the juvenile was capable of caring for another person in his current state. Accordingly, Reinold placed the juvenile under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The juvenile was charged with endangering the welfare of his younger brother in violation of RSA 639:3, I. The delinquency petition alleged that he \u201cdid knowingly endanger the welfare of [his brother], a child under the age of eighteen, by purposely violating a duty of care which he owed to him in that he smoked marijuana and consumed alcohol and said defendant being his brother having custody of the child at the time.\u201d The trial court held an adjudicatory delinquency hearing on April 11, 2016, at which the juvenile\u2019s mother, Fitzpatrick, and Reinold testified. After the hearing, the juvenile moved to dismiss the petition based on insufficiency of the evidence. The trial court denied the motion and found the juvenile delinquent. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">On appeal, the juvenile argues that the evidence at the hearing was insufficient to prove: (1) that he violated a duty of care owed to his brother; and (2) that he endangered his brother\u2019s welfare. \u201cA challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence raises a claim of legal error; therefore, our standard of review is <em>de novo.\" State v. Collyns, </em>166 N.H. 514, 517 (2014). \u201cIn challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, the juvenile must prove that no rational trier of fact, viewing all of the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it in the light most favorable to the State, could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>In re D.B., </em>164 N.H. at 48 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">Pursuant to RSA 639:3, I, a person is guilty of endangering the welfare of a child if he \u201cknowingly endangers the welfare of a child under 18 years of age ... by purposely violating a duty of care, protection or support he owes to such child.\u201d RSA 639:3, I. Thus, in the instant case, the State was required to prove: (1) that the juvenile knowingly endangered the welfare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>of his brother; and (2) that he did so by purposely violating a duty of care owed to him. <em>See id.; see also State v. Bortner, </em>150 N.H. 504, 511 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The juvenile concedes that he owed his brother a duty of care. However, according to the juvenile, his duty of care required only that he keep his brother safe, and \u201c[tjhere is no evidence that [he] failed to fulfill this duty.\u201d He contends that \u201cthe State failed to prove that [his] judgment, though arguably compromised by intoxication, was not up to the challenge of protecting [his brother].\u201d Because the State does not argue otherwise, we assume, without deciding, that where, as here, impairment forms the sole basis of the alleged violation of duty, RSA 639:3, I, requires the State to prove that the person charged was not capable of caring for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Considering the evidence presented at the hearing in the light most favorable to the State, we conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the juvenile violated the duty of care owed to his brother. Contrary to the juvenile\u2019s contention, there was direct evidence of his impairment introduced at the adjudicatory delinquency hearing, and this evidence was sufficient to establish that his impairment rendered him incapable of caring for his brother. According to the testimony of Fitzpatrick and Reinold, the juvenile was under the influence of alcohol and marijuana. He had \u201c[m]umbling, slurring speech,\u201d and his eyes were \u201cred, glassy,\u201d \u201cdroopy,\u201d and bloodshot. Additionally, when the officers tried to speak with him, he was unable to look up at them from where he was seated on the couch. According to the officers, the juvenile was not capable of caring for another person in his then current state. Indeed, as suggested by the officers\u2019 testimony that they would not have left the juvenile alone in the apartment, the trial court could have found that he was not even in a position to care for himself. We therefore conclude, on the facts of this case, that the evidence of the juvenile\u2019s intoxication was sufficient to prove that he violated the duty of care owed to his brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The juvenile next argues that the evidence was \u201cinsufficient to prove that [he] knowingly placed [his brother] in danger.\u201d Specifically, he contends that the State failed to present evidence \u201cthat [his] conduct, or [his] resulting condition, exposed [his brother] to any harm.\u201d He asserts that RSA 639:3,1, requires that the child be placed in actual risk of danger, and that the risk of danger to his brother in the instant case was merely \u201cspeculative and hypothetical.\u201d He claims that \u201c[i]t is not sufficient [for the State] to prove a possibility of danger if some hypothetical circumstance arose.\u201d In response, the State appears to contend that a child is \u201cendanger[ed]\u201d under RSA 639:3, I, whenever the child is subjected to potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>harm, and that, here, the juvenile subjected his brother to potential harm when he rendered himself incapable of caring for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. Dichiara v. Sanborn Reg'l Sch. Dist., </em>165 N.H. 694, 696 (2013). \u201cIn matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiters of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole.\u201d <em>State v. Gilley, </em>168 N.H. 188, 189 (2015). \u201cWe construe provisions of the Criminal Code according to the fair import of their terms and to promote justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u2018We first look to the language of the statute itself, and, if possible, construe that language according to its plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cFurther, we interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said, or add language that it did not see fit to include.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189-90. \u201c[W]e interpret a statute in the context of the overall statutory scheme and not in isolation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190. \u201cWe will not interpret a statute to require an illogical result.\u201d <em>State v. Yates, </em>152 N.H. 245, 255 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">As noted above, to secure a conviction under RSA 639:3, I, the State must prove, among other things, that the offender \u201cknowingly endanger[ed] the welfare of a child under 18 years of age.\u201d RSA 639:3, I. The statute does not define the term \u201cendanger\u201d and we have not previously interpreted the meaning of the term under the statute. However, the term \u201cendanger\u201d commonly means \u201cto bring into danger or peril of probable harm or loss: imperil or threaten danger to.\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW International Dictionary 748 (unabridged ed. 2002); <em>see Gilley, </em>168 N.H. at 190 (explaining that where a term is undefined by statute, \u201cwe look to its common usage, using the dictionary for guidance\u201d). This definition suggests that a child is \u201cendangered\u201d under RSA 639:3,1, when the risk of injury to his or her welfare is actual and significant \u2014 as opposed to speculative or a mere possibility. <em>See </em>WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY, <em>supra </em>at 748; <em>see also State v. Rodney Portigue, </em>125 N.H. 352, 359, 367 (1984) (evidence sufficient to support conviction under RSA 639:3, I, when testimony at trial established that defendant failed to promptly remove child from home and seek medical attention for child after child sustained significant injuries from repetitive physical abuse at hands of defendant\u2019s wife). We thus conclude that, under RSA 639:3,1, evidence is sufficient to prove \u201cendangerment\u201d if it establishes that the offender engaged in behavior creating an actual and significant risk of injury to a child\u2019s welfare. Accordingly, the evidence presented at the adjudicatory delinquency hearing will have been sufficient if the juvenile\u2019s behavior in the instant case created an actual and significant risk of injury to his brother\u2019s welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The delinquency petition alleged that the juvenile endangered his brother by \u201csmok[ing] marijuana and consuming] alcohol.\u201d We have not previously considered whether caregiver intoxication or impairment creates an actual and significant risk of injury to a child\u2019s welfare. In assessing the nature and significance of the risk to a child in these and similar circumstances, courts in other jurisdictions have engaged in a fact-specific inquiry, considering the totality of the surrounding circumstances present in a given case. <em>See, e.g., Barnes v. Com., </em>622 S.E.2d 278, 282 (Va. Ct. App. 2005) (noting that analysis of sufficiency of evidence supporting child endangerment conviction depends upon specific circumstances of the case); <em>cf. State Dept. of Human Servs. v. D.T.C., </em>219 P.3d 610, 616 (Or. Ct. App. 2009) (considering totality of circumstances in assessing whether there was a reasonable likelihood of harm to the welfare of the children). We, accordingly, consider the totality of the circumstances in assessing whether the juvenile\u2019s behavior created an actual and significant risk of injury to his brother\u2019s welfare. Looking to <em>Barnes </em>for guidance, we conclude that, among the factors to be considered are: (1) the \u201cgravity and character\u201d of the risk; (2) the \u201cdegree of accessibility\u201d of the offender; (3) the length of time that the child was exposed to the risk; (4) the child\u2019s \u201cage and maturity\u201d; and (5) the \u201cprotective measures\u201d taken by the offender, if any. <em>Barnes, </em>622 S.E.2d at 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Considering these factors together, and considering the evidence presented at the hearing in the light most favorable to the State, we conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the juvenile \u201cendangerfed]\u201d his brother\u2019s welfare. RSA 639:3,1. Here, the child was only four years old, and the juvenile was effectively inaccessible. <em>See Barnes, </em>622 S.E.2d at 282. As discussed above, a rational trier of fact could have found that the extent of the juvenile\u2019s impairment rendered him incapable of caring for his brother. By rendering himself incapable of providing care, the juvenile \u2014 then, the child\u2019s sole caregiver \u2014 effectively abandoned the child. Courts in other jurisdictions have found the abandonment of a child of this young age sufficient to support a conviction for child endangerment. <em>See, e.g., Barnes, </em>622 S.E.2d at 280-81 (evidence sufficient to support conviction for child endangerment where defendant left two-year-old and four-year-old alone and asleep in apartment while she went to grocery store); <em>People v. Reyes, </em>No. 2008KN019196, 2008 WL 3010044, at *2-3 (N.Y. Crim. Ct. Aug. 6, 2008) (unpublished table decision) (finding endangering the welfare of a child complaint facially sufficient where it alleged that defendant left four-year-old child alone in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>apartment for fifteen minutes). There is also no indication that the juvenile took any \u201cprotective measures\u201d in the instant case. <em>Barnes, </em>622 S.E.2d at 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Additionally, we disagree with the juvenile\u2019s contention that the risk of danger in the instant case was merely \u201cspeculative and hypothetical.\u201d Although the juvenile\u2019s brother <em>generally </em>slept through the night, there still existed a risk that he would awaken and move about the apartment. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 281 (recognizing risk that two-year-old and four-year-old would awaken and exit unlocked door to apartment). If the child had done so, he would have been subjected to the unsafe and unsanitary conditions in the apartment. The apartment smelled of marijuana, the kitchen floor was sticky and wet with beer, and there were beer cans and ashes scattered throughout the kitchen and living room. The juvenile\u2019s brother could easily have been harmed by either ingesting the alcohol readily within reach, or slipping on the floor slick with beer and littered with ashes and beer cans. <em>Cf. People v. Perez, </em>No. 2008NY046914, 2009 WL 57599, at *4 (N.Y. Crim. Ct. Jan. 12, 2009) (unpublished table decision) (\u201cIn this case, the risk of an accident causing harm to the children was significant given the hazards present in the apartment: urine on the floor, bleach bottles in the tub, and cockroaches crawling on the children.\u201d); <em>State v. Graham, </em>109 P.3d 285, 291 (N.M. 2005) (jury could reasonably conclude that three-year-old child and a one-year-old child were endangered where they had access to marijuana). Although the record does not reflect the precise length of time that the child was exposed to this risk, we cannot conclude on the record before us that the length of the exposure was so minimal as to eliminate the risk. Ultimately, we conclude that \u2014 on the facts present here, including the young age of the child and the extent of the juvenile\u2019s intoxication \u2014 a rational trier of fact could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the juvenile\u2019s behavior created a risk to his brother\u2019s welfare that was both actual and significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Relying on our decision in <em>Bortner, </em>the juvenile also argues that \u201ca violation of the duty of care only endangers the welfare of a child if and when it exposes the child to a risk of death or serious injury.\u201d In <em>Bortner, </em>the defendant argued that the child endangerment statute was unconstitutionally vague because RSA 639:3,1, \u201cincorporates the two irreconcilable <em>mens rea, </em>of knowingly and purposely.\u201d <em>Bortner, </em>150 N.H. at 511. We disagreed, concluding that \u201cthere are numerous ways in which a person can purposely fail to act without knowing it will endanger the welfare of a child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To demonstrate that the two separate <em>mens rea </em>of knowingly and purposely were not necessarily incompatible, we provided the following example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>[A] parent who fails to seek medical attention for a child who sprains a finger may have purposely violated a duty of care that the parent owes to the child. But, since a sprained finger is unlikely to cause death or serious injury, it is possible that the parent did not knowingly endanger the welfare of the child. On the other hand, a parent who fails to promptly seek medical attention for a child who stops breathing may have purposely violated a duty of care. In addition, the parent may have knowingly endangered the welfare of the child due to the high risk of death or serious injury that is likely to result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The juvenile interprets this language from <em>Bortner </em>as requiring the State to prove that the child was exposed to a risk of death or serious injury to satisfy the endangerment requirement of RSA 639:3, I. We disagree with this interpretation. We used this example in <em>Bortner </em>to demonstrate that knowingly and purposely were not necessarily incompatible \u2014 not to explain the severity of the danger required by the statute. <em>Id. </em>Our example related, not to the meaning of \u201cendanger,\u201d but to the <em>mens rea </em>attached to the \u201cendangers the welfare of a child\u201d element of the statute. Here, the juvenile\u2019s argument relates to the meaning of \u201cendanger\u201d \u2014 not to the <em>mens rea. </em>of knowingly. Thus, <em>Bortner </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">In sum, viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the State, we hold that the record contains sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to have concluded that the juvenile \u201cknowingly endangered] the welfare of a child under 18 years of age ... by purposely violating a duty of care, protection or support he owe[d] to such child.\u201d RSA 639:3, I.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b598-9\">Dalianis, C.J., and Conboy, Lynn, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
