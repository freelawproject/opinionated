On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred by ruling that this violation-level offense does not require the <em>mens rea </em>of \u201cknowingly.\u201d Because we agree, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The relevant facts follow. The defendant was originally charged with both a misdemeanor and a violation-level offense for driving his motor vehicle after his privilege to do so had been suspended. The misdemeanor offense alleged that the defendant drove after his motor vehicle registration had been suspended; the violation-level offense alleged that he drove after his driver\u2019s license had been suspended. At trial, defense counsel urged the trial court to \u201center a finding of not guilty\u201d as to both the misdemeanor and violation-level offenses because, when the defendant was arrested for driving with a suspended license and registration, he was unaware that they had been suspended, and because \u201che had a license that on its face appeared valid and the same for the registration.\u201d For its part, the State argued that the defendant testified that he \u201clives at the address to which the notice\u201d of license suspension \u201cwas sent,\u201d and that \u201chis testimony was conflicting as to what he does and does not recall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The trial court ruled as follows at the close of evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">Sir, you\u2019re charged with operating on a suspended registration, that is a Class B misdemeanor. The State has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you drove or permitted to be driven a certain motor vehicle in the State of New Hampshire after knowing that your registration had been suspended by the director of motor vehicles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-9\">This is a misdemeanor level offense and it carries with it the <em>mens </em>rea. of knowingly. I\u2019ve heard testimony here today that you don\u2019t recall whether or not you received a notice from the police officer at the time of your accident that your registration would be suspended and your license would be suspended if you failed to comply with the insurance provisions and in essence guarantee that you would make good on any damages from the accident that you were at fault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-10\">You\u2019ve testified that you\u2019ve had problems getting the mail where you were living at the time and you don\u2019t recall ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>receiving a notice from DMV that you had, in fact, had your license suspended for failure to comply with the insurance requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-3\">Since there\u2019s a <em>mens rea </em>of knowingly on this offense, I\u2019m going to enter a finding of not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-4\">You also have a violation level offense of operating after suspension. That is a violation level offense[;] it does not require a <em>mens rea </em>of knowingly. What the State must prove is that your license was suspended and that you were operating a motor vehicle while your license was suspended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">I\u2019m going to enter a finding of guilty to that one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The trial court imposed a $250 fine and a $60 penalty assessment. <em>See </em>RSA 263:64, VII. This appeal followed. The trial court subsequently granted the defendant\u2019s motion to stay payment of the fine pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred when it ruled that the violation-level offense of which the defendant was found guilty does not require a <em>mens rea </em>of \u201cknowingly.\u201d Before addressing the merits of this issue, we note that the State contends that it is not preserved for our review. We assume without deciding that the State is correct. Nonetheless, we elect to address the issue on appeal because preservation is a limitation upon the parties to an appeal, not upon the reviewing court, and because the appeal issue constitutes a discrete question of statutory interpretation, requiring no further factual development. <em>See Camire v. Gunstock Area Comm\u2019n, </em>166 N.H. 374, 377 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">We review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretation <em>de novo. State v. Mayo, </em>167 N.H. 443, 450 (2015). We first examine statutory language, and, where possible, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to the words used. <em>State v. Maxfield, </em>167 N.H. 677, 679 (2015). We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add language that the legislature did not see fit to include. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">RSA 263:64 sets forth misdemeanors and violation-level offenses for the same conduct \u2014 driving \u201cwhile the person\u2019s driver\u2019s license or privilege to drive is suspended or revoked.\u201d RSA 263:64,1. Under RSA 263:64, whether an offense constitutes a misdemeanor or violation depends upon \u201cthe reason for the suspension or revocation.\u201d <em>State v. Curran, </em>140 N.H. 530, 531 (1995); <em>see </em>RSA 263:64, IV, V-a(b), VI (describing misdemeanor offenses), VII (providing that \u201c[e]xcept as provided in paragraphs IV, V-a, and VI, any person who violates\u201d RSA 263:64 \u201cshall be guilty of a violation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>The very structure of RSA 268:64 indicates that the legislature did not intend that only the misdemeanors set forth therein include a <em>mens rea </em>requirement. All offenses in RSA 268:64, including violation-level offenses, penalize the same conduct \u2014 driving \u201cwhile the person\u2019s driver\u2019s license or privilege to drive is suspended or revoked.\u201d RSA 268:64, I. Moreover, in the trial of <em>any </em>offense under RSA 268:64, including violation-level offenses, \u201c[e]vidence that the notice of suspension or revocation was sent to the person\u2019s last known address as shown on the records of the division shall be prima facie evidence that the person was notified of the suspension or revocation.\u201d RSA 268:64, II.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">In discerning whether the legislature intended there to be a <em>mens rea </em>of \u201cknowingly\u201d for the violation-level offenses set forth in RSA 268:64, we find our decision in <em>Curran </em>to be instructive. The issue in that case was whether the legislature intended there to be a <em>mens rea- </em>of \u201cknowingly\u201d for the misdemeanor set forth in RSA 268:64, IV. <em>Curran, </em>140 N.H. at 530-31. Based upon \u201cthe language and legislative history of RSA 268:64, combined with the <em>mens rea </em>requirement of RSA 626:2, I,\u201d we concluded that the legislature so intended. <em>Id. </em>at 530-32; <em>see </em>RSA 626:2, I (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Contrary to the State\u2019s assertions, the legislative history that we consulted in <em>Curran </em>does not require that we reach a different conclusion in this case. Under a prior version of the statute, \u201cany violation of the statute constituted a misdemeanor.\u201d <em>Curran, </em>140 N.H. at 531. In 1989, the legislature reduced certain offenses to violation-level offenses to \u201cpreserve the indigent defense fund from the cost of providing attorneys to defendants who faced no apparent threat of a jail sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 532; <em>see </em>N.H.S. Jour. 438, 787 (1989). In <em>Curran, </em>we concluded that this legislative history \u201coffer[ed] no indication that the legislature intended to eliminate the <em>mens rea </em>requirement for those violations of RSA 268:64 that would remain . . . misdemeanor[s].\u201d <em>Curran, </em>140 N.H. at 532. But neither does that legislative history demonstrate that the legislature intended to modify the <em>mens rea </em>requirement for violation-level offenses. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">RSA 626:2, I, upon which the State also relies, does not require a different result. RSA 626:2,1, provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of murder, a felony, or a misdemeanor only if he acts purposely, knowingly, recklessly or negligently,\u201d but that a person \u201cmay be guilty of a violation without regard to such culpability.\u201d The plain meaning of RSA 626:2, I, is that the legislature need not require proof of a <em>mens rea </em>when it defines a violation-level offense. However, nothing in RSA 626:2, I, precludes the legislature from creating violation-level offenses that do require proof of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number><em>mens rea. </em>It is a general rule of statutory construction that the word \u201cmay\u201d is permissive. <em>State v. Korean Methodist Church of N.H., </em>157 N.H. 254, 256-57 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">In arguing for a contrary result, the State relies upon <em>Straut v. Carpenter, </em>92 N.H. 123 (1942). The issue in <em>Strand, </em>however, was whether a plaintiff could maintain a personal injury action for his injuries even though he failed to comply with the Financial Responsibility Act. <em>Straut, </em>92 N.H. at 124 (preface to opinion). <em>But see Fuller v. Sirois, </em>97 N.H. 100, 100-01 (1951) (explaining that <em>Strand </em>is no longer good law). The State also relies upon RSA 264:3, I (2014), which concerns the mandatory suspension of drivers\u2019 licenses and motor vehicle registrations. The State has failed to demonstrate that either <em>Strand </em>or RSA 264:3, I, are relevant to the issue on appeal \u2014 namely, whether the legislature intended violation-level offenses under RSA 263:64 to contain a <em>mens rea. </em>of \u201cknowingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">We need not address the State\u2019s remaining arguments because they rebut assertions of the defendant that we have not discussed. For all of the above reasons, therefore, we hold that the trial court erred when it concluded that the violation-level offense of which the defendant was found guilty does not require a <em>mens rea. </em>of \u201cknowingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b198-8\">Dalianis, C.J., and Hicks, Conboy, and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
