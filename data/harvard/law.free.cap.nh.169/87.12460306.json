Bach and the Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs, Inc. (ANJRPC), appeal a decision of the Superior Court <em>(Smukler, </em>J.) entering summary judgment in favor of the respondent, the New Hampshire Department of Safety (Department). The petitioners had challenged, as ultra vires and invalid, Department administrative rules that require nonresidents applying for a concealed-carry license in New Hampshire to provide proof of a \u201cresident state license\u201d to carry a concealed weapon. The trial court concluded that the administrative rules were valid. Because we conclude that the rules at issue are ultra vires, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>The following facts are undisputed. Bach, a New Jersey resident, does not possess a New Jersey license to carry a concealed weapon. From 2004 to 2013, he held a New Hampshire nonresident license to carry a concealed pistol or revolver. He did not apply to renew his license when it expired in 2018.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The ANJRPC is a nonprofit corporation in New Jersey. It states that it is comprised of \u201cmore than one million law-abiding firearms owners, target shooters, hunters, competitors, outdoors people, and those with an interest in supporting and defending the Second Amendment.\u201d (Quotation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In July 2013, new administrative rules became effective that \u201cset forth the procedures for nonresidents who wish to obtain a license to carry a [concealed] revolver or pistol in New Hampshire.\u201d N.H. Admin. Rules, Saf-C 2101.01. The rules require applications for a concealed-carry license to include the applicant\u2019s name, address, date of birth, physical description, occupation, whether he or she has ever been previously denied a pistol permit or license, and his or her resident state license number. N.H. Admin. Rules, Saf-C 2102.01-.02. \u201c[R]esident state license\u201d is defined as \u201ca license to carry a pistol or revolver concealed in the state where the applicant resides.\u201d N.H. Admin. Rules, Saf-C 2102.03(a) (quotation omitted). The rules further provide that \u201c[n]o nonresident license shall be issued unless the applicant provides a copy of the applicant\u2019s resident state license, or unless the applicant displays, for verification, a resident state license.\u201d N.H. Admin. Rules, Saf-C 2102.03(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">After an application is submitted, the State Police Permits and Licensing Unit conducts a background check to determine whether the nonresident applicant is \u201csuitable\u201d to be issued a license to carry a concealed weapon in New Hampshire. <em>See </em>RSA 159:6 (Supp. 2015) (providing that a concealed-carry license \u201cshall issue ... if it appears that the applicant . . . has any proper purpose, and that the applicant is a <em>suitable </em>person to be licensed\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>see also </em>RSA 159:4 (2014) (stating that \u201c[n]o person shall carry a loaded pistol or revolver ... concealed upon his person, except in his dwelling, house or place of business, without a valid license therefor as hereinafter provided\u201d). When conducting the background check, state officials, in addition to using certain national databases, rely upon records maintained at the state and local level, such as records pertaining to drug addiction, involuntary mental health commitments, and protection orders \u2014 any of which could lead to a denial of a concealed-carry license. <em>See </em>N.H. Admin. Rules, Saf-C 2103.01(b) (listing reasons to deny a concealed-carry license).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">In October 2013, the petitioners filed a petition for declaratory judgment. The petitioners argued that, because RSA 159:6 does not require nonresidents to produce proof of their resident state licenses to obtain concealed-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>carry licenses in New Hampshire, the administrative rules requiring this proof are invalid and unenforceable. The petitioners also raised various constitutional and statutory claims. The Department moved for summary judgment, arguing that the ANJRPC lacked standing, and that the petitioners\u2019 claims lacked merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The trial court granted the Department\u2019s motion, concluding that the ANJRPC lacked standing, and rejecting Bach\u2019s constitutional and statutory claims. The trial court explained that, although \u201cNew Hampshire residents and nonresidents generally have the right to carry a pistol or revolver on their person so long as it is not concealed,\u201d <em>see </em>RSA 159:4, there is neither a state nor federal constitutional right to carry a loaded concealed weapon, and, even assuming that such a right existed, the administrative rules at issue do not unreasonably infringe upon that right. The trial court also stated that the State \u201chas a compelling interest in protecting the public from certain dangers involved with pistols and revolvers,\u201d which was sufficient to justify the administrative rules at issue. The trial court observed that RSA 159:6 \u201ccontemplates access to information about an applicant because such information is necessary to determine whether the applicant is suitable,\u201d and agreed with the Department that the administrative rules at issue are a \u201creasonable aid in the New Hampshire determination of the suitability of nonresident applicants\u201d and \u201callow[ ] New Hampshire to ascertain the nonresident\u2019s ongoing eligibility\u201d for a concealed-carry license. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u201cIn reviewing the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, we consider the affidavits and other evidence, and all inferences properly drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Farrelly v. City of Concord, </em>168 N.H. 430, 448 (2015) (quotation omitted). \u201cIf our review of that evidence discloses no genuine issue of material fact, and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we will affirm the grant of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">On appeal, the petitioners argue that the trial court\u2019s decision should be reversed because: (1) the administrative rules at issue change the requirements of RSA 159:6 and are, therefore, ultra vires and invalid; and (2) the administrative rules violate the guarantee of equal protection under the State and Federal Constitutions. The Department counters that the petitioners\u2019 claim that the rules are ultra vires is not preserved, and that, regardless, the administrative rules are consistent with RSA 159:6. The Department further argues that the petitioners\u2019 equal protection argument fails under both the State and Federal Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">We also note that the parties dispute whether the ANJRPC has standing in this case. <em>We, </em>however, need not decide that issue because there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>dispute that Bach has standing, and Bach and the ANJRPC advance the same arguments as to the merits of the issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">\u201cBecause we decide cases on constitutional grounds only when necessary, when a claim of error is based upon both a statutory provision and a constitutional provision, we first will address the statutory argument.\u201d <em>State v. Brouillette, </em>166 N.H. 487, 489 (2014) (quotation omitted). Accordingly, we will first address the petitioners\u2019 argument that the challenged administrative rules are ultra vires.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">As a threshold matter, the Department asserts that this argument is not preserved because \u201cnowhere in their original Petition did [the petitioners] include such a claim.\u201d We disagree. Although the petitioners did not use the term \u201cultra vires\u201d in their petition for declaratory judgment, they did assert that \u201c[n]owhere in RSA [159:6] does New Hampshire law require that a non-resident must first have a license from his state of residence,\u201d and, further, that there \u201cis no basis in law to require such licensing of the non-resident as a prerequisite to eligibility for a New Hampshire nonresident license.\u201d Moreover, in their objection to the Department\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the petitioners argued that the challenged administrative rules \u201cadd to, detract from, or modify\u201d RSA 159:6. (Quotation omitted.) Given the arguments made by the petitioners before the trial court, we conclude that their ultra vires argument is preserved. <em>See State v. Bruce, </em>147 N.H. 37, 40 (2001) (concluding that due process argument was preserved because, although trial counsel did not use term \u201cdue process,\u201d counsel sufficiently alerted trial judge \u201cto the legal basis for his argument\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The petitioners assert that requiring a nonresident applicant to \u201cproduce a home state permit . . . fundamentally and unlawfully alterfs] the requirements of RSA 159:6.\u201d (Bolding and capitalization omitted.) They argue that, because it is \u201cnearly impossible to satisfy\u201d the requirements for obtaining a concealed-carry license in states like New Jersey, the administrative rules effectively impose a higher standard than the \u201csuitability\u201d standard contained in RSA 159:6. The Department counters that the rules are \u201cconsistent with\u201d the suitability requirement of RSA 159:6. According to the Department, the \u201crequirement that a nonresident present a resident state license\u201d to carry a concealed weapon \u201caddresses th[e] lack of information\u201d that the Department has regarding the suitability of nonresidents to carry a concealed weapon in this state, and allows the Department to \u201censure the ongoing eligibility of nonresident license to carry holders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Addressing these arguments requires us to interpret statutes and administrative rules; therefore, our review is <em>de novo. See Appeal of Keelin B., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>162 N.H. 38, 42 (2011). We use the same principles of construction when interpreting both statutes and administrative rules. <em>Petition of Parker, </em>158 N.H. 499, 502 (2009). \u201cIn construing rules, as in construing statutes, where possible, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meaning to the words used.\u201d <em>Doe v. N.H. Dep\u2019t of Safety, </em>160 N.H. 474, 477 (2010) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Although it \u201cis well settled that the legislature may delegate to administrative agencies the power to promulgate rules necessary for the proper execution of the laws,\u201d the \u201cauthority to promulgate rules and regulations is designed only to permit the [agency] to fill in the details to effectuate the purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>Appeal of Mays, </em>161 N.H. 470, 473 (2011) (quotation omitted). \u201cThus, administrative rules may not add to, detract from, or modify the statute which they are intended to implement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">RSA 159:6 is \u201cpart of a statutory scheme that requires individuals to obtain permits to carry loaded, concealed weapons.\u201d <em>Bleiler v. Chief, Dover Police Dep\u2019t, </em>155 N.H. 693, 696 (2007). The statute provides, in pertinent part, that a license to carry a concealed pistol or revolver \u201cshall\u201d be issued \u201cif it appears that the applicant has good reason to fear injury to the applicant\u2019s person or property or has any proper purpose, and that the applicant is a <em>suitable person to be licensed. </em>Hunting, target shooting, or self-defense shall be considered a proper purpose.\u201d RSA 159:6, I(a) (emphasis added). Although the statutory scheme does not define the term \u201csuitable,\u201d it provides that some groups of people, such as felons convicted of certain crimes, are unsuitable for the purposes of obtaining a license to carry a concealed weapon. <em>See </em>RSA 159:3-a. \u201cAn individual may also be unsuitable if he or she has a significant and unexplained arrest history.\u201d <em>Garand v. Town of Exeter, </em>159 N.H. 136, 141 (2009) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The administrative rules at issue here require nonresidents seeking to obtain licenses to carry a concealed pistol or revolver in New Hampshire to submit proof of their resident state licenses. <em>See </em>N.H. Admin. Rules, Saf-C 2102.01-.03. However, this requirement is found nowhere in RSA 159:6. Rather, under RSA 159:6, the licensing authority has the authority to \u201cmake two \u2014 and only two \u2014 determinations in deciding whether to grant a license: (1) whether the applicant has either (a) good reason to fear injury to his person or property or (b) any proper purpose; and (2) whether the applicant is a suitable person to be licensed.\u201d <em>Garand, </em>159 N.H. at 141 (quotation omitted). By requiring nonresidents to submit proof of their resident state licenses, the administrative rules effectively import into New Hampshire law requirements different from those set forth in RSA 159:6 \u2014 namely, those requirements that residents of other states must satisfy in order to obtain a concealed-carry license in their home states.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>For example, an applicant seeking to obtain a permit to carry a handgun \u2014 concealed or otherwise \u2014 in New Jersey must demonstrate that he or she has a \u201cjustifiable need to carry a handgun.\u201d N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:58-4(c)-(d) (West 2015); <em>see </em>N.J. Admin. Code \u00a7 13:54-2.3(a)(3) (2016). In order to establish a \u201cjustifiable need\u201d in New Jersey,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">a private citizen shall specify in detail the urgent necessity for self-protection, as evidenced by specific threats or previous attacks which demonstrate a special danger to the applicant\u2019s life that cannot be avoided by means other than by issuance of a permit to carry a handgun. Where possible the applicant shall corroborate the existence of any specific threats or previous attacks by reference to reports of such incidents to the appropriate law enforcement agencies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">N.J. Admin. Code \u00a7 13:54-2.4(d)(1) (2016). One commentator has noted that in New Jersey \u201cit is essentially impossible for anyone except a retired police officer to obtain a permit\u201d to carry a handgun given the \u201cjustifiable need\u201d requirement. Kopel, <em>Pretend \u201cGun-Free \u201d School Zones: A Deadly Legal Fiction, </em>42 Conn. L. Rev. 515, 520 (2009). The Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey observed that \u201c[rjegardless of training and absence of a disqualifying condition, a well-trained and wholly law-abiding and responsible person cannot lawfully carry a firearm in a public place unless that person can demonstrate that he or she has a justifiable need to carry a handgun.\u201d <em>In re Wheeler, </em>81 A.3d 728, 740 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2013) (quotation omitted). Thus, although a New Jersey resident may be able to satisfy the two requirements of RSA 159:6 \u2014 that he has a \u201cproper purpose\u201d and \u201cis a suitable person to be licensed\u201d \u2014 he may not be able to obtain a concealed-carry license in New Hampshire because he is not able to satisfy the New Jersey \u201cjustifiable need\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">A similarly anomalous result could occur under other circumstances as well. For example, as the Department acknowledged during oral argument, if another state prohibited the carrying of concealed weapons, then, under the existing regulatory scheme, residents of that state would be unable to obtain a New Hampshire license to carry a concealed weapon, irrespective of whether the applicant had a proper purpose and was otherwise suitable. <em>See District of Columbia v. Heller, </em>554 U.S. 570, 626 (2008) (recognizing that, historically, most courts have upheld prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Nonetheless, the Department argues that requiring nonresidents to submit their resident state licenses is necessary to \u201caddress[ ] th[e] lack of information\u201d that the Department has regarding the suitability of nonresidents to carry concealed weapons in this state. We are not persuaded. Even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>assuming that the need for information justifies the promulgation of rules regarding suitability, that need does not justify the rules at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">As we have observed, although the applicant must initially demonstrate suitability, <em>see Silverstein v. Town of Alexandria, </em>150 N.H. 679, 682 (2004), the ultimate burden of proving the lack of suitability rests with the licensing authority, <em>see </em>RSA 159:6-c. Consequently, in order to obtain a concealed-carry license in New Hampshire, it is incumbent upon an applicant to provide sufficient information to the Department to prove his suitability. <em>See Silverstein, </em>150 N.H. at 682. Given this burden, we see no need for the administrative scheme to require a nonresident applicant to supply proof that the applicant has a resident state license. As the petitioners correctly observe, a nonresident applicant could provide the Department with sufficient information regarding his suitability in ways other than providing proof of a resident state license.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Further, we cannot disregard the fact that residents of certain states, like New Jersey, may simply be unable to satisfy state requirements for a license that differ from New Hampshire\u2019s statutory requirements. Because the rules at issue here effectively incorporate into New Hampshire\u2019s requirements for concealed-carry licenses the requirements established by other states for the issuance of concealed-carry licenses, the rules change the requirements of RSA 159:6, and thus, \u201cadd to, detract from, or modify the statute which they are intended to implement,\u201d <em>Mays, </em>161 N.H. at 473 (quotation omitted). Accordingly, we conclude that the challenged rules \u2014 requiring nonresidents to provide proof that they hold resident state licenses in order to obtain concealed-carry licenses in New Hampshire \u2014 are ultra vires and, therefore, invalid. <em>See Formula Dev. Corp. v. Town of Chester, </em>156 N.H. 177, 182 (2007) (noting that, to the extent administrative rules added to, detracted from, or modified our interpretation of a statute, the rules were ultra vires).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Because we hold that the rules are ultra vires, we need not address the petitioners\u2019 constitutional argument. Finally, any issues raised in the notice of appeal that were not briefed are deemed waived. <em>See Waterfield v. Meredith Corp., </em>161 N.H. 707, 713 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b138-9\">Dalianis, C.J., and Hicks, Conboy, and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
