We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b477-14\">The relevant facts follow. The charges against the defendant stem from events occurring on July 26, 2010, at the New Hampshire State Prison where the defendant and the victim were then incarcerated. The defendant was a member of a prison gang known as the Brotherhood of White Warriors (BOWW), and had been ordered by Frankie Philbrook, a high-ranking member of BOWW, to assault the victim because Philbrook believed the victim was a \u201crat\u201d <em>(ie., </em>that the victim had provided incriminating information about Philbrook to authorities). The relevant indictments allege that the defendant assaulted the victim by striking him in the head, and that he, acting in concert with another inmate, caused the victim\u2019s death by repeatedly striking him in the head and face. The defendant admitted to striking the victim once in the head, but denied striking him repeatedly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-15\">Before trial, the State moved <em>in limine </em>to admit expert testimony relating to BOWW\u2019s existence, organizational structure, membership process, and culture, as well as evidence of the defendant\u2019s affiliation with the organization. The defendant filed a partial objection, which stated that he had \u201cno objection to disclosure to the jury of his membership in BOWW,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>but argued that the \u201c[ajdmission of evidence regarding BOWW[\u2019s] organizational structure, membership process, and culture\u201d would violate New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 403. (Quotation omitted.) After a hearing, the trial court granted the State\u2019s motion, in part. In its ruling, the trial court permitted the State to present expert testimony relating to BOWW\u2019s organizational structure and culture to \u201cestablish a motive for the inexplicable attack on [the victim],\u201d and to explain \u201chow fear of gang retaliation would affect the testimony of witnesses, and tend to make them less cooperative with law enforcement.\u201d However, the ruling prohibited the expert from testifying \u201cto evidence a jury could readily understand,\u201d including evidence that BOWW believed the victim \u201cratted\u201d on a gang member, that BOWW ordered the attack, and that the defendant held the position of \u201clieutenant\u201d within the organization. The trial court explained that this evidence \u201cwould be admissible if obtained from a percipient witness,\u201d but that it was \u201cnot expert testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">At trial, the State\u2019s expert testified that BOWW\u2019s members, all white males, formed the gang in 2005 to protect themselves from other gangs at the prison. He explained that BOWW maintains a paramilitary ranking structure, that its members generally share a common \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d ideology, and that its motto is \u201cGod forgives and BOWW don\u2019t.\u201d According to the expert, members must abide by certain rules including following orders under the chain of command, and not \u201cratting.\u201d He explained that a member\u2019s failure to follow the rules results in a \u201cviolation\u201d and that possible consequences for violations include \u201ca punch in the ribs,\u201d being \u201cpunch[ed]\u201d by \u201ca couple [of] guys,\u201d or being \u201cthrown out\u201d of BOWW. He also explained that there are varying levels of violations, and that a BOWW member who \u201crats\u201d would \u201cmost likely be kicked out of the gang, assaulted, or really anything.\u201d Additionally, the State\u2019s expert testified that gang-related cases in the prison are generally difficult to investigate because people are typically reluctant to cooperate with investigators, and because victims of gang-related assaults do not usually report the incident to prison authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Also at trial, the defendant presented the testimony of an inmate who corroborated the defendant\u2019s description of events by testifying that the defendant did not repeatedly strike the victim. On cross-examination, the State elicited testimony, over the defendant\u2019s relevance objection, that the inmate had been assaulted by another inmate several months before testifying at the defendant\u2019s trial. The inmate admitted that his attacker had a BOWW tattoo, and that, during the assault, his attacker said, \u201cYou want to tell on [the victim].\u201d He agreed that the assault occurred shortly before a hearing in another criminal case in which the State planned to call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>him as a witness. That case did not involve the defendant, but was related to the July 26, 2010 attack on the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The jury found the defendant guilty on all charges, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\n<em>II. Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred by failing to properly limit the introduction of evidence relating to BOWW. Specifically, he asserts that the following evidence was inadmissible under New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 403: (1) \u201cBOWW crimes [in] which [the defendant] played no role\u201d; (2) BOWW\u2019s organizational rules; and (8) BOWW\u2019s retaliation against witnesses. He contends that, because such evidence was admitted, he \u201cwas tried, in significant part, on evidence of a prison gang\u2019s wide-ranging criminal conduct which was not fairly attributable to [him] and which unfairly prejudiced him in the eyes of the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">As a threshold matter, the State argues that the defendant waived his argument related to evidence of BOWW\u2019s organizational rules. We disagree. Contrary to the State\u2019s contention, defense counsel did not limit the scope of his objection at the motion <em>in limine </em>hearing. Rather, when asked whether the admission of expert testimony to explain witnesses\u2019 reluctance to testily was \u201cthe one ruling [he took] the most issue with,\u201d defense counsel stated, \u201cthat\u2019s about as much of an objection as I\u2019m going to make <em>beyond . . . what\u2019s in my pleading.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, although the defendant focused primarily upon a single argument at the hearing, he did not concede the remaining arguments raised in his objection. <em>Cf. Milliken v. Dartmouth-Hitchcock Clinic, </em>154 N.H. 662, 669-70 (2006) (concluding that plaintiffs waived appellate argument by conceding issue in trial court). Accordingly, we address the merits of the defendant\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">\u201cThe trial court has broad discretion to determine the admissibility of evidence, and we will not upset its ruling absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Towle, </em>167 N.H. 315, 320 (2015). To demonstrate an unsustainable exercise of discretion, the defendant must show that the trial court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case. <em>State v. Legere, </em>157 N.H. 746, 758 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">Evidence is relevant if it \u201cha[s] any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 401. Relevant evidence is generally admissible. <em>See </em>N.H. R. Ev. 402. However, New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 403 operates as \u201can exclusionary rule that cuts across the rules of evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Kuchman, </em>168 N.H. 779, 789 (2016) (quotation omitted). It states, in relevant part, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>\u201c[although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d N.H. R. Ev. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\"> \u201cEvidence is unfairly prejudicial if its primary purpose or effect is to appeal to a jury\u2019s sympathies, arouse its sense of horror, provoke its instinct to punish, or trigger other mainsprings of human action that may cause a jury to base its decision on something other than the established propositions in the case.\u201d <em>Towle, </em>167 N.H. at 323. \u201cUnfair prejudice is not mere detriment to a defendant from the tendency of the evidence to prove guilt, in which sense all evidence offered by the prosecution is meant to be prejudicial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cRather, the prejudice required to necessitate reversible error is an undue tendency to induce a decision against the defendant on some improper basis, commonly one that is emotionally charged.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">Among the factors we consider in weighing [the probative value of] the evidence [against the danger of unfair prejudice] are: (1) whether the evidence would have a great emotional impact upon a jury; (2) its potential for appealing to a juror\u2019s sense of resentment or outrage; and (8) the extent to which the issue upon which it is offered is established by other evidence, stipulation, or inference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 323-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">\u201cThe trial court can, however, obviate the danger of unfair prejudice by such actions as issuing a limiting instruction to the jury or limiting the scope of the evidence that the parties are permitted to present to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324. \u201cThe trial court is in the best position to gauge the potential prejudicial impact of particular testimony, and to determine what steps, if any, are necessary to obviate the potential prejudice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">\n<em>A. Expert Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">The defendant first argues that the trial court should have excluded the expert testimony regarding BOWW pursuant to New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 403 because the evidence\u2019s probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">To convict the defendant of second degree murder, the State was required to prove that the defendant acted \u201crecklessly . . . under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life ...\u201d \u201cA person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an offense when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjusti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>fiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct.\u201d RSA 626:2, II(c) (2016). \u201cThe risk must be of such a nature and degree that, considering the circumstances known to him, its disregard constitutes a gross deviation from the conduct that a law-abiding person would observe in the situation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">With respect to probative value, the defendant acknowledges that the expert\u2019s testimony was relevant to his motive, opportunity, and intent, and to the credibility of witnesses. However, he asserts that the expert\u2019s testimony was only minimally probative of his motive and intent because he admitted that \u201che hit [the victim] and knocked him down\u201d and that \u201che committed the assault at the behest of other BOWW members.\u201d Essentially, he contends that, as a consequence of his admissions, \u201cthere was little need for the State to prove motive.\u201d He also asserts that the expert\u2019s testimony was only minimally probative of the witnesses\u2019 credibility and reluctance to testify, claiming that \u201c[i]t is well-known . . . that cooperating witnesses are disfavored by all prison inmates.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">As the parties recognize, the expert\u2019s testimony was probative of the defendant\u2019s intent and motive. <em>See Legere, </em>157 N.H. at 760 (concluding expert gang testimony was relevant to the defendant\u2019s intent and motive). It helped to explain BOWW\u2019s rules, particularly those regarding \u201cratting\u201d \u2014 conduct in which the gang believed the victim had engaged. It also informed the jury of BOWW\u2019s chain of command and the violent manner in which the gang enforces its orders. This information helped to explain why the defendant would act against the victim and the degree of violence that he used. <em>See id. </em>(concluding expert gang testimony was admissible to explain why the defendant would murder a man wearing a particular shirt). The expert testimony regarding the violent nature of BOWW\u2019s enforcement methods created a strong inference that the defendant acted with the requisite level of intent in order to avoid BOWW retribution. <em>Cf. State v. Addison (Capital Murder), </em>165 N.H. 381, 467 (2013) (reasoning that evidence of the defendant\u2019s participation in other crimes was probative of the defendant\u2019s motive and intent to \u201ctake extreme measures to avoid capture\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>136 S. Ct. 812 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">We disagree with the defendant\u2019s contention that \u201cthere was little need for the State to prove motive.\u201d Although the defendant admitted that he committed the assault at the direction of BOWW leadership, he denied that it was he who struck the victim repeatedly in the head and cleaned up the crime scene afterwards. Moreover, he did not concede the issue of intent with respect to any of the three charges. His motive and intent thus remained at issue. <em>See State v. Pepin, </em>156 N.H. 269, 279 (2007) (\u201cWhen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>intent is not conceded by the defense, and it is an element of the crime to be proven by the State, it is sufficiently at issue to require evidence at trial.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The expert\u2019s testimony was also probative on the issue of witness credibility. Specifically, the expert\u2019s testimony helped to explain why some of the witnesses at trial were reluctant to cooperate. <em>See Legere, </em>157 N.H. at 761 (explaining that evidence of street gang\u2019s violent nature and general disregard for societal rules was probative of witness credibility \u201cbecause it explained why some witnesses might be reluctant to cooperate\u201d). A number of the parties\u2019 witnesses were current and former prison inmates who had been reluctant to cooperate with investigators out of fear for their safety. The expert\u2019s testimony regarding BOWW\u2019s violent enforcement of its rules helped to explain this fear. <em>See id. </em>Additionally, the expert\u2019s testimony that such reluctance is commonplace in gang-related cases was helpful to further aid the jury in assessing the reluctant witnesses\u2019 credibility. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cKnowledge of the witnesses\u2019 fears of retaliation coupled with the understanding that such fears were common in cases of this nature would give the jury a basis to evaluate their credibility.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that the expert\u2019s testimony on this point was unnecessary because it is \u201cwell-known\u201d that contempt for cooperating witnesses is \u201cpart of prison culture[.]\u201d We have noted, in another context, that prisoners may \u201clook unkindly upon those who willingly cooperate with the authorities.\u201d <em>Sanguedolce v. Wolfe, </em>164 N.H. 644, 647 (2013). However, even if we were to assume that the average juror is aware of such sentiments, here, the State theorized that the witnesses\u2019 reluctance to cooperate stemmed, not from fear of retaliation from the general prison population, but rather from a <em>part icularized fear of retaliation from BOWW. </em>The average juror would be ill-equipped to assess the reasonableness of this particularized fear absent expert testimony on the matter. We, therefore, cannot conclude that the expert\u2019s testimony offered \u201climited value\u201d on the issue of witness credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">As to unfair prejudice, we have previously recognized that \u201cthe potential for prejudice in the introduction of gang evidence is apparent.\u201d <em>Legere, </em>157 N.H. at 761. However, this potential \u201cdoes not necessarily make the evidence inadmissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, we must consider \u201cwhether the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[W]e afford considerable deference to the trial court\u2019s determination in balancing prejudicial impact and probative worth.\u201d <em>Towle, </em>167 N.H. at 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The defendant argues that the probative value of the expert\u2019s testimony was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. He claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>that the expert\u2019s testimony, in effect, \u201ctold the jury that [violent] crimes are routine for BOWW members\u201d and \u201cwrongly labeled [him] as the paradigmatic BOWW member, bent on violence and obstruction of the truth.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The record supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. As noted above, the expert testimony was probative of witness credibility and the defendant\u2019s motive and intent. Because these issues were contested at trial, the probative value of the expert testimony was not insignificant. <em>Cf. State v. Ayer, </em>154 N.H. 500, 513 (2006) (concluding that evidence relevant to the defendant\u2019s intent carried \u201csignificant\u201d probative value because his \u201cintent was central to the trial\u201d). Further, the prejudicial impact of the expert\u2019s testimony on the defendant was limited. Although the expert testified that BOWW members generally share a common white supremacy ideology, he also admitted on cross-examination that \u201cthere are people who\u201d join BOWW \u201cstrictly for protection without really buying into the whole ideology,\u201d which helped to limit the impact of any prejudice. Additionally, although the expert testified that BOWW regularly responded to rule violations with violence, this testimony was not graphic, and was, consequently, less likely to provoke the jury\u2019s instinct to punish.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The prejudicial impact of the expert testimony was also limited by the introduction of other evidence at trial. Specifically, the defendant offered testimony that BOWW held white supremacist views and that he \u201cwould probably have gotten jumped\u201d if he refused to follow BOWW\u2019s orders. Additionally, certain of the inmate witnesses agreed that they were initially reluctant to testify out of fear for their safety. A jury could infer from this testimony that BOWW was likely to respond with violence to the defendant\u2019s failure to follow orders and to the inmates\u2019 \u201cratting.\u201d This inference limited the prejudicial impact of the expert\u2019s testimony that BOWW members generally share a common white supremacy ideology and that BOWW generally responds to rule violations with violence. <em>See Addison (Capital Murder), </em>165 N.H. at 473-74 (affirming trial court\u2019s decision to display video of defendant committing armed robbery, in part, because jury had heard evidence that he participated in the robbery through the testimony of other witnesses).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\"><em>B. Inmate </em>\u215b <em>Testimony about Separate Assault</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">The defendant also challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling admitting evidence of the pretrial assault on an inmate witness by another inmate with a BOWW tattoo. The defendant argues that the trial court should have excluded the inmate\u2019s testimony relating to the pretrial assault pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 403. He appears to acknowledge that the testimony was relevant to the credibility of the inmate. He argues, however, that the evidence\u2019s probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. He claims that he was unfairly prejudiced because the inmate\u2019s testimony \u201callowed for the possible inference by the jury that [he] was involved in the attack.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\"> Evidence of the pretrial assault was probative of the inmate\u2019s credibility because it evidenced his motive to deny the defendant\u2019s involvement in the acts underlying the second degree murder charge. <em>Cf. State v. Russell, </em>159 N.H. 475, 485 (2009) (concluding subsequent bad act evidence of defendant\u2019s threats against witness was relevant to witness\u2019s motive to lie); <em>see also Legere, </em>157 N.H. at 761 (\u201cEvidence that a witness is afraid to testify or fears retaliation for testifying is relevant to the credibility of that witness.\u201d (quotation and ellipsis omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">As to the matter of prejudice, we disagree that the inmate\u2019s testimony supported an inference that the defendant continued his affiliation with BOWW or that he was complicit in the assault on that inmate. The inmate did not testily that the defendant was still a member of BOWW or that he was involved in the attack. Rather, at the defendant\u2019s request, the State elicited testimony that the attack occurred just before a hearing that did not involve the defendant. Additionally, the defendant later offered testimony that he had severed his connection with BOWW in the year leading up to his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Given these circumstances, we conclude that the record supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. We hold that the trial court did not unsustainably exercise its discretion when it admitted the inmate\u2019s testimony about the pretrial assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Finally, any issues raised in the defendant\u2019s notice of appeal, but not briefed, are deemed waived. <em>See State v. Cooper, </em>168 N.H. 161, 171 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b484-10\">Dalianis, C.J., and Conboy, Lynn, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
