We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-17\">The relevant facts follow. In November 2013, Streeter injured her left shoulder at work. On December 16, she notified her employer, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>respondent, Garrison Medical, P.A., of her injury and the respondent filed a First Report of Injury with its insurance carrier the next day. On December 19, Streeter was diagnosed with tendonitis and referred for physical therapy. In February 2014, she had an MRI which showed \u201cmild degenerative changes and mild tendinosis of the left shoulder.\u201d She received a steroid injection in March and was subsequently unable to work for two weeks, during which time the respondent\u2019s insurance carrier paid indemnity benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">On April 3, the respondent submitted a \u201cMemo of Denial of Workers\u2019 Compensation Benefits,\u201d denying \u201congoing disability and medical at this time as not [causally] related to employment.\u201d (Bolding omitted.) The respondent explained in its denial memorandum that the \u201c[diagnosis and findings on [the MRI] are not consistent with the mechanism of injury, findings indicate degenerative and other issues in [the] shoulder.\u201d On May 20, Streeter underwent surgery to repair a lesion in her shoulder. Thereafter, she was unable to work until August 25, when she returned to her job.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Streeter requested a hearing with the New Hampshire Department of Labor (department), following which the hearing officer found that Streeter had sustained her burden of proof to demonstrate that her injury was causally related to her workplace activities. <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:2, XI, XIII, :48 (2010). The hearing officer also found that her condition \u201cworsened over the five to six months between the date of injury and her surgery in April 2014\u201d and that her worsening condition \u201cultimately led to the need for that surgery.\u201d Accordingly, Streeter was awarded \u201cpayment of her medical treatment associated with this case, including, but not limited to, her surgery and physical therapy treatment... [and] indemnity benefits at the temporary total disability rate from May 20,2014 through August 24,2014.\u201d The hearing officer instructed Streeter\u2019s attorney to \u201csubmit for approval all fees charged for professional legal services rendered in connection with this claim pursuant to RSA 281-A:44.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Streeter\u2019s attorney was awarded 20% of the retroactive indemnity award, pursuant to New Hampshire Administrative Rules, Lab 207.01(a)(1). Under that rule, an attorney for a claimant who prevails at a workers\u2019 compensation hearing before a hearing officer when the issue in dispute relates to the causal relationship of the injury to employment is entitled \u201cto 20% of the retroactive indemnity benefits payable out of the benefit received from the claimant.\u201d N.H. ADMIN. RULES, Lab 207.01(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Thereafter, her attorney requested additional fees pursuant to New Hampshire Administrative Rules, Lab 207.01(a)(4). Under that rule, when the issue in dispute in a workers\u2019 compensation hearing \u201crelates to medical bills and a period of disability subsequent to the case being found compensable,\u201d the attorney for a claimant who prevails before a hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>officer is entitled to \u201c20% of the retroactive benefits payable out of the benefits received from the claimant\u201d and \u201c[fjees and cost paid by the carrier as a result of disputing the medical bill issue.\u201d N.H. Admin. Rules, Lab 207.01(a)(4). The hearing officer denied the request, finding that Streeter\u2019s attorney was entitled only to 20% of the retroactive award and, thus, her \u201crequest for legal fees relative to the award of medical benefits [was] inappropriate under these circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Streeter appealed to the board and a <em>de novo </em>hearing was held. The board rejected Streeter\u2019s position that her attorney was entitled to 20% of fees and costs pursuant to Rule 207.01(a)(4). The board determined that Rule 207.01(a)(4) \u201capplies only when the issue relates to medical bills and disability \u2018subsequent to the case <em>being found compensable\u2019 </em>\u201d and that \u201c[t]he first time that Ms. Streeter\u2019s bills and indemnity benefits were <em>found compensable </em>was when the Hearings Officer found them to be so.\u201d The board reasoned that Rule 207.01(a)(4) can be construed as \u201cpunitive in nature. The carrier pays \u2018extra\u2019 if it wrongly denies payments after the Department has found that payments should be made. It is to deter carriers from taking the Department\u2019s findings lightly and tormenting claimants.\u201d Thus, because the issue in dispute before the hearing officer was the causal relationship of Streeter\u2019s injury to her employment, the board concluded that her attorney was entitled only to fees pursuant to Rule 207.01(a)(1). Streeter unsuccessfully sought reconsideration of the board\u2019s decision. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">On appeal, Streeter argues that \u201cby paying benefits voluntarily after 21 days after notification of the claim,\u201d the respondent\u2019s insurance carrier made a \u201cde facto\u201d determination pursuant to New Hampshire Administrative Rules, Lab 506.02 that her injury was compensable. (Bolding and capitalization omitted.) Thus, she asserts, because she \u201cprevailed after the carrier itself determined that the work related injury was compensable,\u201d she is entitled to fees under Rule 207.01(a)(4). The respondent counters that neither it nor its insurance carrier made a \u201cde facto determination that the injury was compensable because the claimant was only paid two weeks of indemnity benefits.\u201d (Bolding, underlining, and capitalization omitted.) Therefore, \u201cthe issue of [the] causal relationship of [the] injury to [the] employer needed to be addressed and was properly before the hearing officer pursuant to [Streeter\u2019s] own request.\u201d (Bolding, underlining, and capitalization omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">We will not disturb the board\u2019s decision absent an error of law, or unless, by a clear preponderance of the evidence, we find it to be unjust or unreasonable. <em>Appeal of Phillips, </em>169 N.H. 177, 180 (2016); <em>see </em>RSA 541:13 (2007). We review the factual findings of the board deferentially and review its statutory interpretation <em>de novo. Id. </em>As the appealing party, Streeter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>bears the burden of demonstrating that the board\u2019s decision was erroneous. <em>See Appeal of Rose, </em>146 N.H. 219, 220 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Resolving the issues on appeal requires that we engage in statutory construction. \u201cStatutory interpretation is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo.\" Petition of Malisos, </em>166 N.H. 726, 729 (2014). When construing a statute, \u201c[w]e are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Appeal of Wilson, </em>161 N.H. 659, 662 (2011). \u201cWe first examine the language of the statute and ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to the words used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We apply the same principles of construction in interpreting administrative rules. <em>Appeal of Town of Pittsfield, </em>160 N.H. 604, 606 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Pursuant to administrative rules that govern \u201chow parties in the workers\u2019 compensation process substantially comply with the duty to compute and pay compensation,\u201d if an employer or carrier determines that a case is not compensable, it must complete and file a \u201cMemo of Denial of Workers Compensation Benefits\u201d with the department \u201cand send a copy to the claimant within 21 days of notification of a claim or subsequent period of disability.\u201d N.H. Admin. Rules, Lab 501.01, 506.02(o)(1) (quotation omitted). \u201cIf disability benefits have been paid within the first 21 days of the receipt of notice of disability, and the employer, [or] carrier . .. determines that payment should not have been made, they may cease weekly payments of compensation.\u201d N.H. ADMIN. RULES, Lab 506.02(p); <em>see </em>N.H. ADMIN. Rules, Lab 506.02(q) (\u201cIf disability benefits have been paid after 21 days following the carrier\u2019s receipt of the notice of disability the carrier shall request permission of the department prior to terminating benefits.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">As set forth above, Streeter was unable to work for two weeks in March 2014, during which time the respondent\u2019s insurance carrier paid indemnity benefits. The respondent, thereafter, determined that the injury was not compensable and filed a \u201cMemo of Denial of Workers\u2019 Compensation Benefits,\u201d denying any further liability on grounds that the injury was not causally related to Streeter\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">The board correctly found that \u201cthe first time that Ms. Streeter\u2019s bills and indemnity benefits were <em>found compensable </em>was when the Hearings Officer found them to be so.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 281-A:41 (2010) (\u201cNo payment of any benefits made under this chapter shall in anyway prejudice the rights of an employer in any dispute regarding the question of whether or not an injury... arose out of and in the course of an employee\u2019s service.\u201d); <em>see also </em>N.H. ADMIN. Rules, Lab 504.02(e) (the filing of the employer\u2019s first report of injury \u201cshall in no way prejudice the employer\u2019s right to contest the compensability of the claim at a later date\u201d). Accordingly, we reject Streeter\u2019s contention that the respondent made a \u201cde facto\u201d determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>that her injury was compensable. In fact, the issue before the hearing officer was whether Streeter had established the causal link between the injury and her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Streeter argues that our case law supports her position that the respondent determined \u201cde facto\u201d that her claim was compensable, resulting in the hearing officer\u2019s determination that she was entitled to payment of her medical treatment and indemnity benefits being made \u201csubsequent to the case being found compensable.\u201d N.H. ADMIN. RULES, Lab 207.01(a)(4). She asserts that under our case law, \u201cthe department need not find that an injury is compensable for attorney\u2019s fees to be appropriate if the carrier or employer de facto has made that determination.\u201d However, the cases cited by Streeter are distinguishable. <em>See Appeal of Elliott, </em>140 N.H. 607, 608-09, 610 (1996) (determining that insurance carrier\u2019s voluntary continuation of disability payments for approximately seven years constituted an agreement between the insurance carrier and the injured party having the same legal effect as an award made by the labor commissioner for the purpose of a review hearing); <em>Coulombe v. Noyes Tire Co., </em>125 N.H. 765, 766-67 (1984) (decided under prior law) (noting that where insurance carrier paid indemnity benefits to the employee for approximately three years, despite the fact that \u201cno actual award was made by the labor commissioner ..., an agreement between an insurance carrier and an injured party that benefits are payable has the same legal effect as an award\u201d for purposes of applying the statute of limitations applicable to modifying awards); <em>Prassas v. Company, </em>100 N.H. 209, 210 (1956) (decided under prior law) (explaining that a final settlement agreement executed by the employee and the insurance carrier and approved by the labor commissioner has the same legal effect as an award made by the commissioner).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">We hold that, because the initial determination of whether Streeter\u2019s injury was causally related to her employment was made by the hearing officer, Streeter\u2019s attorney was entitled only to \u201c20% of the retroactive indemnity benefits payable out of the benefit received.\u201d N.H. Admin. Rules, Lab 207.01(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b545-8\">Hicks, Conboy, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
