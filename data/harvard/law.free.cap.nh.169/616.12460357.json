Ct. R. 11, challenging the decisions of the Office of General Counsel of the Attorney Discipline Office (ADO) and the Complaint Screening Committee (CSC). The ADO had dismissed a grievance filed by the petitioners against Attorney John F. Bisson. Upon the petitioners\u2019 request for reconsideration, the CSC affirmed the ADO\u2019s decision. In their petition, the petitioners argue that the ADO and the CSC erred by declining to docket their grievance as a complaint, and that the CSC erred by failing to answer the questions raised in the petitioners\u2019 request for reconsideration. The respondents \u2014 the ADO and Attorney Bisson \u2014 challenge the merits of the petitioners\u2019 claims, and also assert that the petitioners lack standing to bring this petition. Because we conclude that the petitioners lack standing, we dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">We begin by providing background regarding the attorney discipline system. Pursuant to our rule-making authority under the State Constitution, <em>see </em>N.H. Const. pt. II, art. 73-a, we have established an attorney discipline system to discharge our inherent and statutory authority to discipline attorneys, <em>Petition of Brooks, </em>140 N.H. 813, 817 (1996); RSA 811:8 (2015); RSA 490:4 (2010); <em>see also </em>Sup. Ct. R. 87, 37A. \u201c[T]he purpose of attorney discipline is to protect the public, maintain public confidence in the bar, preserve the integrity of the legal profession, and prevent similar [misjconduct in the future . . . .\u201d <em>Bosse\u2019s Case, </em>155 N.H. 128, 131 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">The attorney discipline system is governed by the Supreme Court Rules, <em>see </em>Sup. Ct. R. 37, 37A, and has \u201cdisciplinary jurisdiction\u201d over \u201c[a]ny attorney admitted to practice law in this State,\u201d Sup. Ct. R. 37(1)(b). The standards of conduct for New Hampshire attorneys are set forth in the New Hampshire Rules of Professional Conduct. N.H. R. Prof. Conduct Statement of Purpose. An attorney may be disciplined under the Supreme Court Rules if it is determined by clear and convincing evidence that the attorney violated the Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>See Young\u2019s Case, </em>154 N.H. 359, 366 (2006); <em>see also </em>Sup. Ct. R. 37A(III)(d)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">One of the responsibilities of the ADO is to conduct an initial review of a grievance submitted by an individual. <em>See </em>Sup. Ct. R. 37A(II)(a)(2)(A), (3)(A). A grievance is a written submission that \u201ccall[s] to [the ADO\u2019s] attention conduct that the grievant believes may constitute misconduct by an attorney.\u201d Sup. Ct. R. 37A(I)(c). When a grievance is filed, the ADO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>reviews the grievance to determine whether the attorney in question is subject to the disciplinary jurisdiction of the attorney discipline system and whether the grievance meets certain other enumerated requirements. Sup. Ct. R. 37A(II)(a)(3)(A)-(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">If the ADO concludes that a grievance satisfies those requirements, it dockets the grievance as a complaint \u2014 otherwise, the grievance is dismissed. Sup. Ct. R. 37A(II)(a)(3)(C), (5)(A). If the ADO declines to docket a grievance, the grievant may file a request for reconsideration. Sup. Ct. R. 37A(II)(a)(4)(C). The request is reviewed by the CSC, <em>id., </em>a nine-member panel composed of five attorneys and four \u201cnon-attorneys,\u201d Sup. Ct. R. 37(5)(a). The CSC must either \u201caffirm the decision of the [ADO] or direct that the grievance be docketed as a complaint.\u201d Sup. Ct. R. 37A(II)(a)(4)(C). Once a grievance is docketed as a complaint, the respondent attorney must file an answer to the complaint, and the ADO may conduct a further investigation \u201cas may be appropriate.\u201d Sup. Ct. R. 37A(II)(a)(5)(C), (a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Turning to the present petition, the record reflects the following facts. On December 30, 2015, the petitioners filed a grievance with the ADO. The petitioners\u2019 grievance arises out of the annual meeting of the Oak Brook Condominium Owners\u2019 Association, which took place in November 2015. The petitioners are unit owners at Oak Brook Condominium. Attorney Bisson represented the condominium association at the meeting. The petitioners allege that, during the meeting, Attorney Bisson violated the Rules of Professional Conduct by, among other things, recording the meeting without the petitioners\u2019 knowledge or consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">The ADO reviewed the factual allegations in the petitioners\u2019 grievance, along with the exhibits that the petitioners provided. On January 15, 2016, the ADO\u2019s assistant general counsel sent a three-page letter to the petitioners, in which he reviewed the allegations, assessed the claimed violations, and explained the reasoning that led to his conclusion that \u201ca hearing panel would not likely find clear and convincing evidence that\u201d Attorney Bisson violated the Rules of Professional Conduct. Regarding the claim that Attorney Bisson made a recording without the petitioners\u2019 knowledge or consent, he noted that one of the petitioners\u2019 exhibits showed that, in fact, the meeting had not been recorded. Based upon the analysis of the petitioners\u2019 allegations, the ADO declined to docket the petitioners\u2019 grievance as a complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">The petitioners filed a request for reconsideration, asserting that their grievance satisfied the requirements for docketing and that the ADO erred by dismissing their grievance. In their request, the petitioners listed a number of alleged errors in the ADO\u2019s decision, which they labeled \u201c[q]uestion[s].\u201d In a letter dated February 25, 2016, the CSC informed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>petitioners that it had affirmed the ADO\u2019s decision. The petitioners then filed a \u201cMotion for Clarification\u201d with the CSC, asking that the CSC answer the questions that the petitioners had raised in their request for reconsideration. The CSC responded to the motion by letter, dated March 18, 2016, acknowledging receipt of the motion, and stating that \u201cth[e] matter is now closed.\u201d This petition followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">In their petition, the petitioners argue that the Supreme Court Rules required the ADO to docket their grievance as a complaint and initiate an investigation. They assert that the ADO and the CSC erred by declining to docket their grievance on the basis that a hearing panel would be unlikely to find, by clear and convincing evidence, that Attorney Bisson violated the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">The petitioners further contend that the CSC erred by failing to answer the questions that the petitioners raised in their request for reconsideration. Although the petitioners do not identify a rule that requires the CSC to explicitly answer questions posed in a request for reconsideration, we read the petitioners\u2019 argument to be that the CSC was required to respond to each specific question raised. Thus, all of the petitioners\u2019 claims on appeal relate to alleged violations of the Supreme Court Rules by the ADO and the CSC.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The respondents dispute the merits of the petitioners\u2019 arguments. However, they also argue that the petitioners lack standing to bring this petition. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Certiorari is an extraordinary remedy that is not granted as a matter of right, but rather at the discretion of the court. <em>Petition of State of N.H. (State v. MacDonald), </em>162 N.H. 64, 66 (2011); <em>see </em>Sup. Ct. R. 11(1). Our review of an agency\u2019s decision on a petition for a writ of certiorari entails examination of whether the agency \u201cacted illegally with respect to jurisdiction, authority or observance of the law or has unsustainably exercised its discretion or acted arbitrarily, unreasonably or capriciously.\u201d <em>Petition of Chase Home for Children, </em>155 N.H. 528, 532 (2007). \u201cWe exercise our power to grant such writs sparingly and only where to do otherwise would result in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">Generally, \u201c[i]n evaluating whether a party has standing to sue, we focus on whether the party suffered a legal injury against which the law was designed to protect.\u201d <em>Libertarian Party of N.H. v. Sec\u2019y of State, </em>158 N.H. 194, 195 (2008) (quoting <em>Asmussen v. Comm\u2019r, N.H. Dep\u2019t of Safety, </em>145 N.H. 578, 587 (2000)). This requirement \u201crests upon the constitutional principle that the judicial power ordinarily does not include the power to issue advisory opinions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196; <em>see also Duncan v. State, </em>166 N.H. 630, 641-43 (2014) (discussing constitutional significance of the doctrine of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>standing). In the context of a petition for a writ of certiorari, we have held that a party has standing if his \u201crights may be directly affected by the decision of a lower tribunal.\u201d <em>Melton v. Personnel Comm\u2019n, </em>119 N.H. 272, 277 (1979) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In other words, a person seeking to challenge an agency\u2019s action through a petition for a writ of certiorari must show that his personal rights have been or will be \u201cimpaired or prejudiced\u201d by the agency\u2019s decision. <em>Duncan, </em>166 N.H. at 640-45 (discussing constitutional requirements for standing). A party does not satisfy this requirement if his only injury is a \u201cgeneralized wrong allegedly suffered by the public at large.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 646 (quotation omitted). Similarly, a mere general interest in an administrative proceeding \u2014 for example, an interest in ensuring the \u201cproper administration of the laws\u201d \u2014 is not sufficient to confer standing. <em>Id. </em>at 644 (quotation omitted); <em>see also Appeal of N.H. Right to Life, </em>166 N.H. 308, 314-15 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">To determine whether a grievant has a personal interest in an attorney disciplinary proceeding that is sufficient to confer standing, we examine the nature and purposes of the attorney disciplinary system. <em>See Appeal of Campaign for Ratepayers Rights, </em>142 N.H. 629, 632 (1998) (assessing whether parties had standing to appeal decision of Public Utilities Commission by reference to the nature of the commission\u2019s determination). As noted above, the purposes of attorney discipline include the protection of the public and the maintenance of public confidence in the bar. <em>See Bosse\u2019s Case, </em>155 N.H. at 131. Attorney discipline is not intended to punish attorneys, <em>id., </em>nor does it exist \u201cas a means of redress for one claiming to have been personally wronged by an attorney,\u201d <em>Cotton v. Steele, </em>587 N.W.2d 693, 699 (Neb. 1999). Instead, \u201cthe real question at issue in a [disciplinary] proceeding is the public interest and an attorney\u2019s right to continue to practice a profession imbued with public trust.\u201d <em>State v. Merski, </em>121 N.H. 901, 909 (1981) (quotation omitted); <em>see also Cotton, </em>587 N.W.2d at 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">As a consequence, disciplinary proceedings are not treated as \u201clawsuits between parties litigant but rather are in the nature of an inquest or inquiry as to the conduct of the respondent [attorney].\u201d <em>Merski, </em>121 N.H. at 909 (quotation omitted). The grievant participates in the proceedings not to enforce his or her own rights, but to \u201csupply evidence of the alleged attorney malfeasance.\u201d <em>Akinaka v. Disciplinary Board, </em>979 P.2d 1077, 1085 (Haw. 1999). This principle is reflected in the rules governing the attorney discipline system, which make clear that a grievant may not control the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>prosecution of a charge, <em>see </em>Sup. Ct. R. 37(18), and that the complainant is not a party to the disciplinary proceeding, Sup. Ct. R. 37A(I)(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Because attorney disciplinary proceedings are structured in this manner, no personal rights or remedies of the grievant are adjudicated in, or directly affected by, a disciplinary proceeding. The grievant neither receives a legally cognizable benefit when an attorney is disciplined, nor sustains a legally cognizable injury when the attorney is not disciplined. Rather, the benefit of attorney discipline is bestowed upon the public at large, <em>Merski, </em>121 N.H. at 909, and \u201cthe only one who stands to suffer direct injury in a disciplinary proceeding is the lawyer involved,\u201d <em>Doyle v. Oklahoma Bar Assn., </em>998 F.2d 1559, 1567 (10th Cir. 1993). Nor does the grievant have a personal stake in the proceedings by virtue of his participation in the disciplinary process. As we have observed, an agency may \u201cpermit third parties to participate in proceedings before it... without creating a right in those parties to review a negative decision that the [agency] may ultimately make.\u201d <em>Ruel v. N.H. Real Estate Appraiser Bd., </em>163 N.H. 34, 41 (2011) (quotation omitted). Simply put, regardless of how the ADO or the CSC ultimately addresses a grievance, no legally cognizable interest of the grievant is implicated in an attorney disciplinary proceeding. <em>See In re Attorney Disciplinary Appeal, </em>650 F.3d 202, 204 (2d Cir. 2011) (stating that a complainant lacks standing because his interest \u201cresults only from [his] status as a member of the public at large\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Our reasoning is similar to that employed when courts consider whether, and to what extent, a victim may participate in a criminal prosecution. As a general proposition, \u201ca private citizen lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of another.\u201d <em>Linda R.S. v. Richard D., </em>410 U.S. 614, 619 (1973). It is for this reason that, generally, a victim has no right to intervene in the criminal case of the accused, <em>see Rullo v. Rullo, </em>121 N.H. 299, 300 (1981), to appeal the substantive rulings of the trial court, <em>see, e.g., Cooper v. District Court, </em>133 P.3d 692, 703-05 (Alaska Ct. App. 2006) (collecting cases), or to contest the prosecutor\u2019s decision to dismiss criminal charges, <em>Gansz v. People, </em>888 P.2d 256, 258-59 (Colo. 1995) (en banc). These cases reflect the underlying principle that \u201c[a] crime is a public wrong, raising an issue between the state and the accused,\u201d rather than between the accused and the accuser. 1 Richard B. McNamara, New Hampshire Practice: Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1.01, at 1 (5th ed. 2010). This logic \u2014 that, given the purpose and design of the criminal justice system, a victim does not have standing to seek judicial review of a criminal disposition \u2014 applies with equal force to the attorney discipline system.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Therefore, in light of the nature and purposes of the attorney discipline system, we conclude that a grievant does not have a personal interest in the outcome of an attorney disciplinary proceeding that is sufficient to confer standing. In reaching this conclusion, we join the many courts that have likewise held that a grievant does not have standing to challenge the disciplinary authority\u2019s disposition of a grievance. <em>See, e.g., In re Request for Investigation of an Atty., </em>867 N.E.2d 323, 324-25 (Mass. 2007); <em>Rousseau v. Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>133 A.3d 947, 951 (Conn. App. Ct. 2016) (per curiam); <em>see also In re Attorney Disciplinary Appeal, </em>650 F.3d at 203 (collecting cases); <em>Akinaka, </em>979 P.2d at 1084-86. We agree with those courts that have reasoned that to confer standing upon a private individual in these circumstances would shift the focus of the disciplinary process from the public interest to the private interests of the grievant. <em>See, e.g., Akinaka, </em>979 P.2d at 1085. To do so would contravene the essential purpose of the attorney discipline system \u2014 to protect the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Accordingly, because the petitioners lack standing to appeal the disposition of their grievance, we dismiss their petition for a writ of certiorari. <em>See Libertarian Party of N.H., </em>158 N.H. at 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b667-7\">Dalianis, C.J., and Conboy and Lynn, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
