(Markel Services), and Essex Insurance Company (Essex), appeal an order of the Superior Court (O\u2019Neill, J.) denying their motions for summary judgment and granting summary judgment to the plaintiff, Michael Newell, in this insurance coverage action. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>The following facts were recited in the trial court\u2019s order or appear in the record before us. On or about June 12, 2010, Newell was allegedly injured in a slip and fall accident at a property owned by Brames, Inc. (Brames) in Laconia. Brames was insured under an Amusement Park General Liability Policy (the Policy) issued by Essex. Essex is a subsidiary of Markel Corporation and Markel Services is Markel Corporation\u2019s claims handling branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Newell\u2019s alleged injury occurred when he slipped on a wet bathroom floor on Brames\u2019s property during Motorcycle Week 2010. The floor had recently been washed by Ivy Banks (Banks) of I&amp;L Cleaning Services. Banks had been cleaning the bathrooms at the Brames\u2019s property during the annual Motorcycle Week for several years up to and including 2010 under an arrangement that he had entered into with Brames\u2019s co-owner and treasurer, Robert Ames. Under this arrangement, Banks maintained the bathrooms on the Brames property during Motorcycle Week in exchange for tips he received from patrons using the bathrooms. Banks estimated that he would receive between $75 and $100 in tips per day during Motorcycle Week, and he neither sought nor received any other payment for his services. Banks offered similar services at other motorcycle shows and events throughout the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Newell filed two personal injury actions arising from his slip and fall. In the first (the Brames action), he sued Brames for negligence in leaving the floor wet without a warning. That action concluded with an out-of-court settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">In the second lawsuit (the Banks action), Newell sued Banks. The defendants received notice of the Banks action, but declined to defend Banks or intervene. Banks, although properly served, filed neither an appearance nor an answer and was defaulted. A default judgment was entered against Banks for $300,000, the full amount of damages sought by Newell.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Newell then brought the instant action to recover the $300,000 default judgment from the defendants. In his complaint, Newell alleged that \u201cBanks was an insured under a liability insurance policy issued by Markel/Essex to Brames, and that Markel/Essex breached the insurance contract by failing to defend and indemnify Banks after receiving notice of the suit.\u201d Newell alleged that he was \u201ca third party beneficiary under the contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">In ruling on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment, the court noted that the only issue before it was whether Banks was an insured under Brames\u2019s policy with Essex at the time of Newell\u2019s slip and fall. The court concluded: \u201c[U]nder a reasonable interpretation of the relevant language in the Essex policy, Mr. Banks qualified as a \u2018volunteer worker.\u2019 Because more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>than one reasonable interpretation is possible, and one interpretation provides coverage, the Court construes this language against the defendants and in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d (Quotation, citation, and brackets omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">On appeal, the defendants argue that the trial court erred in determining that the language of the Policy is ambiguous and that Banks was a \u201cvolunteer worker\u201d under the Policy. In addition, Markel Corporation and Markel Services claim that they are entitled to summary judgment because \u201cthey did not issue the policy in dispute and the plaintiff did not object to their motion for summary judgment.\u201d Newell counters that Banks is a \u201cvolunteer worker\u201d as defined under the Policy and that Essex is barred from denying the same under the doctrine of judicial estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">In this appeal from the disposition of cross-motions for summary judgment, we employ the following standard of review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">We consider the evidence in the light most favorable to each party in its capacity as the nonmoving party and, if no genuine issue of material fact exists, we determine whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. If our review of that evidence discloses no genuine issue of material fact and if the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, then we will affirm the grant of summary judgment. We review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-8\"><em>Conant v. O\u2019Meara, </em>167 N.H. 644, 648 (2015) (quotations, citations, and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">We first address the contention that summary judgment should have been granted to Markel Corporation and Markel Services. Those entities moved for summary judgment asserting that because Newell\u2019s action was for breach of contract, and neither Markel Corporation nor Markel Services had a contractual relationship with Brames, the complaint failed to state a claim against them. Newell specifically noted in his own motion for summary judgment and objection to the summary judgment motion of defendant Essex that he did not object to Markel Corporation and Markel Services\u2019s motion. Newell\u2019s counsel at oral argument confirmed that this case concerns only Essex. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s summary judgment rulings with respect to Markel Corporation and Markel Services and remand for the entry of summary judgment in favor of those entities. The remainder of this opinion concerns only defendant Essex.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">We now turn to the issue of coverage under the Policy. \u201cThe interpretation of insurance policy language is a question of law for this court to decide.\u201d <em>Great Am. Ins. Co. v. Christy, </em>164 N.H. 196, 200 (2012). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\u201cWe construe the language of an insurance policy as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based upon a more than casual reading of the policy as a whole.\u201d <em>Colony Ins. Co. v. Dover Indoor Climbing Gym, </em>158 N.H. 628, 680 (2009). \u201cPolicy terms are construed objectively, and where the terms of a policy are clear and unambiguous, we accord the language its natural and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf more than one reasonable interpretation is possible, and an interpretation provides coverage, the policy contains an ambiguity and will be construed against the insurer.\u201d <em>Great Am. Dining v. Philadelphia Indem. Ins. Co., </em>164 N.H. 612, 616 (2013) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The issue before us is whether Banks is an insured under the Policy as a volunteer worker. The Policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">And your Volunteer Workers are Insureds only for activities or work they conduct or perform:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">\u2022 at your direction; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">\u2022 within the scope of their duties for you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">(Emphasis omitted.) The Policy defines the term volunteer worker as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-11\">Volunteer Worker means any person who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-12\">\u2022 isn\u2019t an employee or a leased temporary worker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-13\">\u2022 donates his or her work; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-14\">\u2022 isn\u2019t paid a fee, salary or other compensation for that work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AF8\">(Emphasis omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-15\">Essex argues that \u201cBanks fails to qualify as a \u2018volunteer worker\u2019 \u201d for three reasons: (1) he \u201cdid not donate his services\u201d; (2) he \u201cdid receive compensation in the form of tips\u201d; and (8) he \u201cdid not act at Brames\u2019s direction.\u201d We will address each in turn, beginning with the contention that Banks \u201cdid not \u2018donate\u2019 his work under the common meaning of that term.\u201d Essex asserts that \u201c[t]he common meaning of the term \u2018donate\u2019 is to present a gift or give property or money without consideration,\u201d and argues that \u201cBanks did not donate or bestow a gift of his services to Brames\u201d because \u201cBanks benefited from his use of\u2019 Brames\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-16\">Newell counters that the term \u201cdonates\u201d cannot mean \u201cto give without compensation\u201d when \u201cthe definition already includes \u2018isn\u2019t paid .. . other compensation\u2019 in the conjunctive.\u201d As Newell points out, \u201cthe usual rule[ ] of construction [is] that effect is to be given to all the clauses of a contract if it reasonably may be.\u201d <em>Shelby &amp;c. Co. v. Lynch, </em>89 N.H. 510, 512 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Construing a similar definition of \u201cvolunteer worker,\u201d the court in <em>North Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance v. Burns, </em>767 S.E.2d 109 (N.C. Ct. App. 2014), concluded that \u201cthe term \u2018donate\u2019 must encompass more than working without receiving payment. Otherwise, the policy language that the work must be without \u2018fee, salary or other compensation\u2019 would be superfluous and the term \u2018donate\u2019 would have no effect.\u201d <em>N. Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins., </em>767 S.E.2d at 112. The court then reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">Having determined that the term \u201cdonate\u201d as used in the policy must mean more than \u201cwithout compensation,\u201d and in order to give effect to every provision of the policy definitions, we consider the context in which the term is used: defining \u201cvolunteer worker.\u201d We note that the common everyday meaning of the word \u201cvolunteer\u201d is characterized by not only lack of compensation, but also choice and free will. Therefore, considering its common definitions, its use in the context of working as a volunteer, and the policy language as a whole, we conclude that to \u201cdonate\u201d one\u2019s work under the terms of the policy at issue necessitates the presence of choice and free will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 112-13 (footnote omitted). Relying upon <em>North Carolina, Farm, Bureau Mutual Insurance, </em>Newell contends that \u201c[a] reasonable interpretation of \u2018donates\u2019 in the context of this policy is to act by choice, free will and voluntarily, which Banks did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">We conclude that the foregoing arguments demonstrate a \u201creasonable disagreement between [the] contracting parties leading] to at least two interpretations of the [Policy\u2019s] language,\u201d <em>Colony Ins. Co., </em>158 N.H. at 630 (quotation omitted). Although Essex\u2019s interpretation employs the more common meaning of \u201cdonates,\u201d Newell points out nonnegligible flaws with that interpretation and posits an alternative that has garnered acceptance by at least one court. Accordingly, we conclude that the term \u201cdonates\u201d is ambiguous, <em>see id., </em>and we construe it in favor of coverage. <em>See High Country Assocs. v. N.H. Ins. Co., </em>139 N.H. 39, 44 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Essex next argues that Banks does not meet the definition of \u201cvolunteer worker\u201d because the tips he received from patrons \u201camount to compensation under the ordinary meaning of that term.\u201d Essex cites cases and statutes that equate tips with compensation in other contexts. <em>See, e.g., Marden v. State, </em>122 N.H. 751, 753-54 (1982) (construing the term wages in unemployment compensation statute to include tips received by waitress).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">Newell, on the other hand, citing both the dictionary definition and case law differentiating compensation and gratuities in other contexts, contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>that \u201c[c]ompensation is for something that is owed, and not a gratuity or gift.\u201d Newell also invokes the doctrines of <em>ejusdem generis </em>and <em>noscitur a sociis, </em>as well as the presence of the word \u201cother\u201d before \u201ccompensation\u201d in the definition of \u201cvolunteer worker,\u201d to argue that compensation must be construed to mean something like \u201cfee\u201d and \u201csalary.\u201d Newell also notes that \u201c[t]he policy language is unclear as to whether [the] \u2018fee, salary or other compensation\u2019 applies just to [payments by] the policy holder Brames or includes receipts from third parties.\u201d Newell points out that many insurance companies define \u201cvolunteer worker\u201d with additional language specifying that the volunteer worker may not receive compensation from either the policy holder or anyone else. <em>See, e.g., Dry v. United Fire &amp; Cas. Co., Inc., </em>420 S.W.3d 593, 594-95 (Mo. Ct. App. 2013) (quoting policy defining \u201cvolunteer worker,\u201d in pertinent part, to be \u201ca person who ... is not paid a fee, salary or other compensation by you or anyone else for their work performed for you\u201d). He argues that \u201c[t]he practice of adding this language is so wide spread that it is reasonable to infer that Essex intended by omitting it that only fee, salary or other compensation by Essex itself would bar coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">We again conclude that although Essex has put forth a reasonable interpretation of the term \u201ccompensation,\u201d Newell has identified an ambiguity by articulating another reasonable construction. <em>See Colony Ins. Co., </em>158 N.H. at 630. Accordingly, we will construe that term in favor of coverage. <em>See High Country Assocs., </em>139 N.H. at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Finally, Essex contends that Banks does not meet the coverage requirement of having acted at Brames\u2019s direction. Citing the dictionary definition of \u201cdirection,\u201d Essex argues that \u201cin the context of the present case, the term \u2018at your direction\u2019 connotes supervision or guidance of an action or operation, or an order or command.\u201d Essex then argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">Here, the undisputed facts demonstrate that Banks did not conduct or perform work at Brames\u2019s direction. Ames testified that when Banks first came to provide services at the [property], he did not show him what to do or tell him what to do. He showed Banks where the bathrooms were, but did not point [out] the area he wanted him to clean. When asked how I&amp;L Cleaning Services would know what they are supposed to do with the two places where there are portable toilets, Ames testified that \u201cThey\u2019re bathroom cleaning people. My assumption was that they knew what to do, that I didn\u2019t have to tell them anything.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">(Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Ames\u2019s testimony suggests that the degree of supervision of Banks\u2019s work \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 by Brames was not a consequence of their work arrangement but of the nature of the work itself. <em>Cf. Borello &amp; Sons v. Dept. of Indus. Rel., </em>769 P.2d 399, 408 (Cal. 1989) (noting, in finding sharefarmers to be employees for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation law that \u201c[i]t is the simplicity of the work, not the harvesters\u2019 superior expertise, which makes detailed supervision and discipline unnecessary\u201d). As Newell contends, Banks\u2019s services were \u201cnot complex\u201d and did not constitute \u201cwork that required any supervision or instruction.\u201d Newell therefore argues that, in this context, the policy term \u201cat your direction\u201d means \u201cwith the knowledge and approval of Brames.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">We agree with Newell that, at least in the context of unskilled labor, the phrase \u201cat your direction\u201d can reasonably be read to mean something other than \u201csupervision or guidance\u201d as urged by Essex. The provision at issue conditions coverage on the worker conducting or performing the activities \u201cat [the policyholder\u2019s] direction\u201d and \u201cwithin the scope of their duties for [the policyholder].\u201d Taken together, these two conditions foreclose action taken on the worker\u2019s own initiative and unrelated to the agreed-upon task \u2014 and certainly foreclose any \u201cfrolic of his own.\u201d <em>Cf., e.g., Perlstein v. American Exp. Co., </em>59 N.E. 194, 195 (Mass. 1901) (noting that the question for the jury in determining whether defendant was liable for negligence of its employee driver was \u201cnot whether the defendant owned the team, but whether the person who was driving it negligently was then acting for the defendant in doing the work which he was directed to do\u201d or \u201cwas off \u2018on a frolic of his own\u2019 \u201d); <em>Shakra v. Benedictine Sisters, </em>131 N.H. 417, 422 (1989) (concluding sufficient evidence supported trial court\u2019s finding that former president of defunct corporate defendant \u201centered into [a purchase and sale] agreement while \u2018on a frolic of her own,\u2019 without. . . authorization or approval\u201d). In this sense, \u201cat your direction\u201d could reasonably mean \u201cauthorized by you\u201d or \u201cinstructed by you to do.\u201d Employing that interpretation here, Banks would not be acting at Brames\u2019s direction if, for instance, he unilaterally decided to tend bar at Brames\u2019s establishment, but would be acting at Brames\u2019s direction in carrying out the very task Brames engaged him to do \u2014 clean the bathrooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">We conclude that, at the very least, the phrase \u201cat your direction\u201d is susceptible of two reasonable interpretations under the circumstances presented here. <em>See Colony Ins. Co., </em>158 N.H. at 630. The phrase is therefore ambiguous and will be construed in favor of coverage. <em>See High Country Assocs., </em>139 N.H. at 44. Having determined that all of the disputed provisions must be construed in favor of coverage, we conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>trial court did not err in ruling that Banks was a \u201cvolunteer worker\u201d under the Policy. Given this conclusion, we need not address Newell\u2019s judicial estoppel argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part; and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b244-6\">Dalianis, C.J., and Conboy, Lynn, and Bassett, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
