Defendant, West Columbia Condominium Association (West Columbia), is the agency in charge of maintaining and administering the common elements of the condominium building, as well as enforcing the covenants and restrictions of the association and collecting and disbursing its assessments. Several months following the foreclosure sale of the subject unit, V &amp; T requested from West Columbia a paid assessment letter. West Columbia issued a paid assessment letter, stating that $7803.97 was due and owing on the account. V &amp; T paid the total amount under protest. V &amp; T then filed a complaint in\n   <em>\n    assumpsit\n   </em>\n   . Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court denied both motions, but found that section 9(g)(4) of the Condominium Property Act (Act) ( 765 ILCS 605/9(g)(4) (West 2012) ) would apply to the matter at hand. The case then proceeded to trial, where the trial court found in favor of West Columbia. V &amp; T\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   now appeals. For the following reasons, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 Both parties state in their respective appellate briefs that the facts of this case are not contested. Indicative of this is the bystander's report, which contains an agreed-upon statement of what took place at trial and the trial exhibits deemed necessary for this appeal. However, before we discuss the testimony and evidence presented at trial, a review of the facts leading up to the trial is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 On November 12, 2009, West Columbia filed an action against Richard Dresmann, one of its unit owners, based on his failure to pay his share of the common expenses. Thereafter, the unit became subject to a foreclosure action. On October 16, 2013, V &amp; T purchased the subject condominium unit at a judicial foreclosure sale. The sale was confirmed by court order on December 16, 2013, and the deed was issued to V &amp; T on December 31, 2013. On February 6, 2014, V &amp; T tendered its first assessment payments to the association for the months of January and February 2014. In June, V &amp; T was preparing to sell the property, so it requested a paid assessment letter. On June 19, 2014, West Columbia's property manager issued a paid assessment letter to V &amp; T, advising it that a balance of $7803.97 was due and owing. V &amp; T paid the amount under protest so that it could sell the unit unencumbered, but subsequently filed the present action against West Columbia on July 22, 2014, seeking a judgment in the amount of $7803.97.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 In its complaint in\n   <em>\n    assumpsit\n   </em>\n   , V &amp; T argued that it became responsible for assessments beginning in January 2014 and that it paid all the assessments that became due thereafter. V &amp; T further argued that it was not responsible for any assessments left unpaid by the former owner because West Columbia obtained a judgment from the former owner in the November 2009 action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 West Columbia filed affirmative defenses in its answer to V &amp; T's complaint. In its first affirmative defense, based on section 9(g) of the Act, West Columbia stated that it had filed an action on November 12, 2009, based on the failure of the former owner to pay his share of the common expenses. West Columbia stated that on November 15, 2012, the circuit court of Cook County \"confirmed the existence of an arrearage regarding the unit owner's proportionate share of common expenses.\" West Columbia contended that, thereafter, there were no payments made to the account until February 2014. West Columbia argued that after filing an action to collect unpaid assessments, accruing assessments and reasonable attorney fees, and \"being awarded judgment by the court,\" West Columbia was entitled to seek assessments from the first day of the month after the sale as well as six months' worth of assessments preceding the institution of an action \"and attorney's fees.\" West Columbia also filed two counterclaims, which were later dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7 V &amp; T filed an amended complaint on December 16, 2015, adding a count for breach of fiduciary duty. V &amp; T argued that West Columbia breached its fiduciary duty toward plaintiff by forcing it to pay money it did not legally owe and which West Columbia knew or should have known V &amp; T did not owe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 8 Thereafter, West Columbia filed a motion for summary judgment. West Columbia argued that V &amp; T owed common assessments beginning on November 1, 2013, not January 1, 2014, and that by not making a payment until February 6, 2014, V &amp; T failed and refused to comply with section 9(g)(3) of the Act. West Columbia stated that the arrearage amount left unpaid\n   by the former owner was \"never cured\" and that the court had confirmed the continued existence of an arrearage amount. Citing section 9(g)(4) of the Act, West Columbia further argued that because that money was never paid, V &amp; T had to pay the amount in assessments that would have been due during the six months preceding the institution of the prior action to collect assessments. And finally, West Columbia argued that V &amp; T, as a foreclosure sale purchaser, had the duty to pay legal fees required by subsections (1) and (5) of section 9(g) of the Act. West Columbia claimed that V &amp; T offered \"no factual allegations, by way of affidavits, account ledgers, or proof of payments, to suggest that the amounts West Columbia had demanded were inaccurate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 9 V &amp; T then filed a response to West Columbia's motion for summary judgment, stating that West Columbia had obtained a judgment of $3011.12 in the action West Columbia had initiated against the former unit owner, \"with an\n   <em>\n    ad damnum\n   </em>\n   of $2,219.94.\" V &amp; T stated that the judgment date was February 1, 2010, and that there were also costs allowed in that case. V &amp; T stated, \"See Exhibit A, 'Condominium Statement' and Exhibit B 'West Covina Condo Assoc. v. Dresmann Docket.' \" Attached to the answer was Exhibit A, a statement of accounting for the subject property for the time period from January 31, 2009, to July 1, 2014. There was no indication of the amounts stated by V &amp; T in that document. Exhibit B was a printout of an electronic docket search of the previous case, which also did not state the judgment amount or that one was obtained. It merely stated that the amount of damages sought was $2219.94. There was also an attached affidavit by John Cloutier, the attorney for V &amp; T in the foreclosure sale, which stated: \"As indicated in the court records the association only filed one action against the former owner and obtained a judgment of $3,011.82.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 10 West Columbia filed a reply to V &amp; T's response to its motion for summary judgment, stating that the only circumstance where a foreclosure purchaser \"would not be required to comply with 9(g)(4) is if the 'outstanding assessments' were paid * * *. That does not apply here, because in the case at hand, the outstanding balance at the time of the sale was $9,630.34.\" West Columbia explained the accounting of the $7803.97 that appeared in the demand letter by stating that a \"significant portion\" of that amount was incurred after the foreclosure sale ($2580.45), and that there was $2791 in \"legal fees associated in the underlying action.\" West Columbia further stated that, upon review, \"it does appear that [V &amp; T] was overcharged in the amount of $849.96\" because the actual amount of six months of back assessments totaled $1582.56, instead of $2357.52. West Columbia included those three amounts in an attached exhibit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 11 On February 19, 2016, V &amp; T filed a reply, arguing that the exhibit containing the three numbers that allegedly made up the amount claimed in the demand letter should be stricken because \"there is no indication as to where the numbers came from.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 12 A hearing was held on the motions on April 12, 2016, where the trial court ruled that questions of fact existed and denied both motions, but found that section 9(g)(4) of the Act would apply to the matter at hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 13 The matter proceeded to trial, which was held on July 20, 2016. The parties stipulated to a bystander's report, which contained the following information. Counsel for V &amp; T argued in its opening statement that the deed for the subject unit was issued to V &amp; T on December 31, 2013, and that therefore V &amp; T became liable for assessments beginning in January\n   2014, under the rulings in\n   <em>\n    Household Bank, FSB v. Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3614870\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/229/173/\">\n    229 Ill. 2d 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=322%20Ill.%20Dec.%2015\">\n    322 Ill.Dec. 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=890%20N.E.2d%20934\">\n    890 N.E.2d 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008), and\n   <em>\n    Pembrook Condominium Ass'n-One v. North Shore Trust &amp; Savings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20IL%20App%20%282d%29%20130288\">\n    2013 IL App (2d) 130288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=377%20Ill.%20Dec.%20691\">\n    377 Ill.Dec. 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20N.E.3d%20607\">\n    2 N.E.3d 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Counsel argued that evidence would show that V &amp; T paid its assessments owed each month for January 2014 through June 2014. Counsel argued that the evidence would show that West Columbia was not entitled to any assessments for the period before V &amp; T purchased the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 14 West Columbia's counsel argued that V &amp; T purchased the subject unit at a judicial sale in October 2013 and did not tender any assessment payments for several months. As such, there was a lien on the property that had not been extinguished.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 15 Tam Huynh, secretary of V &amp; T, testified that V &amp; T purchased the property at a court-ordered foreclosure sale that was confirmed by the court on December 16, 2013, with the deed issued on December 31, 2013. Huynh testified that V &amp; T became responsible for paying assessments the following month, January 2014, and that he sent V &amp; T's first payment in late January or early February 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 16 Huynh testified that he paid a $25 late fee for the January payment, and that he then paid the February, March, April, May, and June assessments on time. He testified that when V &amp; T went to sell the property in June 2014, the association issued a paid assessment letter demanding payment of $7803.97, which V &amp; T paid under protest because most of the charges were incurred by the prior owner. V &amp; T then rested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 17 West Columbia's first witness was Mathieu Brown, the property manager for Westward Property Management, who testified that on October 1, 2013, there was a balance owed by the former owner of $9630.74. Brown testified that the association had rented out the unit during the time it had possession from 2009 until the judicial sale in question. Brown testified that the records showed that the association had received rent payments of $900 a month from October 2010 to July 2011, and $1000 a month from November 2011 to September 2012. Brown further testified that the balance on the account in November 2012 was $904.60. He testified that the records showed no assessment payments received between November 2012 and February 2014, but that assessments had continued to accrue during that time. Brown further testified that he did not know if West Columbia had ever filed an action to collect against the former owner, but that the records showed attorney charges in 2009, so he \"believed so.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 18 During closing arguments, V &amp; T argued that, according to\n   <em>\n    Pembrook\n   </em>\n   , a purchaser of a condominium unit at a foreclosure sale does not incur liability for condominium assessments due under section 9(g)(3) of the Act until the month after the court accepts the bid, confirms the sale, and the deed is issued. V &amp; T noted that the 2006 amendments to the Act added section 9(g)(4), which allows an association to collect up to six months of unpaid assessments left by the former owner for the six months preceding the institution of an action to collect filed against the former owner. V &amp; T argued, however, that if the assessments were paid, they were no longer collectable from the foreclosure purchaser. V &amp; T stated that the association filed an action to collect in November 2009, and obtained a judgment of $3012.11. The association then rented out the unit for the next two years and collected $22,000 in rent. V &amp; T argued that any money received in rent is first to be applied against the assessments sued for.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 19 West Columbia's counsel stated that the Act applied, the section 9(g)(1) lien was never extinguished due to V &amp; T's late initial payment, and the notice of sale had stated that V &amp; T was obligated to pay the section 9(g)(1) and section 9(g)(4) liens. West Columbia's counsel argued that assessment payments under section 9(g)(3) begin the month after the sale, which occurred in October 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 20 The report of proceedings states that the \"court ruled in favor of Defendant but would not state her reasoning or provide a written opinion.\" The order of judgment in the record merely states that judgment was entered in favor of West Columbia. V &amp; T filed a motion to reconsider, which was denied. V &amp; T now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 21 ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 22 The issue on appeal is whether V &amp; T should be reimbursed for any amount it paid to West Columbia under protest. \"Condominiums are creatures of statute and, thus, any action taken on behalf of the condominium must be authorized by statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Board of Directors of 175 East Delaware Place Homeowners Ass'n v.

V &amp; T contends that the term \"foreclosure sale\" in the statute encompasses not just the sale, but also the confirmation by the court, which occurred on December 16, 2013, and the delivery of the deed, which occurred on December 31, 2013. Accordingly, V &amp; T contends that assessments were not due until January 1, 2014, and thus its February 6, 2014, payment was timely. West Columbia contends that because the foreclosure sale occurred on October 13, 2013, the first payment was due on November 1, 2013, making V &amp; T's February 6, 2014, payment late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 27 To answer the question of whether V &amp; T's February 2014 payment extinguished the existing lien on the property, we must first decipher what \"judicial foreclosure sale\" means in the context of this statute. In section 9(g)(3) of the Act, the legislature stated that the payment of the unit's proportionate share of the common expenses assessed from and after the first day of the month after the date of the judicial sale, confirms the extinguishment of any lien created pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (g), \"where the judicial foreclosure sale has been confirmed by order of the court.\" 765 ILCS 605/9(g)(3) (West 2014). This last statement makes clear to us that the statute distinguishes between the judicial foreclosure sale, and the confirmation of that sale by the court. If we were to read \"judicial foreclosure sale\" as encompassing the confirmation of the sale, then the portion of the statute that states, \"where the judicial foreclosure sale has been confirmed by order of the court,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) would be rendered superfluous.

As noted above, the last part of the statute makes clear that such payment confirms the extinguishment of the condominium association's lien where the judicial foreclosure sale has been confirmed by the court. So the question then becomes what happens when the foreclosure sale occurs two months before the confirmation of sale.

However, while V &amp; T's payment was prompt under this particular set of circumstances, according to\n   <em>\n    Country Club Estates\n   </em>\n   , the payment should have included the assessments that had accrued starting from November 1, 2013, the month following the sale, instead of January 1, 2014, the month following the confirmation of the sale.

In this case, the action against the prior owner was initiated in November 2009.

The condominium association is similarly required to exercise a fiduciary duty toward the individual unit owners.\n   <em>\n    Duffy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20IL%20App%20%281st%29%20113577\">\n    2012 IL App (1st) 113577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=367%20Ill.%20Dec.%20341\">\n    367 Ill.Dec. 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=981%20N.E.2d%201069\">\n    981 N.E.2d 1069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In its amended complaint, V &amp; T argued that West Columbia breached its fiduciary duty \"when it extorted money from [V &amp; T] that [V &amp; T] did not owe and [West Columbia] did not have a right to collect.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 40 During trial, the only argument we see in the bystander's report relating to a breach of fiduciary duty is a statement during opening arguments: \"[V &amp; T]'s counsel stated that the evidence would show that the Defendants did not have a valid reason to force V &amp; T to pay the money it did not owe and had breached their fiduciary duty to it,\" and a similar statement during closing arguments. When V &amp; T's counsel asked Huynh why West Columbia would have demanded $7803.97, Huynh apparently attempted to testify that West Columbia was in a superior position and wrongfully and powerfully made demands for money. West Columbia's counsel objected on the basis that Huynh was being asked to speculate, and the trial court sustained the objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 41 In its motion to reconsider, V &amp; T argued that West Columbia had filed an action against the former unit owner and then obtained possession, collecting $22,250 in rent. V &amp; T argued that once the assessments for the six months preceding the institution of the action were paid, it did not have an obligation to pay any\n   assessments that had accrued before it acquired title and, thus, West Columbia breached its fiduciary duty to V &amp; T by charging them for those six months of assessments. However, as stated above, we find that the trial court's finding that the outstanding assessments had not been paid during the 2009 action to collect was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Accordingly, to the extent that V &amp; T alleged a breach of fiduciary duty based on the charge in the demand letter for the six months of assessments, we find there was no breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 42 To the extent that V &amp; T is arguing that West Columbia breached its fiduciary duty by otherwise overcharging it in the demand letter, we find that V &amp; T did not present sufficient facts to support such a finding. As stated above, to properly prove a breach of fiduciary duty, a plaintiff is required to prove the existence of a fiduciary duty, the breach of that duty, and damages proximately caused therefrom.\n   <em>\n    Duffy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20IL%20App%20%281st%29%20113577\">\n    2012 IL App (1st) 113577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 17,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=367%20Ill.%20Dec.%20341\">\n    367 Ill.Dec. 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=981%20N.E.2d%201069\">\n    981 N.E.2d 1069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Its only allegation of the existence of a duty is from section 18.4 of the Act, which states that in the exercise of their duties, the officers and members of a board shall exercise the care required of a fiduciary of the unit owners. 765 ILCS 605/18.4 (West 2014). V &amp; T does not allege which specific duty was breached in overcharging V &amp; T or what facts gave rise to the breach, except to say that the evidence would show that West Columbia overcharged V &amp; T for no valid reason.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Palm v. 2800 Lake Shore Drive Condominium Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20IL%20App%20%281st%29%20111290\">\n    2014 IL App (1st) 111290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 97,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=381%20Ill.%20Dec.%20222\">\n    381 Ill.Dec. 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20N.E.3d%20307\">\n    10 N.E.3d 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the plaintiffs properly alleged a breach when they argued that \"the defendants breached their fiduciary duty by 'failing to strictly comply with the clear requirements of' the declaration and/or the [Act] by failing to itemize reserves in the budget, failing to credit unit owners with surpluses, commingling operating and reserve expenses, allowing funds in bank accounts in excess of the FDIC-insured limit, failing to provide written notices of board meeting as required by the declaration and failing to present possible conflicts of interest to the unit owners for approval\"). V &amp; T's statements are conclusory in nature and unsupported by evidence in either the bystander's report or the pleadings. Accordingly, we cannot find that West Columbia breached a fiduciary duty to V &amp; T.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 43 Accordingly, the total amount owed by V &amp; T at the time of the demand letter should have been $510.94. V &amp; T paid $7803.97 under protest. For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court of Cook County and remand for the trial court to enter judgment in favor of V &amp; T for a portion of the payment it made under protest, in the amount of $7293.03.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b6 44 Reversed and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Justices Cunningham and Delort concurred in the judgment and opinion.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
