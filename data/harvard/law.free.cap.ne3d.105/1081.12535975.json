Jackson committed several criminal offenses in connection with a criminal gang. As a result, the trial court increased his overall sentence by thirty years according to the criminal gang enhancement statute. Jackson appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed the enhancement. Jackson and the State now dispute the extent of the trial court's sentencing authority on remand. This appeal requires us to determine what, if any, ability a trial court has to resentence a criminal defendant on the felonies that underlie a criminal gang enhancement when an appellate court has reversed that enhancement and remanded to the trial court. Guided by a general inquiry into the relationship between an enhancement and its underlying offenses, we find that the criminal gang enhancement statute unambiguously increases the punishment for all the felonies that underlie the enhancement, and vacating such an enhancement disturbs the punishment originally imposed. As such, after an appellate court reverses a criminal gang enhancement, the trial court on remand must resentence a defendant on all surviving underlying felonies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 26, 2015, Jackson and four friends decided to rob a person they thought had marijuana. Armed with two guns, they drove to the person's apartment building. Four members of the group, including Jackson, entered the building, made their way to the apartment, and encountered a group of about ten people smoking marijuana. A gunfight broke out, and the would-be thieves fled. All told, three of the intruders, one of the occupants of the apartment, and a neighbor's brother were injured in the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The State ultimately charged Jackson with nine offenses: two counts of burglary, as Level 1 felonies (Counts 1 and 2); one count of attempted robbery resulting in serious bodily injury, as a Level 2 felony (Count 3); four counts of attempted armed robbery, as Level 3 felonies (Counts 4, 5, 6, and 7); and two counts of aggravated battery, as Level 3 felonies (Counts 8 and 9). The State also sought to have Jackson's potential sentence enhanced under the criminal gang enhancement statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-50-2-15\">\n    Ind.

The trial court merged Count 2 with Count 1 but otherwise entered judgments of conviction on each count and accepted the jury's finding as to the enhancement. The court ordered that Jackson serve concurrent sentences of thirty years for Count 1, seventeen-and-one-half years for Count 3, and nine years each for Counts 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. It then applied the statutory enhancement of thirty years to Jackson's sentence, which resulted in a sixty-year overall sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Jackson appealed and argued, among other things, that the trial court committed fundamental error when it allowed the State to amend the information for the criminal gang enhancement. The Court of Appeals agreed and reversed the enhancement.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Jackson sought clarification instructing the trial court that it could not resentence him on the offenses underlying the vacated enhancement, and the State, in relevant part, requested that the clarification explicitly allow the trial court to resentence on those underlying offenses.

But this discretion can be limited when the sentencing occurs on remand. For example, the nuances of a particular sentence enhancement, as shown by the enhancement statute and related case law, can limit a trial court's sentencing discretion on remand.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Coble\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10906728\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/523/228/\">\n    523 N.E.2d at 228-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing the trial court's sentencing options on remand after a habitual offender enhancement had been vacated);\n   <em>\n    Greer v.

Because the parties here dispute the extent of the trial court's sentencing discretion on remand, we begin with an overview of the criminal gang enhancement statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The criminal gang enhancement statute increases the penal consequences for committing one or more felony offenses in connection with a criminal gang.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   I.C. \u00a7 35-50-2-15. The State must initially show that the defendant has committed at least one underlying felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.C. \u00a7 35-50-2-15(b) - (d) (referring to \"the offense,\" \"the felony offense,\" \"the underlying felony,\" and \"the underlying felonies\").\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

If the State carries\n   this burden, the statute provides for \"an additional fixed term of imprisonment\" based on the underlying felony or felonies. I.C. \u00a7 35-50-2-15(b), (d). This enhancement then runs consecutive to the underlying sentence and cannot be suspended. I.C. \u00a7 35-50-2-15(e) - (f). With this statutory scheme in mind, we turn to the task at hand: determining the extent of the trial court's sentencing authority on remand after vacating a criminal gang enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The general inquiry illustrated by\n    <em>\n     Coble\n    </em>\n    is instructive in determining a trial court's sentencing authority on remand after a criminal gang enhancement has been reversed.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Both parties direct us to our prior decision in\n   <em>\n    Coble\n   </em>\n   as a means to resolve this matter, and the Court of Appeals below heavily relied on the case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State argues that\n   <em>\n    Coble\n   </em>\n   and subsequent cases allow a trial court, on remand from a reversal of a criminal gang enhancement, to resentence a defendant on the felonies related to the enhancement. Jackson argues that\n   <em>\n    Coble\n   </em>\n   plainly prohibits a trial court from resentencing on any felonies underlying a vacated criminal gang enhancement. Both parties' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Coble\n   </em>\n   is partially misplaced.\n   <em>\n    Coble\n   </em>\n   dealt with issues specific to habitual offender enhancements-not criminal gang enhancements-and cannot be mechanically applied to disputes outside that context. However, we find the general inquiry illustrated by\n   <em>\n    Coble\n   </em>\n   instructive here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Coble was initially convicted of two counts of burglary and found to be a habitual offender.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 228. The trial court sentenced him to concurrent terms of two years on each count.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It attached the habitual offender enhancement to count 2, enhancing it by thirty years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On appeal, this Court reversed the habitual offender enhancement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After vacating the enhancement on remand, the trial court sentenced Coble to consecutive terms of six years on count 1 and eight years on count 2.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Coble appealed again, and this Court reversed the trial court in part.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 228-29. First, we reversed the change of Coble's sentence on count 1 because it \"was not directly affected by the habitual offender status.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 228. Second, we affirmed the change of the sentence on count 2 because the attachment of the enhancement to that count increased the punishment for that burglary offense from two years to thirty-two years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 229. Vacating the enhancement thus disturbed the punishment, and we found it \"proper for the trial court to sentence [Coble] on [count 2], and to impose any sentence permissible under the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Flowers v.

Finally, we affirmed the trial court's change to consecutive sentences finding that the trial court had a duty to reassess its concurrent/consecutive determination after the initial sentence for count 2 was set aside.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11022600\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/518/1096/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Coble\n   </em>\n   provides two takeaways in the context of this appeal. First,\n   <em>\n    Coble\n   </em>\n   's narrow holding shows an application of the\n   specific law of habitual offender enhancements to the two particular offenses Coble committed to determine the trial court's sentencing authority on remand. Second, more broadly,\n   <em>\n    Coble\n   </em>\n   illustrates a general inquiry into how an enhancement affects the punishment for the offenses the defendant committed to determine a trial court's sentencing authority after vacating the enhancement. We find\n   <em>\n    Coble\n   </em>\n   's specific application of the habitual offender enhancement statute unhelpful here, but its general inquiry is instructive in the context of criminal gang enhancements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The specific holdings of\n    <em>\n     Coble\n    </em>\n    are based on nuances of the habitual offender enhancement statute and related case law-not the criminal gang enhancement statute-and do not control here.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Coble\n   </em>\n   involved a habitual offender enhancement, and its specific holdings relied on particular aspects of such enhancements. Because this appeal involves the criminal gang enhancement, which has important differences from the habitual offender enhancement,\n   <em>\n    Coble\n   </em>\n   's specific holdings do not control here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A habitual offender enhancement increases punishment based on recidivism and is not intrinsically related to the underlying offense it enhances.

As a result, the habitual offender enhancement is not intrinsically linked to any particular current offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12009240\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/680/526/#p527\">\n    680 N.E.2d at 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nevertheless, this Court has consistently held that the trial court must specify to which underlying felony the enhancement applies.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Winn v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11092837\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/748/352/#p360\">\n    748 N.E.2d 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 360 (Ind. 2001) ;\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Because habitual offender enhancements do not naturally relate to any particular underlying offense, the trial court must specifically attach the enhancement to an underlying offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A criminal gang enhancement, by contrast, is fundamentally related to its underlying felony or felonies. The enhancement increases punishment based on the manner in which the defendant committed the underlying felony or felonies. I.C. \u00a7 35-50-2-15(b) (2014 Repl.). Additionally, the increase in the defendant's sentence depends on the length of the sentence for the underlying felony or felonies. I.C. \u00a7 35-50-2-15(d). Thus, the criminal gang enhancement is fundamentally tied to the underlying felony or felonies. Because of this intrinsic connection and the basis for the enhanced punishment, the criminal gang enhancement does not experience the same potential constitutional pressures as the habitual offender enhancement, and there is no need for the trial court to specifically \"attach\" the criminal gang enhancement to an underlying felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Coble\n   </em>\n   addressed issues related to habitual offender enhancements rather than criminal gang enhancements. While both enhancements increase the punishment of\n   crimes, they differ in their aims, requirements, and results. Because of these differences,\n   <em>\n    Coble\n   </em>\n   cannot be mechanically applied to this case. The specific holdings of\n   <em>\n    Coble\n   </em>\n   providing a trial court's sentencing options on remand after vacating a habitual offender enhancement do not control a trial court's options after a criminal gang enhancement has been vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The general inquiry represented by\n    <em>\n     Coble\n    </em>\n    , however, is instructive here.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Coble\n   </em>\n   's relevance here is not its narrow holding but its general inquiry into the relationship between an enhancement and the punishment for the underlying offenses. This general inquiry asks: For what offense(s) does the enhancement provide an increased punishment? If the enhancement provides an increased punishment for a particular offense (or multiple offenses), the sentence for that offense (or those offenses) can be adjusted on remand after the enhancement is vacated because vacating the enhancement disturbs the punishment. Viewed in this light, the specific holdings of\n   <em>\n    Coble\n   </em>\n   can be understood as an application of this general inquiry in the context of habitual offender enhancements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This general inquiry reflects the realities of sentencing. The Court of Appeals has noted that \"[w]hen a[ ] habitual offender enhancement is to be added to a defendant's sentence, it certainly is a factor in the trial court's decision of whether to impose the presumptive sentence for the underlying felony or to increase or decrease the presumptive sentence due to aggravating or mitigating circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11026970\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/494/1001/#p1003\">\n    494 N.E.2d 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1003 (Ind. Ct. App. 1986). This statement, based on the general understanding that an enhancement will increase a defendant's sentence, applies as equally to criminal gang enhancements as to habitual offender enhancements. The general inquiry into the connection between the enhancement and the underlying offense(s) that receives an increased punishment comports with this commonsense understanding of some of a trial court's sentencing considerations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We find this general inquiry instructive in determining the trial court's authority to resentence Jackson on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The statute then provides that \"[a] sentence imposed under this section\n   shall run consecutively to the underlying sentence.\" I.C. \u00a7 35-50-2-15(e).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In cases with multiple underlying felonies punished together, the \"underlying sentence\" will necessarily be the total sentence for those underlying felonies. In these situations, the additional term of imprisonment is \"equal to the longest sentence imposed for the underlying felonies.\" I.C. \u00a7 35-50-2-15(d)(2). The result of this scheme is that, when multiple felonies provide the basis for the criminal gang enhancement, the enhancement increases a defendant's overall punishment by a term equal to the longest individual, underlying sentence. Effectively, the legislature has provided a system that groups the felonies underlying a criminal gang enhancement and increases the punishment on the group. Thus, because the criminal gang enhancement increases the punishment for all the underlying felonies, a trial court's authority on remand after a reversal of such an enhancement extends to resentencing on each underlying felony. The trial court's authority likewise extends to its determination as to whether the sentences for the underlying felonies should be concurrent or consecutive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flowers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11022600\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/518/1096/\">\n    518 N.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1097-99 ;\n   <em>\n    Gootee v.

Franklin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7101074\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/997/1020/#p1026\">\n    997 N.E.2d 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1026 (Ind. 2013) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bushong v.

The legislature has provided that a purpose of the criminal code is to \"give judges maximum discretion to impose sentences based on a consideration of all the circumstances related to the offense[.]\" I.C. \u00a7 35-32-1-1(7). Our reading of the criminal gang enhancement statute provides trial courts with the discretion to craft an appropriate sentence without undue concern for what sentence might be left if an appellate court reverses the enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Here, the jury found the criminal gang enhancement applied to each felony offense charged. Based on the statutory formula, the trial court sentenced Jackson to an additional fixed term of imprisonment of thirty years. Thus, Jackson's punishment for committing the underlying felonies (Counts 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) was increased by thirty years because he committed each offense in the manner specified by the criminal gang enhancement statute. When the trial court vacates the criminal gang enhancement on remand, it will necessarily disturb the punishment originally imposed for the underlying felonies. With the original sentences disturbed, the trial court on remand must resentence Jackson on each underlying felony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Based on the general inquiry from\n   <em>\n    Coble\n   </em>\n   and the unambiguous language of the criminal gang enhancement statute, a trial court on remand from a reversal of a criminal gang enhancement is to resentence the defendant on all the felonies underlying that enhancement. Thus, we remand to the trial court with instructions to follow the instructions given by the Court of Appeals that relate to those portions of\n   <em>\n    Jackson I\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jackson II\n   </em>\n   we have summarily affirmed, including the instruction to vacate the criminal gang enhancement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We further instruct the trial court on remand to resentence Jackson on Counts 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 in accordance with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Rush, C.J., and David, Massa, and Slaughter, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Effective July 1, 2016, the statute refers to criminal organizations rather than criminal gangs.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pub.

Response to Pet. to Transfer, p. 6. While we agree that the subsection contemplates some difference in how the terms of imprisonment are served, we do not read it as creating sentences so separate as to be unrelated. As discussed throughout this opinion, the criminal gang enhancement statute provides an enhancement that is intimately related to its underlying felonies as well as the corresponding sentences. Despite any separation in the service of the sentences, vacating the enhancement still disturbs the punishment imposed on the underlying felonies. Finding otherwise would deny the enhancement's very nature and contravene the legislature's intent.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    The trial court may, in its discretion and subject to generally applicable resentencing limitations,\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Alabama v.
