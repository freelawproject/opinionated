Thus, I would find that the R.C. 2744.02(B)(1) exception to immunity applies to the BOE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 37} In finding that an exception to immunity applies, I would then move on to the third tier of the immunity analysis, which is to consider whether there exists a defense or immunity to liability under R.C. 2744.03.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 38} R.C. 2744.03(A) lists five particular defenses or immunities that a political subdivision may assert to establish non-liability: (1) the employee involved was engaged in the performance of a judicial, quasi-judicial, prosecutorial, legislative, or quasi-legislative function; (2) the employee's conduct, other than negligent conduct, was required by law or authorized by law; (3) the action or failure to act by the employee that gave rise to the claim of liability was within the employee's discretion with respect to policy-making, planning, or enforcement powers; (4) the action or failure to act by the political subdivision or employee resulted in injury to a person who had been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a criminal offense and who was serving any portion of the person's sentence by performing community service work for or in the political subdivision; and (5) the injury resulted from the exercise of judgment or discretion in determining whether to acquire, or how to use, equipment, supplies, materials, personnel, facilities, and other resources. None of these defenses apply here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Thus, I would find that the BOE was not entitled to immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 40} While I would find that the BOE is not entitled to immunity based on the alleged negligence by Steele, I would still find that Steele is entitled to immunity. The reason for the difference being that under the third tier of the immunity analysis, R.C. 2744.03(A)(6) provides for broader immunity for employees:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   (6) In addition to any immunity or defense referred to in division (A)(7) of this section and in circumstances not covered by that division or sections 3314.07 and 3746.24 of the Revised Code, the employee is immune from liability unless one of the following applies:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   (a) The employee's acts or omissions were manifestly outside the scope of the employee's employment or official responsibilities;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   (b) The employee's acts or omissions were with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   (c) Civil liability is expressly imposed upon the employee by a section of the Revised Code. * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   {\u00b6 41} In this case, there is no allegation that Steele was acting outside of the scope of her employment as a bus driver. Moreover, Steele's actions of driving over, and ultimately parking on top of, a large pothole may constitute negligence. But these actions were not undertaken with malice, bad faith, or in a wanton and reckless manner. Finally, there is no allegation that the Revised Code expressly imposes civil liability on Steele.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 42} In conclusion, for the reasons stated above, I would find that the R.C. 2744.02(B)(1) exception to immunity applies to reinstate liability as to the BOE and that no defenses to immunity apply to the BOE. Therefore, I respectfully dissent from that part of the majority opinion holding that the R.C. 2744.02(B)(1) exception to immunity does not apply to the BOE and that the BOE is entitled to immunity. Moreover, I would find that Steele is entitled to immunity based on R.C. 2744.03(A)(6), which the majority does not discuss. Therefore, I concur in judgment only with that part of the majority opinion\n   that determines that Steele is entitled to immunity.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
