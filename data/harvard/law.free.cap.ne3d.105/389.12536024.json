J.C., A.M.'s biological father, appeals the trial court's judgment that awarded the agency permanent custody of A.M. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court's judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In May 2016, six-and-one-half-year-old A.M. reported to a teacher that her mother's live-in boyfriend, G.D., sexually abused her \"100s of times.\" The agency subsequently sought and obtained emergency temporary custody of A.M. and her younger brother, E.D.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The agency additionally filed separate complaints that\n   alleged A.M. and E.D. are abused, neglected, and dependent children. The agency requested the court to grant it temporary custody of the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The trial court later adjudicated A.M. abused and dependent and adjudicated E.D. dependent. The court dismissed the remaining allegations contained in the complaints. The court also placed the children in the agency's temporary custody. The court further found that the agency used reasonable efforts to prevent the children's continued removal from the home but that the mother's decision to continue living with G.D., the perpetrator, made reunification \"inadvisable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The agency developed a case plan for the family. The case plan indicated that the mother would need to change the following behavior in order to reduce risk to the children: (1) \"learn new discipline techniques and strategies\"; (2) \"learn protective parenting capacities to prevent future abuse/neglect of her children\"; and (3) \"work with a mental health provider to learn about sexual abuse, her own protective capacities and the effects of this type of abuse.\" The case plan required the mother to work with a parent mentor, engage with Help Me Grow and any other service providers regarding E.D.'s development,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   regularly visit the children, and undergo counseling in order to understand A.M.'s sexual victimization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The case plan indicated that A.M.'s father, J.C., needs to develop a father-daughter relationship with A.M., obtain safe and stable independent housing, obtain a source of income to provide for A.M.'s basic needs, and learn new parenting techniques and strategies for a child that has experienced sexual abuse. The case plan required J.C. to regularly visit A.M., work with a parent mentor, and engage with Integrated Services to obtain housing, counseling, and case management needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On April 7, 2017, the agency filed a motion to modify the disposition to permanent custody. The agency asserted that the children cannot be placed with their parents within a reasonable time or should not be placed with their parents. The agency alleged that the mother has not made progress in addressing the sexual abuse that A.M. suffered and has not acknowledged that G.D. sexually abused A.M. The agency further asserted that even though the mother claims that she no longer shares a relationship with G.D., the two recently were spotted together at a grocery store and were observed leaving the store in the same vehicle. The agency argued that the mother's failure to address A.M.'s sexual abuse and to admit that G.D. was the perpetrator illustrates that she cannot adequately protect her children. The agency claimed that returning the children to their mother would not be safe when the mother refuses to believe that her paramour could have perpetrated sexual abuse against A.M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The agency additionally asserted that A.M. cannot be placed with her father within a reasonable time or should not be placed with him. The agency alleged that her father is not an appropriate placement due to his mental health issues and his lack of appropriate housing for A.M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} At the permanent custody hearing, Nickie Webb, A.M.'s mental health counselor, testified that she sees A.M. approximately once per week. Webb explained that although A.M. has done well in foster care, A.M. is anxious about the children services case and would like to return home to her mother. Webb stated that\n   A.M. enjoys visiting with her father, but A.M. has not mentioned a desire to live with her father. Webb related that A.M. definitely does not want to see G.D. and is \"angry with him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Webb indicated that A.M. has expressed concern that the agency's involvement is \"her fault\" as a result of reporting G.D.'s sexual abuse. Webb thus explained that A.M. should be placed in an environment with a caregiver who will reinforce that A.M. is not to blame for her family's children services involvement and who will validate A.M.'s feelings. She additionally related that A.M. might be afraid to report any future instances of abuse if A.M. felt that her mother did not believe her first report, or if she thought that her disclosure might lead to another removal from her home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The children's foster mother testified that the children have lived in her home for a little over one year. She stated that when A.M. initially entered her care, A.M. lacked appropriate boundaries with strangers. The foster mother related that A.M. has since developed more appropriate boundaries and displays more caution around strangers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The foster mother explained that when E.D. initially entered her home, he exhibited a speech delay. Further testing revealed that E.D. has a rare chromosomal abnormality that includes speech and cognitive delays. The foster mother testified that E.D.'s speech has improved since entering her care. Both children are doing well in her home and are very pleasant children. The foster mother indicated that A.M. and E.D. appear bonded to one another and interact like typical siblings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The children's foster father testified that in early March 2017, he observed the mother and G.D. together at a grocery store. He stated that they left the store in the same vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} ACCS parent mentor and family support worker Jennifer Brooks testified that she provides parent mentoring services and also supervises visitations. Brooks explained that she contacted all three parents involved in the case. She related that before she could complete a home visit with J.C., he began sending her inappropriate messages. Brooks stated that J.C. asked her if she was single and if she wanted to be in a relationship. Brooks immediately notified her supervisor and closed the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Brooks stated that she started working with the mother and G.D. around the beginning of August 2016. She explained that she closed G.D.'s case in January 2017 because he had completed all tasks listed on the initial referral. Brooks continues to work with the mother. Brooks related that she helped the mother with developmental information, parenting skills, potty training, and protective capacities regarding A.M. She testified that she discussed A.M.'s sexual abuse allegations and how to protect A.M. from further abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Brooks indicated that throughout her discussions with the mother, the mother consistently related that she did not believe A.M.'s disclosures. Instead, the mother offered varying explanations for A.M.'s allegations: J.C. concocted the story and told A.M. to blame G.D. when J.C. actually was the perpetrator; G.D.'s brother was the perpetrator; A.M. is malicious and would say things to get attention or to get G.D. in trouble; A.M. walked in on G.D. and the mother having sex and may have gotten ideas from viewing them; A.M. may have seen pornographic movies; and A.M. is extremely jealous of E.D. and may have made up the story to get attention. Brooks explained that the mother's denials have made it impossible to work with the\n   mother on her protective capacities. Brooks further noted that the mother and G.D. did not actually separate until the children had been in the agency's custody for five or six months and that they informed Brooks multiple times that they separated only because the agency expected them to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Brooks agreed that the mother generally cooperated with her and appeared eager to learn. Brooks stated that the mother \"did very well with parent mentoring. She took every piece of information and she also applied it during visitation.\" Brooks told the mother that she is \"a really good mom.\" Brooks testified that the mother even asked if parent mentoring services could continue if the children returned home; and Brooks encouraged the mother to instead state, \"when the kids come home.\" Brooks explained that the mother shared her plan to ask her sister to move into the house so that someone would always be at home to care for the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Despite the mother's parenting skills, the mother still refused to recognize that G.D. perpetrated sexual abuse upon A.M. This caused Brooks great concern regarding the mother's \"capacity to protect\" the children. Brooks did not agree with the mother's counsel that the mother has progressed in her understanding from shock, to denial regarding the number of occurrences, to acceptance. Brooks stated she does not believe the mother has \"made progress in that aspect.\" Brooks related that the mother did not simply express disbelief at the number of occurrences, but instead, the mother did not believe that the incidents even occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Tara Carsey testified that she worked with the family to develop a case plan to address A.M.'s sexual abuse and E.D.'s delays. Carsey indicated that the agency had concerns that the mother continued to live with G.D. for five or six months after A.M.'s disclosure and the children's removal. Carsey stated that she discussed the parties' living situation with the mother and advised the mother that her chances of having the children returned to her home would be increased if G.D. did not live in the home. Carsey related that G.D. moved out of the mother's home in late October or early November 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Carsey explained that although the mother complied with the case plan requirements to obtain mental health counseling and participate in parent mentoring, the mother still did not believe that G.D. sexually abused A.M. Carsey offered to show the mother a recording of A.M.'s forensic interview to which she declined. Carsey indicated that the mother's denial led her to believe that the mother would not be able to adequately protect the children from future abusive situations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Carsey testified that E.D. had speech delays when he first entered the agency's care and that the mother now understands E.D.'s issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Carsey stated that A.M.'s father J.C. consistently visited her. However, Carsey also testified that the agency had concerns with J.C.'s mental health and that A.M. should not be placed with him. She related that during a home visit, J.C. exhibited strange behavior. J.C. was not making sense when he spoke. He talked about how he was being watched with the cameras on the poles out front and listened to with the devices that were in the house. J.C. had been admitted to Appalachian Behavioral Health where he spent about three weeks. Although J.C. was receiving medication and case management to work on his social skills, Carsey still had concerns with J.C.'s cognitive ability and ability to protect A.M. Carsey further indicated that J.C.'s living situation was\n   not conducive for a healthy environment for A.M. J.C. lived in a three-bedroom trailer with his mother, stepfather, and two adolescents who are in his mother's legal custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Carsey related that in October 2016, the agency determined that it would seek permanent custody of the children, but the agency did not actually file its permanent custody motion until April 2017. Carsey explained that in October 2016, the agency decided that it would seek permanent custody because the mother and G.D. had not fully separated and J.C.'s mental health was a serious concern. Carsey stated that after the agency decided that it would seek permanent custody, it continued to provide services to the family, but the agency did stop reunification efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Carsey ultimately testified that placing the children in the agency's permanent custody would serve their best interests. She explained that the children need a safe and stable home, with people who can keep them safe from abuse and neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The children's guardian ad litem testified that granting the agency permanent custody of the children would serve their best interests. The guardian ad litem agreed that the mother was not capable of providing the children with a safe home because of her unwillingness to believe A.M. about being abused. The guardian ad litem related that the mother would not be able to adequately protect A.M. from future abuse if the mother does not believe A.M.'s story. Likewise, the guardian ad litem did not believe that J.C. could provide A.M. with a safe, stable home due to his mental health issues and lack of independent housing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Michele Papai testified that in late May 2017, the mother was referred to her for counseling. Papai testified that the mother appeared to be motivated. Papai explained that the mother still has \"a question in her mind\" whether G.D. was the perpetrator and would like to undergo therapy with A.M. to resolve the issues. Papai opined that the mother would be capable of parenting the children and keeping them safe. Papai testified that they discussed how to keep the children safe if they returned home. She stated that they also discussed that G.D. should have no contact with A.M. Papai believed that the mother possessed an understanding of how to keep her daughter and her son safe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 26} The mother testified that she is capable of protecting the children; and that although A.M.'s disclosure initially shocked her, she has accepted that A.M. suffered sexual abuse. She stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   It was shocking at first. I'm always home so I'm struggling with the fact of when [G.D.] could have done it, and how he could have done it with me always being home. But there is still always the possibility that something did happen and I just finally come [sic] to accept that even with me always being home and always being around him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The mother explained that she was a stay-at-home mother and could not understand when G.D. could have perpetrated the abuse. She stated that when she, A.M., E.D., and G.D. lived together, it was not \"even physically possible\" for G.D. and A.M. to have been left alone for the number of times that A.M. alleged the abuse occurred. The mother related that G.D. did not have the opportunity to be alone with A.M. She explained that G.D. worked until 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning and that A.M. left for school before G.D. woke up. The mother stated that G.D. left for work at 4:30 pm and A.M. arrived home from school around 4:00 pm. She testified that G.D. worked five nights per\n   week \"but he even went on his days off cause they needed more help.\" The mother indicated that G.D. \"was always at work\" and that he \"did not like being at home.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The mother explained that she and G.D. are no longer romantically involved and that she will not have any contact with him, except as necessary to maintain G.D.'s relationship with E.D. The mother stated that she and G.D. met at a grocery store in March 2017 only to ensure that they did not duplicate Easter gifts for E.D. The mother further related that she will \"not get with anybody else,\" but instead will \"direct all of [her] attention to just the kids.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 29} The mother indicated that she will be able to keep the children safe. She stated that her sister will move into the home and will be able to watch the children during the mother's working hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 30} The mother testified that after she learned about E.D.'s rare genetic disorder, she researched his condition in order to learn more about it. She explained that the disorder may cause heart problems later in life and was the cause of his speech delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 31} On cross-examination, the mother explained that during her relationship with G.D., G.D. mentioned that he had lost custody of his daughter. G.D. indicated that the child's mother physically abused the child and that the agency would not allow G.D. to obtain custody of his child. The mother was not alarmed that G.D. had lost custody of his own daughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 32} The mother stated that she had difficulty believing that A.M. suffered sexual abuse as many times as she claimed and denied that she ever stated that she did not believe A.M. She agreed that she offered alternate explanations for A.M.'s story. The agency's counsel asked the mother about her statement that A.M. and G.D. could not have been alone together, and the mother explained: \"I don't see how it could have happened * * *, but I did say that there's always that possibility that something did happen.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 33} J.C. testified that in 2012, he stopped living with K.M. and A.M. He stated that after he stopped living with A.M., he saw her \"every once in awhile.\" J.C. indicated that his visits with A.M. occurred mostly around holidays or her birthday. J.C. explained that he currently lives with his mother, stepfather, eleven-year-old niece, and twelve-year-old nephew. He stated that he gets along well with his niece and nephew and that A.M. also interacts well with them. J.C. believes that he, his mother, and stepfather can provide A.M. with an appropriate home. J.C. related that the household has sufficient income to provide for A.M.'s basic needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 34} J.C. testified that in the summer of 2016, he spent three weeks at Appalachian Behavioral Healthcare (ABH). He explained that he had a nervous breakdown and anxiety and stress. J.C. related that he was diagnosed with PTSD and stress syndrome. He indicated that he was prescribed medication and that he continues to take his medication. J.C. stated that the medications help him and that he does not believe that his mental health constitutes a barrier to parenting A.M. On cross-examination, J.C. stated that he also was diagnosed with schizophrenia and was prescribed medication for it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 35} J.C. explained that after his release from ABH, he started \"equine therapy.\" He testified that approximately two to three months after he started the therapy, he learned that it was the wrong type of counseling for him. J.C. indicated that he then started seeing a mental health counselor and meets with her almost every week. J.C. testified that he has a case manager at Integrated Services and that\n   they work on housing. J.C. related that he has applied for HUD housing and plans to eventually move out of his mother's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 36} J.C. stated that he did ask Brooks if she would like to go on a date and that he has not yet received any parent mentoring services. He indicated that he did not understand why the agency failed to refer him to a different parent mentor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 37} J.C.'s mother, P.W., testified that she and her husband, along with J.C., could provide a safe and stable permanent home for A.M. She admitted that she had prior children services involvement; but she stated that she worked with the agency and the cases were eventually closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 38} The mother's sister, S.M., testified that she intends to move in with K.M. if the children return home. She stated that she would be able to help the mother care for the children. S.M. related her belief that the mother is more protective of the children than she had been before their removal and that she is careful about who she allows around the home. S.M. disputed any assertion that the mother and G.D. are still romantically involved. She stated that although they were spotted together at a grocery store in March 2017, they met only to discuss E.D.'s Easter gifts and to ensure they did not duplicate gifts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 39} On August 16, 2017, the trial court granted the agency permanent custody of the two children. The court found, by clear and convincing evidence, that permanent custody is in the children's best interests and that the children cannot be placed with their parents within a reasonable time or should not be placed with their parents. The court thus granted the agency permanent custody of the two children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 40} The parties timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Mother\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 41} K.M. raises two assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   First Assignment of Error:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   The trial court's decision terminating parental rights, [sic] was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Second Assignment of Error:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Children services' decision to ask for termination of parental rights was extremely premature, and failed to satisfy the \"reasonable efforts\" requirements imposed by law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Father\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 42} J.C. raises one assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   The trial court's ruling to terminate appellant's parental rights, and grant Athens County Children Services permanent custody of his daughter, was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LAW AND ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 43} The mother's first assignment of error and the father's sole assignment of error assert that the trial court's decision to grant the agency permanent custody of the children is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Both parents argue that the evidence does not clearly and convincingly show that placing the children in the agency's permanent custody is in their best interests. The parents also tangentially contend that the evidence does not clearly and convincingly support the trial court's R.C. 2151.414(E) determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 44} In her second assignment of error, the mother asserts that the trial court erred by granting the agency permanent custody when the agency had not actually\n   engaged in reasonable efforts aimed at reunifying the family, but instead, quickly determined to seek permanent custody without affording the mother an adequate opportunity to establish that she is willing and able to provide the children with a legally secure permanent home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 45} The same essential legal principles and analysis guide our discussion of all of the assignments of error. Thus, for ease of analysis we have combined our discussion of the assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

She asserts that she consistently visited the children, researched E.D.'s genetic condition, and attended the majority of the children's medical appointments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The mother additionally contends that the evidence fails to support a finding that she would allow the children to suffer sexual abuse in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 60} Several other courts have considered whether a parent's denials of abuse in the home or minimization of an abuser's conduct constitute sufficient evidence to establish that a parent failed to substantially remedy the conditions that caused the children's removal, is unwilling to provide them with an adequate permanent home, or is unwilling to prevent a child from suffering physical, emotional, or sexual abuse.

In that case, the agency filed abuse and dependency complaints concerning the mother's five children due to her lack of cooperation in an investigation regarding allegations that her husband had sexually abused his five-year-old stepdaughter. A magistrate later determined to place two of the children in the agency's permanent custody and to place the other three children in a relative's custody. In reaching its decision, the magistrate emphasized the mother's repeated refusal to recognize that her husband-the child's stepfather-had sexually abused her daughter. The mother additionally did not believe her daughter's allegations and claimed that the child's therapist had influenced the child. Moreover, the mother remained married to stepfather, even though she claimed that they had separated. The magistrate determined that the \"mother would not be dutiful in protecting [her daughter] from further abuse, and could not genuinely support or participate in [her daughter]'s trauma therapy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.

Additionally, the mother and the stepfather had been spotted together on multiple occasions. The mother and stepfather's conduct caused the agency to doubt the sincerity of the mother's willingness to protect her children from the stepfather. The appellate court also recognized the trial court's observation that the \"main requirement\" the agency expected the mother to fulfill was \"to acknowledge that her husband sexually abused [her daughter] and that she would discontinue association with him, forbid him to be near the children and protect them from him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28. The court additionally believed that the mother's conduct showed that she was unwilling to provide an adequate permanent home for the children or to prevent them from suffering\n   abuse. The court thus concluded that placing the children with their mother is not in their best interest.

The court pointed out that the caseworker testified that when the child reported the abuse to her mother, the mother did not believe her and called her a liar; and the children's therapist stated that the abused child reported an incident when the mother observed the father and the child in bed together but the mother did nothing about it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   {\u00b6 66} The court further noted that the mother testified and claimed that she was unaware of the abuse and that the child never reported any abuse to her.

The child's grandfather reportedly sexually abused the mother, which led the trial court to issue a no-contact order between the child and the grandfather. The court noted that the evidence showed that the mother continued to live with either the child's grandfather, despite the no-contact order, or her paramour/friend who previously had sexually abused R.S.

The mother first contended that the evidence did not support the trial court's determination that she failed continuously and repeatedly to remedy the conditions that caused the children's removal. The appellate court rejected the mother's argument. The court began by noting that the mother's argument rested upon her \"flawed assertion\" that the agency removed the children due to the sexual abuse allegations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28. The court explained that although sexual abuse \"precipitated [the agency] referral,\" it was not the actual cause for their removal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Instead, the agency removed the children due to the mother's \"disbelief that 'her boyfriend/the father of her children is the type of person who would' sexually abuse [the child], and [the mother]'s lack of insight as to how she continued to put her children at risk for abuse by allowing them to have contact with [him].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The appellate court pointed out that the \"trial court specifically held that [the mother] failed to remedy the conditions causing the removal 'by her ongoing contact with [the father], her failure to effectively and adequately address the significant and extensive issues of * * * [the child's] sexual abuse in spite of intensive and ongoing efforts of the therapists, and [the] mother failed to adequately prepare a plan for the children about what they should and would do if [the father] further exposes himself to the family.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   {\u00b6 70} The court concluded that the evidence supported the trial court's findings.

Additionally, the parenting education caseworker testified that although the mother completed a twelve-week parenting course-in addition to an extended course-the mother still lacked the ability to protect her children. The mother's social worker testified that although the mother initially refused to believe the sexual abuse allegations, by the\n   time of the permanent custody hearing, the mother \"had accepted that some sexual abuse had occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33.

The court disagreed that the evidence failed to support the trial court's finding. The court noted that the trial court determined that the mother \"demonstrated a lack of commitment to the children by failing to report [the abuse] to the police when family members expressed concerns to her\" and by elevating her relationship with the father over the children's safety.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37. The appellate court concluded that even though the evidence clearly showed that the mother \"loves her children,\" \"regularly visited them,\" and \"was committed to physically providing for them,\" the evidence further showed that the mother \"failed to demonstrate a commitment to the safety and welfare of her children,\" which \"was necessary to demonstrate [the mother]'s willingness to provide an adequate permanent home.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   {\u00b6 72} Next, the court considered the mother's argument that the evidence failed to support the court's R.C. 2151.414(E)(14) finding.

In that case, the mother's paramour raped two of her children, yet the mother did not believe the allegations. At the permanent custody hearing, a psychologist testified that the agency requested her to evaluate whether the mother would be able to protect her children from potential abuse in the future.

The agency asserted that the mother's continued doubt established her unwillingness to take appropriate steps to protect the child. At the permanent custody hearing, the mother's social worker testified that the mother \"made little, if any, progress * * * principally because she doubted that [the child] had been molested and consistently denied that [the stepfather] could have molested the child.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The social worker additionally indicated that the mother \"seemed to be most concerned with clearing the names of herself and her husband.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The social worker explained that the mother \"neither expressed concern about the possibility that [the child] had been traumatized by the abuse nor asked what she could do to help her daughter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Another witness stated that the mother attended a twenty-week support program for parents of sexually abused children and never acknowledged that her daughter suffered sexual abuse.

The court stated that the record indicated that the mother's lack of progress resulted from her failure to acknowledge that her daughter was sexually abused at all, and not from her failure to name her husband as the perpetrator.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court found no evidence that the case plan required the mother to recognize her husband as the perpetrator.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court additionally observed that the goal of the mother's case plan was \"therapeutic improvement\" and to \"equip[ her] with the knowledge to protect [the child] from further abuse, regardless of the identity of the perpetrator.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court pointed out that two witnesses \"testified that because [the mother] was unwilling to admit that [the child] had been sexually abused, she could not progress in her therapy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court thus concluded that the mother \"did not lose permanent custody * * * because she refused to admit that her husband * * * sexually abused [the child].

Instead, for a period of five to six months after the children's removal, the mother continued living with the alleged perpetrator. The trial court apparently found that the mother's decision to continue living with the person whom her daughter identified as the perpetrator of sexual abuse spoke volumes about her commitment to her children and her willingness to protect her children. The court noted that during the time the mother remained living with G.D., she sat through the adjudicatory hearing and listened to the recording of her daughter's graphic descriptions of G.D.'s sexual abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court described the testimony as \"compelling.\" Yet even after the mother heard this testimony, she continued living with G.D. for another three or four months. Even then, the agency's caseworkers stated that the mother and G.D. indicated that they were separating only to regain custody of the children. Thus, for a period of at least five to six months, the mother completely and utterly failed to take any steps whatsoever to ensure that her children could return home to an environment free of sexual abuse. Instead, she did not believe A.M's allegations at all and continued to live with A.M.'s abuser. The mother's five- to six-month period of vacillating between her children and her live-in boyfriend does not create confidence that the mother will prioritize her children's safety and place their best interest over her own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   {\u00b6 81} When the mother finally did separate from G.D., her expressed intention was to do so only to regain custody of the children. She did not, therefore, give the court much reason to believe that she intended to sever all contact with G.D. (except as might be necessary to address the care and custody of their biological child, E.D.). Additionally, several months after G.D. and the mother purportedly separated, the foster father spotted them together\n   and a grocery store and saw them leave in the same vehicle. While the mother offered an innocent explanation for their contact, the trial court was entitled to discredit it, given the mother's prior refusal to separate from G.D. for nearly six months, her unwillingness to recognize him as the perpetrator, and her indications that she and G.D. intended to separate only to regain custody of the children. Because this is a credibility matter, we will not second-guess the trial court's finding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The mother may have removed the physical threat G.D. posed, but the mother's failure to believe that G.D. sexually abused her daughter shows that the mother is unwilling to place her children's best interests and safety first. Instead, it shows that she doubts her daughter, has not adequately resolved the issues surrounding her daughter's sexual abuse, and lacks a parent's primal protective instincts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   {\u00b6 84} Furthermore, if the mother does not believe A.M., then she cannot possibly begin to address A.M.'s mental needs as it relates to her sexual abuse and to provide appropriate emotional support. The mother's denials of sexual abuse show that the mother \"could not genuinely support or participate in [her daughter's] trauma therapy\" and is unprepared to meet the child's emotional and mental health needs.\n   <em>\n    Z.P.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2151.011(B)(1) (defining \"[a]dequate parental care\" to mean, in part, \"the provision by a child's parent or parents of specialized services warranted by the child's physical or mental needs\"). Her disbelief makes it less likely that she will follow through with A.M.'s recommended treatment and less likely that she will provide adequate support.\n   <em>\n    D.H.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, by placing her romantic relationship over her children, the mother demonstrated a lack of commitment to them.\n   <em>\n    See A.R.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    D.H.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   {\u00b6 85} While we do not discount the mother's efforts to comply with the case plan activities, the mother unfortunately remained unwilling to believe A.M.'s sexual abuse allegations. Without a firm belief in A.M.'s allegations, the mother could not begin to appropriately learn how to care for A.M. and her emotional health-both now and in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   {\u00b6 86} Consequently, we do not believe that the trial court's finding that the children cannot be placed with their mother within a reasonable time or should not be placed with them is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    b. R.C. 2151.414(E)(16)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   {\u00b6 87} The trial court appears to have determined that A.M. cannot be placed with J.C. based upon R.C. 2151.414(E)(16), which allows a court to find that a child cannot be placed with a parent within a reasonable time or should not be placed with the parent based upon any other relevant factor. J.C. asserts that the trial court did not provide him a sufficient opportunity to establish that he can provide A.M. with an adequate permanent home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   {\u00b6 88} We believe that the record contains clear and convincing evidence of\n   other relevant factors to support the trial court's finding that A.M. cannot be placed with J.C. within a reasonable time or should not be placed with him. J.C. does not have independent housing, even though the case plan specifically indicated that he would need to find safe and stable independent housing. Instead, J.C. lives with his mother, stepfather, and two adolescent relatives. The agency did not deem this home an appropriate placement for A.M. due to J.C.'s mother's past children-services involvement; and J.C. did not suggest that he had any other alternative living arrangements in place. Although J.C. testified that he has applied for HUD housing and eventually plans to move to independent housing, he did not indicate that he would have independent housing within a reasonable period of time. While we commend J.C.'s efforts to address his mental health and his devotion to visiting A.M., unfortunately, he did not obtain appropriate housing and did not state that he would have independent housing within a reasonable period of time. Thus, without independent housing, A.M. cannot be placed with J.C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   {\u00b6 89} Furthermore, even if J.C. had independent housing, his mental health issues raise concerns regarding his ability to provide A.M. with the emotional support she needs in order to address G.D.'s sexual abuse. The guardian ad litem testified that J.C.'s mental health issues prevent him from providing A.M. with the emotional support she needs in order to adequately cope with G.D.'s sexual abuse. Moreover, the agency presented testimony that A.M. displays more of a care-giver role with J.C. Given A.M.'s young age and sexual abuse suffered at the hands of her mother's live-in boyfriend, we do not believe that placing her in an environment in which she will feel like the care-giver would be in her best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   {\u00b6 90} Consequently, we do not believe that the trial court's finding that A.M. cannot be placed with J.C. within a reasonable time or should not be placed with him is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Best Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   {\u00b6 91} K.M. and J.C. additionally challenge the trial court's best interest determination. The mother claims that the record does not contain clear and convincing evidence to support the trial court's finding that placing the children in the agency's permanent custody is in their best interests. J.C. asserts that the record does not contain clear and convincing evidence to support the trial court's finding that placing A.M. in the agency's permanent custody is in her best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   {\u00b6 92} R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) requires a trial court to consider all relevant, as well as specific factors to determine whether a child's best interest will be served by granting a children services agency permanent custody. The specific factors include: (1) the child's interaction and interrelationship with the child's parents, siblings, relatives, foster parents and out-of-home providers, and any other person who may significantly affect the child; (2) the child's wishes, as expressed directly by the child or through the child's guardian ad litem, with due regard for the child's maturity; (3) the child's custodial history; (4) the child's need for a legally secure permanent placement and whether that type of placement can be achieved without a grant of permanent custody to the agency; and (5) whether any factors listed under R.C. 2151.414(E)(7) to (11) apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   {\u00b6 93} Determining whether granting permanent custody to a children services agency will promote a child's best interest involves a delicate balancing of \"all relevant [best interest] factors,\" as well as the \"five enumerated statutory factors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <em>\n    In re C.F.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5805729\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/113/73/\">\n    113 Ohio St.3d 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007-Ohio-1104\">\n    2007-Ohio-1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=862%20N.E.2d%20816\">\n    862 N.E.2d 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 57, citing\n   <em>\n    In re Schaefer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3760758\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/111/498/\">\n    111 Ohio St.3d 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006-Ohio-5513\">\n    2006-Ohio-5513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=857%20N.E.2d%20532\">\n    857 N.E.2d 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 56 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re C.G.,\n   </em>\n   9th Dist.

The agency did not raise any concerns regarding the mother's interaction with the children during visitations. However, the agency expressed deep concern regarding the mother's protective capacities due to her lack of faith in her daughter's sexual abuse allegations. Therefore, while the mother and her children may share a strong bond and interact well with each other, the mother displayed an unwillingness to believe her daughter over her paramour, which thus supports a finding that the mother's relationship with her children is not her first priority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re L.D.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-1037\">\n    2017-Ohio-1037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=86%20N.E.3d%201012\">\n    86 N.E.3d 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 38 (8th Dist.)

(Sadler, J., dissenting) (stating that a legally secure permanent placement means \"a placement that is stable and consistent\"); Black's Law Dictionary 1354 (6th Ed. 1990) (defining \"secure\" to mean, in part, \"not exposed to danger; safe; so strong, stable or firm as to insure safety\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1139 (defining \"permanent\" to mean, in part, \"[c]ontinuing or enduring in the same state, status, place, or the like without fundamental or marked change, not subject to fluctuation, or alteration, fixed or intended to be fixed; lasting; abiding; stable; not temporary or transient\"). Thus, \"[a] legally secure permanent placement is more than a house with four walls. Rather, it generally encompasses a stable environment where a child will live in safety with one or more dependable adults who will provide for the child's needs.\"\n   <em>\n    M.B.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56. Furthermore, a trial court that is evaluating a child's need for a legally secure permanent placement and whether the child can achieve that type of placement need not determine that terminating parental rights is \"not only a necessary option, but also the only option.\"\n   <em>\n    Schaefer\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64. Rather, once the court finds the existence of any one of the R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a)-(e) factors, R.C. 2151.414(D)(1) requires the court to weigh \"all the relevant factors * * * to find the best option for the child.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   {\u00b6 102} Here, the evidence supports a finding that the children need a legally secure permanent placement and that they cannot achieve this type of placement without granting the agency permanent custody. The mother's unwillingness to recognize G.D. as the perpetrator of A.M.'s sexual abuse and hesitancy to even believe that A.M. was sexually assaulted shows that she cannot provide the children with a legally secure permanent placement. The children would not be safe and\n   secure with a mother who fails to believe her children's abuse allegations. G.D.'s sexual abuse of A.M. demonstrates that he is not a safe and secure placement for either child. Although J.C. would like to be able to provide A.M. with a legally secure permanent placement, he did not demonstrate that he will be able to do so in a reasonable period of time. Furthermore, his mental health issues raise concerns whether he would be able to provide a proper environment for A.M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    e. R.C. 2151.414(E)(7)-(11)\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   {\u00b6 103} The trial court found that R.C. 2151.414(E)(11) applied to G.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <strong>\n    f. Balancing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   {\u00b6 104} In light of the foregoing, we do not believe that the trial court's best interest determination is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Although the evidence shows that the children share a bond with their mother, the mother's consistent failure to believe A.M.'s allegations and decision to continue to reside with A.M.'s abuser for more than five months does not show that she will prioritize their safety over her desires. Furthermore, her unwillingness to believe A.M. illustrates that she cannot provide her children with a home where they will feel safe and where all of their emotional needs will be met. The mother's conduct displayed that she lacks one of a parent's primal instincts-to protect her children. Even though the mother claims that she finally believes A.M.'s allegations and that G.D. was the perpetrator, the trial court found her claims dubious. We will not second-guess its determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   {\u00b6 105} The totality of the evidence additionally shows that placing A.M. with J.C. is not in her best interest. J.C. does not have appropriate housing for A.M. and did not set forth a timeframe for when he might be able to obtain appropriate housing. Moreover, even if J.C. obtained appropriate housing, the evidence does not show that J.C. would be able to provide for all of A.M.'s emotional needs. J.C.'s own mental health issues, although treated with medication, call into question his ability to adequately address A.M.'s emotional health as it relates to her sexual victimization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   {\u00b6 106} Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule the mother's first, and J.C.'s sole, assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <strong>\n    D. REASONABLE EFFORTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   {\u00b6 107} In her second assignment of error, the mother asserts that the trial court erred by granting permanent custody of the children to the agency when the agency failed to use reasonable efforts to reunify her with the children. She charges that the agency prematurely decided to seek permanent custody, rather than affording her a reasonable amount of time to show that the children could be reunified with her. The mother additionally asserts that the agency's efforts were not reasonable. She argues that the reunification efforts should have intensified after G.D. moved out of the home, that the agency should have coordinated counseling between the mother and A.M., and that the agency should have offered the mother specific training to learn how to recognize abuse. The mother essentially asserts that the trial court's reasonable-efforts finding is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   {\u00b6 108} R.C. 2151.419(A)(1) requires a trial court to determine whether a children services agency \"made reasonable efforts to prevent the removal of the child from the child's home, to eliminate the continued removal of the child from the child's home, or to make it possible for the child to return safely home.\" However, this statute applies only at \"adjudicatory, emergency, detention, and temporary-disposition hearings, and dispositional hearings for abused, neglected, or dependent children * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    C.F., supra\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 41 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re C.B.C.,\n   </em>\n   4th Dist.

Obviously, the agency would not risk placing the children in the home or allowing unsupervised visits in the home while G.D., the perpetrator of A.M.'s sexual abuse, still lived there. Once G.D. moved out of the home, the agency indicated that it did not allow overnight or unsupervised visits in the home due to the mother's consistent refusal to believe A.M.'s allegations. The agency expressed concern that if the mother did not believe A.M., then she might try to discuss the allegations with A.M. and attempt to persuade A.M. that her allegations were wrong. The agency additionally did not want the mother discussing the allegations with A.M. at all.
