For the reasons set forth below, this Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Summa hired Ms. Messer on June 29, 2015 as a special procedures technologist in the interventional radiology department at its Barberton Hospital facility. In this position, Ms. Messer assisted doctors and others on medical procedures involving the veins and arteries of patients. Ms. Messer was employed for approximately one month before being terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Upon being hired, Ms. Messer received Summa's employee handbook. Contained within the handbook was a provision on probationary employment which permitted Summa to terminate an employee within the first 90 days of employment without notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} At the time of Ms. Messer's employment, Summa had a policy requiring all technicians in the interventional radiology department to change in and out of hospital-issued scrubs at the beginning and end of the shift, either in the unisex locker room or in the bathroom located inside the locker room. Doctors and nurses also used the unisex locker room, but had different policies regarding scrubs. Both the locker room and its bathroom could be locked. Ms. Messer did not agree, nor comply with the changing policy. She wore her own scrubs instead of the hospital-issued scrubs. She wore the scrubs home at the end of her shift instead of changing into street clothes. When she did change her clothes, she would use the public restroom instead of the unisex locker room or its bathroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Ms. Messer claims that on one occasion, she walked in on a male employee who was changing in the unisex locker room. Ms. Messer further claims she reported this incident to three of her co-workers and to team leader L.M., but these verbal reports were unconfirmed. Ms. Messer did not file a written report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} After the first incident, Ms. Messer claims to have stopped using the unisex locker room. Yet, according to Ms. Messer, a few days later she was changing in the locker room when someone began to walk-in. She immediately shouted for the person to leave and he/she did. Ms. Messer never saw the person and, thus, does not know if it was a male or female. Again, Ms. Messer claims to have reported this second incident to two of her co-workers and to team leader L.M., yet these verbal reports are also unconfirmed. Ms. Messer also did not file a written report for the second incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Sometime during her one-month employment, Ms. Messer's co-worker K.T., team leader L.M., and supervisor S.B., all\n   met with her and addressed the fact that her job performance and knowledge did not correspond to the skills and background she had listed in her resume. Shortly thereafter, Ms. Messer was counseled twice by team leader L.M. about wearing the hospital-issued scrubs, wearing personal scrubs home, and not using the public restroom to change clothes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} As to her resume, Summa claims it discovered after Ms. Messer was hired that she had not disclosed her previous employment with Akron General Medical Center. During the interview, supervisor S.B. took notes on Ms. Messer's resume. The handwritten notes indicate \"medical issues-temp position[,] interventional cath[.,] St[.] Vincent vasc[.,], UH PT currently.\" Ms. Messer faults S.B. for not asking follow-up questions regarding who the employer was for the temporary position. Supervisor S.B.'s expectation was that Ms. Messer's resume would include all of her employment history, relevant and non-relevant to the posted position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Ms. Messer testified that she did not include the Akron General Medical Center information because it was a \"term position\" and averred that she \"tailor[ed] the experience in the resume to meet the posted requirements for the job [she was] seeking.\" Despite her assertion that the resume was \"tailor[ed]\" for the interventional vascular technologist position at Summa, the resume included a position at W.F. Hann and Sons where Ms. Messer worked as an \"Accounting Administrator\" and \"[h]andled all clerical and accounting functions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On July 28, 2015, the day before Ms. Messer's termination, she requested permission from supervisor S.B. to leave work early. S.B. asked Ms. Messer how many of the required HealthStream courses she still needed to complete. Ms. Messer indicated that she only had two courses that needed to be completed and was granted permission to leave early based on her representation. After Ms. Messer had left work, S.B. learned from the education department that Ms. Messer, in fact, had five courses remaining. Ms. Messer claimed that she had answered truthfully because she had watched a couple of the courses, but deferred taking the tests until the next day, which she did. In Ms. Messer's opinion, watching the courses was the same as completing the courses because the tests only took \"three minutes to do.\" However, S.B. viewed Ms. Messer's representation to be false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On that same day, Ms. Messer was involved in a procedure that resulted in a hematoma to a patient. Summa contends the injury to the patient was a result of a mistake made by Ms. Messer during the procedure. Ms. Messer asserts the mistake was not her fault, but the fault of the other medical personnel because they did not provide her with the necessary equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The following day, Ms. Messer met with team leader L.M. and supervisor S.B. for an exit interview. During this meeting, S.B. advised Ms. Messer that her employment was being terminated within the 90-day probationary period. The reasons for her termination were recorded on the Summa New Employee/Internal Transfer Probationary Evaluation Form (\"Termination Form\"). Both Ms. Messer and supervisor S.B. signed the Termination Form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In response to her termination, Ms. Messer filed a complaint alleging gender discrimination under R.C. 4112.02(A) based on sexual harassment, retaliatory discrimination under R.C. 4112.02(I), and aiding, abetting, inciting, compelling, or coercing an unlawful discriminatory act under R.C. 4112.02(J). Summa filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial\n   court granted Summa's motion for summary judgment on all three claims. Ms. Messer timely appeals this judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Contrary to App.R. 12(A)(2) and App.R. 16(A), Ms. Messer has asserted three assignments of error and argued them jointly because, in her view \"[a]ll [of the] [a]ssignments of [e]rror are [b]ased upon a common fact and law argument.\" While Ms. Messer is essentially arguing the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Summa in each assignment of error, the facts and law are not common because there are three separate causes of action and there are procedural arguments being asserted. This Court agrees with Summa that Ms. Messer's improper briefing method has \"present[ed] a convoluted legal analysis.\" For ease of discussion, this Court will reorder and address the assignments of error individually.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 2\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED PREJUDICIAL AND REVERSIBLE ERROR BY CREDITING [SUMMA'S] CONTRADICTED AND OPINION EDITED VERSION OF [THE] FACTS ON [THE] MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In her second assignment of error, Ms. Messer argues that the trial court erred by rejecting her affidavit and by failing to consider the deposition transcripts of the Summa employees that she filed and, thereby, prejudiced her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Ms. Messer's Affidavit\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Ms. Messer asserted that the standard of review for all of her assignments of error is de novo. She is incorrect. In the second assignment of error, Ms. Messer challenges the trial court's determination that her affidavit contradicted her deposition testimony without any explanation and, thus, did not consider the affidavit. A trial court's decision whether to strike an affidavit is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel. Cassels v. Dayton City School Dist.

While the trial court only specifically addressed an alleged discrepancy between Ms. Messer's deposition testimony and paragraph 5 of her affidavit, it generally concluded that \"[s]he ha[d] merely asserted bald allegations by way of her contradictory affidavit\" and would \"not consider the affidavit or find that it creates a genuine issue of material fact where these matters [were] concerned.\" Because the trial court struck Ms. Messer's entire affidavit, this Court will review the propriety of that action before addressing the merits of the motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 18} \"An affidavit of a party opposing summary judgment that contradicts former deposition testimony of that party may not, without sufficient explanation, create a genuine issue of material fact to defeat the motion for summary judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Byrd v.

In that instance, the trial court must engage in a two-part analysis of the inconsistent affidavit.\n   <em>\n    Craddock\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. First, the trial court \"must determine whether the statements in the affidavit contradict or merely supplement the affiant's earlier testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20142443\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, the trial court must decide whether the affiant has presented \"a sufficient explanation for the inconsistency.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20142443\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Here, the trial court based its decision not to consider Ms. Messer's affidavit solely on the contents of paragraph 5, which stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   While I was employed at Summa [ ], I was required to use a common access, unisex locker room by my supervisor [L.M.] and her supervisor [S.B.] to change my clothes in before starting my work shift and afterwards. I objected and refused to use the room as I am uncomfortable, offended[,] and embarrassed when I am caught in a state of undress by total strangers who are men while changing my clothes and I am put into a position where I have to walk in on others[,] including men[,] while they are changing clothes when I have to use the unisex locker room in issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The trial court interpreted this paragraph to mean that Ms. Messer \"was caught half-dressed on multiple occasions and that there were multiple times when she walked in on males while they were changing.\" The trial court explained that Ms. Messer's deposition testimony, however, only identified two incidents. The trial court adopted Summa's rationale that Ms. Messer's affidavit indicated multiple incidents and this contradicted her deposition testimony of two incidents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Ms. Messer argues the word \"multiple\" is not in her affidavit and thus the trial court erred in interpreting her affidavit to say multiple incidents. While this Court agrees that \"multiple\" does not appear in her affidavit, the trial court's interpretation of paragraph 5 of the affidavit as describing \"multiple\" incidents is proper. \"[M]ultiple\" is defined as \"more than one.\"\n   <em>\n    The Merriam-Webster Dictionary\n   </em>\n   325 (New Ed.2005). The affidavit describes two different scenarios, thus it describes multiple incidents. Similarly, Ms. Messer testified to two different incidents, which also equates to multiple incidents. Thus, Ms. Messer's affidavit is consistent with her deposition testimony. Because paragraph 5 of the affidavit did not conflict with Ms. Messer's deposition testimony, the trial court erred in not considering this paragraph of the affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Upon review of an affidavit, a trial court may strike only the portion of the affidavit that is inadmissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wesley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-473\">\n    2013-Ohio-473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20544053\">\n    2013 WL 544053\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 27. Here, the trial court rejected the entire affidavit as containing only \"bald allegations\" that were \"contradictory\" to her deposition testimony. There was no additional analysis as to how the remaining paragraphs of the affidavit were contradictory to the deposition testimony. Accordingly, the trial court erred in not considering the entire affidavit based solely on its analysis that paragraph 5 of the affidavit was inadmissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wesley\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 22} While Ms. Messer has shown that the trial court erred in striking her entire affidavit, she has failed to support her claim of prejudice resulting from that error. The appellant bears the burden of affirmatively demonstrating the error on appeal and substantiating his or her arguments in support. App.R. 16(A)(7) ; Loc.R. 7(B)(7). \"Claimed error alone may not support reversal; the party assigning\n   error must demonstrate prejudice resulting therefrom.\"\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati Ins. Co. v.

Therefore, Ms. Messer has failed to show that the erroneous exclusion of the cumulative information contained within her affidavit affected the trial court's decision to enter judgment in Summa's favor. Consequently, the erroneous exclusion of Ms. Messer's affidavit did not affect the substantial rights of the parties and, thus, constituted harmless error that this Court must disregard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civ.R. 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Deposition Transcripts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Ms. Messer argues that the trial court did not consider any of the four depositions that she submitted as evidence to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. \" '[A] trial court's ruling on the use of the deposition of a witness is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.' \"\n   <em>\n    Clinton v.

The trial court set forth seven instances in its judgment entry of \"uncontroverted evidence that [Ms. Messer] was terminated * * * for reasons unrelated to any of her claims.\" The trial court indicated the source for each of the seven points. While the bulk of the support for the trial court's decision came from Ms. Messer's deposition, the trial court also relied upon the depositions of human resource representative E.H, team leader L.M., and supervisor S.B. These three depositions were produced by Ms. Messer in opposition to Summa's summary judgment motion. Thus, contrary to Ms. Messer's position, the trial court did consider the deposition transcripts she submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Ms. Messer also argues that Summa's conduct in submitting only a partial transcript of her testimony amounted to \"severe editing of the record\" and she avers that she was prejudiced by the \"absence [of] the full context of [her] deposition answers.\" (Emphasis deleted.) Ms. Messer overlooks the fact that she could have remedied any prejudice by filing a complete copy of the transcript herself. Moreover, Ms. Messer does not provide this Court with any case law or rule to support her position that the entire transcript should be filed. \"An appellant bears the burden of formulating an argument on appeal and supporting that argument with citations to the record and to legal authority.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Ms. Messer testified that she was ordered by team leader L.M. to use the locker room to change in and out of the hospital scrubs.

While Ms. Messer testified and averred in her affidavit that she complained many times to team leader L.M. that she was uncomfortable using the unisex locker room, a fact which L.M. denies, she did not testify or aver to having made this complaint to supervisor S.B. As to her co-workers, Ms. Messer testified that she told them about the two locker room incidents. However, she did not testify that she told her co-workers that the incidents made her feel uncomfortable about changing in the locker room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Supervisor S.B. testified that she completed the Termination Form and it was her decision to fire Ms. Messer. This is corroborated by team leader L.M.'s testimony that the Termination Form was not \"[her] documentation,\" that she has never been in a supervisory role, and that her previous involvement in a discipline situation with another employee consisted of sitting in on the discipline and termination meetings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Further, supervisor S.B. testified, to repeated questioning, that she did not know that Ms. Messer \"complained about having to use the unisex locker room, because she didn't like being walked in on\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   \" S.B.'s testimony was that the reason Ms. Messer was using the public restroom in lieu of the locker room to change did not interest her, so she never discussed the issue with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 57} The record does not reflect that team leader L.M. told supervisor S.B. about Ms. Messer's complaint. As to co-worker K.T., she testified that her only discussion with supervisor S.B. was to tell her that Ms. Messer was wearing scrubs home. Upon review of the evidence, Ms. Messer has failed to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact that someone other than supervisor S.B. made the decision to terminate Ms. Messer and that S.B. had direct knowledge of Ms. Messer's protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 58} Ms. Messer relies on circumstantial evidence to create an inference that supervisor S.B. had knowledge of Ms. Messer's protected activity. S.B. testified that shortly before Ms. Messer's termination, she learned from team leader L.M. that Ms. Messer was changing in the public restroom instead of the locker room. According to S.B., because she does not micromanage her staff, she deferred to team leader L.M. to counsel Ms. Messer on the prohibited use of the public restroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 59} Ms. Messer claims that the fact that supervisor S.B. \"testified that [Ms. Messer] was told not to change in a public restroom [at the hospital] * * * leads us to infer [Ms. Messer] complained about having to change in the unisex locker room prior to her termination.\" (Emphasis deleted.) Ms. Messer is asking this Court to\n   infer, first, that her conduct was a complaint and, second, that the substance of her complaint was that she was uncomfortable changing in the unisex locker room because she did not want to see males or have males see her changing. The record does not support either inference and is, therefore, insufficient to establish knowledge by supervisor S.B. of Ms. Messer's protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 60} While team leader L.M. brought the issue of changing in the public restroom to supervisor S.B.'s attention, in light of S.B.'s hands-off approach to management, the record only supports a finding that team leader L.M. was reporting a policy violation by Ms. Messer to S.B., and not that S.B. knew Ms. Messer complained about changing in the unisex locker room. Ms. Messer has failed to present any \"specific facts\" to support these inferences, and instead has improperly relied upon \" 'speculations, hunches, [or] intuitions.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mulhall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9438443\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/287/543/#p552\">\n    287 F.3d at 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Visser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10543815\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/924/655/#p659\">\n    924 F.2d at 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, Ms. Messer has failed to present evidence supporting the inference that supervisor S.B. knew of Ms. Messer's protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 61} In an attempt to infer knowledge upon supervisor S.B., Ms. Messer argues for the first time on appeal the \" 'cat's paw' liability analysis.\" Ms. Messer asserts that \"an employer who commits [an] adverse action that constitutes retaliation may be found liable even if it is not personally aware of the protected activity of the [p]laintiff if it is shown the adverse act was caused by higher management's reliance on information produced by a subordinate employee who had a motive to retaliate against the plaintiff.\" However, Ms. Messer did not advance this argument to the trial court and cannot now raise it on appeal in the first instance.\n   <em>\n    Burden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-2746\">\n    2014-Ohio-2746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202918455\">\n    2014 WL 2918455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 12. Accordingly, this Court will not consider this portion of her argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 62} Additionally, Ms. Messer's deposition testimony regarding the discussions during the exit interview does not create an inference of knowledge by supervisor S.B. Ms. Messer testified that, during the exit interview with team leader L.M. and supervisor S.B., she told them that \"[changing in the locker room was] not something [she was] comfortable [ ] doing.\" Despite this general statement by Ms. Messer, supervisor S.B. did not inquire as to why Ms. Messer was uncomfortable, nor did Ms. Messer elaborate during the interview as to why she was uncomfortable. Based on Ms. Messer's limited testimony, in conjunction with supervisor S.B.'s testimony relative to the discussion during the exit interview, Ms. Messer has not presented any specific facts or evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer that supervisor S.B. knew of Ms. Messer's protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   {\u00b6 63} Ms. Messer has not presented any direct evidence and the circumstantial evidence upon which she relies is speculative and does not support the inference that supervisor S.B. knew of Ms. Messer's protected activity when she was terminated. Accordingly, Ms. Messer has failed to meet her\n   <em>\n    Dresher\n   </em>\n   burden of establishing the existence of a genuine issue of material fact that Summa had knowledge of Ms. Messer's protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 64} In light of this Court's analysis of the second element of a retaliation claim, the parties' arguments as to the other elements are moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App.R. 12(A)(1)(c). The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment as to the retaliatory discrimination claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Aiding and Abetting an Unlawful Discriminatory Act Under R.C. 4112.02(J)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 65} Pursuant to R.C. 4112.02(J), the following conduct is another instance of an unlawful discriminatory practice:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   For any person to aid, abet, incite, compel, or coerce the doing of any act declared by this section to be an unlawful discriminatory practice, to obstruct or prevent any person from complying with this chapter or any order issued under it, or to attempt directly or indirectly to commit any act declared by this section to be an unlawful discriminatory practice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 66} In its summary judgment motion, Summa presented a single argument as to this cause of action: because no unlawful discriminatory act was committed,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Summa could not be liable under this statute. Ms. Messer responded that there was evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact as to unlawful discriminatory practices by Summa and that the \"three women went out of their way to make sure [Ms. Messer] was terminated and the ground they picked, happened to be a violation of [R.C.] 4112.02(A) and (I).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {\u00b6 67} As discussed above, Ms. Messer has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding her claims of gender discrimination arising from sexual harassment and retaliatory discrimination. Accordingly, there is no evidence regarding an unlawful discriminatory practice under R.C. 4112.02(A) - (I) and Summa is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this cause of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pittman v.
