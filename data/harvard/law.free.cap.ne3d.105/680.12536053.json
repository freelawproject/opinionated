JONES, SR., J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} In this appeal, defendant-appellant the city of Cleveland, division of water, appeals the trial court's January 2017 judgment denying its motion for summary judgment based on immunity. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Plaintiff-appellee Alpha Plaza Investments, Ltd. (\"Alpha Plaza\") is the landlord for commercial property located in Highland Heights, Ohio. The city of Cleveland provides water for the tenant businesses in Alpha Plaza.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In April 2016, Alpha Plaza initiated this action against the city, asserting relief under two counts. In Count 1, Alpha Plaza alleged that, beginning in 2015, the\n   city overcharged it for water usage at the property. It alleged that (1) it maintains \"individual sub-meters for each tenant,\" (2) at all relevant times, the tenants' usage was consistent, and (3) two leak detection companies it hired did not find any leaks. Alpha Plaza further alleged that it informed the city of the overcharge, but the city \"has refused to credit for the charges, or make any determination as to the meter and whether or not the same was functioning properly during all relevant times.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In Count 2, Alpha Plaza alleged that it is \"entitled to a refund or credit to its account in an amount of approximately $45,278.20, based on historical use rates and overcharges,\" and sought that amount in damages under the theory of unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The city filed a motion for summary judgment, in which it contended that it is \"immune under R.C. \u00a7 2744.02 from Plaintiff's intentional tort claims of unjust enrichment and overcharging.\" The city further maintained that \"[e]ven if Plaintiff's overcharging claims were construed as negligence, Plaintiff cannot show that the City acted negligently in any way while providing water service to Plaintiff's retail property.\" Alpha Plaza opposed the city's motion. The trial court found the city's contention that Alpha Plaza's claim of overbilling was an intentional tort \"curious.\" The court held that a \"fair reading of the Complaint and knowledge of applicable law establishes that [Alpha Plaza] has pled a claim of negligence per se,\" for which immunity would not apply. Thus, the trial court denied the city's motion for summary judgment as it related to Alpha Plaza's claim of overbilling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} However, the trial court found the city's motion well taken as to Alpha Plaza's unjust enrichment claim: \"Equitable claims of promissory estoppel, unjust enrichment, and quantum merit are not actionable against a municipality.\" Trial court's January 23, 2017 judgment, citing\n   <em>\n    Sylvester Summers, Jr. Co., L.P.A. v. E. Cleveland\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 98227,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-1339\">\n    2013-Ohio-1339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201384892\">\n    2013 WL 1384892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23. Accordingly, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the city on Alpha Plaza's unjust enrichment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The city now appeals, and presents the following three assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   I. The Trial Court erred in denying summary judgment to the Defendant under the statutory immunity provisions of R.C. \u00a7 2744, et seq., because Plaintiff's overbilling claim does not fall under any of the exceptions to political subdivision immunity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   II. The Trial Court erred in denying summary judgment to the Defendant under the statutory immunity provisions of R.C. \u00a7 2744.02(A)(1), because Plaintiff's Complaint fails to allege that any purportedly negligent act was performed by Defendants' employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   III. The Trial Court erred in denying summary judgment to the Defendant on Plaintiff's \"negligence\" claim because it is undisputed that Defendant's meters are functioning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Generally, an order denying a motion for summary judgment is not a final appealable order subject to appellate review. However, R.C. 2744.02(C) states that \"[a]n order that denies a political subdivision or an employee of a political subdivision the benefit of any alleged immunity from liability as provided in this chapter or any other provision of the law is a final order.\" Further, the Ohio Supreme Court has held, \"when a trial court denies a motion in which a political subdivision or its employee seeks immunity under R.C. Chapter 2744, that order denies the benefit\n   of an alleged immunity and there is therefore a final, appealable order pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(C).\"\n   <em>\n    Hubbell v.

As previously alluded to, the city's issue, as raised in its first assignment of error, is that it believes Alpha Plaza's complaint set forth an intentional tort claim, as opposed to a negligence claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Upon review, we agree with the trial court that a \"fair reading\" of Alpha Plaza's complaint demonstrates that it was not asserting an intentional tort claim against the city. It is true that the words \"negligent\" or \"negligence\" were not used in the complaint, but it is equally true that the words \"intentionally\" or \"knowingly\" were also absent from the complaint. Moreover, after the city raised the issue in its motion, Alpha Plaza sought leave to file an amended complaint to clarify that its claims sound in negligence. That motion has not yet been ruled on, but presumably will be when the case is remanded to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In light of the above, the city's first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Negligent Acts of a Political Subdivision or an Employee of the Political Subdivision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In its second assignment of error, the city maintains that even if Alpha Plaza's complaint is not found to state an intentional tort claim, it nonetheless fails to state a negligence cause of action because it is \"devoid of identifying any of [the city's] employees * * *\" who allegedly acted negligently. According to the city, identification of its employees is required under R.C. 2744.02(B)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 16} It is true that subsection (2) of R.C. 2744.02(B) only mentions negligent acts committed by a political subdivisions employees: \"political subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by the negligent performance of acts by their employees with respect to proprietary functions of the political subdivisions.\" But the introduction to the provision states that a \"political subdivision is liable in damages in a civil action for injury, death, or loss to person or property allegedly caused by an act or omission of the\n   <em>\n    political subdivision or of any of its employees\n   </em>\n   in connection with a governmental or proprietary function.\" (Emphasis added.)
