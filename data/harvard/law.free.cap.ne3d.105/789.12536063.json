Ford contended that the defendants negligently failed to diagnose and treat her during her September 2008 visit to Ingalls Memorial Hospital. The complaint was filed shortly before the expiration of the two-year statute of limitations period applicable to medical malpractice actions under section 13-212(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code) ( 735 ILCS 5/13-212(a) (West 2008) ). On September 14, 2010, the circuit court granted Ford's motion to voluntarily dismiss the complaint. On July 15, 2014, plaintiff, Johnnie Watkins, \"as Guardian of the Estate of Johnnice Ford, a disabled person,\" filed a complaint in the circuit court, naming as defendants Ingalls Memorial Hospital and Ingalls Health System (collectively, Ingalls) and Bari Parks-Ballard, M.D. The allegations in the complaint largely mirrored the allegations raised in the 2010 complaint concerning Ford's treatments at Ingalls Memorial Hospital in September 2008. Ingalls filed a motion to dismiss, but before the circuit court could address plaintiff's complaint, the case was removed to federal court by the Unites States of America, which substituted itself as defendant for Dr. Parks-Ballard, who was a federal employee. The federal district court dismissed the case, finding that plaintiff had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. Plaintiff never sought to transfer the remaining state law claims against Ingalls to the circuit court.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 In September 2015, plaintiff filed a complaint in the federal district court for the northern district of Illinois against the United States, as the principal of Dr. Parks-Ballard. Plaintiff alleged negligence against the United States for the treatment provided to Ford at Ingalls in September 2008, echoing the claims from the 2010 and 2014 complaints. The federal district court granted the United States's motion to dismiss the complaint, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed that ruling.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 On January 21, 2016, plaintiff filed the instant action, the fourth complaint concerning the same operative facts and cause of action. The principal allegations of the complaint once again concerned Ford's treatment at Ingalls in September 2008. All defendants moved to dismiss the action under section 2-619 of the Code ( 735 ILCS 5/2-619 (West 2014) ), chiefly contending that the action was barred by the statute of limitations, the statute of repose, and the refiling limitation of section 13-217 of the Code ( 735 ILCS 5/13-217 (West 1994) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ingalls also contended that the\n   conduct of plaintiff's attorneys was sanctionable under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 137 (eff. July 1, 2013). The circuit court granted defendants' motions, finding that the 2016 complaint was an unpermitted refiling of the original action. The court determined that the 2014 complaint was the one, and only, refiling of the 2010 action permitted pursuant to section 13217. The court also found that plaintiff's claims were barred by\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   . The court subsequently denied Ingalls motion for Rule 137 sanctions.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 On appeal, plaintiff asserts that the circuit court erred in granting defendants' motions to dismiss where there was a question of fact as to whether Ford was under a mental disability at the time the 2010 complaint was filed, rendering that action a nullity and tolling the limitations periods. Plaintiff also contends that she was not appointed as Ford's guardian until 2015, and thus lacked the authority to bring the 2014 complaint on Ford's behalf. Plaintiff therefore asserts that the 2016 action was not barred by section 13-217 because it was the first new action brought against these defendants by Ford or on her behalf. Plaintiff also asserts that the doctrines of collateral estoppel and\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   do not bar her claims. Ingalls contends that the circuit court erred in denying its motion for sanctions. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 A. The 2010 Complaint\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 On August 20, 2010, Ford filed a complaint in the circuit court \"individually, and as mother and next best friend of Jaiyana Ford, a minor.\" Ford named as defendants all of the defendants in the case at bar and other medical professionals. In her complaint, Ford alleged that, on August 20, 2008, the physician defendants rendered medical care to her while she was pregnant. On September 10, 2008, Ford checked into the emergency room at Ingalls. During the course of Ford's treatment at Ingalls, she underwent an emergency caesarean section. Ford was later transferred to another hospital and diagnosed with Wernicke's Encephalopathy, Dry Beriberi, and Pseudobulbar palsy. Ford asserted that the physicians at Ingalls failed to properly diagnose and treat her, which directly caused her serious medical conditions, rendering her disabled. Ford contended that since her treatment at Ingalls, she had been \"lethargic, bedridden, and incapable of fully caring for herself, and require[d] constant care and attention.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 Ford's attorney attached an affidavit to the complaint, stating that he had recently obtained Ford's complete medical records and required time to have the records reviewed by proper medical professionals. Ford's attorney maintained that he was therefore unable to comply with section 2-622 of the Code ( 735 ILCS 5/2-622 (West 2008) ) as required for medical malpractice actions. On September 14, 2010, Ford voluntarily dismissed the action without prejudice, and the circuit court permitted her \"leave to re-file within one year.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20Barb.%202014\">\n    9 B. 2014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Complaint\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10 Nearly four years later, on July 15, 2014, plaintiff filed a complaint in the circuit court \"as Guardian of the Estate of Johnnice Ford, a disabled person.\" In this action, plaintiff named only Ingalls and Dr. Bari Parks-Ballard as defendants. In the complaint, plaintiff contended that on September 10, 2008, Ford received treatment at Ingalls by Dr. Parks-Ballard. Plaintiff contended that Dr. Parks-Ballard negligently failed to properly care for and treat\n   Ford, resulting in her current medical conditions. One of plaintiff's attorneys attached an affidavit to the complaint, averring that counsel was unable to obtain a consultation as required by section 2-622 of the Code ( 735 ILCS 5/2-622 (West 2014) ) because \"the statute of limitations would impair the action and the consultation required could not be obtained before the expiration of the statute of limitations.\" Ingalls filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, but before the trial court could rule on the motion, the United States removed the case to federal court, substituting itself as defendant in place of Dr. Parks-Ballard, a federal employee. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois subsequently dismissed the action because plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies before filing suit.\n   <em>\n    Watkins v. Ingalls Memorial Hospital\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-CV-08417,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%207722730\">\n    2015 WL 7722730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ill. Jan. 27, 2015).

As in the 2014 complaint, plaintiff claimed Dr. Parks-Ballard committed malpractice in failing to treat and diagnose Ford at Ingalls on September 18, 2008. The district court granted the United States' motion to dismiss the complaint, finding that the claim was time barred under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202675\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) ) statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    Watkins v. United States\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-CV-8350,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201435704\">\n    2016 WL 1435704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ill. Apr. 12, 2016). The court stated that the issue was determining when plaintiff's claim accrued and that \"the 2010 lawsuit against Dr. Parks-Ballard resolves any doubt about whether Ford (and by extension Plaintiff) knew of the doctor-related cause of her injuries. Her claims thus accrued,\n   <em>\n    at the latest\n   </em>\n   , by August 20, 2010.\" (Emphasis in original.)\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The court found that despite plaintiff's claims that Ford's disability tolled the limitations period, Ford's filing of the 2010 complaint \"indisputably establishes that Plaintiff was sufficiently aware of her injuries and their cause to trigger the limitations period.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. On April 27, 2017, after the circuit court in this case granted defendants' motions to dismiss, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling.\n   <em>\n    Watkins v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277218\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/947/\">\n    854 F.3d 947\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20Dall.%202016\">\n    13 D. 2016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Complaint\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14 Plaintiff filed the instant action on January 21, 2016, again \"as Guardian of the Estate of Johnnice Ford, a disabled person.\" Plaintiff's contentions again concerned Ford's treatment by the physician defendants at Ingalls in September 2008. This represented the fourth such complaint filed by Ford or on Ford's behalf relating to same cause of action. Ingalls filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff's complaint contending that plaintiff's complaint was based on the same facts and same cause of action as Ford's 2010 complaint and plaintiff's 2014 action and should, therefore, be dismissed under section 13-217 of the Code ( 735 ILCS 5/13-217 (West 2014) ). Ingalls contended that section 13-217 barred this action because the complaint represented a second refiling of Ford's 2010 action and section 13-217 permits only one refiling after a complaint is voluntarily dismissed. In the alternative, Ingalls contended that plaintiff's complaint should be dismissed under section 13-217 because it was filed more than one year after Ford's 2010 action was voluntarily dismissed. Before the court could rule on\n   Ingalls's motion, plaintiff filed an amended complaint.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 15 In the amended complaint, plaintiff contended that at the time Ford's cause of action accrued, or before the applicable statute of limitations period had expired, she was under a legal disability, which stayed the limitations period until the disability was removed. Plaintiff asserted that Ford's disability was evidenced by her medical records, the fact that she was adjudicated disabled in January 2015, and plaintiff's appointment as guardian of Ford's estate. Plaintiff asserted that, therefore, her time to refile the action under section 13-217 had not yet expired. Plaintiff further contended that the 2014 action did not qualify as a refiling because the case was dismissed for plaintiff's failure to exhaust administrative remedies, rather than for one of the reasons enumerated in section 13-217.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 16 1.\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Motions to Dismiss\n   </em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 17 All defendants filed motions to dismiss plaintiff's amended complaint pursuant to section 2-619(a)(5) of the Code ( 735 ILCS 5/2-619(a)(5) (West 2014) ). Ingalls contended in a motion to dismiss that plaintiff's complaint should be dismissed because under section 13-217, this action represented a second, impermissible refiling of Ford's 2010 action, and section 13-217 permits only one refiling. Ingalls contended that Ford's care at Ingalls in 2008 has been the basis of all of her filings since her first complaint in 2010 and that the statute prevented this refiling of her claims. Ingalls argued that, in the alternative, plaintiff's complaint should be dismissed because it was filed more than one year after the original action was dismissed, or because it was filed after the expiration of the applicable statute of repose. Ingalls also noted that in the amended complaint, plaintiff cited the amended version of section 13-217 in her brief, which was found unconstitutional. Ingalls maintained that sanctions were warranted under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 137 (eff. July 1, 2013) where plaintiff impermissibly filed the lawsuit three times and relied on an unconstitutional version of section 13-217 to support her arguments.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 18 The motions to dismiss filed by defendants Dr. Saif Nazir and Larry Foster\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and defendants Dr. Marvin Zelkowitz and South Suburban Neurology, Ltd., largely echoed the arguments made by Ingalls in their motion concerning section 13-217. Dr. Saif Nazir and Larry Foster also contended that both the statute of limitations and the statute of repose had elapsed and that Ford's disability had not tolled the limitations period. Dr. Marvin Zelkowitz and South Suburban Neurology, Ltd., contended that because they were not named as defendants in the 2014 complaint, plaintiff could not use the relation-back doctrine to relate her claims against Dr. Marvin Zelkowitz and South Suburban Neurology, Ltd., back to when she filed the 2014 action.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 19 In response, plaintiff contended that her complaint should not be dismissed because there was a question of fact as to whether Ford was under a legal disability at the time her cause of action accrued, thus tolling the limitations period. Plaintiff recognized that although Ford was not adjudicated disabled until 2015, the allegations in the complaint and the attached letters from physicians raised a genuine issue as to whether Ford was under a legal disability at the time her cause of action accrued. Plaintiff further asserted that the 2014 action was filed before Watkins was judicially appointed as Ford's guardian, and thus plaintiff had no authority to file that action on Ford's behalf. Plaintiff\n   maintained that the 2014 action, therefore, could not be considered a valid refiling on the 2010 action for purposes of section 13-217. Plaintiff contended that this action thus represented the first refiling against defendants by a person authorized to file an action under section 13-217, and within the limitations period, which was tolled due to Ford's legal disability.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 20 2.\n   <em>\n    Circuit Court's Ruling\n   </em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 21 In ruling on defendants' motions, the circuit court determined that \"the record contains sufficient evidence to raise a question of fact as to whether Ms. Ford was under a legal disability at the time this cause of action accrued in September of 2008.\" The court found that the letters of Ford's treating physicians and the allegations in the 2010, 2014, and 2016 complaints established enough evidence to raise a question of fact as to Ford's legal disability. The court concluded that, therefore, the action could not be dismissed on the basis of the expiration of the statutes of limitations and repose.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 22 The court further noted that the 2010 action was filed against all of the defendants named in this case, but the 2014 action named only Ingalls and Dr. Parks-Ballard as defendants. The court found that it was \"crucial\" to note that the 2014 action was filed by the same law firm that was currently representing plaintiff in the 2016 action. The court, therefore, found plaintiff's argument that the 2014 action was a nullity or not relevant was unpersuasive. The court found that the fact that plaintiff had not yet been appointed Ford's guardian at the time the 2014 complaint was filed was merely a \"technical defect,\" which could have been \"cured by actual issuance of letters of office as guardian, and a motion for leave to substitute could have been presented and granted, and the 2014 pleading would have related back to the date of the original filing of the 2014 action.\"\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 23 The court observed that after the 2014 action was removed to federal court and dismissed for plaintiff's failure to exhaust her administrative remedies, plaintiff made no attempt to pursue the action against Ingalls. The court noted that although there was no adjudication of the claim with regard to Ingalls, the 2014 action constituted plaintiff's one refiling against Ingalls permitted under section 13-217.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 24 The court further found that the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   applied to bar plaintiff's claims against all of the physicians originally named as defendants in the 2010 action. The court observed that, although these physicians were not named as defendants in the 2014 action, they could have been. The court therefore granted defendants' motions to dismiss the complaint pursuant to section 2-619(a)(5) of the Code. Plaintiff appealed the circuit court's ruling.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 25 3.\n   <em>\n    Ingalls Motion for Sanctions\n   </em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 26 After the trial court entered its order dismissing plaintiff's complaint, Ingalls filed a motion for a ruling on its motion for sanctions. In ruling on Ingalls's motion, the court found that although plaintiff's attorneys should have realized the version of section 13-217 cited in the amended complaint had been previously invalidated, such an error did not support the imposition of sanctions. The court further found that the plaintiff's refiling of an action more than once on a basis that was found to be incorrect did not warrant sanctions. Accordingly, the court found that Ingalls failed to meet its burden to demonstrate that sanctions were warranted. Ingalls appealed the circuit court's ruling and the case was consolidated with plaintiff's appeal.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 27 II. ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 28 On appeal, plaintiff contends that the court erred in granting defendants'\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-38\">\n   motions to dismiss where there was a question of fact as to whether Ford was legally disabled at the time her cause of action accrued. Plaintiff asserts that Ford's status as legally disabled adult precluded the presumption that the 2010 action was brought by an attorney with the authority to do so. Plaintiff further contends that the circuit court erred in \"applying the relation-back rule, offensively, to find that the 2014 action was the one permitted refiling of the 2010 action,\" and dismissing the complaint on that basis. Plaintiff maintains that at the time the 2014 action was filed, she had not been appointed Ford's guardian, and her appointment as guardian was not a mere \"technical defect\" that could be cured by plaintiff's later appointment. Plaintiff also contends that the court erred in applying the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   to bar her claims where the physician defendants were not named in the 2014 action.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 29 A. Standard of Review\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 30 Defendants brought their motions to dismiss plaintiff's complaint pursuant to section 2619 of the Code ( 735 ILCS 5/2-619 (West 2014) ). A motion to dismiss under section 2-619 of the Code admits the legal sufficiency of the complaint, but asserts affirmative matters outside of the complaint that defeat the cause of action.\n   <em>\n    Hoover v.

Plaintiff's Multiple Complaints\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 32 By voluntarily dismissing her 2010 complaint, Ford invoked section 13-217 of the Code, which provides, in pertinent part, that if the plaintiff voluntarily dismisses a cause of action, \"the plaintiff, his or her heirs, executors or administrators may commence a new action within one year or within the remaining period of limitation, whichever is greater,\" after the \"action is voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff.\" 735 ILCS 5/13-217 (West 2014). As such, section 13-217 would appear to bar the instant action, given that plaintiff, as Ford's administrator, previously refiled Ford's 2010 action in 2014, and then again in 2016. Nonetheless, plaintiff contends that the circuit court erred in failing to consider the impact of Ford's legal incapacity in finding the 2010 and 2014 complaints to be valid actions brought on Ford's behalf. Plaintiff asserts that the circuit court's finding that there was a question of fact as to Ford's legal capacity at the time she filed the 2010 complaint should have precluded the presumption that the initial action was brought by an attorney with authority to do so. Similarly, plaintiff contends that where she was not appointed to be Ford's guardian until 2015, the court erred in finding that the 2014 action was a proper complaint brought on Ford's behalf.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 33 1.\n   <em>\n    Section 13-217\n   </em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b6 34 As noted, section 13-217 allows a plaintiff to refile a cause of action within one year of its dismissal or within the remaining limitations period, whichever is greater.\n   <em>\n    Schrager v.

The court found that the 2016 complaint could, therefore, not be dismissed on the basis of the expiration of the statute of limitations or statute of repose. Nonetheless, the court found that, under section 13-217, plaintiff's instant complaint represented an impermissible refiling of Ford's 2010 action, where plaintiff had previously used her one opportunity to refile the action in 2014.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b6 37 a.

Plaintiff contends that where there was a question of fact as to her legal capacity at the time the complaint was filed, the court should not have presumed that the 2010 action was brought by an attorney with the authority to file the action.

We find the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Lydon\n   </em>\n   distinguishable from the case at bar. Most importantly, in\n   <em>\n    Lydon\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff provided an affidavit averring that she had never met with the Cook County attorney, had never spoken with him, and did not retain him to represent her. Here, plaintiff offers no such evidence. Setting aside the fact that plaintiff failed to present any evidence regarding this contention at any point in the circuit court, or even raise this issue before the circuit court, plaintiff has utterly failed to argue before this court anything more than a bare assertion that Ford could not have entered into an attorney-client relationship because of her mental incapacity at the time the complaint was filed. Plaintiff does not suggest that she has access to evidence that would call into the question the legitimacy of the 2010 complaint, other than the letters of her treating physicians, the reports of reviewing health care professionals, and the allegations of her complaints, which were previously presented to the circuit court. Although the evidence was found sufficient to raise a question of fact as to mental capacity, it was insufficient to suggest that the 2010 complaint was a nullity.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 46 Generally, the nullity rule is applicable only where an individual who is not an attorney is engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.\n   <em>\n    Applebaum v. Rush University Medical Center\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3617246\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/231/429/#p435\">\n    231 Ill. 2d 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 435,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=326%20Ill.%20Dec.%2045\">\n    326 Ill.Dec. 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=899%20N.E.2d%20262\">\n    899 N.E.2d 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). That is not the case here. Rather, the content and claims in the 2010 complaint suggest Ford's participation and awareness of the filing. In fact, in his section 2-622 affidavit attached to the complaint, Ford's attorney represented that he had obtained Ford's medical record, an action which would likely require Ford's acquiescence. Plaintiff speculates that someone other than Ford could have provided her attorney with access to Ford's medical records but, again, plaintiff offers no more than pure speculation and fails to support her contention with even the suggestion of pertinent evidence that she would present at an evidentiary hearing to rebut the presumption of a valid attorney-client relationship. In short, despite the trial court's finding that the evidence presented raised\n   a question of fact as to Ford's mental capacity at the time the 2010 complaint was filed, such a finding does not also indicate that the 2010 action was a nullity. Accordingly, we find that plaintiff has presented no argument that would suggest she could reasonably rebut a presumption of a valid attorney-client relationship, and we find her argument that the 2010 complaint was a nullity unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 47 iii.\n   <em>\n    Self-Constituted Next Friends\n   </em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b6 48 We likewise find plaintiff's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Passmore v.

The court concluded that in such situations, it was equitable to toll the limitations period even though the plaintiff had not been adjudicated legally incompetent before the limitations period would have expired.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 56 Here, the circuit court implicitly applied the rational of\n   <em>\n    Passmore\n   </em>\n   , finding that because there was a question of fact as to whether Ford was under a legal disability at the time her cause of action accrued, plaintiff's complaint could not be dismissed on the basis of the expiration of the statute of limitations or statute of repose. The circuit court made this finding despite the fact that plaintiff was not adjudicated incompetent until 2015, in keeping with the holding of\n   <em>\n    Passmore\n   </em>\n   that the court could not rely on Ford's \"self-constituted next friend\" to step forward and enforce Ford's rights within the limitations period. Nonetheless, the court found that this question of fact as to Ford's legal competency at the time her cause of action accrued was not sufficient to render the 2010 action a nullity for purposes of section 13-217.

This, however, is an entirely different consideration from whether the 2010 action could be considered a nullity due to Ford's legal incapacity. As in\n   <em>\n    Passmore\n   </em>\n   , the court in\n   <em>\n    Riha\n   </em>\n   was chiefly concerned with the tolling of the applicable statute of limitations, an issue addressed by the court in this case when it determined that plaintiff's complaint could not be dismissed on statute of limitations or statute of repose grounds. As discussed, however, the court correctly found that the 2016 filing was an improper refiling of the 2010 complaint under section 13-217 and nothing in\n   <em>\n    Riha\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Passmore\n   </em>\n   suggests that ruling was erroneous.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 59 b.

Plaintiff contends that, at the time the 2014 complaint was filed, there had been no adjudication regarding Ford's mental capacity and no one had been judicially appointed to bring an action on Ford's behalf. Plaintiff asserts that the circuit court erred in applying the relation-back rule \"offensively\" to legitimize the 2014 action as one filed on behalf of Ford.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b6 61 i.\n   <em>\n    The Circuit Court's Ruling\n   </em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b6 62 In finding that the 2014 action was the one refiling of plaintiff's claims permitted under section 13-217, the circuit court noted that it was \"crucial\" to note that the 2014 action was filed by the same law firm representing plaintiff in the 2016 lawsuit. The court found that plaintiff's argument that the 2014 case was a \"nullity\" was unpersuasive where the suit was filed, summonses were issued, and there was briefing before the case was removed to federal court. The court found that although plaintiff had not yet been appointed Ford's guardian by the probate court, this was a \"technical defect, which could have been cured by actual issuance of letter of office as guardian, and a motion for leave to substitute could have been presented and granted.\" The court found that, in that case, the 2014 pleading would \"have related back to the date of the original filing of the 2014 action.\" The court noted that after the case was dismissed in federal court for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, plaintiff took no action to remand the remaining state claims against Ingalls. The court held that even though there was no adjudication of the claim against Ingalls in that suit, the complaint still constituted plaintiff's one permissible refiling of the 2010 action.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b6 63 Plaintiff contends that the court erred both in applying the relation back rule to legitimize the 2014 action and in classifying the fact that plaintiff had not yet been appointed Ford's guardian as a mere \"technical defect.\" Plaintiff further contends that the court erred in placing any emphasis on the fact that the same law firm represented plaintiff in both the 2014 and 2016 actions. Plaintiff contends that the Probate Act is not concerned with the identity of the attorneys retained, but with the guardian who is answerable to the court. Plaintiff also repeats her argument raised with regard to the 2010 complaint that, in 2014, plaintiff was no more than Ford's \"selfconstituted next friend\" as defined by the court in\n   <em>\n    Passmore\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b6 64 ii.\n   <em>\n    Relation-Back Doctrine\n   </em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 65 In contending that the circuit court erred in finding that the 2014 filing was plaintiff's one permitted refiling of the 2010 action under section 13-217, plaintiff contends that the circuit court erred in its application of the relation-back rule of section 2-616(b) of the Code. 735 ILCS 5/2-616(b) (West 2014). \" Section 2-616(b) * * * provides that a cause of action set up in an amended pleading shall not be time-barred if: (1) the original pleading was timely filed and (2) the cause of action at issue grew out of the same transaction or occurrence set up in the original pleading, even though the original pleading was defective in that it failed to allege the performance of some act or the existence of some fact or some other matter which is a necessary condition precedent to the right of recovery or defense asserted.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    American Airlines, Inc. v.

In such a case, the amendment would relate back to the date of the original, timely filed pleading, for purposes of preserving the cause of action. 735 ILCS 5/2-616(b) (West 2014). Plaintiff contends that the court improperly used\n   this doctrine \"offensively\" where plaintiff never sought to correct the defective pleading by filing a petition to have Ford declared incompetent during the pendency of the 2014 action and substituting herself as plaintiff.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 66 We believe plaintiff's argument misses the import of the circuit court's ruling. The court did not suggest employing the relation-back doctrine, against plaintiff's express wishes, to improperly legitimize the 2014 action years after the fact. Instead, the court was explaining its reasoning for its finding that the fact that plaintiff had not yet been appointed Ford's guardian at the time the 2014 complaint was filed was not a defect that was so serious that it rendered the 2014 complaint a nullity. Rather, as the court correctly noted, it was a mere technical defect that could have easily been cured, and the amended complaint, substituting plaintiff as Ford's guardian after she had been judicially appointed, would have \"related back\" to the date of the original filing of the 2014 action.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b6 67 The court observed that this finding was supported by the fact that plaintiff was, in fact, later appointed as Ford's guardian, and the fact that plaintiff was represented by the same law firm in both the 2014 and 2016 actions. The court, therefore, determined that the 2014 action should not be rendered a nullity based on this mere \"technical defect.\" We agree. Plaintiff had a fair opportunity to present her claims, briefs were drafted, motions were filed, and defendants appeared. There is no basis to now argue that the 2014 action was a nullity. We therefore find plaintiff's extensive argument concerning the relation-back doctrine misplaced. Furthermore, for the same reasons discussed in part 2.a.iii,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , we find plaintiff's contention that the court should have protected Ford from plaintiff as Ford's \"self-constituted next friend\" unpersuasive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 68 3.\n   <em>\n    Res Judicata\n   </em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b6 69 Plaintiff next contends that the court erred in finding that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   barred her claims against the physician defendants who were named in the 2010 complaint, but were not named in the 2014 complaint. Plaintiff asserts that there is no basis to support the circuit court's finding that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   barred her claims because, although the physician defendants were not named in the 2014 action, they could have been included.\n  </p>\n<p id=\"p-84\">\n   \u00b6 70 Here, the circuit court found that \"the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   would also apply in this instance, because the claims against all of the physicians originally named in the 2010 filing, while not actually named as defendants,\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have been included in the 2014 filing, but were not.\" (Emphasis added.)

In this case, plaintiff could have named each of the known defendants in the 2014 action and had her claims against them decided, but did not. Plaintiff cannot avoid the refiling limitation of section 13-217 merely by failing to include all of the defendants in each action where the record shows that she knew about all of the defendants and knew they\n   could have been potentially liable for her injuries. Nonetheless, plaintiff did not name all of the physician defendants in 2014 action, but did name them in the 2016.

In that case, the court found that plaintiff's voluntary dismissal of a defendant operated as a final judgment because plaintiff failed to refile a claim against that defendant within one year under section 13-217. However, section 13-217 allows a party who voluntarily dismissed their claim to refile within one year, or within the limitations period,\n    <em>\n     whichever is greater\n    </em>\n    . 735 ILCS 5/13-217 (West 2014). Here, as discussed, the court found that Ford's incapacity tolled the limitations period, and thus the one-year limitation of section 13-217 was not applicable.

However, not only is the reasoning in that case distinguishable from the case at bar, but that decision is unpublished and not precedential pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 23, and cannot be cited as authority.

Finally, the 2015 federal action was still pending on appeal at the time the circuit court entered its ruling in this case.

We note only that the circuit court merely stated that \"an additional argument could be made that the filing of the 2015 federal action for damages based on the same conduct was yet another refiling of the claim by Plaintiff's law firm.\" The circuit court did not expand on that statement, but had already found that the 2014 complaint was the one and only refiling plaintiff was allowed. Thus, the 2015 action did not form the basis for the circuit court's ruling.\n   </p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n"}}
