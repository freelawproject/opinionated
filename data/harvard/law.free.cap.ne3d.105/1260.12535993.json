Thyot. We find merit in the state's sole assignment of error, and therefore, we reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the cause for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Facts and Procedure\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The record shows that Thyot was charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol under R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a) and driving under suspension under R.C. 4510.11(A). He filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude a video taken from a Thornton's gas station purportedly showing him operating a motor vehicle on the date in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} At a hearing on the motion, the state presented the testimony of Tom Tegenkamp, a regional manager for Thornton's Oil Co. He supervised eight stores, including store 560, located at 12185 Princeton Pike. He was familiar with that store because he had helped open it about a year prior to the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Tegenkamp was also familiar with the store's surveillance system, which he had used in the past for \"various investigations and that sort of thing.\" He testified that it was a \"continuous recording closed-circuit surveillance system,\" meaning that there were 12 to 16 cameras at each store, which were recording \"24 hours a day, seven days a week.\" Tegenkamp was one of three people who could access the system, and the videos were made in the ordinary course of business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The system stored all recordings on the hard drive, which was kept for 90 days. The hard drives were stored in the office at the site. If a recording had to be saved longer than 90 days, it was burned onto a DVD or stored on a flash drive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Tegenkamp identified a frame of a video on a DVD as a \"video of our fueling areas in front of * * * Store 560.\" He also testified that the video was taken on July 4, 2016, at 9:00 in the evening. He knew the date and time because it was \"superimposed on the bottom of the picture, right\n   below the picture.\" He indicated that there had been no problems with the recording system in the past and that he had no reason to believe the time and date were inaccurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Tegenkamp acknowledged that he was not present when the video was recorded, and that he had no personal knowledge of the events that appeared in the video. He was also not the individual who had burned the video onto a DVD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Following the hearing, the trial court granted Thyot's motion in limine. The court noted that the state had to prove that the video tape \"fairly, truly and accurately\" depicted what it purported to depict and that the \"condition of the video has not been altered, edited, or distorted.\" It found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1. The witness was not the custodian of the video DVD[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   2. The witness did not have custody or control over the burned copy[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   3. The witness had no personal knowledge of video DVD equipment reliability to record[,] burn or copy[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   4. The wit[ness] was not [at] the scene of the videotaping or burning of copy[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   5. The wit[ness] did not prepare the video DVD for court[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   6. The wit[ness] cannot testify that the video DVD fairly and accurately depicted what the proponent said it did[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Based on those findings, the court held that the video was not adequately authenticated. The state has filed an interlocutory appeal from the trial court's judgment. Before we address the state's assignment of error, we must address Thyot's argument that the state has no right to appeal from the denial of the motion in limine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. The State's Right to Appeal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 10} R.C. 2945.67 states that a prosecuting attorney may appeal as a matter of right \"any decision of the trial court in a criminal case * * * which decision grants * * * a motion to suppress evidence[.]\" Crim.R. 12(K) (formerly Crim.R. 12(J) ) \"supplements and formalizes the statutory procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The rule provides that when the state takes an appeal from an order suppressing or excluding evidence, the prosecuting attorney must certify that (1) the appeal is not taken for purpose of delay, and (2) the ruling on the motion or motions has rendered the state's proof so weak in its entirety that any reasonable probability of effective prosecution has been destroyed.\n   <em>\n    State v.

But, the Ohio Supreme Court has stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Any motion, however labeled, which, if granted, restricts the state in the presentation of certain evidence and, thereby, renders the state's proof with respect to the pending charge so weak in its entirety that any reasonable probability of effective prosecution has been destroyed, is, in effect, a motion to suppress. The granting of such a motion is a final order and may be appealed pursuant to R.C. 2945.67 and Crim.R. 12(J).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Davidson\n   </em>\n   at syllabus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In\n   <em>\n    Hatter\n   </em>\n   , the defendant filed a motion in limine, contending that statements\n   made by a murder victim were inadmissible hearsay and other-acts evidence. The trial court granted the motion, and the state appealed. This court held that the granting of the motion was a final order from which the state was permitted to appeal under R.C. 2945.67, as long as it had followed the provisions of Crim.R. 12(K).\n   <em>\n    Hatter\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. We stated, \"The granting of Hatter's pretrial motion excluding the witnesses' testimony in its entirety severely weakened the state's case so that any reasonable probability of effective prosecution was destroyed. Therefore the trial court was correct in recasting the motion as one requesting the suppression of evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Though the trial court did not say that it was recasting the motion in limine as a motion to suppress, this court can do so. Thus, the ruling on the motion in limine was a final order, which the state was permitted to appeal under R.C. 2945.67, as long as it followed the provisions of Crim.R. 12(K).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The state complied with the requirements of Crim.R. 12(K). Thyot takes issue with the state's certification that the granting of the motion severely weakened the state's case so that any reasonable possibility of effective prosecution was destroyed. But the Ohio Supreme Court has held that an appellate court is without authority to review the prosecutor's Crim.R. 12(K) certification. Therefore, a court of appeals may not dismiss the prosecutor's appeal for want of a final, appealable order based on the merits of the prosecutor's certification.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In its sole assignment of error, the state contends that the trial court erred in granting Thyot's motion in limine. It argues that it adequately authenticated the video. This assignment of error is well taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Generally, the standard of review for evidentiary motions, such as motions in limine, is abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.
