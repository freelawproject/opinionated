STEWART, J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Appellant Rola Mouded and appellee Antoine Khoury were married in the state of Ohio after a long-distance courtship (Mouded lived in Ohio; Khoury lived in Massachusetts). Five months later, Mouded filed for divorce in the domestic relations court. While the divorce action was pending, Khoury asked a commonwealth of Massachusetts court to annul the marriage. He also asked the domestic relations court to stay the divorce action pending the resolution of the Massachusetts annulment action. The domestic relations court refused to stay the divorce proceedings; nevertheless, the Massachusetts court annulled the marriage. Khoury then asked the domestic relations court to dismiss the divorce action by giving full faith and credit to the Massachusetts annulment. The domestic relations court granted the motion to dismiss the divorce action over Mouded's argument that the domestic relations court had jurisdictional priority over the matter. The domestic relations court also found that Mouded was making a collateral attack on the Massachusetts annulment and should have challenged the annulment on direct appeal in that state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Mouded's sole assignment of error is that the court erred by granting the motion to dismiss and giving full faith and credit to the Massachusetts annulment. She maintains that her divorce complaint was first filed in the domestic relations court, so that court had exclusive jurisdiction over the subject matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} \"Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State.\" Article IV, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution. \"Ohio courts are required to recognize the validity of a foreign judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Wyatt v.

The court appeared to dismiss the divorce action with reluctance: it stated that \"[b]ecause the choice-of-law rules in both states would look to Ohio law to determine the validity of the marriage, this Court chose not to defer[.]\" The Ohio action was first filed and it might have been expected that the Massachusetts court would stay the annulment action pending decision from the Ohio court. It is true that the court could have proceeded with the divorce action even with the Massachusetts court having annulled the marriage. But with the Massachusetts court fully adjudicating the case by annulling the marriage, further proceedings in Ohio could have resulted in the scenario of a divorce being granted for a marriage that another state court had, with finality, declared void. The domestic relations court could reasonably have desired to avoid that outcome, leaving it to Mouded to appeal the Massachusetts judgment where she could question whether the Massachusetts court should have abstained from annulling the marriage, in addition to challenging whether the Massachusetts court had personal jurisdiction over her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} We would add that the domestic relations court noted that Mouded's arguments against dismissing the divorce action were primarily that the Massachusetts court erred by finding that an annulment should issue: \"[Mouded] devotes one page of argument to these issues, and four pages of argument to a collateral attack on the merits of the Massachusetts court's ruling.\" Judgment entry at 2.

As earlier stated, her recourse was to appeal from the Massachusetts judgment annulling the marriage or seek vacation of the annulment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the annulment has not been either overturned or vacated by the Massachusetts courts, the domestic relations court did not err by dismissing the divorce action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   EILEEN T.

The judgment of annulment says nothing about Mouded's attorney failing to appear at a pretrial or that the pretrial had been converted into a trial. Mouded supports her assertions by reference to an affidavit she filed with her opposition to the motion to dismiss, but the affidavit makes no claim that her attorney failed to attend the pretrial. The affidavit states only that it was her \"belief\" that her attorney would attend the pretrial and continue to represent her in the pending action. We disregard any factual assertions that have no proof in the record. See\n    <em>\n     Squire v.
