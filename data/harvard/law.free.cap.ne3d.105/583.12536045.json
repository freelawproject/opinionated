Procedural History and Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The Cuyahoga County Grand Jury indicted Frierson with one count of trafficking in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(1), one count of trafficking in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(2), and one count of drug possession in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A). Frierson waived his right to a trial by jury, electing to try the case before the bench.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The following evidence was presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On April 15, 2016, Detective Matos of the Cleveland Police Department's Vice Unit organized a drug sale between a confidential informant and a suspect known as \"D.\" The sale was set to take place around 7:00 p.m. near West 116th Street and Lorain Avenue in Cleveland. After searching him for contraband, Detective Matos dropped off the informant, who was wearing\n   a wire and was provided with \"buy money\" to purchase the drugs, near that location and then took a covered position nearby. Other officers from the Cleveland Police Department, including Detectives Duller and Pitts, were also nearby the sale location to effectuate a \"take down\" and arrest the suspect once the sale was complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Detective Matos testified that the informant entered a gray minivan to complete the sale and then returned to her vehicle with a rock of crack cocaine. On cross-examination, Detective Matos explained that because the suspect fled the scene, officers were not able to account for the \"buy money\" used to purchase the crack cocaine. She testified that she never saw the driver of the minivan, but was able to record the van's license plate number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Detective Duller testified that after Detective Pitts and he, who were in the same vehicle, received confirmation that the sale was complete, they proceeded to the suspect's location. As the detectives came to an intersection on West 117th Street, however, the suspect, who was fleeing from police, made a left-hand turn, crossing in front of and driving by the detectives' vehicle in the opposite direction. Detective Duller stated that he was in the passenger seat and was only 15 to 20 feet away from the defendant at the time he observed the suspect make the left-hand turn. He testified that his opportunity to view the driver was fairly quick, but that the lighting conditions were good as it was still early evening and that he remembered the driver's facial features.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Detective Pitts testified that as he approached the intersection on West 117th Street, the minivan made a left-hand turn going between 35 to 45 m.p.h. and that he got a \"real good look\" at the driver, even though it happened quickly. Detective Pitts stated that he recognized the driver, but could not remember his name at the time. He testified that officers terminated the pursuit a short time later for safety purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Detective Matos testified that after the car chase, she searched through the Ohio Law Enforcement Gateway (\"OHLEG\"), the Cleveland Police Department's record-management system, with the minivan's license plate information. She testified that the minivan was registered to a woman and, after searching that woman's personal information, discovered that she and Frierson were acquaintances. Detective Matos testified that she also searched Lexus Nexus for information connected to the phone number that the confidential informant used to contact the suspect. She testified that the phone number was registered to a different woman who listed the same address that was listed for Frierson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Detective Matos testified that she then searched Frierson through OHLEG, printed out a report with his photograph, and within a few hours of the car chase, showed it to Detectives Pitts and Duller. Both detectives identified Frierson as the driver and stated they were confident in their identification. Detectives Pitts and Duller also later identified Frierson as the driver of the minivan during the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The state then rested its case, and Frierson moved for directed verdict under Crim.R. 29. After hearing oral argument from both Frierson and the state, the court denied the motion. Frierson then rested its case without calling any witnesses and renewed his Crim.R. 29 motion, which the court denied. The court then adjourned the proceedings for deliberation without closing arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The court found Frierson not guilty of drug trafficking in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(1) and drug possession in\n   violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), but found him guilty of drug trafficking in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(2). The court sentenced Frierson to one and a-half years of community control sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 12} It is from this judgment that Frierson now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

At trial, the state offered the testimony of a police officer who observed a vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed and attempted to pull the driver over. The officer testified that, at one point during the car chase, he pulled next to the vehicle while going 80 m.p.h. and got a \"pretty fair look\" at the driver.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13. The officer eventually gave up the pursuit but was able to later identify the appellant as the driver in a photo array.

The officers also testified that they did not search the confidential informant for the \"buy money\" after the exchange took place and were not able to discover if the suspect had the \"buy money\" because he fled.
