Plaintiff-appellee, American Express Bank, FSB (\"AMEX\"), sued defendant-appellant, Klaas Olsman (\"Olsman\") and defendant Holland Investment Inc., to collect the debt owing on two business credit card accounts. Ultimately, the actions were consolidated and AMEX was awarded summary judgment in its favor. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural Posture\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On some unknown date, Olsman, and/or defendant Holland Investment Inc., applied for business credit card accounts with AMEX. Olsman is a \"representative\" of Holland Investment Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   An AMEX SimplyCash Business Credit Card with account number ending in 2000 lists Holland Investment Inc., and Olsman's name individually on billing statements. An AMEX Business Green Card with account number ending in 4003 lists Holland Investment Inc., and Olsman's name individually on billing statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On May 11, 2016, AMEX filed a complaint against Olsman (original Case Number CVF 1600511) alleging default, and to collect the sum of approximately $4,871.68 due on the credit card with account number ending in 2000. Shortly thereafter, on May 19, 2016, AMEX sued Olsman and Holland Investment Inc. (original Case Number CVF 1600544) alleging default, and to collect the sum of approximately $8,438.93 due on the credit card with account number ending in 4003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The defendants filed an answer in each case denying the allegations. The trial court eventually consolidated the two cases, with consolidated proceedings being conducted in Case Number CVF 1600511.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Following consolidation, AMEX filed a motion for summary judgment. Olsman did not file a memorandum contra to the motion for summary judgment. However, he did file an affidavit in response in which he averred that he opened the two credit card accounts as acting representative of Holland Investment Inc., that the debts were incurred for the benefit of Holland Investment Inc. only, and that he never accepted personal liability for the amounts due on either account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On April 25, 2017, the trial court rendered a written decision and judgment entry granting AMEX's motion for summary judgment. Olsman was ordered to pay AMEX the balance of the account with numbers ending in 2000 in the amount of $4,871.68; and Olsman and Holland Investment Inc. were ordered to pay, jointly and\n   severally, the balance of the account with numbers ending in 4003 in the amount of $8,437.32. The defendants were further ordered to pay AMEX's costs in pursuing the judgment, plus any additional costs to be incurred in the execution of judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Olsman filed a timely notice of appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Olsman's brief contains no assignments of error as required by App.R. 16(A). Because appeals are decided on the basis of assignments of error,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   App.R. 12(A)(1)(b), we technically have nothing to review in this case; and we would be justified in summarily affirming the trial court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Guardianship of Freeman,\n   </em>\n   4th Dist.

Nevertheless, because this Court affords considerable leniency to pro se litigants, we believe the interests of justice are better served by reviewing the merits of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Generally, Olsman contends that the trial court erred by granting AMEX's motion for summary judgment. Olsman does not contest the creation of the accounts and the amount of debt incurred. He does, however, contest his personal liability for the claims. AMEX, on the other hand, asserts that Olsman is personally liable for repayment of the charges on the accounts according to the terms of the account agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court must construe the record and all inferences therefrom in the nonmoving party's favor. Civ.R. 56(C). The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden to demonstrate that no genuine issues of material fact exist and that they are entitled to judgment in their favor as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Dresher v.

To meet its burden, the moving party must specifically refer to \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of fact, if any, timely filed in the action,\" that affirmatively demonstrate that the nonmoving party has no evidence to support the nonmoving party's claims.

[Appellate Brief at p. 5.] The Cardmember Agreements provide that they are governed by Utah law. [Complaint CVF 1600511, Exhibit B, p. 9; Complaint CVF1600544, Exhibit B, p. 5.] \"Utah law provides that a credit card agreement is binding if the cardholder is provided a written copy of the agreement, the agreement provides that use of the card constitutes acceptance, and the cardholder uses the card after receiving the agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Knapp\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 21, citing\n   <em>\n    MBNA Am.

Here, Olsman has not alleged that he did not receive the Cardmember Agreements. The Cardmember Agreements provide that use of the cards constitute acceptance of the terms. Finally, it is undisputed that the cards were used, and there is no allegation that they were used by an unauthorized person. Therefore, the fact that Olsman did not sign the Cardmember Agreements for each account does not preclude a finding that he is bound by their terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Conversely, we conclude that Olsman is personally liable for the credit card debts under the terms of the Cardmember Agreements.
