CELEBREZZE, JR., J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Appellant-delinquent, C.W. (\"appellant\"), brings this appeal challenging a magistrate's denial of his motion to dismiss. After a thorough review of the record and law, this court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On March 24, 2017, Cleveland Metropolitan Housing Authority police officers were dispatched to the intersection of East 30th Street and Central Avenue in Cleveland for a noise disturbance. As officers arrived, they observed a vehicle in a parking lot occupied by four young males. As officers approached the vehicle, they observed the driver, later identified as appellant, place an item under the driver's seat. Officers ordered the occupants out of the vehicle and as officers spoke with appellant, appellant told officers that he had placed a handgun under the driver's seat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellant was charged in Cuyahoga J.C. No. DL 17104838 for the following offenses: Count 1, having weapons while under disability, a third-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(2), with a one-year firearm specification; Count 2, carrying a concealed weapon, a fourth-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2923.12(A)(2) ; and Count 3, improper handling a firearm in a motor vehicle, a fourth-degree felony in violation of R.C. 2923.16(B). The weapons under disability charge alleged that appellant had a previous adjudication for felonious assault that prohibited him from carrying a firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The matter proceeded to a trial before the juvenile court magistrate. Prior to trial commencing, the state dismissed the one-year firearm specification attached to Count 1. Also, prior to trial, appellant's counsel filed a motion to dismiss the having weapons while under disability adjudication arguing that the basis for the disability was itself a juvenile adjudication, and not a criminal conviction. The magistrate denied appellant's motion, and the matter proceeded to trial. The magistrate found appellant guilty on all three counts and appellant was adjudicated delinquent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Thereafter, appellant's trial counsel filed an objection to the magistrate's decision denying the motion to dismiss. After a hearing on the issue, the juvenile court overruled appellant's objection and adopted the magistrate's decision. It is from this ruling that appellant now appeals, assigning the following assignment of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   I. Given the Ohio Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Hand\n   </em>\n   , the juvenile court violated [appellant's] rights under the state and federal constitutions by relying on a previous adjudication as the predicate disability element for the offense of having a weapon under disability when it found [appellant] delinquent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In appellant's sole assignment of error, he argues that the juvenile court\n   erred when it adjudicated him delinquent of having weapons while under disability, because it erred in using a prior juvenile adjudication as the \"disability\" element of the offense. In so doing, appellant argues that the juvenile court's decision denying his motion to dismiss is in direct contradiction to the Ohio Supreme Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    State v. Hand\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280351\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/149/94/\">\n    149 Ohio St.3d 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280351\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/149/94/\">\n    2016-Ohio-5504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20N.E.3d%20448\">\n    73 N.E.3d 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court of Ohio held that the use of a juvenile adjudication as the equivalent of an adult conviction to enhance a penalty for a later crime is unconstitutional, because, unlike an adult conviction, a juvenile adjudication does not involve the right to a trial by jury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   In so holding, the court struck down R.C. 2901.08(A), a statute that specifically provided that a prior \"adjudication as a delinquent child or as a juvenile traffic offender is a conviction for a violation of the law or ordinance for purposes of determining the offense with which the person should be charged and, if the person is convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense, the sentence to be imposed * * [.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at paragraph one of the syllabus and \u00b6 9. Therefore, the Supreme Court of Ohio made it clear in\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   that \"a juvenile adjudication is not a conviction of a crime and should not be treated as one.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Cuyahoga No. 105301,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-9157\">\n    2017-Ohio-9157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206540630\">\n    2017 WL 6540630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In his motion to dismiss, appellant asserted that the logic of\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   should extend to his case and prevent the juvenile court from considering his prior juvenile adjudication to support his having a weapon while under disability adjudication. In committing\n   the offense of having weapons while under disability, the statute requires an offender to either have a prior conviction or a prior juvenile adjudication. Therefore, \"[u]nlike the statute that was struck down in\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   , the statute at issue, R.C. 2923.13(A)(2), does not treat a prior juvenile adjudication as a conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Albeit in those particular cases, the issue before the court was an adult defendant not a juvenile defendant, the essence of the argument is identical. In\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   , we declined to interpret\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   to negate the \"disability\" element of the offense of having weapons while under disability resulting from a prior juvenile adjudication, stating, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   does not apply to the statute at issue here: it did not hold that a juvenile delinquency adjudication may not constitute an element of an offense.\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   addressed the narrow issue of whether a juvenile adjudication could be deemed a criminal conviction for the purpose of sentencing enhancements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6, citing\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 36-37. Thus, we decline to interpret the ruling in\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   to be applicable to a juvenile charged with having weapons while under disability where the disability element constitutes a prior juvenile adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Further, as this court noted in\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Our resolution of this issue is in accordance with other appellate districts that have considered the issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

From our review of the above case law, Ohio appellate districts have all agreed that an adult defendant may be charged with having weapons while under disability where the disability element is a juvenile adjudication. Thus, we find the same analysis indistinguishable to appellant's arguments before this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Accordingly, based on the precedent established in this appellate district and several other appellate districts in the state of Ohio, we conclude that the trial court did not err in refusing to apply the holding in\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   to appellant's motion to dismiss the charge of having weapons while under disability because\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   does not apply to R.C. 2923.13(A)(2). Therefore, we hold that the use of a juvenile adjudication to support an adjudication of having\n   weapons while under disability does not violate a defendant's constitutional right to due process, whether that defendant is charged within the juvenile system or the adult criminal system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ortiz.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.
