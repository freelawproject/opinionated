For the following reasons, this Court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} State Trooper Justin Ross was sitting in his cruiser by a county road one rainy summer evening when a vehicle pulled up to his. The occupants of the vehicle told him that the car in front of them had attempted to run them off the road. Trooper Ross caught up to the car and, after noticing it go left of the center line, initiated a traffic stop. When he reached the driver's door, Trooper Ross noticed damage to the left side of the car that appeared to have occurred recently. According to Trooper Ross, when he observed the driver of the car, Mr. McClain, he noticed that Mr. McClain's eyes were glassy and that his pupils were dilated, suggesting that he might be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Mr. McClain also kept moving his hands about, despite being told multiple times to keep them on the steering wheel. Trooper Ross, therefore, administered field sobriety tests on Mr. McClain. After observing numerous clues of impairment during each test, Trooper Ross arrested Mr. McClain for operating a vehicle under the influence of drugs or alcohol. He also cited Mr. McClain for driving left of center. The State later dismissed the driving-left-of-center charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Following a trial to the bench, the municipal court found Mr. McClain guilty of the operating-under-the-influence offense. It sentenced him to 30 days in jail, which it stayed pending appeal. Mr. McClain has appealed the municipal court's judgment, assigning as error that his conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   APPELLANT'S CONVICTION FOR OPERATING A VEHICLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE IS AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The trial court found Mr. McClain guilty of violating\n   Revised Code Section 4511.19(A)(1)(a), which provides that \"[n]o person shall operate any vehicle * * * if, at the time of the operation, * * * [t]he person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them.\" In this case, it is not disputed that there was no evidence that Mr. McClain was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the stop. The question, therefore, is whether Mr. McClain was under the influence of a drug of abuse. Mr. McClain argues that his conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence because the State failed to establish that he was impaired because he had used marijuana or because it was a side-effect of his Adderall medication. According to Mr. McClain, the State did not present any evidence that marijuana or Adderall impairs the average individual or him specifically. He relies on the Second District's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. May\n   </em>\n   , 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25359,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-1542\">\n    2014-Ohio-1542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201419568\">\n    2014 WL 1419568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which held that the State \"must do more\" to establish a violation of Section 4511.19(A)(1)(a)\"than simply present evidence that the defendant has taken * * * medication and shows sign of impairment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46. He also relies on this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Collins\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist. Wayne No. 11CA0027,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-2236\">\n    2012-Ohio-2236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201820866\">\n    2012 WL 1820866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which this Court recognized that Section 4511.19(A)(1)(a) requires \"the State to do more than prove impairment in a vacuum[,]\" and \"specifically requires the State demonstrate that the source of the defendant's impairment was 'alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. In other words, the State must prove that a defendant's \"impaired condition resulted from being under the influence of a drug of abuse.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Although couched as a \"manifest weight\" argument, Mr. McClain's argument that the State \"was unable to provide evidence that the actions and impairment shown by McClain are the result of the use of alcohol or a drug of abuse\" sounds in sufficiency. Mr. McClain also cites\n   <em>\n    State v. Eskridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1412231\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/38/56/\">\n    38 Ohio St.3d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=526%20N.E.2d%20304\">\n    526 N.E.2d 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988), which involved a question about the sufficiency of evidence, not the weight of such evidence. Accordingly, we will review Mr. McClain's argument as a sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Jackson\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist.

In making this determination, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   An appellate court's function when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction is to examine the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Jenks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1708870\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/61/259/\">\n    61 Ohio St.3d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=574%20N.E.2d%20492\">\n    574 N.E.2d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 7} This Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from this case. In\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   , law enforcement officers suspected that Terry Collins was under the influence of drugs because his speech was slower than it had been during previous encounters\n   and because of Mr. Collins's performance on field sobriety tests.\n   <em>\n    Collins\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist. Wayne No. 11CA0027,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-2236\">\n    2012-Ohio-2236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201820866\">\n    2012 WL 1820866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 12-17. This Court concluded that there was insufficient evidence to convict Mr. Collins of violating Section 4511.19(A)(1)(a), however, because, despite Mr. Collins's impaired condition, there was no evidence demonstrating that he was impaired because he was under the influence of a prohibited substance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20. This Court explained that the State had failed to \"establish a nexus between Collins' impaired condition and any type of drug of abuse[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Regarding whether he was under the influence of a drug of abuse, Mr. McClain concedes that he told Trooper Ross that he takes Adderall to treat a medical condition and that troopers found marijuana during a search of his vehicle. Mr. McClain has not contested the State's assertion at trial that marijuana and Adderall both qualify as drugs of abuse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 4511.181(E) ; R.C. 4506.01(M). This case, therefore, more closely resembles\n   <em>\n    State v. Strebler\n   </em>\n   , 9th Dist. Summit No. 23003,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006-Ohio-5711\">\n    2006-Ohio-5711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203078422\">\n    2006 WL 3078422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Strebler\n   </em>\n   , deputies suspected William Strebler of operating a vehicle under the influence after noticing signs of impairment, including several clues during field sobriety testing. Mr. Strebler admitted that he was using Methadone, which was detected in his urine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12, 14. This Court concluded that Mr. Strebler's conviction was supported by sufficient evidence because it was undisputed that he had been operating a vehicle, because he admitted taking Methadone, and because of the number of physiological signs of impairment that did not have another explanation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-20.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Wayne No. 08CA0009,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-6940\">\n    2008-Ohio-6940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%205412884\">\n    2008 WL 5412884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 13 (concluding that conviction for operating under the influence of a drug of abuse was not against the manifest weight of the evidence when the defendant admitted taking a drug of abuse on the day she was stopped and exhibited several physiological factors that evidenced impairment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Trooper Ross testified that Mr. McClain's glassy eyes and dilated pupils indicated that he could possibly be under the influence of a drug or alcohol. He also testified that Mr. McClain's behavior during the field sobriety tests and his performance on them also indicated that Mr. McClain was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Together with Mr. McClain's admission that he was taking a medication that qualifies as a drug of abuse and the presence of marijuana in his car, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence in the record for the trial court to find Mr. McClain guilty of violating Section 4511.19(A)(1)(a). To the extent that Mr. McClain argues that his conviction is against the weight of the evidence, we conclude that the trial court did not lose its way when it found him guilty of the offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Otten\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6711870\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/33/339/#p340\">\n    33 Ohio App.3d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 340,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=515%20N.E.2d%201009\">\n    515 N.E.2d 1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Dist.1986). This is not the exceptional case that requires reversal because the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=515%20N.E.2d%201009\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mr. McClain's assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Mr. McClain's assignment of error is overruled.

Collins,\n   </em>\n   9th Dist. Wayne No. 11CA0027,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-2236\">\n    2012-Ohio-2236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201820866\">\n    2012 WL 1820866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20. Accordingly, I would conclude there was insufficient evidence to support McClain's conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Only three substances were discussed at trial, alcohol, marijuana, and Adderall. There is no evidence in the record that McClain ingested alcohol. He denied alcohol consumption, did not smell of alcohol, and his urine did not test positive for alcohol. Thus, in order to demonstrate that McClain violated R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a), the State was required to demonstrate that he was operating a vehicle while under the influence of a drug of abuse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a). There has been no dispute on appeal that both marijuana and Adderall are drugs of abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Trooper Ross found marijuana in the vehicle, as well as a pipe containing residue. And while McClain admitted to Trooper Ross that he had smoked marijuana, he indicated that he did so, \"a few weeks ago[.]\" Trooper Ross denied that McClain smelled of marijuana or had bloodshot eyes, which Trooper Ross agreed would also correspond to marijuana use. Further, although Trooper Ross testified that McClain demonstrated all of the clues on the horizontal and vertical gaze nystagmus tests, Trooper Ross agreed that someone impaired by marijuana would not demonstrate those clues. Moreover, even though McClain's urine was also tested for drugs, the lab deemed that the sample was insufficient for testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 14} McClain did also admit to taking Adderall. However, there was no testimony about what the signs of Adderall impairment would be. In fact, Trooper Ross seemed to not know much about Adderall at all. Trooper Ross was asked whether the drug panel included amphetamines and he replied that he believed so. However, when he was asked if Adderall was an amphetamine, Trooper Ross responded that he was \"not familiar with Adderall.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Thus, even though there were certainly signs that McClain was impaired. I cannot say that there was sufficient evidence that the impairment was caused by alcohol, marijuana, or Adderall-the only substances that there was a suggestion might be involved. While the indicators of marijuana impairment might be considered commonly known, I cannot conclude there was sufficient evidence that McClain was impaired from marijuana.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Richardson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12281113\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/150/554/\">\n    150 Ohio St.3d 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12281113\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/150/554/\">\n    2016-Ohio-8448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20N.E.3d%20993\">\n    84 N.E.3d 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19. With respect to Adderall, there was no lay or expert testimony explaining the common impairments linked to Adderall use.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20N.E.3d%20993\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, under the particular circumstances of this case, I can only conclude that the State failed to meet its burden. Therefore, I respectfully dissent from the judgment of the majority.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
