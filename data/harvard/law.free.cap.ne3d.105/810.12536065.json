The trial court dismissed plaintiff's amended complaint, finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the matter. In this court, plaintiff argues that the dismissal was improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2 The record shows that plaintiff was a member of Amalgated Transit Union Local 1241 (Union) and employed by the CTA. Plaintiff was terminated on January 24, 2013, and grieved his termination pursuant to his collective bargaining agreement, which provided that disputes concerning the discharge of a Union employee were to be submitted to arbitration. Before the arbitrator, the CTA maintained that plaintiff had violated a Last Chance Agreement by engaging in misconduct on November 29, 2012, specifically, that he had failed to comply with work orders and falsely represented what he had been doing that day in verbal and written reports. On July 22, 2013, after hearing the evidence related to the alleged misconduct, the arbitrator found that the evidence established plaintiff's misconduct and that the CTA had \"good cause for their finding that [plaintiff] had violated the last Chance Agreement.\" Specifically, the arbitrator noted that plaintiff testified that he began his shift at 2 p.m., and the evidence established that he had not performed the required inventory counts that he had been directed to perform as of 3:30 p.m., when his supervisor arrived and found that the inventory forms were blank and that plaintiff \"was wearing gym shoes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3 Although plaintiff claimed that he had been talking to a coworker for an hour and fifteen minutes, the arbitrator found that the timeline of plaintiff's version of events was inconsistent and concluded that plaintiff had \"falsely represented in both verbal and written reports\" what he had been doing that afternoon. The arbitrator noted, however, that plaintiff \"had been retained on the payroll until January 24[,] 2013 without having been given any prior indication that he would be disciplined for the November 2012 misconduct.\" Due to the delay, the arbitrator concluded that plaintiff \"was treated arbitrarily, without due process and [wa]s entitled to be offered reinstatement.\" However, \"[c]onsidering his offense,\" the arbitrator found that plaintiff was \"not entitled to back pay or benefits.\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4 Following the arbitrator's decision, plaintiff filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and other relief against the CTA in the circuit court on April 15, 2014, seeking an award of back pay and benefits. He\n   alleged that the denial of back pay and benefits violated section 12.6 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, which provided that, \"[a]ny Employee, who, upon investigation, is found to have been discharged or suspended unjustly shall be reinstated and reimbursed for all time lost for such discharge or suspension.\" Plaintiff sought \"a declaration by the Court finding that pursuant to Section 12.6 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, [p]laintiff is entitled to back pay and benefits.\" Plaintiff also argued that the collective bargaining agreement \"constituted a bi[n]ding and enforceable contract between [p]laintiff and [the CTA]\" and that the CTA breached that contract. Plaintiff sought damages equal to his \"loss of salary, reimbursement of health insurance costs and reimbursement for moving expenses\" as well as \"reasonable attorney[ ] fees.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5 The CTA filed a motion to dismiss on June 13, 2014. In that Motion, the CTA contended that plaintiff failed to allege a violation of the collective bargaining agreement, where the CTA and the Union had agreed to final and binding arbitration, and there were no allegations that the CTA had not complied with the arbitration award. The CTA also argued that plaintiff's request for declaratory relief should be dismissed because it \"hinges on * * * [his] breach of contract claim, and does not allege any independent legal interest to state a claim for declaratory relief.\" The CTA further argued that plaintiff lacked standing to challenge a breach of the collective bargaining agreement because he is not a party to the agreement and because \"Illinois law specifically prohibits individual employees from bringing a suit to overturn the outcome of a grievance procedure or arbitration under a collective bargaining agreement absent exceptional circumstances.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 Plaintiff filed a response to the CTA's motion to dismiss on August 14, 2014. Plaintiff acknowledged that \"it appears to be true, that under most circumstances an individual, unionized employee lacks standing to challenge an arbitration award, which was made pursuant to a [collective bargaining agreement.]\" However, plaintiff contended that his case fit into an \"exception to th[at] rule\" because \"the U.S. Supreme Court has found that an employee does in fact have standing to challenge an arbitration decision, where it can be shown that the employee's union failed to fairly represent the employee-thereby leaving the employee with no other recourse other [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] than to seek relief at the trial level\" (citing\n   <em>\n    Vaca v. Sipes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169888\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/171/\">\n    386 U.S. 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169888\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/171/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169888\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/171/\">\n    17 L.Ed.2d 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967) ). Plaintiff further argued that the Illinois Supreme Court \"adopted this reasoning * * *, specifically finding that a union employee does have standing to challenge an arbitration decision, where it can be shown that the employees [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] union did not provide fair and adequate representation during the grievance procedure and arbitration\" (citing\n   <em>\n    Stahulak v. City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"926979\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/184/176/\">\n    184 Ill. 2d 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=234%20Ill.%20Dec.%20432\">\n    234 Ill.Dec. 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=703%20N.E.2d%2044\">\n    703 N.E.2d 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998) ). Plaintiff contended that his union did not provide him fair representation, and, accordingly, he had standing \"to independently challenge [the CTA's] breach of the [collective bargaining agreement].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 On October 8, 2014, the trial court struck plaintiff's complaint \"for failure to plead allegations raised in Plaintiff's Response to [the CTA]'s Motion to Dismiss,\" and granted plaintiff time to file an amended complaint to add those allegations. Plaintiff filed his amended complaint on November 12, 2014, which raised additional allegations regarding the Union's duty of fair representation. Specifically, in the amended complaint, plaintiff alleged that, \"despite [p]laintiff's insistence, * * * the Union attorney did not bring up the issue of back pay and benefits\" during the arbitration\n   hearing. After receiving the decision, plaintiff \"informed his Union rep that he wanted the Union to challenge the decision to deny his back-pay and benefits\" but \"the Union rep informed [p]laintiff that he had no other recourse than to seek outside counsel and that the Union would be taking no further action.\" Plaintiff further argued that the \"failure of the Union to raise the issue of back-pay and benefits at the arbitration hearing and its subsequent refusal to challenge the decision to deny back-pay and benefits, constituted a breach of the Union's duty of fair representation to [p]laintiff.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 In December 2014, the CTA filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff's amended complaint. In that motion, the CTA contended that plaintiff's claims were barred by collateral estoppel and\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   because they had been previously litigated to final judgment through the grievance arbitration process. The CTA continued to argue that plaintiff lacked standing to challenge a breach of the collective bargaining agreement, and that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over any claim that plaintiff's union breached its duty of fair representation because it is \"settled Illinois law that the Illinois Labor Relations Board and not the circuit courts hear such claims\" (citing\n   <em>\n    Cessna v. City of Danville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"222656\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/296/156/#p165\">\n    296 Ill.

The CTA also contended that plaintiff failed to allege a violation of the collective bargaining agreement where the CTA and the Union had agreed to final and binding arbitration, and there was no allegation that the CTA has not complied with the arbitration award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 9 Plaintiff filed a response to the CTA's motion to dismiss the amended complaint on February 5, 2015. Plaintiff continued to acknowledge that \"[u]nder some circumstances an individual, unionized employee may lack standing to challenge an arbitration award, which was made pursuant to a [collective bargaining agreement]\" but argued that he had standing \"to independently challenge [the CTA's] breach of the [collective bargaining agreement]\" based on his allegation that the union did not provide him fair representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 10 Following briefing, the circuit court held a hearing on the CTA's motion to dismiss on April 3, 2015. The court heard argument from the parties and denied the CTA's motion. The court found that \"the amended complaint contained sufficient factual allegations to plead that the union breached its duty of fair representation.\" On May 1, 2015, the CTA filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied on August 20, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 11 Thereafter, on September 21, 2015, the CTA filed a \"Third-Party Complaint for Implied Indemnification\" against the Union, arguing that \"[i]f, as the Complaint alleges, [the Union] breached its duty of fair representation to Plaintiff * * *, then some or all of Plaintiff's purported damages were caused by [the Union]'s breach of its duty of fair representation.\" The CTA argued that, if damages were awarded, the Union would be \"liable to CTA for any damages that flow from its breach of its duty of fair representation to Plaintiff.\" The CTA contended that, \"pursuant to 735 ILCS 5/2-406, a complete determination of the controversy between [p]laintiff * * * and CTA cannot be had without the presence of [the Union] in the instant lawsuit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 12 On November 13, 2015, the Union filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff's amended complaint and the third-party complaint filed by the CTA. The Union alleged that plaintiff's complaint was defective and that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider it because the Illinois State Labor Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction over claims that a\n   Union breached its duty of fair representation. Alternatively, the Union claimed that plaintiff had not alleged sufficient facts to support a breach of the duty of fair representation, where he had made no allegations of intentional misconduct or retaliation by the Union. The Union also contended that third-party complaint should be dismissed because, \"[i]f there is liability (which the Union disputes), the CTA and the Union are respectively liable for separate items of damage.\" Finally, the Union argued that it had no obligation to contribute to the damages plaintiff was awarded from the CTA because it theoretically could be liable for back pay only after the date that the employee would have been reinstated and plaintiff was actually reinstated. Thus, it contended, there were no possible damages that could be attributable to the Union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 13 The CTA responded to the Union's motion to dismiss on December 22, 2015. The CTA \"agree[d] with the Union that Plaintiff's Knox's Amended Complaint should be dismissed,\" but contended that the motion to dismiss should be denied as to the third-party complaint, because it was premature and the Union was a necessary party to a determination of the controversy between plaintiff and the CTA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 14 Plaintiff also responded to the Motion to Dismiss on December 23, 2015, contending that the Union's arguments regarding his amended complaint had \"already been adjudicated by the Court and therefore must be denied.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 15 On February 26, 2016, the circuit court held a hearing on the Union's motion to dismiss. After allowing the parties to present arguments, the court indicated that it wanted to \"go back to the subject matter jurisdiction\" issue. Counsel for the Union maintained that the case law instructed that breach of the duty of fair representation cases were required to \"go to the Labor Board,\" but acknowledged that it appeared the Court had \"already decided the issue\" to the contrary. Counsel for the CTA agreed that the Labor Relations Board had exclusive jurisdiction, adding that it was \"subject matter jurisdiction over the question, not the party,\" and thus, plaintiff's complaint against the CTA could not survive if the court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the question of the Union's breach of duty. The Court stated that, after reviewing additional case law, it had reconsidered its prior order and found that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the matter. The court \"\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   reconsider[ed] [its] prior decision,\" \"dismissed plaintiff's complaint,\" and \"dismissed [the third-party complaint] as moot.\" Plaintiff's motion to reconsider the dismissal of the amended complaint was denied on July 19, 2016. Plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal on August 16, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 16 In this court, plaintiff challenges the circuit court's order, which dismissed the amended complaint for lack of jurisdiction and dismissed the third-party complaint as moot. Plaintiff argues that the trial court \"improperly determined that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to determine whether the Union breached its Duty of Fair Representation.\" We review the court's decision to dismiss an action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Country Mutual Insurance Co. v.

Both parties agree that the trial court's\n   decision to dismiss the amended complaint was proper, because the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider plaintiff's claim. The Union also makes additional arguments specific to the dismissal of the CTA's third-party complaint against the Union. Specifically, it contends that \"appellate jurisdiction does not exist\" because plaintiff lacks standing to appeal the dismissal of the CTA's third-party complaint. The Union also claims that it has no responsibility to share in the CTA's possible liability to plaintiff and that plaintiff's complaint is an untimely attack on an arbitration award pursuant to the Uniform Arbitration Act ( 710 ILCS 5/1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (West 2016) ). Plaintiff has not filed a reply brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 18 Because the Union has raised an issue implicating this court's jurisdiction, we will consider that argument first.

Concurrent jurisdiction may lead to forum shopping and inconsistent judgments in similar factual settings. Another consideration is the fact that circuit courts lack jurisdiction to hear claims against unions for breach of the fair duty of representation. Pleading and proving such claims is a prerequisite to maintaining an action against an employer for breach of the collective-bargaining agreement.

We agree with\n   <em>\n    Stahulak\n   </em>\n   that an individual employee represented by a union cannot seek judicial review of a grievance procedure unless he proves that their union breached its duty of fair representation. However, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Foley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cessna\n   </em>\n   , that determination must be made by the Board before an employee may bring an action in the circuit court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b6 32 Nonetheless, even if we were to conclude that, under\n   <em>\n    Stahulak\n   </em>\n   , a claim of the breach of the duty of fair representation need not be brought before the Board, we would still conclude that plaintiff's claims fail to implicate the exception to the general rule that an individual employee lacks standing to seek judicial review of arbitration awards.

To establish intentional misconduct, the employee must prove by a preponderance of the evidence (1) the union's conduct was intentional and directed at the charging party\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   (2) the intentional action occurred because of and in retaliation for some past activity by the employee or because of animosity between the employee and the union's representatives.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=803%20N.E.2d%20119\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b6 33 In this case, plaintiff merely states that the Union breached its duty of fair representation, but he provides no specific factual allegations that would support such a conclusion. Although plaintiff conclusively claims that the Union \"did not bring up the issue of back pay and benefits\" during the arbitration hearing, it is apparent from the arbitration award itself that the issue of back pay and benefits was before the arbitrator, who found that \"[c]onsidering [plaintiff's] offense, he is not entitled to\n   <em>\n    back pay or benefits\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis in original.) The fact that the arbitrator decided the issue against plaintiff does not establish that the Union breached its duty of fair representation. Plaintiff has not pleaded any allegations that would support a conclusion that the Union committed intentional conduct directed at him that was\n   retaliatory or due to animosity between him and the union representatives.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=803%20N.E.2d%20119\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 34 We thus conclude that the exception to the general rule that employees lack standing to seek judicial review of arbitration awards does not apply, and the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider plaintiff's claim that the Union breached its duty of fair representation.
