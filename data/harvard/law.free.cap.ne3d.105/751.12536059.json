Kiger appeals her convictions and sentence entered by the Licking County Court of Common Pleas, on one count of aggravated vehicular homicide, in violation of R.C. 2903.06(A)(1)(a)(B)(1)(2)(a) ; one count of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence, in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a)(G)(1)(a)(i) ; one count of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence, in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(f)(G)(1)(a)(i i) ; and one count of failure to obey a traffic control device, in violation of R.C. 4511.12(A)(B). Plaintiff-appellee is the state of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} At approximately 1:30 a.m. on May 8, 2016, officers from the Newark Police Department were dispatched to the scene of an auto accident at the intersection of Main and Union Streets in Newark, Licking County, Ohio. Upon their arrival, officers observed two disabled vehicles, a silver Lexus SUV and a black Dodge pickup truck. Appellant, who was identified as the driver and sole occupant of the Lexus, was found in the vehicle, restrained in the driver's seat. David Ehlerman, who was identified as the driver and sole occupant of the pickup truck, had been ejected from his vehicle and was found on the roadway. Ehlerman was unconscious and unresponsive when officers reached him. He was transported to the Ohio State University Medical Center in Columbus, where he died of his injuries on May 9, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Officer Ray Lewis arrived at the scene, and made contact with Appellant while she was still in her vehicle. Although Appellant was conscious, she was not fully aware of her surroundings. Officer Lewis detected an odor of alcohol emanating from Appellant's vehicle, but was unable to further investigate due to Appellant's condition. Emergency medical personnel arrived at the scene and assumed care of Appellant. Thereafter, Officer Lewis assisted the other officers with the accident investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Lisa Carkin and Victoria Fitzsimmons witnessed the accident. They were together in a vehicle on Union Street, stopped at a red light at the intersection of Main and Union Streets. Ehlerman was in the vehicle next to them at the intersection. Carkin and Fitzsimmons testified Ehlerman did not pull into the intersection until after the light had turned green. As Carkin was attempting to turn left onto Main Street, she observed Appellant out of the corner of her eye. Carkin immediately slammed on the brakes. She and Fitzsimmons stated Appellant was traveling at a high rate of speed and drove into the intersection through a red light, colliding with Ehlerman's truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Based upon the conditions and locations of the vehicles, Officer Lewis believed Appellant was at fault. Officer Lewis also believed Appellant may have been under the influence of alcohol based upon the odor of alcohol coming from the vehicle, the time of the accident, and the eyewitness accounts Appellant had been traveling at a high rate of speed when she failed to stop at the red light and drove through the intersection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Officer Lewis informed his supervisor of his suspicion, and received authorization to attempt to obtain a blood alcohol test from Appellant. Appellant had been transported to the Ohio State University Medical Center due to her injuries. Officer Lewis retrieved a blood test kit from the police department and proceeded to the hospital. When Officer Lewis arrived at the hospital at approximately 3:00 a.m., he located Appellant in the triage area. Appellant was not conscious; therefore, the officer was unable to obtain her consent for the blood draw. Although Officer Lewis contemplated requesting a search warrant, he determined he would not be able to obtain the warrant and complete the blood draw within the statutory three-hour window following the accident. Officer Lewis was unfamiliar with the procedures for obtaining an after-hours warrant in Columbus, and believed the evidence of Appellant's intoxication would be compromised if he pursued a search warrant rather than proceed with a warrantless blood draw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Hospital personnel performed the blood draw at approximately 3:15 a.m. on May 8, 2016. The specimen was tested at the Ohio State Highway Patrol Crime Lab. The results established Appellant had a blood alcohol content of 0.210.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Over the course of investigating the accident, officers contacted Zachary Bell. Bell advised the officers he came into contact with Appellant outside of Hooligan's Bar in Newark, on the night of the accident. Bell observed Appellant and another individual in a heated discussion. Appellant was crying. Appellant approached Bell's vehicle. Initially, Bell thought Appellant was someone he knew, but soon realized he was mistaken. Appellant asked Bell for a ride home. After speaking with the gentleman with whom Appellant had been in the heated discussion as well as Appellant, Bell agreed. Appellant was highly intoxicated and either would not or could not provide Bell with her address. Bell drove around for 30-45 minutes without being able to find out where Appellant lived. Bell returned to Hooligan's with Appellant in hopes of finding her friends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Bell and Appellant entered the establishment. While Bell was using the restroom, Appellant left the bar and returned to her vehicle. Bell found Appellant in her vehicle and informed her she was in no condition to drive, and asked her to exit the vehicle. Appellant refused and drove out of the parking lot. Bell proceeded to his own vehicle and attempted to catch up to Appellant. He flashed his lights and\n   honked his horn, trying to get Appellant's attention. Bell followed Appellant for a short time, but ended his pursuit due to the high rate of speed at which Appellant was driving. Bell stopped following Appellant approximately \u00bd to 1 mile before the intersection where the accident occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Law enforcement personnel retrieved the airbag control modules from Appellant's Lexus and Ehlerman's pickup truck. Bradley Long, an Ohio State Highway Patrol trooper, conducted an analysis of the modules. The analysis revealed Ehlerman's pickup truck was traveling at a speed of 13 mph at the time of impact and Ehlerman had just started to apply the brakes. The analysis further revealed Appellant's Lexus was traveling in excess of 70 mph 5 seconds prior to the collision, and continued at that speed until the moment of impact. There was no evidence Appellant applied her brakes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On November 10, 2016, the Licking County Grand Jury indicted Appellant on one count of aggravated vehicular homicide in violation of R.C. 2903.06(A)(1)(a)(B)(1)(2)(a) ; one count of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence, in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a)(G)(1)(a)(i) ; one count of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence, in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(f)(G)(1)(a)(i i) ; and one count of failure to obey a traffic control device, in violation or R.C. 4511.12(A)(B). Appellant appeared before the trial court for arraignment on November 17, 2016, and entered a plea of not guilty to the Indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On January 17, 2017, Appellant filed a motion to suppress the results of the warrantless blood draw. Appellant subsequently filed a supplement to the motion to suppress, which the trial court initially denied on March 15, 2017. Thereafter, Appellant filed a motion for reconsideration/motion for leave to file a motion to suppress on March 29, 2017. The trial court conducted a hearing on the motions on April 24, 2017. Via Order filed May 8, 2017, the trial court denied Appellant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The matter proceeded to jury trial on May 17, 2017. After hearing all the evidence and deliberating, the jury found Appellant guilty on Counts 1, 2, and 3. Count 4 was a minor misdemeanor and tried to the court. The trial court found Appellant guilty of Count 4. On June 26, 2017, following a pre-sentence investigation, the trial court sentenced Appellant to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 7 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} It is from these convictions and sentence, Appellant appeals, raising the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   1. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTED TO JUSTIFY THE WARRANTLESS BLOOD DRAW PERFORMED UPON THE APPELLANT\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   2.

Long,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"589985\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/127/328/#p332\">\n    127 Ohio App.3d 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=713%20N.E.2d%201\">\n    713 N.E.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Dist. 1998). During a suppression hearing, the trial court assumes the role of trier of fact and, as such,\n   is in the best position to resolve questions of fact and to evaluate witness credibility.\n   <em>\n    State v. Brooks,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1746541\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/75/148/#p154\">\n    75 Ohio St.3d 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 154,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=661%20N.E.2d%201030\">\n    661 N.E.2d 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996). A reviewing court is bound to accept the trial court's findings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v. Medcalf,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"852547\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/111/142/#p145\">\n    111 Ohio App.3d 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 145,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=675%20N.E.2d%201268\">\n    675 N.E.2d 1268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Dist. 1996). Accepting these facts as true, the appellate court must independently determine as a matter of law, without deference to the trial court's conclusion, whether the trial court's decision meets the applicable legal standard.\n   <em>\n    State v. Williams,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1692088\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/86/37/#p42\">\n    86 Ohio App.3d 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 42,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=619%20N.E.2d%201141\">\n    619 N.E.2d 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Dist. 1993), overruled on other grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 16} There are three methods of challenging a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress on appeal. First, an appellant may challenge the trial court's finding of fact. In reviewing a challenge of this nature, an appellate court must determine whether the trial court's findings of fact are against the manifest weight of the evidence. See,\n   <em>\n    State v. Fanning,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1809976\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/1/19/\">\n    1 Ohio St.3d 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=437%20N.E.2d%20583\">\n    437 N.E.2d 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982) ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Klein,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1473054\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/73/486/\">\n    73 Ohio App.3d 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=597%20N.E.2d%201141\">\n    597 N.E.2d 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991). Second, an appellant may argue the trial court failed to apply the appropriate test or correct law to the findings of fact. In that case, an appellate court can reverse the trial court for committing an error of law. See,\n   <em>\n    Williams,\n   </em>\n   supra. Finally, an appellant may argue the trial court has incorrectly decided the ultimate or final issues raised in a motion to suppress. When reviewing this type of claim, an appellate court must independently determine, without deference to the trial court's conclusion, whether the facts meet the appropriate legal standard in any given case.\n   <em>\n    State v. Curry,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1758945\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/95/93/#p96\">\n    95 Ohio App.3d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 96,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=641%20N.E.2d%201172\">\n    641 N.E.2d 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Dist. 1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 17} In her first assignment of error, Appellant argues the trial court erred in finding exigent circumstances existed which justified her blood to be drawn absent a search warrant. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 18} We note if there are exigent circumstances and \"an officer has probable cause to arrest a driver for OVI, the result of an analysis of a blood sample taken over the driver's objection and without consent is admissible in evidence, even if no warrant had been obtained.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In making this determination, the trial court must examine the totality of facts and circumstances surrounding the arrest. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Miller,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1222347\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/117/750/#p761\">\n    117 Ohio App.3d 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 761,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=691%20N.E.2d%20703\">\n    691 N.E.2d 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997) ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

When evaluating probable cause to arrest for OVI, the totality of the facts and circumstances can support a finding of probable cause to arrest even where no field sobriety tests were administered. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Homan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1090878\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/89/421/#p427\">\n    89 Ohio St.3d 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 427,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=732%20N.E.2d%20952\">\n    732 N.E.2d 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). Furthermore, a police officer does not have to observe poor driving performance in order to effect an arrest for driving under the influence of\n   alcohol if all the facts and circumstances lead to the conclusion that the driver was impaired. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Harrop,\n   </em>\n   5th Dist.

The accident occurred at approximately 1:30 a.m. on May 8, 2016. After his initial contact with Appellant, Officer Lewis was unable to investigate further due to Appellant's condition. Emergency medical personnel at the scene assumed care of Appellant, who was transported to Ohio State University Medical Center in Columbus. Officer Lewis then assisted with the accident investigation. When Officer Lewis arrived at the hospital at 3:00 a.m., Appellant was in triage. Appellant was not conscious; therefore, the officer was unable to obtain her consent for the blood draw. Although Officer Lewis contemplated requesting a search warrant, he determined he would not be able to obtain the warrant and complete the blood draw within the statutory three-hour window following the accident. Officer Lewis was unfamiliar with the procedures for obtaining an after-hours warrant in Columbus, and believed the evidence of Appellant's intoxication would be compromised if he pursued a search warrant rather than proceed with a warrantless blood draw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Based upon the foregoing, we find the trial court's findings of fact to be supported by competent, credible evidence. We further find the trial court did not err in overruling Appellant's motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Appellant's first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In her second assignment of error, Appellant challenges her convictions as against the manifest weight of the evidence. Specifically, Appellant contends the state failed to establish her intoxication was the proximate cause of Ehlerman's death. Appellant maintains the evidence showed Ehlerman's death was the result of her speeding and running the red light, but the state failed to prove her intoxication led to her speeding or running the red light. Appellant submits the testimony revealed she was attempting to get away from Bell, whom she viewed as being a dangerous predator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 27} In determining whether a verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence, the appellate court acts as a thirteenth juror and \"in reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses, and determines whether in resolving conflicts in evidence the jury 'clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.
