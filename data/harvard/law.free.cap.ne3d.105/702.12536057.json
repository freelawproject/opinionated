The issue in\n   <em>\n    Marcum\n   </em>\n   , therefore, only implicated the factors set forth in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12.

Nevertheless, it is fully consistent for appellate courts to review those sentences that are imposed solely after consideration of the factors in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12 under a standard that is equally deferential to the sentencing court.

But the court concluded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The Fourth District correctly held that it could not modify or vacate Marcum's sentence unless it clearly and convincingly found that the record did not support the sentence. Its review of the record revealed that the facts amply supported the sentence.

The Ohio Supreme Court's ultimate conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Marcum\n   </em>\n   was that the facts in the case supported the sentence. We therefore do not find paragraph 23 of the\n   <em>\n    Marcum\n   </em>\n   opinion to be mere dicta. And because none of the Revised Code sections enumerated in R.C. 2953.08(G)(2)(a) applied, the court necessarily considered the sentence relative to R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 13}\n   <em>\n    State v.

The discussion in\n   <em>\n    Marcum\n   </em>\n   relative to the plain language of a statute involved the standard of review: abuse of discretion versus clear and convincing evidence that the record does not support the trial court's findings under relevant statutes or that the sentence is otherwise contrary to law.\n   <em>\n    Marcum\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1, 7-10.

There is nothing new about this type of appellate review-it was part of R.C. 2953.08(G) from the beginning. As Griffin and Katz note:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   The statute itself contributed to the misconception that abuse of discretion remained the standard of review; for \u00a7 2929.12(A) provided: \"[A] court that imposes a sentence under this chapter upon an offender for a felony has discretion to determine the most effective way to comply with the purposes and principles set forth in section 2929.11 of the Revised Code.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Although the section went on to say that the discretion was to be guided by the seriousness and recidivism factors identified in \u00a7 2929.12, the section failed to state-perhaps because it seemed obvious to those who drafted the Ohio Plan-that \u00a7\u00a7 2929.13 (guidance on whether to imprison), 2929.14 (guidance on length of a prison sentence), and 2929.11, itself, were limitations on the sentencing judge's discretion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   In addition, it was easy to overlook the fact that the language in \u00a7 2929.12(A) was not a general grant of discretion but only a grant to exercise discretion with respect to the effectiveness of a sentence in complying with the statutory guidance in those sections not mentioned. Thus, it was only when a choice of sanctions was available to the judge within the statutory limitations that the Ohio Plan contemplated that the judge could exercise\n   discretion. And, even then, that discretion was limited by the principles of proportionality, reasonableness, consistency, and cost set forth in sections 2929.11(B) and 2929.13(A). Ultimately the statute was amended to specify that the sentencing judge's discretion was limited by sections 2929.13 and 2929.14 and that the standard of appellate review was no longer \"abuse of discretion.\" Unfortunately, in the initial years many judges did not want to relinquish the old ways.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Griffin &amp; Katz,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 31} In its final report on draft legislation that would become S.B. 2, the Ohio Criminal Sentencing Commission\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   stated that a sentencing judge's discretion was to be guided through a series of presumptions concerning the principles of felony sentencing, and appellate courts would \"police\" this enhanced discretion in a way that would foster predictability and ease disparity.\n   <em>\n    A Plan for Felony Sentencing in Ohio: A Formal Report of the Ohio Criminal Sentencing Commission\n   </em>\n   , at 49.

The use of the phrase \"clear and convincing\" required the appellate court to have a \"firm belief or conviction\" that the sentences were not supported by the goals and purposes of felony sentencing. It is important to understand that this was not appellate review that examined the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised discretion in selecting a prison term within a defined statutory range for a particular degree of felony. Sentencing judges were given broad discretion to select a sentence within the applicable statutory range.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Appellate review of criminal sentences was meant to be divorced from this discretion, at least insofar as that discretion was exercised in selecting a term of years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Despite the statutory changes made by R.C. 2953.08(G), appellate judges continued to defer to sentencing judges. This caused the legislature to modify R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) to specifically state that \"[t]he appellate court's standard for review is not whether the sentencing court abused its discretion.\" Griffin &amp; Katz,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 42. Importantly, this was not a legislative directive that barred appellate review of any exercise of a sentencing judge's discretion to impose a sentence. Appeals raising issues of proportionality and consistency continued to fall under the \"contrary to law\" provision of R.C. 2953.08(A)(4). To conclude otherwise would be to assume that the legislature jettisoned the original intent behind appellate review under S.B. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Unless one assumes that the Supreme Court created a new level of appellate review beyond that set forth in R.C. 2953.08(G), paragraph 23 of\n   <em>\n    Marcum\n   </em>\n   has to be read as allowing appeals based on consideration of the R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12 factors as falling under the contrary to law provision of 2953.08(A)(4). It is also tempting to read\n   <em>\n    Marcum\n   </em>\n   as restoring the original intent behind appellate\n   review under R.C. 2953.08(G). But if the Supreme Court truly intended to restore appellate review of criminal sentences to the original intent of S.B. 2 as enacted, it would have done so with more than a single sentence. Clarification of the law is still needed. But until then, I agree that appellate courts can, under the R.C. 2953.08(A)(4) contrary to law provision, review sentences imposed after consideration of the factors in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-259\">\n    Randy and Carissa filed separate appeals.

(Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rahab\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19 ; R.C. 2953.08(A) eff. Jan. 1, 1997. This is a high burden to meet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Once the trial court's sentencing statements are considered in this case, it is beyond dispute that the court considered what was required by law and that which was deemed relevant by the parties. In fact, neither defendant advanced any claim that the record did not support the sentence-the sole argument presented for review was that the sentences were contrary to law because the trial court failed to consider R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12, a proposition definitively rejected through even a cursory review of the record. Nevertheless, even if the Joneses had properly framed their argument under\n   <em>\n    Marcum\n   </em>\n   , the trial court's considerations and conclusions are amply supported by the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 49} The trial court considered the defendants' lack of a criminal record, the letters submitted by the defendants regarding their character, and the defendants' support within their community. Tr. 1929:22-24; 1931:23-1932:8. The trial court discounted the defendants' support, however, and noted that none of their supporters saw the evidence at trial or the state of the victim before expressing their support. Tr. 1964:4-21. It was within the trial court's discretion to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 50} The victim did not suffer lightly before death-a stand-alone consideration for sentencing. Tr. 1165:11-16 (death classified as homicide because conditions the victim suffered would have been painful). The trial court was struck by the fact that the emergency room physician, one who has seen tragedy in his career, was moved to tears when relating the severity of the victim's suffering to the jury, a tragedy that should not have happened because simple medical intervention early would have prevented the death. Tr. 1939:24-1940:11; 816:18-817:2. In addressing the defendants' remorse, the trial court noted that the defendants' claim that they did not recognize the severity of the child's plight, until it was too late to save her, was nothing short of incredible. Tr. 1947:1. In the trial court's own words:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   I've never seen-I have-I have been a lawyer and a judge now for almost 17 years and I have never seen, in my career-in my top 5 these are the worst photographs of a child that I have ever seen, and I have seen countless autopsy photos of murders of babies. And for this to be in my top 5, I can't-I can't wrap my mind around the idea that you-that you are suggesting that you didn't see that. That those series of photographs that we saw from the minute that your child was dead that you-somehow you missed this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Tr. 1947:3-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 51} On this point, the court found it important that the victim was found with over 80 marks, scars, bruises, cuts, deep\n   wounds, and foot blisters at the time of her death. Tr. 1952:7-13. The trial court then listened while Randy Jones explained that the scratches were minor and that the child had thrown a \"tantrum\" that caused the blisters. Tr. 1953:4-6; 1954:13-23. The trial court found the defendant's statement incredulous-\"So you're telling me that your child, your 12-year-old child had a tantrum so significant that she caused the damage that we saw in those photos? And you recognize that I have seen the worst photos that humanity has to offer. And that's your explanation?\" Tr. 1955:14-20. The court then noted that the \"scratch\" Randy Jones had so callously referred to was actually a cut that appeared to be caused by a \"huge knife.\" Tr. 1965:15-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 52} To make matters worse, the defendants stated that the reason they failed to take the child to the emergency room earlier was because they relied on a website to diagnose and care for the child. Tr. 1957:14-18. Upon hearing such a statement, the trial court inquired why the defendants failed to accept responsibility for their actions and demonstrate any remorse, knowing what they knew after the fact. Tr. 1958:22-1960:18. Neither had an answer, but continually maintained that they were not aware of the severity of the child's medical plight, despite the fact that the necrosis (dead tissue) the child was found with was so severe that the treating doctor and investigating detective were able to note the condition from the odor alone that filled the room. Tr. 810:12-15; 1963:12-25. The necrosis had been allowed to fester for up to four weeks, and the odor would have been noticeable in as little as two. Tr. 817:10-20. During all of this, the defendants maintained that they believed the victim was suffering from a simple cold-although Carissa willingly sought medical treatment for her own cold symptoms during the same period of time despite the fact that the skin was not rotting off her body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 53} It was not until the end of a lengthy sentencing dialogue that Carissa and Randy Jones finally expressed any degree of remorse for their actions. Tr. 1981:14-17; 1982:4-17. By then, it was too late. The court noted that the child \"died a very painful death,\" and yet the court had not seen either defendant shed \"one tear about the death of your child in front of me.\" Tr. 1987. Nevertheless, the trial court considered the belated statements, but found after giving \"this case more thought than just about any case that I've ever had in my career,\" and despite the fact that the defendants were \"two people that could be just like everybody else,\" that their conduct was so egregious, the injuries and abuse so severe, that a 10-year sentence was appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court was so thorough with the sentencing considerations that none of the trial court's considerations are referenced by either defendant. The record amply supports the sentence. I would affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 54} There are two salient points we must remember. First, like the ones imposed here, sentences that are based solely after consideration of the R.C. 2929.11 principles and the 2929.12 factors are presumptively proportional. They fall within the prescribed range authorized by the legislature. They are not imposed on a consecutive basis. They do not involve a maximum sentence. And more importantly, under\n   <em>\n    Marcum\n   </em>\n   , they are not contrary to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Second, reversing sentences like these where there is evidence in the record supporting the trial court's determination undermines finality in the criminal justice system and creates the dangerous precedent of turning appellate panels into second-tier sentencing courts, without the benefits of interacting with the defendants and sitting through the entire proceeding. These sentences should be disturbed only where the appellate panel finds that the record clearly and convincingly does not support the sentence imposed. This approach does not eliminate \"meaningful\" review. To claim as much would be to ignore the right of the legislature to establish the punishment ranges for offenders and the trial court's authority, discretion, and duty to sentence within those parameters. The key point is that the record ensures the sentence is fair and equitable but within the framework of legislative authority. The Joneses' sentences meet that requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   LARRY A. JONES, SR., P.J.:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    DECISION OF THE MERIT PANEL:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Statement of the Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 56} The victim in this case was the Joneses' 12-year old daughter, T.J., who passed away on February 18, 2013. The Joneses, Florida natives, adopted T.J. in Florida in 2002 when she was approximately eight months old. They made the decision to adopt because Carissa had Lupus, an autoimmune disorder, which she was successfully managing with medication at the time she and Randy wished to start a family. Attempting to get pregnant would have required her to go off her medications, which she did not want to do. The family moved to Cleveland in 2006 for Randy's job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Shortly after they relocated in Cleveland, T.J. was diagnosed with autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (\"ADHD\"), and mild developmental delays. Her parents initially gave her medications to treat the issues, but eventually discontinued doing so because they believed the medications were not working. T.J. also had difficulty communicating and understanding other people. Her parents took her to a psychologist for the communication issues, but stopped doing so in 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 58} T.J. saw a pediatrician in 2007 as part of her school registration, but did not see any doctors after 2009 because, according to Randy, she was \"never sick.\" T.J. had self-injurious behavior and self-picking issues. According to Randy, he and Carissa learned from medical professionals how to deal with the issues and thereafter were able to help T.J. on their own. T.J. was also prone to developing blisters on her body. Randy, who had military experience treating injuries, tended to T.J.'s blisters. According to her parents, T.J. had a high pain tolerance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {\u00b6 59} T.J. initially went to a traditional school, but her parents did not feel it was working for her and, therefore, after the second grade, Carissa, a teacher, home schooled her. An area in the basement of the family's home was set up similar to a classroom and was where T.J. was schooled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   {\u00b6 60} Randy testified at trial. He told the jury that T.J. first started getting blisters on her body when she was three or four years old; he and Carissa noticed them one day after T.J. had been in daycare. They never got a definitive answer as to why T.J. would get them but, as mentioned, Randy would treat them and, according to him, they would generally heal in 10 to 14 days. Randy testified that his treatment of the blisters involved applying a topical antibiotic (Neosporin), hydrogen peroxide, rubbing alcohol, and a mixture of \"home\" remedies, including a salve containing garlic and cayenne pepper. He would daily clean the wounds and, because\n   of T.J.'s picking issues, he would also bandage them daily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    The Days Leading up to T.J.'s Death\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   {\u00b6 61} On February 10, 2013, T.J. and Carissa were both sick with colds. T.J. also had blisters on her feet. Randy and Carissa did not seek professional treatment for T.J.; they treated her at home as they had always done. However, at Randy's urging, Carissa went to an urgent care center for her cold. Randy testified that, on and off since January 2013, Carissa had been fighting a cold which caused her to cough up mucus and because of her inability to shake it, coupled with her Lupus, he urged her to seek professional medical treatment. Carissa was prescribed an antibiotic and she filled the prescription.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    T.J.'s Death\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   {\u00b6 62} T.J. died on a Monday, and the Sunday immediately preceding was the NBA's All-Star Game. Randy testified that it was a family tradition to watch the game and celebrate. According to Randy, on that Sunday, T.J. was getting back to her normal self, appeared to be clear of any cold symptoms, and joined in the festivities. Randy testified that, because of the day's festivities, he did not remove the bandages on T.J. or clean her wounds that day. When T.J. went to sleep that evening she appeared to be fine but awoke in the early morning hours, complaining of a pain in her side. Randy thought she had probably overdone it during the festivities so he gave her a heating pad and took her temperature, which did not indicate a fever. He laid down with her for a while, but left her room when Carissa suggested that T.J. would get more rest if he were not there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   {\u00b6 63} Randy went to sleep in another bed but was awakened by Carissa screaming. He found Carissa in T.J.'s room; T.J. was unresponsive. Randy performed CPR on T.J., who vomitted. Carissa called 911. The 911 dispatcher testified at trial, and Carissa's call to 911 was played for the jury. The dispatcher described hearing Randy in the background, sounding \"panicked,\" and heard him say \"I knew it, I knew it.\" Randy testified that he said \"I knew it\" to mean that he knew he should not have left T.J. that morning to sleep in another bed. According to the dispatcher, although Randy was \"panicked,\" Carissa was \"calm.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   {\u00b6 64} T.J. was transported by ambulance to an emergency room where, among others, Dr. Jamal Alarafi, attended to her and she passed away shortly after arriving at the hospital. Dr. Alarafi testified that he smelled necrotic, or dead, flesh on T.J. Dr. Alarafi did not remove the bandages on T.J.'s feet, but described them as \"dirty,\" observed pus draining from T.J.'s feet, and observed an abscess on her leg. The doctor believed that it would have taken days and weeks of non-management of the wounds for them to develop to the point that they had, and that the smell would have been noticeable within one to two weeks. After viewing pictures of the wounds with the bandages removed, Dr. Alarafi admitted that they depicted wounds in various stages of healing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   {\u00b6 65} Over the defense's objections, Dr. Alarafi was permitted to testify that it was his opinion that T.J. was malnourished.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   He testified that her stomach was distended, and that she was very small and emaciated. The doctor admitted that he did not know if T.J. had always been a small child and that he did not look at any growth charts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   {\u00b6 66} In speaking with Randy and Carissa after T.J.'s death, Dr. Alarafi found\n   Carissa to be \"kind of indifferent,\" and found that \"very strange.\" According to the doctor, Randy told him that T.J. had had a cold and had recently complained of chest pain, they were treating her with over-the-counter medicine, and they did not believe in modern medicine. The statement regarding disbelief in modern medicine was not reflected in the doctor's notes, however, and Randy testified that he never said that and that he and Carissa did believe in modern medicine. Dr. Alarafi also initially testified that Randy told him that T.J. had not been immunized but, later admitted, after reviewing his notes, that Randy said he was not sure whether she had been immunized; the record indicates that T.J. had, in fact, been immunized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   {\u00b6 67} Dr. Alarafi opined that T.J. \"probably\" would have survived if a medical professional had been involved in her care. He testified that T.J.'s condition \"shocked\" him, that he had been in medicine for over 20 years, and T.J.'s situation was the \"worst case I've ever seen of anything like this.\" Dr. Alarafi contacted the police to investigate T.J.'s death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   {\u00b6 68} Officer Timothy Casto spoke with Randy at the hospital. Randy told him that he and Carissa had taken T.J. to a doctor a month earlier for a physical, but Randy was unable to tell the officer the doctor's name or office location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    Autopsy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   {\u00b6 69} An autopsy was performed on T.J.'s body on February 19, 2013, the day following her death. Deputy medical examiner Dr. Andrea McCollum, who supervised the autopsy, testified at trial. The cause of death was \"polymicrobial sepsis,\" \"acute necrotizing bronchopneumonia,\" and \"staphylococcus, left leg abscess\" and the manner of death was designated as homicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   {\u00b6 70} Dr. McCollum explained that T.J. had an abscess, or a swollen area filled with pus, in her left leg near her ankle. The abscess became infected with a bacterium called staphylococcus (a staph infection), the infection festered, traveled into her bloodstream, and caused her to develop severe pneumonia in her lungs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   {\u00b6 71} Dr. McCollum testified that the manner of death was designated as homicide based on the Joneses' inaction: \"[T.J.] was a child. A 12-year old cannot be expected to seek medical attention. * * * They depend on their caregivers to provide that attention for them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   {\u00b6 72} Dr. McCollum admitted that T.J. could have developed the infection without having had the foot ulcers, and that the infection could have developed within a matter of hours or days. But she also testified that wounds on T.J.'s feet were to the point where T.J.'s tissue was actually dying, and that would have taken days to weeks to progress to that point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   {\u00b6 73} Further, Dr. McCollum testified about injuries T.J. had on her neck, head, torso, right arms and legs, and left leg, and that T.J. had bedsores. Dr. McCollum also testified that T.J. was in the 10th percentile on the body mass index and below the 5th percentile for stature for age and weight for her age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   {\u00b6 74} Neither defense counsel for Randy nor Carrisa questioned Dr. McCollum on cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   {\u00b6 75} Dr. Thomas Gilson (\"Dr. Gilson\"), the chief medical examiner for Cuyahoga County, also testified as follows to elaborate on the homicide manner of death designation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   We felt that this was an instance of medical negligence as the result of a caregiver not providing adequate care to this child. A reasonable person would have sought treatment for this child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   This child had gangrene on her feet. She had an abscess. These are conditions that would have been painful. * * * They would have been foul-smelling.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   {\u00b6 76} According to Dr. Gilson, T.J. also would have been \"coughing, bringing up phlegm,\" and would have appeared \"very sick.\" Dr. Gilson admitted that a person can develop sepsis, as T.J. had, and die suddenly from that. But it was his opinion that that did not occur in this case. Specifically, he testified that the evidence from the autopsy findings indicated that T.J. did not die from \"necrotizing fasciitis,\" which occurs when bacteria \"seed\" then quickly proliferate in the fascia (tissue that surrounds the muscle), before causing sepsis. The doctor also testified that he did not observe any active bedsores on T.J.'s body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   {\u00b6 77} Counsel for Randy did not cross-examine Dr. Gilson and Carissa's counsel cross-examined him only as to the autopsy procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    Investigation into T.J.'s Death\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   {\u00b6 78} One of the officers who responded to the Joneses' home as a result of the 911 call photographed the home. The photographs showed various over-the-counter medications and supplies in T.J.'s room. Also found in T.J.'s room was Carissa's antibiotic prescription, which had been filled at a CVS Pharmacy on February 10, 2013. Randy denied that either he or Carissa had given the antibiotic to T.J., and the laboratory results from the autopsy were inconclusive as to the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   {\u00b6 79} In March 2013, Paul Sturman (\"Sturman\"), an investigator for the Cuyahoga County Department of Children and Family Services (\"CCDCFS\"), interviewed the Joneses at their home. Sturman testified that the Joneses were cooperative and still in shock and grieving. He viewed the schooling area for T.J. and found it to be adequate and appropriate. A day-by-day calendar in the schooling area showed the date of \"January 7.\" Sturman testified about T.J.'s history, the days leading up to her death, and the day of her death, the sum and substance of which was generally the same as has already been stated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   {\u00b6 80} Sturman also questioned the Joneses about the other injuries on T.J.'s body. The Joneses told him that they attributed them to T.J.'s self-injurious behavior. Randy also told Sturman that it was like \"pulling teeth\" to get T.J. to tell them how she got her injuries, and so they set up a camcorder to help them learn. Further, Randy also said that because of her high tolerance for pain, T.J. could get burned or blisters without calling out in pain. The Joneses also told Sturman that T.J. was a \"hefty eater,\" but just did not gain weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   {\u00b6 81} Detective Darren Porter was assigned to investigate the case. He was called to the scene after the 911 call and arrived when T.J. was in the ambulance. Detective Porter testified that he did not smell any odors in the home except for vomit. He saw food in T.J.'s bedroom. The detective also went to the hospital, and testified that when he entered the examination room where T.J.'s body was he immediately smelled something foul. He also testified that he saw Randy at the hospital and he was \"highly emotional.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    The Defense's Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    Randy's Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   {\u00b6 82} As mentioned, Randy testified at trial. In addition to himself, he presented seven other witnesses. One of the witnesses, Dr. Janice Ophoven, a pediatric forensic pathologist, testified as an expert witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   {\u00b6 83} Dr. Ophoven testified that bacteria can cause a rapid and fatal infection in just a few hours, and that with an infection, no one can predict a time line. She\n   opined that if the infection had been in T.J.'s body for an extended period of time, it would have traveled into T.J.'s deep tissue and bones, and there was no evidence of that. Dr. Ophoven found Randy's treatment of T.J.'s blisters appropriate and testified that his home remedy would have likely reduced the amount of pain T.J. experienced. The doctor also did not find any evidence of abuse or malnutrition of T.J. She testified that anyone undergoing approximately 45 minutes of CPR, as T.J. had, would have a distended stomach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   {\u00b6 84} After her review of this case, which included the autopsy protocol, Dr. Ophoven agreed with the medical examiner's determination as to the cause of T.J.'s death, but disagreed with the homicide designation as the manner of death. According to Dr. Ophoven, T.J. died of natural causes as a result of the bacteria spreading through her body. Dr. Ophoven testified that she believed that the Joneses were unaware of how sick T.J. was, and that they were not neglectful by not taking her to a doctor because \"you don't take your kid to the doctor to discover unknown diseases if they don't have signs and symptoms of diseases.\" But the doctor also admitted that there was a \"component of delay in seeking medical attention,\" and that a \"typical\" family would have sought medical treatment. She attributed the other injuries on T.J.'s body as the result of T.J.'s self-picking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   {\u00b6 85} Dr. Ophoven also testified that there is debate within the forensic pathology community over the use of the term \"homicide.\" She believed that defining homicide as \"being death at the hands of another\" is \"oversimplified.\" The doctor gave the example of backing over a child in a driveway; she opined that that would be an accident, rather than a homicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   {\u00b6 86} Randy's remaining witnesses were character witnesses, who collectively testified that the Joneses had a loving and nurturing relationship with T.J., that they never noticed anything was amiss with the family, and that they were shocked by the charges brought against Randy and Carissa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    Carissa's Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   {\u00b6 87} Carissa did not testify, but presented one witness, her cousin. The cousin testified that Randy was the \"emotional\" one in the relationship, while Carissa was the \"stern\" one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    State's Rebuttal Witness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   {\u00b6 88} The state presented one rebuttal witness, a parishioner from the Joneses' church. According to the parishioner, the Jones family \"secluded\" themselves and T.J. appeared to be afraid of Carissa. The parishioner testified that she once noticed that T.J.'s ankles appeared to be swollen, but she could not qualify when that was. She admitted, however, that T.J. never appeared to have any mobility issues and she never felt the need to contact CCDCFS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    Verdict and Sentence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   {\u00b6 89} On the above evidence, the jury found Randy and Carissa each guilty of involuntary manslaughter, permitting child abuse, and two counts of endangering children. The jury found them both not guilty of one count of endangering children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties agreed that the counts all merged, and the state elected to proceed to sentencing under the involuntary manslaughter count. Neither Randy nor Carissa had a criminal history. As mentioned, the trial court sentenced each to a ten-year term in prison. This appeal ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In their first assignments of error, Randy and Carissa contend that the trial court erred in denying their Crim.R. 29 motions. Both contend that the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that they acted recklessly, the mens rea for the crimes, and that the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that their actions/inactions were the proximate cause of T.J.'s death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   {\u00b6 91} When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, our inquiry focuses primarily upon the adequacy of the evidence; that is, whether the evidence, if believed, reasonably could support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The record demonstrates that since 2009 they did not have T.J. under any medical care, including during the time of her illness immediately preceding her death. In finding the evidence sufficient to support the convictions, we note that it was not necessary for the state to prove that Randy and Carissa knew specifically what medical condition T.J. had or that it would lead to her death. Rather, under R.C. 2919.22, the endangering children statute, the state was only required to prove that the Joneses, through their inaction, created a \"substantial risk to the health or safety\" of T.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   {\u00b6 95} Dr. McCollum testified that the gangrenous wounds on T.J.'s feet had developed for days or weeks and were to the point where the tissue was dying. Dr. Alarafi also testified that the wounds had to have been present for a period of time to have deteriorated to the point they had. The three doctors who testified for the state-Drs. McCollum and Alarafi, along with Dr. Gilson-all believed that a reasonable person would have sought medical treatment for the wounds on T.J.'s feet. Drs. McCollum's and Gilson's testimony as to the substantive findings of the autopsy were not challenged by the defense. And, even the defense's witness, Dr. Ophoven, admitted that there was a \"component of delay in seeking medical attention.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   {\u00b6 96} Further, at the hospital Randy told the police that he and Carissa had taken T.J. to a doctor one month prior to her death, but admitted during his testimony that T.J. had not been to a doctor in the approximately four years before her death. A reasonable inference could be made from that testimony that the Joneses believed that they should have sought medical treatment for their daughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   {\u00b6 97} Another reasonable inference could have been made, based on the evidence that T.J. had bedsores, food was found in her room, and the day-by-day calendar in the schooling area had the date \"January 7,\" that T.J. had become so ill that she was bedridden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   {\u00b6 98} In light of the above, the state presented sufficient evidence of recklessness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   {\u00b6 99} We likewise find that the state presented sufficient evidence that the Jones's inaction was the proximate cause of T.J.'s death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   {\u00b6 100} Criminal conduct constitutes the \"proximate cause\" of a death, when the conduct \"(1) caused the result, in that but for the conduct, the result would not have occurred, and (2) the result [was] foreseeable.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although Dr. McCollum did testify that an infection \"can happen independently as well,\" the state presented sufficient evidence that that was not the case here, and that was not Dr. McCollum's opinion. The state presented testimony that the staph infection developed in T.J.'s left ankle and caused bacteria to enter her bloodstream, that traveled to her lungs, caused severe pneumonia, and killed her. Thus, the state presented evidence that, if believed, proved that without the abscess in T.J.'s ankle, there would have been no staph infection and no pneumonia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   {\u00b6 102} As to foreseeability, the state also presented sufficient evidence that, if believed, would prove that the consequences of the Jones's inaction were \"natural and logical.\" As mentioned, although a person can have a staph infection without visible injuries, the state presented evidence that that was not the case with T.J. Specifically, the state presented evidence about the foul odor that was coming from T.J.'s feet, as well as the appearance of her feet and legs.

The statement made by the court was as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-228\">\n   Now, I've outlined the essential elements of the offenses charged in this indictment.

Rather, it was introduced as \"part and parcel\" of the state's theory of recklessness; that is, as the assistant prosecuting attorney contended, for the jury to \"[l]ook at [the evidence] in the lens of the duty of care that parents owe to their children,\" and to consider it in light of the fact that Carissa sought medical treatment for herself days before T.J.'s death, but did not do the same for T.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   <strong>\n    Definition of Homicide: Legal Definition v.
