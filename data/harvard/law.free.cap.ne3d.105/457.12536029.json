Hinton, appeals a decision and entry of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas entered February 23, 2017, that granted summary judgment to defendants-appellees, Ohio Bureau of Sentence Computation (\"OBSC\") and Ohio Department of Rehabilitation &amp; Correction (\"ODRC\") (collectively referred to as \"appellees\"). Because we agree with the trial court that credit for good behavior is deducted from the minimum but not the maximum measures of an indeterminate sentence, we overrule Hinton's assignment of error and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL POSTURE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On December 19, 1994, following Hinton's guilty plea to two counts of rape, the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas sentenced Hinton to two indefinite sentences of 9 to 25 years, to be served concurrently with each other. (Dec. 19, 1994 Jgmt. Entry case No. B 945589, Ex. A attached to July 25, 2016 Compl.) Over 21 years later, on July 25, 2016, Hinton filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment against appellees alleging that three years of credit for good behavior, having been applied to the minimum term of his sentence, should also have reduced his total sentence. (Compl.) Hinton's complaint included copies of correspondence between Hinton and appellees indicating that Hinton and appellees reached an impasse on the issue. (Exs. B-C attached to Compl.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellees answered, admitting most of the pertinent background facts, including that Hinton began serving his 9-to-25-year sentence on December 27, 1994. (Sept. 26, 2016 Answer at \u00b6 1-5\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   .) On October 21, 2016, after filing its answer, appellees filed \"DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR LEAVE TO PROCEED,\n   <em>\n    INSTANTER\n   </em>\n   WITH THEIR MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND IN THE ALTERNATE MOTION TO DISMISS WITH MOTION TO STRIKE PLAINTIFF'S EXHIBIT AT PAGE 13 OF PLAINTIFF'S COMPLAINT AS IRRELEVANT.\" (Emphasis sic.) (Oct. 21, 2016 Mot. for Summ. Jgmt.) Essentially,\n   appellees' motion had the potential of being four motions in one-a motion to strike certain news articles attached to the complaint, a motion for summary judgment, a request that the trial court consider the motion for summary judgment, and, in the alternative, a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Exhibits were filed with the four-in-one motion, the trial court treated it as a summary judgment motion, and the parties addressed it in the record as a motion for summary judgment. (Feb. 23, 2017 Decision in passim; Feb. 21, 2017 Entry at 2.) The trial court did not need to give separate notice under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) that it was considering summary judgment, since an answer had been filed, and appellees' out-of-rule motion to dismiss was in the alternative to its motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

However, this provision was not a part of the Ohio Constitution or in effect at the time Hinton filed his action.

The straightforward legal issue Hinton places before us is whether the approximately three years of credit he earned for good behavior and participation in prison programs, should have reduced his maximum sentence as a logical consequence of reducing his minimum sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    III. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In granting appellees' motion for summary judgment, the trial court found that Hinton was not entitled to an interpretation of law that reduced his maximum sentence, even though his minimum sentence had been reduced so that he could appear before the APA earlier than he would have without his \"good time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The facts in evidence before the trial court included an affidavit appellees attached to its somewhat unorthodox motion for summary judgment of an auditor for appellees, Kimberly Guitner. (Guitner Aff. at \u00b6 3, Ex. A attached to Oct. 21, 2016 Memo. in Opp.) Guitner swore by affidavit that, based on documents attached as sub-exhibits A-1 through A-12, Hinton's sentence was a 9-year minimum and a 25-year maximum.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b610. The expiration of the maximum, according to Guitner, was December 13, 2019.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b611. Guitner explained that Hinton's good-time credit, earned credit, and jail-time credit (a total of 992 days) has been deducted from his minimum sentence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b614-16. As previously detailed in a letter to Hinton in January 2016, these credits reduce the minimum sentence so that the inmate is eligible for parole sooner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b622;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Guitner Aff. at Ex. A-12. But earned and good-time credits, unlike jail-time credit, have no effect on the maximum possible sentence. (Guitner Aff. at \u00b6 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 23} On November 7, 2016, Hinton filed a memorandum in opposition to appellees' motion. (Nov. 7, 2016 Memo. in Opp.) Hinton did not disagree with Guitner's calculation of his maximum-sentence expiration date based on his original sentence. (Diagram, App'x at 11 attached to Nov. 7, 2016 Memo. in Opp.) He argued that he had 16 years to serve following the completion of his minimum sentence of 9 years. (Nov. 7, 2016 Memo. in Opp. at 5.) Assuming that approximately three years were deducted from his minimum sentence for good-time, earned, and jail-time credits, Hinton reasoned once he served 16 years after his minimum 9-year sentence expired, he should have been freed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He argued the approximate three-year deduction of credits from his minimum sentence also applied in computing his maximum sentence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He argued for a release date of December 13, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment, concluding that appellees' calculation of Hinton's release date, based on the relevant law and agreed facts, was correct. (Feb. 23, 2017 Decision at 6-7.) It also noted that even if Hinton's claims were construed as a motion for postconviction relief or a petition for a writ of mandamus, they would fail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Hinton now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

However, though this had the effect of having the APA consider granting parole at an earlier point in time from his original sentencing date and thereby potentially reducing the\n   <em>\n    minimum\n   </em>\n   amount of time he had to serve, it did not alter the maximum time he could be required to serve under the trial court's original sentence. In reaching this conclusion, we take into consideration that \"in the event of breaking his parole he might under certain circumstances be returned to the penitentiary to serve out the balance of his time.\"\n   <em>\n    O'Neill v.

That is, were good time permitted to reduce the maximum sentence, an inmate released upon having served the minimum (and reduced) sentence but who violates parole, could argue that he or she would not need to serve all of the remainder of the maximum sentence if denied further community supervision. Thus, in following\n   <em>\n    Vaughn,\n   </em>\n   neither we, nor the APA, are in a position to reduce a trial court's maximum sentence for indeterminate sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Hinton's contention that he was required to serve a minimum sentence of 9 years plus a possible 16 years so that reducing the 9-year sentence logically reduces the total sentence of 9 years plus 16 years misapprehends the nature of his indefinite sentence.\n   <em>\n    Vaughn.\n   </em>\n   His sentence was a maximum of 25 years, with a minimum of 9 before he became eligible for release.

The risk score represents an inmate's risk of recidivism and is calculated by analyzing several objective factors, including an inmate's prior convictions, incarcerations, age, and prior parole and probation history. These factors are given numerical values that are added to arrive at a number between zero and eight, with eight indicating the greatest risk of recidivism. These risk scores are similar to the risk scores used in the matrix. Second, the parole board assigns an offense category. The offense category is determined by analyzing the conduct leading to the inmate's current incarceration based on the offense of conviction. The offense is then placed in categories numbered one through 13, with 13 being the most serious offense. The offense category is a new creation and was not used in the matrix. Third, the parole board evaluates the risk score and offense category. The risk score and offense category are utilized in a guideline-grid chart to suggest a range of months the inmate should serve before being paroled. The horizontal axis of the grid lists the eight risk of recidivism factors, while the vertical axis of the grid lists the 13 categories of offenses. After locating the category of offense along the vertical axis and then locating the risk score along the horizontal axis, the parole board then finds the intersection of these categories on the grid, which suggests a range of months to be served by the inmate before becoming eligible for parole. Fourth, the parole board decides whether to follow or depart from the suggestion of the guidelines. If it chooses to follow the guidelines, the board picks a period within the suggested range that the offender should serve. \"Good time\" as a consideration is eliminated under the new guidelines and is now presumed.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    <em>\n     Ankrom v.
