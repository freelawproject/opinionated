The minor child, R.P. who is the subject this case, was born on September 10, 2015 to appellee Amanda M. Parks, and appellant's son, Michael C. Parks. At the time of his birth, the two were not married but later married on February 12, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Appellees filed a Motion to dismiss the complaint on February 27, 2017, arguing\n   that application of R.C. 3109.12 to them, an intact, married family unit, was unconstitutional. Appellees cited to this court's Opinion in\n   <em>\n    Rugola-Dye v. Dye\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist. Delaware No. 08 CAF 06 0038,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009-Ohio-2471\">\n    2009-Ohio-2471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%201485035\">\n    2009 WL 1485035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A hearing for the limited purpose of determination of paternity was held on February 27, 2017. Appellees did not contest the issue of paternity. Pursuant to a Magistrate's Decision and Judgment Entry filed on March 2, 2017, the Magistrate found that appellee Michael C. Parks was the father of R.P. and that a parent-child relationship existed between the two. The Magistrate further found that appellee Amanda M. Parks and appellee Michael C. Parks were married on February 12, 2016 and continued to be married, sharing a residence with their son. The trial court approved and adopted the Magistrate's Decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellant, on March 16, 2017, filed a memorandum in opposition to the Motion to Dismiss and appellees filed a reply on March 20, 2017. As memorialized in a Magistrate's Decision filed on March 22, 2017, the Magistrate recommended that the Motion to Dismiss be granted, applying this Court's precedent in the\n   <em>\n    Rugola-Dye\n   </em>\n   case. Appellant filed objections to the Magistrate's Decision on April 3, 2017 and appellees filed a response on April 26, 2017. The trial court, on November 29, 2017, issued an Opinion and Judgment Entry overruling the objections and ordering that the Motion to Dismiss the Complaint be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Appellant now raises the following assignment of error on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} I.

Appellant specifically asks that this Court reconsider our decision in such case arguing that this case presents a constitutional question of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} \"Constitutional analysis is a question of law that we review de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

R.C. 3109.12(A) governs the issue of the grandmother's right of visitation with the minor child in this case. That section provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} [i]f a child is born to an unmarried woman, the parents of the woman and any relative of the woman may file a complaint requesting the court of common pleas of the county in which the child resides to grant them reasonable companionship or visitation rights with the child. If a child is born to an unmarried woman and if the father of the child has acknowledged the child and that acknowledgment has become final pursuant to section 2151.232, 3111.25, or 3111.821 of the Revised Code or has been determined in an\n   action under Chapter 3111. of the Revised Code to be the father of the child, the father may file a complaint requesting that the court of appropriate jurisdiction of the county in which the child resides grant him reasonable parenting time rights with the child and the parents of the father and any relative of the father may file a complaint requesting that the court grant them reasonable companionship or visitation rights with the child\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} R.C. 3109.12(B) provides that [t]he marriage or remarriage of the mother or father of a child does not affect the authority of the court under this section to grant * * * the parents or relatives of the natural father or the parents or relatives of the mother of the child reasonable companionship or visitation rights with respect to the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In the\n   <em>\n    Rugola-Dye\n   </em>\n   case cited above, the appellants, Michael C. and Jessica L. Dye, fka Ward, appealed the decision of the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, which granted a complaint for grandparent visitation in favor of appellee Mary C. Rugola. Appellants were the parents of a son, \"H.D.\", born in 2005. Appellants were not married to each other at the time H.D. was born. Appellant Michael had legally acknowledged paternity of the child. Appellants did marry about eighteen months after H.D.'s birth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Appellee, H.D.'s paternal grandmother, filed a complaint in the trial court on May 22, 2006 seeking grandparent visitation under R.C. 3109.12. Following a hearing, the trial court, issued a Judgment Entry granting appellee Grandmother Mary C. Rugola-'reasonable' Companionship time with her grandson. The appellants then appealed to this Court arguing, in part, that the trial court's decision was an unconstitutional application of R.C. 3109.12. We agreed. In our Opinion, this Court stated, in relevant part, as follows at paragraphs 18-23:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Troxel v.
