Dornoff, Jr., appeals the September 14, 2016 judgment of the Wood County Court of Common Pleas, where he was sentenced to 15 years of incarceration, following acceptance of his negotiated guilty plea agreement. For the reasons which follow, we vacate and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant sets forth the following assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   1. The trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant in accepting a guilty plea, which was not made knowingly, in violation of appellant's due process\n   rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2. The trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant by denying his motion to withdraw his plea.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On September 3, 2015, appellant was charged in a six-count indictment with three counts of rape with firearm specifications, one count of felonious assault with a sexual motivation specification, one count of felonious assault with firearm and sexual motivation specifications and one count of kidnapping with a sexual motivation specification. Appellant entered a plea of not guilty. The charges stem from an incident which occurred on August 29, 2015, when appellant drove a woman to a cemetery, allegedly threatened her and struck her on the head with a rifle, then raped her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On September 7, 2016, a jury trial commenced. The trial concluded on September 8, 2016, when the court became aware that appellant agreed to enter a plea. On September 12, 2016, appellant entered a guilty plea to one count of rape with a firearm specification, one count of felonious assault with a sexual motivation specification and one count of kidnapping with a sexual motivation specification. On the document entitled \"Plea of Guilty to Amended Indictment and Waiver of Trial by Jury,\" it provided in relevant part that \"[t]he defendant is also aware that he will be required to register as a Tier 2 and Tier 3 Sexual Offender.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Sentencing proceeded immediately after the plea was accepted. Appellant was sentenced to 11 years in prison on the rape count, 4 years in prison on the felonious assault count and 11 years in prison on the kidnapping count. The rape and the kidnapping counts were ordered to be served concurrently, for an aggregate sentence of 15 years of incarceration. The remaining counts of the indictment were dismissed. The court filed its judgment entry on September 14, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On September 30, 2016, appellant filed with the trial court a pro se motion to withdraw his plea. The court denied the motion on October 3, 2016. Appellant filed another motion to withdraw his plea with the trial court, on November 3, 2016. This second motion was also denied by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On December 28, 2016, appellant filed with this court a motion for leave to file a delayed appeal; we found appellant's motion well-taken. Appellant then filed his appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error No. 1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellant argues his plea was not knowingly or voluntarily offered as the trial court did not discuss registration duties, community notification requirements, duration or penalties associated with being classified as a Tier III sexual offender prior to accepting his guilty plea. In addition, appellant contends his plea document did not provide specific information pertaining to Tier III registration requirements. Appellant submits the court's failure to inform him of Tier III registration requirements should be viewed as a complete failure to comply and his plea must be vacated without a showing of prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Crim.R. 11\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Crim.R. 11(C) governs guilty and no contest pleas in felony cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Before a trial court may accept a guilty plea, it must address the defendant personally and inform him of, and ensure that he understands, \"the nature of the charges and of the maximum penalty involved\" and the \"effect of the plea of guilty.\" Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) and (b).

However, the plea document lacked any specificity as to the punitive consequences associated with being classified as a Tier II and Tier III sexual offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 17} At the plea hearing, the prosecutor indicated to the trial court that appellant was entering a guilty plea to three counts and \"will be registered as a Tier III sex offender.\" However, during the plea hearing, the trial judge did not advise appellant that he would have to register as a sexual offender, nor was appellant informed of any of the punitive consequences of entering a guilty plea and having a sexual offender classification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 18} During the sentencing hearing, which occurred immediately after appellant's guilty plea was accepted, the judge informed appellant that he would be required to register as a Tier II sexual offender, which requires in-person registration for a period of 25 years, every 180 days, and a Tier III sexual offender, which requires registration, in person, every 90 days, for the rest of his life. Appellant acknowledged he understood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 18} We conclude the trial court failed to comply with Crim.R. 11(C)(2) by not informing appellant of the registration requirements, community notifications and residential restrictions associated with being classified as a Tier II and III sexual offender prior to accepting appellant's guilty plea. We further conclude the trial court's failure to comply with Crim.R. 11(C)(2) renders appellant's plea involuntary, unknowing and invalid. Accordingly, appellant's first assignment of error is well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In light of the foregoing, the trial court's September 14, 2016 judgment is hereby vacated, and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this decision. As a result of this determination, appellant's second assignment of error is rendered moot.
