While it is argued on behalf of the defendants that under Section 3 of the Trinidad Ordinances these copies should have been delivered to the Colonial Secretary by the printers, we think that Judge Byers properly held in his opinion that the plaintiff had mailed the copies on behalf of the printers and that the latter could act through Khan as their agent in making the delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">The assignment of the song and of the right to copyright it made by Grant to Khan in Trinidad on or about March 1, 1943, was oral, but later Ellis reduced the assignment to writing, as appears in Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 17, which we set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Grant executed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">The written assignment by Grant dated April 16, 1945, confirmed the plaintiff\u2019s proprietorship in the song that entitled him to the protection of the copyright laws of the United States.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendants contend that the assignment by Grant to the plaintiff was invalid because it was not made in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>writing at the time of the oral agreement therefor. But the writing, like the memorandum of an oral agreement under the statute of frauds,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we regard as sufficient to satisfy the British Copyright Law by confirming the prior oral assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">In December 1944 the defendants obtained a United States copyright for their song \u201cRum and Coca-Cola\u201d in the name of Amsterdam and later in the joint names of Amsterdam and the other individual defendants. Two of the stanzas of this song, as we have already said, were identical with those copyrighted in Trinidad by the plaintiff. Though the music for the defendants\u2019 lyrics was composed by Baron, the words and music of defendants\u2019 song were copyrighted as a whole. So far as Baron cooperated in the infringement of those lyrics which were identical with verses \u2022copyrighted by plaintiff, Baron was an infringer, as well as Amsterdam who furnished the lyrics, and Leo Feist, Inc., the publisher. The extent of Baron\u2019s liability as a contributor for any profits that have been realized through the infringement of plaintiff\u2019s verses will have to be determined on the accounting which has been ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Defendants argue that the alleged \u25a0infringing lyrics were not subject to copyright by Grant because they had become part of the public domain, but the trial judge found that Grant was the author upon the basis of what must be regarded as substantial evidence and we can discover no justification for reversing the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Defendants further contend that the English Copyright Act and the applicable Trinidad Ordinances invalidated any assignment by Grant to Khan that was not in writing and executed at the time the latter received a conveyance of Grant\u2019s rights. As we have already said, the requirement of the Copyright Act that an assignment be in writing was satisfied by the written confirmation of the prior oral assignment by Grant to Khan.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">The English decisions<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> on which the \u25a0 defendants rely are inapplicable to the case at bar and do not affect the rights of the plaintiff. We however have found no controlling decision invalidating an oral assignment which has been confirmed by a later writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">Clementi v. Walker and Chappell v. Purday, supra, turned on the holding of the court that the copyright statute of Queen Anne did not extend protection to foreigners where there had been publication by third parties in England before the execution of a written assignment. In each case there had been publication abroad by a foreign author and importation into England prior to a later assignment in writing to the plaintiff. It was held that in such circumstances there was a dedication to the public which prevented subsequent copyright protection in England. It is to be remembered that these two decisions preceded the enactment of an international copyright law and dealt with the rights of Englishmen to copy foreign writings which had been published in England before any copyright had been perfected in that country.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">In the Jude decision as assignment was not involved, but only a license. In Performing Right Society the question was whether an assignment of literary property to be acquired in the future transferred more than equitable rights to future copyrighted property and it was held that the legal title to such copyrighted property remained in the assignor. We think the decision has no bearing on the case before us. Nicol v. Barranger held that a plaintiff who had no title to a copyright at law or in equity at the time when he commenced his action could not secure relief in that action by means of a title subsequently acquired, but must discontinue and begin another suit after obtaining an assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">The defendants further attack the plaintiff\u2019s song and the suit to enforce his copyright because of its alleged immoral tendencies. It seems exaggerated to hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>that the rather cheap and vulgar verses would tend to promote lust. We hold that Judge Byers properly refused to grant a dismissal of the suit on such a ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">The defense of laches in bringing suit also interposed is clearly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-5\"> \u201c1. \u2014 (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, copyright shall subsist throughout the parts of His Majesty\u2019s dominions to which this Act extends for the term hereinafter mentioned in every original literary dramatic musical and artistic work, if\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">\u201c(a) in the case of a published work, the work was first published within such parts of His Majesty\u2019s dominions as aforesaid; and</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">\u201c(b) in the ease of an unpublished work, the author was at the date of the making of the work a British subject or resident within such parts of His Majesty\u2019s dominions as aforesaid;</p>\n<p id=\"Acq\">*******</p>\n<p id=\"AAA\">\u201c(2) For the purposes of this Act, \u2018copyright\u2019 means the sole right to produce or reproduce the work or any substantial part thereof in any material form whatsoever, * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">\u201c(3) For the purposes of this Act, publication, in relation to any work, means the issue of copies of the work to the public, and does not include the performance in public of a dramatic or musical work, the delivery in public of a lecture, the exhibition in public of an artistic work, or the construction of an architectural work of art, but for the purposes of this provision, the issue of photographs and engravings of works of sculpture and architectural works of art shall not be deemed to be publication of such works.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">*******</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">\u201c5. \u2014 (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the author of a work shall be the first owner of the copyright therein: \u201cProvided that\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">*******</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">\u201c (2) The owner of the copyright in any work may assign the right, either wholly or partially, and either generally or subject to limitations to the United Kingdom or any self-governing dominion or other part of His Majesty\u2019s dominions to which this Act extends, and either for the whole term of the copyright or for any part thereof, and may grant any interest in the right by licence, but no such assignment of grant shall be valid</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">unless it is in writing signed by the owner of the right in respect of which the assignment or grant is made, or by his duly authorized agent;</p>\n<p id=\"b244-14\">*******</p>\n<p id=\"b244-15\">\u201c27.
