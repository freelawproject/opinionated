If the counterclaim and amended counterclaim are \u201ccompulsory\u201d within the meaning of Rule 13(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, plaintiff\u2019s motion to dismiss defendant\u2019s appeal must be granted; if the counterclaim and amended counterclaim are merely \u201cpermissive,\u201d Rule 13(b), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, plaintiff\u2019s motion must be denied. The pertinent provisions are set forth in the footnote below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-11\">Plaintiff sought issuance of a patent for an apparatus and process for fusing and brightening tin metal strip. The Board of Interference Examiners held that plaintiff was not the prior inventor. Plaintiff then filed the instant bill in equity under R.S. \u00a7 4915, 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-15\">Defendant\u2019s answer, in addition to denying material allegations of the complaint, set forth a counterclaim, which was later supplemented by an \u201camended and second counterclaim.\u201d The counterclaim effectually alleged that, during his employment by defendant, plaintiff, using confidential information which he had gained from agents of defendant, had applied for and procured patents; and, inter alia, requested that plaintiff be enjoined from exercising any rights under those patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-16\">Plaintiff thereupon moved for summary judgment on the counterclaims under the provisions of Rule 56, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, on the ground that defendant had executed a general release of all claims it had against plaintiff at the termination of plaintiff\u2019s employment by defendant. The court below, after examining affidavits submitted in connection with the motion for summary judgment, and after hearing oral argument, held that there was no genuine issue as to material facts and that plaintiff was entitled to summary judgment on the counterclaims as a matter of law. It is from the order entered pursuant to that decision that defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-17\">Defendant concedes that, as to the injunction sought, since its appeal was filed more than 30 days after the lower court had entered the order, this court would have no jurisdiction under Section 129 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 227. George v. Victor Talking Mach. Co., 1934, 293 U.S. 377, 55 S.Ct. 229, 79 L.Ed. 4391; Bowles v. Rice, 6 Cir., 1946, 152 F.2d 543. We need only decide, therefore, whether or not the counterclaims arise out of the \u201ctransaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>ar occurrence that is the subject matter\u201d of plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">We note both that defendant couched the counterclaims partially in the language of Rule 13(a) and that plaintiff\u2019s reply to the first counterclaim denied that the counterclaim was compulsory. Since each of the litigants is now urging a result opposite to that asserted in his pleadings, it is clear that the pleadings can be of little help in determining the question here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">Our examination of the record and consideration of the oral argument, however, persuades us that the question sub judice is analogous to those which confronted the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Audi Vision, Inc., v. R. C. A. Mfg. Co., 1943, 136 F.2d 621, 147 A.L.R. 574; Lesnik v. Public Industrial Corp., 1944, 144 F.2d 968, 975; Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Co. v. Sylvania Indust. Corp., 1946, 154 F.2d 814, certiorari denied, 1946, 328 U.S. 859, 66 S.Ct. 1353, 90 L.Ed. 1630; and see Clark v. Taylor, 1947, 163 F.2d 940, 942, in which it was said, \u201c * * * But as has often been stressed, no complete identity of facts can be required or else every claim by different persons or dealing with differing steps in a litigation will always involve a different \u2018cause of action.\u2019 <em>The theory adopted in the new rules, </em>including the pertinent rule here, * * * <em>has been that the \u2018transaction\u2019 or \u2018occurrence\u2019 is the subject matter of a claim, rather than the legal rights arising therefrom; </em>additions to or subtractions from the central core of fact do not change this substantial identity so as to support piecemeal appeals.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) In the case at bar, it is obvious that the claims of the litigants all stem from the basic fact that plaintiff, while in defendant\u2019s employ, asserted the right of invention in a general field to which defendant, through its agents and assignors, also claims priority. Defendant maintains that one of the patents, 2,-266,330, teaches a process for adherently electrocoating cold rolled steel strip with tin, while the instant complaint seeks a patent on brightening apparatus; but, even though there be points of dissimilarity between the two processes, it cannot be gainsaid that the trial involving those processes would develop very similar testimony and present substantially the same issues of fact and of law. Cf. Audi Vision, Inc., v. R. C. A. Mfg. Co., supra, 136 F.2d at pages 624, 625; and see Big Cola Corporation v. World Bottling Co., 6 Cir., 1943, 134 F.2d 718, 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">In holding the counterclaims to be compulsory, we have given due consideration to the possibility that, dependent upon the final judgment rendered in the court below, we may later have occasion to review the counterclaims on the merits. See Audi Vision, Inc. v. R. C. A. Mfg. Co., supra, 136 F.2d at page 624. It may be that the limiting of piecemeal appeals may tend in individual cases to impose some hardship on a litigant and, perhaps, prolong litigation; but we believe the reasoning of the Lesnik and Audi Vision cases, supra, in explaining the basis and operation of Rule 13(a), needs no further elaboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-9\">The motion to dismiss defendant\u2019s appeal, on the ground that the order of the court below is not a \u201cfinal order\u201d within the meaning of Section 128 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 255, will therefore be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1052-12\"> \u201cRule 13.

A pleading may state as a counterclaim any claim against an opposing party not arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\u2019s claim.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
