The formula determined \u201chybrid questions of \u2018mixed law and fact,\u2019 [and] their resolution, because of the fact element involved will * * * afford little concrete guidance for future cases.\u201d Bingham v. Commissioner, 325 U.S. 365, 370, 65 S.Ct. 1232, 1235, 89 L.Ed. 1670.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-22\">On the first review we held the formula a rational one. Todd v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 153 F.2d 553. Because of the want of certain findings the case was ordered remanded to the Tax Court to make findings with regard to the issue as to the respective amounts attributable to capital and to the petitioners\u2019 management of the business and its decision thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-23\">On the remand the income and deficiencies were computed on the formula we had held valid on the first review. Taxpayers in this review do not contend that the formula was misapplied but again attack the formula, offering certain evidence merely cumulative on that offered at the first hearing. We regard the decision of our first review as establishing the law of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>the case. Were the question open to us, the decision of the Tax Court on the hybrid questions of law and fact controls and we would not consider the contention \u201cthat the facts found fall short of meeting statutory requirements.\u201d Bingham v., Commissioner, supra, 325 U.S. 370, 65 S.Ct. 1235.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
