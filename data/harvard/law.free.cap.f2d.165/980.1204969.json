Such failure is a violation of the Pennsylvania Factory Act of 1937.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jurisdiction \u2022of the Federal Court is based on diversity of citizenship and the entire question is one of Pennsylvania law. It is our humble function to determine, as best we can, what \u25a0a Pennsylvania court would say under similar circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">At the trial the District Judge, upon defendant\u2019s motion, entered judgment for the defendant after the jury had disagreed. The one point upon which the District Judge decided the case and the one point brought to us, is whether the plaintiff\u2019s rights, whatever they may be, are to be exclusively measured by the Pennsylvania \u25a0Occupational Diseases Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-9\">The parties here have accepted the Act and are bound by its provision making the Act the exclusive means for deciding the existence and extent of the liability in situations where it applies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At this stage of the case we, of course, take the plaintiff\u2019s testimony at its face value and ask ourselves whether, if applied most favorably to him, he has shown a basis for common law recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-10\">Plaintiff is now suffering from tuberculosis. The tuberculosis followed a period in which he worked in defendant\u2019s factory. Part of the time during which he worked there he was engaged in a step in the process of insulating copper wire. One of the means used to insulate this wire was a preparation called \u201chalowax\u201d. The evidence shows that \u201chalowax\u201d contained \u201chalogenated hydrocarbon\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The \u201chalo-wax\u201d was applied to the wire in a liquid condition. Liquefaction was brought about by heating solidified wax to the melting point. Plaintiff says that escaping fumes from these pots of \u201chalowax\u201d entered into his nose, throat, and lungs and that this lighted up a quiescent tubercular condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-16\">Poisoning by chlorinated hydrocarbons is expressly included as one of the injuries for which recovery is given under the Pennsylvania Occupational Diseases Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If the plaintiff\u2019s evidence shows he was poisoned by such substance, his own proof has taken him out of common law recovery and indicated a claim under the statute. Under such claim, a recovery cannot be had in a law court, but must go through the compensation procedure provided for by the Pennsylvania legislature. Fritsch v. Pennsylvania Golf Club, 1947, 355 Pa. 384, 50 A.2d 207; Moffett v. Harbison-Walker Refractories Co., 1940, 339 Pa. 112, 14 A.2d 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-17\">Two of the plaintiff\u2019s expert witnesses gave as their opinion that the noxious fumes which the plaintiff breathed lighted up a theretofore quiescent case of tuberculosis. Another physician, however, while agreeing that what had happpened was the \u201clighting up of the quiet tuberculosis condition of the patient\u201d indicated that such activation of a tuberculosis case would not constitute a \u201cpoisoning\u201d of the system. There was, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>the medical <em>testimony, </em>evidence to the effect that the breathing in of chlorinated hydrocarbon could produce dermatitis and acute yellow atrophy of the liver. This plaintiff did not suffer either of these effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">The question in this case becomes, therefore, whether plaintiff has taken his case out of the Occupational Diseases Act by the testimony of one of his expert witnesses that lighting up of a theretofore quiescent tuberculosis was not \u201cpoisoning\u201d. This states the physician\u2019s testimony perhaps stronger than the physician would have put it. The doctor said: \u201cPoison would indicate direct poison in the system, systemic poison.\u201d The examination did not proceed to find out from the doctor whether \u201csystemic\u201d poison was the only kind of poison there is. A reference to medical books, however, indicates that such term is used to distinguish a poison which exerts its effect after absorption from an irritant poison. Cattell, New Medical Dictionary (1910) p. 969; Reese, Medical Jurisprudence &amp; Toxicology (6th Ed. 1902) p. 385. The facts in this case indicate clearly that whatever happened was caused by irritation to the tissues rather than absorption of poison into the system.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">We think the meaning of the term \u201cpoison\u201d or \u201cpoisoning\u201d in a statute is not a question to be decided by a jury in the light of expert testimony, but one for a court. It is for the court to ascribe the effective meaning to words used by the legislature. Of course, the term, as used by <em>experts,'</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is also relevant in considering the answer to be given. But it is by no means conclusive and the question is certainly not to be turned over to a jury to decide for itself in each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">We have <em>no </em>doubt <em>that </em>\u201cpoison\u201d as used in. common parlance is not limited to \u201csystemic poison\u201d which the doctor was speaking of in this case. The District Court found a wider definition in Corpus Juris which it applied. It runs as follows: \u201cPoison may be defined as any substance which, where introduced into the system either directly or by absorption produces violent, morbid, or fatal changes, or which destroys living tissue with which it comes in contact.\u201d Watkins v. National Electric Products Co., D.C., W.D.Pa., 1947, 69 F.Supp. 596, 598. Turning to the dictionary, we find a not dissimilar statement: \u201cPoison * * * Any agent which, introduced * * * into an organism, may chemically produce an injurious or deadly effect * * * ,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When we turn to judicial use for the word we find the same broad meaning carried through which emphasizes the introduction of the poisonous substance into the body and the resulting harm, without any attempt to make the distinction that plaintiff here urged. State v. Baldwin, 1886, 36 Kan. 1, 12 P. 318; Urian v. Scranton Life Insurance Co., 1933, 310 Pa. 144, 165 A. 21; United Fidelity Life Ins. Co. v. Roach, Tex.Civ.App. 1933, 63 S.W.2d 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-12\">Finally, and we think this clinches the point, it is to be remembered that this is a case turning on a Pennsylvania statute and that statute has had interpretation by the Pennsylvania courts. The courts in Pennsylvania have held that the effect of the inhalation of carbon disulphide upon the heart is within the phrase \u201cpoisoning by carbon bisulphide\u201d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Carbon bisulphide is listed in the same part of the Occupational Diseases Act as halogenated hydrocarbons. The court there relied upon the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>which established the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s heart condition was aggravated by the toxic gas. Plaugher v. American Viscose Corp., 1943, 151 Pa.Super. 401, 30 A.2d <em>376. </em>We agree with the trial judge\u2019s statement that this case \u201cdecisively brings under the Occupational Disease[s] Act cases in which exposure to halogenated hydrocarbon has been a contributory or accelerating cause aggravating or accelerating a preexisting disease.\u201d Watkins v. National Electric Products Co., D.C., W.D.Pa., 1947, 69 F.Supp. 596, 598.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">This being so, the plaintiff\u2019s sole remedy is before the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Ap9\"> P.L. 654, \u00a7 2 (1937), 43 P.S. \u00a7 25 \u2014 2 (e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1035-13\"> P.L. 566, \u00a7 101 et seq., 77 P.S. \u00a7 1201 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1035-14\"> \u201cSuch agreement [to accept provisions of article 3 of act] shall constitute an acceptance of all the provisions \u25a0of * * * [the Occupational Diseases Act] and shall operate as a surrender by the parties thereto of their rights to any form or amount of compensation or dam- \u25a0 ages for any disability * * * resulting from occupational disease * * * oth- \u2022 er than as provided in article three of this act.\u201d P.L. 566, \u00a7 303 (1939), 77 P.S. \u00a7 1403.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1035-20\"><em> </em>The halogen in the \u201chalowax\u201d was chlorine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1035-21\"> \u201cThe term \u2018occupational disease,\u2019 as used in this act, shall mean only the following diseases:</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-22\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-23\">(c) Poisoning by * * * carbon bi-sulphide * * * or halogenated hydro carbons, or any preparations containing these chemicals or any of them <em>* </em>* P.L. 566, \u00a7 108 (1939), 77 P.S. \u00a7 1208.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1036-6\"> Poison action is either local or remote. Remote, or systemic, poison produces its effect by being absorbed into the circulation and then acting on organs more or less remote from the point of their absorption. The other type of poison menaces life by destroying the tissue it comes into contact with. Glaister, Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology (5th Ed.1931) p. 671; 2 Wharton and Stale\u2019s Medical Jurisprudence (5th Ed.1905) p. 34. Chlorine is recognized as being an irritant poison and affecting the pulmonary tissues with which it comes into direct contact. Goodman &amp; Gilman, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (1941) p. 711; Glaister, Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology (5th Ed.1931) p. 791.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1036-15\"> In this connection it is interesting to note that Goodman and Gilman in their treatise on Pharmacology and Toxicology discuss the irritant effect of chlorine, the halogen here involved, on the pulmonary tissue, under the heading \u201cChlorine Poisoning\u201d. Goodman &amp; Gilman, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (1941) p. 711.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1036-16\"> Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d Ed.1941) p. 1905.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1036-17\"> The court earlier had held that the phrase \u201cpoisoning by carbon bisulphide\u201d' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>included poisoning by carbon disulphide.
