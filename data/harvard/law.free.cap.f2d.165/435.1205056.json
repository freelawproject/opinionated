V. Kennedy v. McGough Brothers et al., 5 Cir., 165 F.2d 276, and must fall with that judgment. This case is accordingly also reversed and remanded to the district court for such further proceedings as may appear to be proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b489-15\">On Petition for Rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-16\">We have not considered nor adjudged the merit of the claim for attorneys' fees which is the subject of this motion for rehearing.
