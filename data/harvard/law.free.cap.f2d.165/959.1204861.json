Our examination of the record satisfies us that the evidence was sufficient to raise issues for the jury as to the negligence of the defendant, the contributory negligence of the plaintiff and the validity of a release alleged to have been given by the plaintiff to the defendant. These issues were submitted to the jury in a charge to which no objection is made and were resolved in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. We find no error in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-17\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
