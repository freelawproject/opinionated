HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">The plaintiffs appeal from an order and judgment quashing the service of the summons and dismissing the complaint on the ground that the plaintiffs had not acquired personal jurisdiction over the defendant, a Texas corporation. The complaint was filed in the .state court, and service of the summons (and complaint) was made upon one, Rudolf Pick, as \u201cmanaging agent\u201d of the local business. The complaint alleged that both the plaintiffs and the defendant made and distributed women\u2019s clothes, on which the plaintiffs used the words, \u201cJune Arden,\u201d as a registered trade-mark, and the word, \u201cJunard,\u201d as an unregistered trademark; that they had \u201coffered for sale, and sold in the -State of New York and elsewhere in the United States and shipped in interstate commerce,\u201d quantities of women\u2019s clothes bearing these marks; that since July, 1944, the defendant had been selling \u201cin the State of New York and elsewhere in the United States in interstate commerce,\u201d women\u2019s clothes with the trademark, \u201cJunard.\u201d After the defendant had removed the case for diversity of citizenship (the plaintiffs are citizens of Pennsylvania), it moved to quash the service and dismiss the complaint upon the ground that it was not doing business in New York, and that Pick was not its \u201cmanaging agent.\u201d The supporting and opposing affidavits used upon the motion being in conflict, the judge, on March 2, 1945, directed a reference to a special master to take testimony and report; and on October 22, 1945, the master filed a report, finding that the defendant did not do business in the Southern District of New York, that Pick was not its \u201cmanaging agent,\u201d and that for these reasons the service should be quashed and the complaint dismissed. On June 25, 1946, the judge so ordered, and on July 9, 1946, a judgment was entered in favor of the defendant for costs. In the order of reference, the judge had provided that the expenses of the hearing, if the defendant was unsuccessful, might be borne by the party who eventually failed in the action; and the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is from this order as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The facts, so far as relevant, are as follows. On December 18, 1942, the defendant entered into an agreement with three persons \u2014 Sorter, Hertz and Pick, then doing business as \u201cWest Coast Sales Company\u201d \u2014 by which it appointed them its agents, \u201cto solicit orders and to further the sale for it of women\u2019s sportswear manufactured by it,\u201d subject to \u201cwritten approval and acceptance\u201d at such prices and upon such conditions as it should authorize in writing: the power to accept orders or assume obligations being absolutely reserved to it. They were to maintain a show-room for the display of the defendant\u2019s goods, and to employ their own assistants; and they were to be responsible for employer\u2019s liability, workmen\u2019s compensation, unemployment insurance, and other liabilities of the kind. As compensation they were to have seven per cent of the net sale price upon all orders accepted by the defendant, and three and one-half per cent upon any merchandise sold by them in any showrooms set up by them m outside territory; The defendant agreed to pay $100 a week advance commissions for the first twelve weeks, $100 a month for the first six months toward the expenses of maintaining the show-room, and $125 rent for the New York show-room for the first month, January, 1943; but except for these the agents were to pay all their expenses out of their commissions. Sorter, Hertz and Pick organized a company, known as the Sopic Corporation, which took over the contract, and later they filed a certificate allowing them to do business as the \u201cSopic Trading Company,\u201d under which name after June, 1944, they took back the business. They leased a show-room in Manhattan, paid the rent, employed two salesmen to solicit orders, and two office girls; they carried on altogether without interference from the defendant, paid for the telephone, outfitted the office, paid all taxes and similar liabilities ; and secured orders in 1944 amounting to $400,000 \u2014 which was about nine per cent of the defendant\u2019s total business. Of the three Pick was the person in charge. The judge held that the rule still obtained that the solicitation of orders alone did not subject a foreign corporation to service in personam in a transitory action; and that there were not enough additional activities to take the case out of this doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>By removal a defendant does not lose his right to challenge the invalidity of the service in the state court;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and thus the first question is whether the service was valid under the New York decisions. If we conclude that it was not, of course the case ends; but, if we conclude that it was, there arises the second question: i. e. whether the service was valid under the Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This approach is the proper one, because the law of New York may not extend to suitors\u2019 access to its courts against foreign corporations as amply as it has power to do under the Constitution. In the first inquiry we need not go back of Judge Cardozo\u2019s opinion in Tauza v. Susquehanna Coal Co.,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for that has been accepted as the basis of the later decisions. The test there set was the familiar one: whether the corporation was \u201cpresent\u201d in the state by virtue of those activities which it there set in motion. How extensive these must be to make the corporation \u201cpresent\u201d was left at large in that case, as it had been before and has been since; for in the last decision,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Conway, J., after summing up those local activities of the corporation \u2014 Vanguard Films, Inc. \u2014 which, he held, proved it to have been \u201c \u2018here\u2019 within the meaning of the Tauza Case,\u201d made no attempt to lay down any general proposition \u2018from which that conclusion could be deduced. Nor had any of the intervening decisions attempted to do so.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It would have been possible from some of the language in Bagdon v. Philadelphia &amp; Reading Coal &amp; Iron Co.,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to infer that, if the liability in suit arises out of the local activities, it .is not necessary to go further, except to show that these were continuous. However, we understand that since Tauza v. Susquehanna Coal Co., supra,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the law of New York has been that a foreign corporation is either \u201cpresent,\u201d or it is not; and once it is found to be \u201cpresent,\u201d it becomes subject to process, regardless of whether the particular liability in suit has arisen out of the activities which collectively constitute the \u201cpresence.\u201d How far this has been a reflection of what the New York courts suppose to be the constitutional limit of their power is not clear. In Lillibridge, Inc. v. Johnson Bronze Co., supra,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finch, J., declared that the state courts should take the federal decisions as their absolute standard, positive as well as negative; but, when the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision, it wrote no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">If the state courts do take the Supreme Court decisions in both senses: that is, if they regard the inquiry, how far they may go, as coalesced with the inquiry, how far they will go, International Shoe Co. v. Washington,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> has effected a change. The Supreme Court there declared that the corporation\u2019s \u201cpresence\u201d was to be determined by balancing the opposed interests: the convenience of the obligee against the burden upon the corporation. That is a test not different in kind from that which has been repeatedly used, when the inquiry is whether it will \u201cunduly burden\u201d interstate commerce to fetch a corporation, engaged in such commerce, from the place of its principal activities to defend the action. If that be the test, the question at once becomes relevant whether the action is based upon a liability arising out of the local activities ; for it is almost always less burdensome to subject a corporation to the defense of actions so arising than to those arising elsewhere.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Indeed, probably some such notion is at the basis of those decisibns which permit a state to subject to process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>in personam transients who, while within its borders, have incurred a liability under its laws.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the case at bar such a rule would answer any objections to jurisdiction, for the complaint alleges that the defendant has sold goods in New York bearing the trade-mark, \u201cJunard\u201d; and, if so, the wrong was pro tanto .a direct consequence of the continuous New York solicitation of orders. Nevertheless, we hesitate to say that the New York courts will occupy the new enclave, now opened to them by International Shoe Co. v. Washington, supra;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and, until they do, we see no other course but to compare the facts in the case at bar with those which existed in the bellwether decisions of the state, and to appraise \u2014 a more candid word would be to guess at \u2014 the importance of any differences. This we shall try to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">In Tauza v. Susquehanna Coal Co., supra,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the foreign corporation had an agent in charge of the New York office who employed eight salesmen, over whom he had the entire direction. The corporation kept a bank account in New York out of which all office expenses were paid, including sal-. aries and rent. This managing agent had no power to close any contracts; he merely solicited orders and sent them to the home office for acceptance, but he used the corporation\u2019s name upon the door and elsewhere, as he desired. The differences are that in the case at bar Pick was obliged to pay all expenses out of his commisssions, that he employed fewer assistants and salesmen, and that the local business is not so large. His use of the defendant\u2019s name on the door, in public directories, in the telephone book, and on stationery was obviously with the defendant\u2019s acquiescence; Gold, its president went to the office not infrequently, and the defendant actually furnished the stationery. We cannot think it crucial that the principal pays the salaries of the salesmen, the rent and the other expenses incidental to the business, instead of fixing the commissions high enough to cover these charges; and indeed in the only case in which the question has arisen in New York,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that was the ruling. A local bank account is obviously necessary if the principal is to pay the expenses itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">In Chaplin v. Selznick, supra,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Vanguard Films, Inc. had a New York office where there were only three employees, whose duties were to look over such scripts and other literary material as came in, and to forward to the home office any that appeared promising. The corporation paid all the expenses, however, and kept a bank account for the purpose. The majority dwelt with some emphasis upon the corporation\u2019s payment of an \u201coccupancy tax,\u201d \u2022arguing that it could not well assert that it was not \u201cpresent\u201d after such an implied admission. Yet it would seem that to pay the charges imposed upon a resident employer \u2014employer\u2019s liability, unemployment and the like \u2014 which Pick paid, as much justifies the inference of \u201cpresence\u201d as the payment of an \u201coccupancy tax,\u201d though verbally the argument is not so strong. If it is as strong in substance, and if, as we think, it makes no difference whether the principal or the agent pays the expenses of the business, so long a.s they come out of the same pocket in the end, the \u201coccupancy tax\u201d is not an important distinction here. Nor is it one that on one occasion Vanguard Films, Inc. tried unsuccessfully to borrow a large sum from a New York bank. What we have just said as to Tauza v. Susquehanna Coal Co., supra,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> applies to this decision; the distinctions between the situation there and here seem to us insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">On the other hand we do find it difficult to reconcile Lillibridge, Inc. v. Johnson Bronze Co., supra,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> for we cannot see that it was important that the agent worked for several principals. In the end any decision must seem like the fiat of a piepowder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>court. That will indeed be to some measure true, even though the federal \u25a0 test is applied of balancing the conflicting interests ; but at least that will serve to center the inquiry upon those considerations which count with the parties, and to remove it from that world of abstractions \u2014 drawn from the analogy of arrest under a capias\u2014 in which it has hitherto so helplessly floundered. Our own decisions need not detain us. In Deutsch v. Hoge,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the extract from Judge Goddard\u2019s opinion says among other things that the \u201cdefendants did not conduct a regular course of business in New York.\u201d Whether by this he meant that the agent\u2019s work was intermittent and sporadic, or whether it was merely his legal conclusion from the evidence is not clear. In any event the majority cited only federal decisions, and apparently proceeded on the assumption that these were conclusive; International Shoe Co. v. Washington, supra,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> had not been decided and might have resulted in an opposite conclusion. The same is true of Davega, Inc. v. Lincoln Furniture Mfg. Co.,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> where also we did not distinguish between the state and the federal law. In conclusion we hold that the defendant was doing enough business in New York to satisfy the state decisions; and that, since the cause of action aros\u00e9 \u2014 at least as to New York sales \u2014 out of those activities which made the corporation \u201cpresent,\u201d any federal question is set at rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">.[5,6] There remains the question whether the service on Pick was valid under the New York Civil Practice Act,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> strictly a question of state law. This is in two parts: whether Pick was a \u201cmanaging agent\u201d at all; whether the plaintiffs had exercised due diligence to ascertain that the persons mentioned in subdivision one of \u00a7 229 were not available for service. As to the first issue, Pick was concededly in charge of the local business, when Gold, the president, was not in New York, which was only occasionally. That being true, Pick was the \u201cmanaging agent,\u201d as the statute uses the word; for we understand the New York courts to hold that, whatever activities make the corporation \u201cpresent,\u201d the agent in charge of those activities is the \u201cmanaging agent\u201d pro hac vice.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The master also found that the process servers did not exercise due diligence to ascertain the absence from New York of the officers mentioned in subdivision one. Two process servers testified: Wechsler and Kruger. Wechsler said that he went to Pick\u2019s office on December 28 and 29, 1944, and asked whether any officers , of the defendant were there; and that on one occasion anyway he was told that they were out of town. The master doubted this testimony, because he thought that if Wechsler had been there, he would have served Pick as soon as he heard that the officers were out of town. Be that as it may, on January 5, 1945, Kruger undoubtedly did appear, asked to see an officer or a director, and was told that they were all in Dallas and that Pick was in charge. This is to some extent confirmed by the af-, fidavit of one, Satz, that Kruger was told that no officer \u201cwas around.\u201d The master apparently believed Kruger; but he thought that due diligence called for further inquiry. The last is not a finding of fact, and we cannot agree with the conclusion. The statute does not impose on a plaintiff the duty of waiting till some officer appears; he may choose his own time to sue. (We mention, merely to leave the answer open, the possibility of a situation in which the officers are regularly present, but the plaintiff deliberately selects an occasion when he knows that all will be away.) There is no such evidence here; so that all the plaintiffs had to do was to make reasonable effort, when they did seek to serve the process, to serve any officer or director who was then within the state. To go to the place of the local business, and there to ascertain from the person in charge that all are 1500 miles away, was enough. Indeed, the master\u2019s rulings result in a curious inconsistency: he discredited Wechsler because he thought Wechsler would have served Pick <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>upon getting precisely that information, which, when Kruger acted upon it, he found to be insufficient diligence. We hold the service valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">We read the interlocutory order as leaving it to the discretion of the trial judge \u2022at the conclusion of the cause to include the costs and disbursements of this interlocutory proceeding within the other costs, and impose them as to him may then seem fair. We think that this was right; this proceeding was a step in the defence of the action, and the trial judge may conclude that the claim as a whole was so destitute of merit as to make it proper to charge the cost of every step in it against the plaintiffs who stirred up the controversy. We do not suggest that he ought to do so; but it is proper to leave his hands free.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Interlocutory order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Order quashing summons and dismissing complaint reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-5\"> Lambert Co. v.
