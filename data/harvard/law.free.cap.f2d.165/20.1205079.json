Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 2553(a). But the indictment plainly excludes both of the statutory exceptions. The particular language in which it does .so is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-22\">Appellant contends that evidence which was seized during a search should have been excluded, because of an asserted conflict between the affidavit on which the search warrant was based and the affiant!s subsequent testimony at the trial. We need not consider the effect of such a conflict, for none exists. The affidavit states, as though on personal knowledge, that appellant \u201cdid unlawfully sell\u201d narcotic drugs \u201con or <em>about </em>the 8th day of August 1946\u201d; and the only testimony at appellant\u2019s trial that tended in any degree to show that the' affidavit was not in fact made on personal knowledge was affiant\u2019s testimony that he did not <em>\u201csee\u201d </em>appellant <em>\u201con </em>the 8th of August, 1946.\u201d [Italics supplied.]</p>\n<p id=\"b74-23\">Since the affidavit was not based on mere information and belief the Schencks case, 55 App.D.C. 84, 2 F.2d 185, has no bearing on this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
