The claimed deduction was proper only if the trust agreement required the trustees to distribute the income currently or such sums were actually \u201cproperly paid or credited during such year to [the beneficiaries].\u201d Int.Rev. Code \u00a7\u00a7 162(b), 162(c), 26 U.S.C.A. IntRev. Code, 162 (b, c); cf. Commissioner v. Stearns, 2 Cir., 1933, 65 F.2d 371, certiorari denied, 1933, 290 U.S. 670, 54 S.Ct. 90, 78 L.Ed. 579. In the light of the facts of the taxpayer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>case the Tax Court held that neither condition existed. 8 T.C. 368. It found that the circumstances surrounding the crediting by the trustees of certain sums to the beneficiaries indicated an intent not to place the money unconditionally and irrevocably at their disposal. This conclusion was based upon the evidence which revealed the close relationship between the settlor, one of the. trustees, and the beneficiaries; the tender ages of the beneficiaries; likewise, the immediate agreement by these beneficiaries, after the sums in question had been \u201cvoted\u201d, to leave the money with the trustees so that it could be lent to another trust which was engaged in the construction of a home for their mother and father. The transaction, therefore, did not satisfy \u00a7 162(c) of the Code. Cf. Richards\u2019 Estate v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 1945, 150 F.2d 837, 160 A.L.R. 1186; Commissioner v. Guitar Trust Estate, 5 Cir., 1934, 72 F.2d 544. This question is peculiarly within the competency of the Tax Court because it involves the conclusion to be drawn from certain evidentiary facts. Commissioner v. Scottish-American Investment Co., 1944, 323 U.S. 119, 65 S.Ct. 169, 89 L.Ed. 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">The decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
