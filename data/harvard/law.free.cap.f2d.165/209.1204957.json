The union selected plaintiff who received from the union a shipping ticket. He boarded the ship (then unloading grain at Buffalo, New York) with the intention of reporting to the engineer for duty. On his way aft, he fell into an open hatch and was seriously injured. Up to the time of his fall, he had reported to no one representing the defendant, indeed had seen no one connected with the ship. He brought this suit under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 688.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the close of the evidence, the trial judge, reserving the question whether plaintiff was an employee of defendant, left the other issues to the jury, which returned a verdict for $77,000 in favor of plaintiff. The judge then, on defendant\u2019s motion, set the verdict aside and, holding plaintiff not an employee, entered judgment for defendant dismissing the action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">We think that judgment must stand. The contract plainly meant that, until the defendant had an opportunity to reject him, plaintiff was but a \u201cprospective employee.\u201d Fie was therefore never employed by defendant. Accordingly he had no claim under the Jones Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As there was no evidence of employment other than the contract, the trial judge properly decided the issue instead of leaving it to the jury. We do not consider whether or not plaintiff, in another action, may recover as an invitee or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-13\"> That section reads: \u201cAny seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may, at his election, maintain an action for damages at law, with the right of trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common-law right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees, shall apply. * * * Jurisdiction in such actions shall be under the court of the district in which the defendant employer resides.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b264-15\"> The judge, on defendant\u2019s alternative motion for a new trial, entered an order providing that, if the jury\u2019s verdict should be reinstated on appeal, then the verdict should be set aside and a new trial granted, unless, within twenty days of the order on the mandate, plaintiff filed a stipulation consenting to a reduction in the verdict from $77,000 to $60,000. Because of the nature of our decision, we <em>need not </em>consider that order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b264-17\"> See Buffalo &amp; Grand Island Ferry Co. v.
