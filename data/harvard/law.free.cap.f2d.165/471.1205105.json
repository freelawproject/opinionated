Appellant alleged that appellee had previously filed a petition to cancel the mark \u201cSportmaster\u201d on the ground of confusing similai-ity between the marks \u201cSportster\u201d and \u201cSportmaster\u201d and that it was damaged by such petition; and that it will be further damaged if its registration for the word \u201cSportmaster\u201d were canceled, and that such damage could only be mitigated by the cancellation of appellee\u2019s mark in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The cancellation proceeding initiated by appellee\u2019s petition, as aforesaid, was finally determined in Appeal No. 5372, entitled Apollo Shirt Company v. Enro Shirt Company, Inc., Cust. &amp; Pat.App., 165 F.2d 469, in favor of appellee and decided concurrently herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">There is no contention by the parties that the Trade-Mark Act of 1946, 15 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1051 et seq., has any application to the present proceeding and the sole question to be decided is whether or not appellee\u2019s mark \u201cSportster\u201d is descriptive of the goods to which it is applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Only the petitioner has taken testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">It is contended by appellant that the word \u201cSportster\u201d has a similar meaning and is equivalent to the word \u201cSporter.\u201d That word is defined in Webster\u2019s new International Dictionary, 2 Ed., Unabridged, as who sports; a sportsman; also, Colloq., one who wears sport clothes, or who spends lavishly and ostentatiously.\u201d While appellee contends \u201cSportster\u201d is a natural word properly used to describe a sportsman who ostensibly would be clad in sports attire, it bases its reasoning on such contention by the meanings attached to such common words as \u201cgamester,\u201d \u201csongster,\u201d \u201cfunster,\u201d' \u201ctrickster,\u201d \u201cteamster\u201d etc. It endeavors to invariably attach the same meaning to the suffixes \u201cster\u201d and \u201cer.\u201d It apparently invokes the law of usage by which coined words by' reason of long general use become fixed in the English vocabulary, arguing that one who would u'se the word' \u201csporter\u201d would probably be a person of erudition, but that the public in general would say and would refer to a sportsman as a \u201csportster.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">That the term \u201csportster\u201d has not up to the present time been embodied in the English vocabulary under the law of usage is clear. It does not appear in any dictionary that has been called to our attention or to which we have access.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">Furthermore, appellant has not by its evidence satisfied the tribunals of the Patent Office nor this court that appellee\u2019s mark is descriptive of sport shirts, and, th\u00e9refore, we must conclude, as did the Examiner of Interferences and the commissioner, that, since no use has been shown of such word in a descriptive sense, the decision appealed, from should be affirmed. The term is probably highly suggestive, but, in our opinion,, it cannot properly he held as merely descriptive of the goods to'which it is applied, as required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-13\">We find no error in the decision appealed' from, and it is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-15\">BLAND, Judge, sat during the argument of this case, but resigned \"before the opinion was prepared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
