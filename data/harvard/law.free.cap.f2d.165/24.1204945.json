The decision requires petitioner to repay a retirement annuity which, the Board found, had been erroneously paid. In his application for the annuity, petitioner stated to the Board that he had \u201cnot worked for any other person, institution, or company for compensation\u201d since he left railroad service. He was in fact employed as an assistant clerk of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. We have two questions for decision. (1) Was petitioner\u2019s employer a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2(a), (b), and (d) of the Railroad Retirement Act, 50 Stat. 309, 310, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 228b?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We think the Board was right in answering this question in the affirmative. Section 1 (n) of the Act, 50 Stat. 309, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 228a(n), defines \u201cperson\u201d as meaning \u201can individual, a partnership, an association, a joint-stock company, or a corporation.\u201d Where, as here, the context and purpose require, the statutory term \u201cperson,\u201d as defined to include \u201ccorporation,\u201d includes a governmental body. Ohio v. Helvering, 292 U.S. 360, 54 S.Ct. 725, 78 L.Ed. 1307; Georgia v. Evans, 316 U.S. 159, 62 S.Ct. 972, 86 L.Ed, 1346. (2) Did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>the evidence before the Board require it, as a matter of law, to find that petitioner was without fault in -obtaining annuity payments and that recovery of them from him would be contrary to the purpose of the Act or would be against equity or good! conscience? 54 Stat. 1100, \u00a7 26, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 228i(c). Though the evidence might perhaps have supported findings in petitioner\u2019s favor on these points, if the Board had made such findings, it clearly supports the findings adverse to him which the Board has made, Aifirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-25\"> Amended in respects not material here, 60 Stat. 727, 728, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 228b.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
