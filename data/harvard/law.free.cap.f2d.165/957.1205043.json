The devices in question consisted of a cabinet equipped with a 1000 watt electric light bulb, an electric fan and water container for cooling purposes, two glass condenser lenses to focus the rays from the electric light bulb and five ordinary glass slides, each of a different color. Attached to the devices were plate labels bearing, in part, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-9\">\u201cSpectro-Chrome Metry</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkE\">Measurement And Restoration Of The Human</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AU8\">Radio-Active And Radio-Emanative Equilibrium</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHn\">(Normalation Of Imbalance)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-10\">By</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-11\">Attuned Color Waves</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXG\">The Science Of Automatic Precision</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajn\">No Diagnosis \u2014 No Drugs \u2014 No Manipulation \u2014 No Surgery</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Auh\">Originated, Developed, Applied, Copyrighted 1920 By</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADO\">Colonel Dinshah P. Ghadiali, M.S.C.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-12\">M.D., M.E., D.C., Ph.D., L.L.D., N.D., D.Opt, D.F.S., D.H.T., D.M.T., D.S.T., Etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-13\">Metaphysician And Psychologist\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1012-14\">The devices were accompanied by various pieces of printed matter, two of them being entitled in part \u201cSpectro-Chrome Home Guide\u201d and \u201cFavorscope\u201d, which related to the devices and contained statements relative to their therapeutic value in the cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, and directions for their use. The directions called for doing what the defendants call \u201cirradiating\u201d the body of the patient with what the defendants describe as \u201cattuned color waves\u201d projected by the device through the colored glass slides. The particular slide or combination \u2022of slides required to produce the exact color said to be needed to treat a given disorder was specified in the \u201cSpectro-Chrome Home Guide\u201d. The patient was advised to adhere to a designated diet. He was directed to subject himself to \u201cirradiation\u201d while facing south or lying in a north and south position with his head to the north. The \u201ctonations\u201d from the Spectro-Chrome were to be taken at times specified by the defendants in the \u201cFavorscope\u201d which accompanied the device and which, they alleged, was compiled on the basis of solar, lunar and terrestrial radiant, gravitational influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">The government presented a large amount of evidence which, if believed, was amply sufficient to support a finding by the jury that the labeling of the defendants\u2019 Spectro-Chrome device was false and misleading within the meaning of Sec. 502(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 352(a), in that the device did not have the therapeutic value which the labeling claimed for it. The jury, evidently believing the government\u2019s evidence, found the defendants guilty of violating the act. The defendants upon the present appeal have presented eleven points which they assert require the reversal of the judgment of the district court. We have examined with care each of the points raised by the defendants and we find each to be wholly lacking in merit. It would serve no useful purpose to discuss them in detail. Suffice it to say that our consideration of the case has left us completely satisfied that the defendants had a fair trial. Indeed the trial judge, if anything, leaned over backward to afford them the fullest opportunity to establish their defense and he submitted their case to the jury in a charge to which no objection was or fairly could be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-16\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
