The appellee insurer moved to dismiss the appellant\u2019s claim on the basis that Florida Statutes \u00a7 627.7262 (1987) bars the appellant from bringing a direct action against an insurer for benefits prior to obtaining a judgment against the insured. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>The trial judge granted appellee\u2019s motion and dismissed appellant\u2019s claim, ultimately with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\">The appellee insurer concedes that the provisions of the statute are not applicable to the appellant\u2019s claim inasmuch as medical payment coverage provides first-party benefits to persons injured on the insured\u2019s premises, and that therefore appellant may bring a claim directly against the insurer. Instead, the appellee contends that we should affirm the trial court\u2019s order of dismissal, entered with prejudice, on the separate and different ground that the allegations of appellant\u2019s claims are inconsistent with and negated by the very terms of the insurance contract, citing to <em>Harry Pepper &amp; Associates, Inc. v Lasseter, </em>247 So.2d 736 (Fla. 3d DCA 1971). We reject this latter argument. Instead, we agree with appellee\u2019s concession and hold that the provisions of Florida Statutes \u00a7 627.7262 (1987) are inapplicable to appellant\u2019s claim. We therefore reverse the trial court\u2019s order granting appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss with prejudice, and remand the case to the lower court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
