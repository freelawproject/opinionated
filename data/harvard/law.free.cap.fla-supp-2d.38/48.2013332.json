The motion was denied, with leave to answer within 15 days. The 15 day period came and went; no answer was served or filed. The appellee moved for a default and obtained a hearing date for the motion. Prior to the hearing, the defendant served and filed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>answer,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but did not appear at the scheduled hearing upon the motion for default. At that hearing, the trial judge granted the default, and entered a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Because the answer was filed before the default was entered, the court was prohibited from entering the default and final judgment. <em>Mohammad v J.I. Kislak Mortgage Corp., </em>534 So.2d 818 (Fla. 3d DCA 1988), but it was not prohibited from entering sanctions for violation of its order, provided the sanction is less severe than entry of default.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Reversed and remanded, with directions to vacate the final judgment and default, and to take such other proceedings that the court deems appropriate. SALMON, MORENO and CARONNE, JJ., concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-6\"> The answer denominated the court as the circuit court instead of the county court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
