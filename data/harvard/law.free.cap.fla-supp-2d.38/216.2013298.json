The Trial Board concluded that the City of Coral Gables erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>in its decision regarding employee, Richard Wagner. The Court remands the case to the Trial Board for a rehearing in which the correct standard of proof (preponderance of the evidence) will be utilized. The Trial Board incorrectly applied the standard of evidence \u201cbeyond a shadow of a doubt.\u201d Wherefore, the petition is granted, the Trial Board\u2019s order is quashed, and the case is remanded with directions to act in accordance with this Opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-19\"> All parties agreed in open court, at the time of the oral argument, that Judge Moreno could sit on the appellate panel despite being a resident of Coral Gables and the employment of his sister-in-law as a Coral Gables Police Department Sergeant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
