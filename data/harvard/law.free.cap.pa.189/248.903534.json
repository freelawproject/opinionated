It is also proper to reject an offer to prove that the defendant\u2019s manager had been told that the team was unsafe, where it is not accompanied by an offer to show the time, with reference to the plaintiff\u2019s injury, when the communication was made, except that it was within two years thereof or in what respect the team was unsafe.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b268-7\">Argued.

The plaintiff offered to prove that some time within two years before the injury to plamtiff, one of the mules of the \u201cMoreland team\u201d kicked a young man named Bowman, who was at the time driving the team, breaking Bowman\u2019s leg, but neither the time nor circumstances under which the injury to Bowman was inflicted was included in the offer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-5\">When Percy Moreland, a witness called by plaintiff, was on the stand, plaintiff offered to prove by him that he drove the team or span of mules owned by the Atlantic Company, and that he stated to Mr. Noble, who had absolute charge and control of a distinct branch of the company\u2019s business, that this team or span of mules was unsafe, and that Mr. Noble replied that he \u201c could not help that, they had them and had to use them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-6\">Defendant objected to the offer as incompetent and irrelevant, the evidence so far being that the plaintiff was injured by the off-side mule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-7\">By the Court: Objection sustained.

He drove a pair of mules which had been owned by the company and used in its business for a number of years. He was an experienced driver, but had had charge of this team only four or five days. In the afternoon, after having returned to the stable and cleaned the mules, he went into the stall for the purpose of leading one of them to the blacksmith shop. As he took hold of the halter the mule threw its head around, struck the plaintiff and knocked him down, and then struck and kicked him.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>As it was not shown that the mule had before injured or attempted to injure any one or that it had manifested in any way a vicious disposition, there was nothing in the testimony to warrant a recovery, and the judgment of nonsuit should stand unless it appears that offers of testimony were improperly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">For the purpose of showing that the mule was vicious, an offer was made to prove by a witness called that one of the mules of the team prior to the kicking of the plaintiff had kicked and injured another driver. This was the whole offer. It was not proposed to show the time when or the circumstances under which the injury was inflicted, or which mule had done it. Indeed, it was stated in connection with the offer that no one knew which mule had kicked the other driver. It may require but little to establish the vicious disposition of a mule, but unless it is to be taken wholly for granted there must be some basis for a reasonable inference, and in this offer we see none. A mule may kick under circumstances which do not indicate a vicious disposition generally, as in case of sudden fright, or under provocation when teased, or in consequence of careless management. That it had kicked some months or years before, or when untrained, would not be reason for the inference of continued viciousness. The fact that one of the pair had kicked, which one not being shown, would not justify the conclusion that both were vicious, or that the injury had been inflicted by the one which had kicked a driver before.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The offers to prove that the company\u2019s manager had been told that the team was unsafe fixed no time with reference to the plaintiff\u2019s injury when the communication was made, except that it was within two years thereof. It was not proposed to show that any facts were stated to him, but the mere opinion of a witness, not that the mules were vicious, but that they were unsafe. They might have been unsafe in many ways, as the result of timidity or want of training, without showing any indication of either general viciousness or a disposition to injure any one when in their stalls.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
