Cowan, one of the members of the firm, makers of the note in suit, which written request is offered in evidence, or will be in connection with this offer, the defendant indorsed four notes each for $150, at three, four, five and six months, from November 28, 1895, the dates thereof; that three of said notes were raised after they were indorsed from $150 to $750 each and passed by the said John L. Cowan to the plaintiff in this case, D. Wheeler; that subsequent to the indorsement of the notes in suit, to wit: on December 18, 1895, at the request of said John L. Cowan for an indorsement by the defendant of a note of $350 for the benefit of D. Wheeler, the plaintiff, the defendant indorsed a note at four months for $350, which was, after being indorsed, raised to $2,350, and passed to the said D. Wheeler, the plaintiff. This for the purpose of showing that the notes in suit were raised from $150 to $750 and from $175 to $775, as part and parcel of a scheme of forgery or raising of notes practised by the said John L. Cowan, one of the makers, upon the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-8\">Counsel for plaintiff objected to the proposed offer, as incompetent and irrelevant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-9\">By the Court: Objection sustained and bill sealed for defendant.

Cowan, and that he found him in Gautemala, in the latter part of March, 1896, and brought him back to New Orleans, where he made a statement to the witness\u2019s father in the presence of the witness, which was reduced to writing by a stenographer and approved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>by John L. Cowan and attested by tbe witness, and tbe witness having identified the paper marked exhibit \u201c 14 \u201d as said statement, counsel for defendant offered in evidence the portion of exhibit \u201c 14,\u201d reading as follows: \u201c Mr. Perkins : Q. There is a note about which there seems to be some tangle. A note was given for $150, I think, or $250, and I understand that Mr. Ahlers says that this was raised by erasing to $750. Whom was that note given to? A. There were several notes of $100 and $150. One is held by Samuel Crawford. I don\u2019t remember the amount of this particular one\u2014in the neighborhood of $150, I think. This note was altered, the figure 1 being changed into a 7. I telephoned to Mr. Ahlers that I wanted to see him, that the note was not large enough, and that I would have to have another one. He said he wouldn\u2019t be over in town soon, as he had several engagements, and didn\u2019t see how he could arrange it. I asked him if he would give me authority to change it; he said, yes, if I could fix it up so it would pass, to do so. The note was in blank, the figures were simply there. I changed the 1 to a 7, and changed it by his authority. The name of the Ahlers Lumber Company was then on the back. I got value received from Mr. Crawford for that $750 note. Then there were several Wheeler notes that the amounts were changed in precisely the same manner. These notes bore William Ahlers\u2019s indorsement when they were changed. They were not changed in his presence. . I telephoned him about them. He told me to change them through the telephone. He was never present when the notes were changed. On several occasions when I could meet him I got him to write out new notes, but on several occasions when I couldn\u2019t arrange to meet him I changed them with his authority.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-6\">Mr. Patterson, of defendant\u2019s counsel: I offer that part of Mr. Cowan\u2019s statement to Mr. Perkins of New Orleans, to be followed by testimony of Mr. Ahlers that he never on any occasion gave to John L. Cowan any authority to change the amount of any note after he indorsed it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-7\">Plaintiff objected to the offer as incompetent and irrelevant and inter alios acta; and also that there is nothing to show that it refers to these notes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-8\">By the Court: Objection sustained and bill sealed for defendant.

Cowan, of bills payable, defendant\u2019s counsel proposed to prove by the witness that in a book kept in the office of the firm of W. G. Cowan &amp; Son, by John L. Cowan, purporting to contain entries of bills payable of said firm there was a note dated December 10, 1895, to the order of William Ahlers at three months for the sum of $175.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-6\">Plaintiff objected that the books are the best evidence, and also as incompetent and irrelevant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-7\">By the Court: Objection sustained and bill sealed for defendant.

Cowan. This to be followed by the letter marked exhibit \u201c 15,\u201d of Mr. Cowan to Wheeler, the plaintiff, which Wheeler has already identified as having received and as containing three notes for $750 each. This for the purpose of showing that on that date, November 29, Mr. Cowan was representing to the defendant that the indebtedness to Wheeler was $600, and that he asked for indorsements covering that amount, which were furnished and which went into the hands of Wheeler and were raised from notes of $150 to $750, three of them. For the further purpose of showing the improbability of Mr. Cowan coming to Mr. Ahlers, the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>indorser, within two weeks after that time, to wit: on December 10, 1895, to ask for indorsements amounting to $1,525 on account of an indebtedness to the same creditor, D.

Co. for Ins., etc., v. R. R., 153 Pa. 160; Winters v. Mowrer, 163 Pa. 239; Thomas v. Miller, 151 Pa. 482; Goersen v. Com., 99 Pa. 388.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-6\">As the confession admits changes by Cowan of notes delivered to Wheeler on several occasions, and, as the offer was proposed to be followed by testimony of Ahlers that he never on any occasion gave Cowan authority to change the amount of any note after he indorsed it, it was surely a question for the jury whether, under all the evidence, the confessed changes related to the notes in suit: Leas v. Walls, 101 Pa. 57.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b163-7\"><em>Levi Bird Duff, </em>with him <em>L. B.

Com., 99 Pa. 888, was the trial of an indictment for murder. It has no bearing on this case and needs no discussion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b163-9\">Thomas v. Miller, 151 Pa. 482, and Winters v. Mowrer, 163 Pa. 239, were actions between the original parties and involved the issue of fraud as well as forgery.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AIP\">January 2, 1899:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b163-10\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AR-\">Mb.. Justice Mitchell,</author>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">The action being assumpsit on promissory notes, by holder against indorser, the defense was that the notes had been fraudulently raised in amount by the maker after the indorsement. On such an issue all the authorities agree that the door should he opened wide to all evidence tending to throw light on the transaction. It is true that in general it is not competent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>prove an act, and especially a criminal offense, by evidence of a similar act at a different time, though such evidence may be strongly corroborative of the probability of the act or offense charged. But where the acts are connected as parts of a plan or scheme of fraud, the rule that excludes evidence is relaxed. In relation to the exact question here raised, the proof of forgery of a note by proof of forgery of other notes of the same kind under similar circumstances, at or near the same time, the authorities appear to sustain the competency of the evidence. The subject was very carefully considered by Judge Thayer in Penna. Co. for Ins., etc., v. R. R. Co., 158 Pa. 160, and his opinion adopted by this Court. The offers of evidence in the first, fourth and fifth assignments of error tended to show that Cowan, \u201c the maker of the notes in suit, had in his possession notes of small amounts, with genuine accommodation indorsements of defendant upon them, and at or near the same time passed to the plaintiff similar notes, with what purported to be defendant\u2019s indorsement, but for much larger amounts, which defendant denied having executed in that condition.\u201d In addition, the offers included a card, testified to being in Cowan\u2019s writing, showing practice in changing figures in the very manner charged by the defendant as having been done here. These offers tended to show a scheme on the part of Cowan to get defendant\u2019s indorsements on notes of small amounts, and then raise the amounts by alteration of the figures before passing them to his creditors, and particularly to the plaintiff. The evidence therefore bore on the issue, and should have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The second assignment, to the exclusion of a confession or statement by Cowan as to the raising of the amounts of certain notes, cannot be sustained. While Cowan himself might have testified to the facts, his ex parte statement, not under oath, and not subject to cross-examination, could not affect the rights of plaintiff as a bona fide holder of the raised note.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The other assignments do not require special notice. They are not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Judgment reversed and venire de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
