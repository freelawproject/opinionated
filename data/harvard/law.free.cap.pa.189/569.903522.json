Franklin Melloy, Executors of the last will of Rachel Melloy, deceased, <em>v. </em>George D. Melloy and J. Frank Melloy, who survived James B. Melloy, late trading as J. M. Melloy\u2019s Sons. Appeal of George D. Melloy.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b589-7\">\n<em>Promissory notes\u2014Statute of limitations\u2014Evidence\u2014Question for jury.</em>\n</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b589-8\">In an action upon two promissory notes, maturing more than six years before suit, but alleged by the plaintiff to have been taken out of the bar of the statute of limitations by an express promise of payment, the notes are admissible in evidence to identify them as the notes referred to in the new promise, and the case is for the jury where it appears that they were the only notes given by defendant to plaintiff, and that when the promise was made two promissory notes had been produced by plaintiff and exhibited to defendant.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b589-9\">Argued Jan. 6, 1899.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AL-\">Appeal, No. 244, Jan.

Before Biddle, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-11\">The suit was upon two promissory notes given by J. M. Melloy\u2019s Sons to Rachel Melloy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-12\">The sheriff returned nihil habet as to J. Frank Melloy, and George D. Melloy. The defendant served, pleaded the statute of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-13\">At the trial there was proof by two separate witnesses, that on two separate occasions the defendant admitted his indebtedness to the plaintiff upon two notes, and expressly promised to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>pay them, fixing the time at which he would do so. At one of these conversations notes were produced and were handed to and examined by the defendant. The witness who testified to this conversation said that she knew of the existence of the notes in suit; that they were handed to and examined by the defendant at this conversation, and that he said: \u201c Mother, these notes are all right. You shall have them. I will pay you on the first of the year. I cannot pay you before.\u201d The witness further testified that the notes so produced and examined at this conversation were the notes in suit. Upon cross-examination, however, she admitted that she did not read the notes which were handed to the defendant at the time of the conversation, but that later in the day her mother showed them to her. The witness to the other conversation was J. Frank Melloy, defendant\u2019s partner, who testified that the plaintiff came to the store of the firm and said to the defendant that she came for her money, and defendant said, \u201c What money? \u201d and plaintiff said, \u201cThe notes,\u201d and defendant then said, \u201cI haven\u2019t any money,\u201d and plaintiff then said, \u201c When will I get it ? \u201d and defendant said, \u201c In three weeks.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-5\">The evidence also showed that the two notes in suit were the only notes of the firm which the plaintiff held. The defendant, although in court, was not called by his counsel to disprove that the notes referred to in his promise were the ones in suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-6\">The notes were offered and admitted in evidence. [1, 2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-7\">The court charged as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-8\">There is no question in this case but that these notes were executed by the defendant, and there is no question that they were the only notes issued by that firm. They are, however, barred by what we call the statute of limitation, and they could not be sued upon unless there is testimony in the case which takes it out of the operation of that statute. In all these cases if you claim a sum of money which is barred by the statute you must prove that there was a subsequent acknowledgment and promise to pay that debt. Of course, a man cannot make a general promise to pay all his debts. That would not be considered sufficient to take it out of the bar of the statute. [The point made by the defendant in this case is that in this evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>these notes were not sufficiently identified as the notes in regard to which the conversation took place between the son and his mother on the two occasions which have been testified to; one occasion in the presence of the daughter, and the other in the presence of her son. The question for you to decide, there being but these two notes issued by the firm to her, in the conversation of the parties and the production of these two pieces of paper, whether they were the identical notes. If you find they were the notes about which the conversation was had, then they are good. If you find that these promises were not made as to these identical notes, your verdict should be for the defendant.] [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-5\">The defendant\u2019s point and the answer thereto were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b591-6\">Under all the evidence the verdict must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>Refused.

The evidence referred to in the first and second specifications tended to identify the notes in suit, and was therefore rightly admitted. The instructions recited in the third specification were fully war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>ranted by the evidence therein referred to by the learned trial judge. Referring to the conversation that was testified to, as having taken place between the son and his mother, on two occasions, he rightly instructed the jury that if they found that the notes in suit were the same \u201c notes about which the conversation was had, then they are good.\u201d But if they found that the \u201c promises were not as to these identical notes the verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d It follows, of course, that there was no error in refusing to charge as requested, that \u201c under all the evidence the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The case involved questions of fact which were rightly submitted to the jury and by them determined in favor of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
