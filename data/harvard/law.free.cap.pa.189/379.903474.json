The two water companies received their charters upon the same day, and recorded them upon the same day. The Penn Water Company was authorized to supply water to Braddock township, and the Pennsylvania Water Company was authorized to supply water to the Sterrett township, which adjoins Braddock. On August 10, 1888, the Penn Water Company, assuming to act under the provisions of the act of April 17, 1876, conveyed its franchises and property to the Pennsylvania Water Company. It is therefore the Pennsylvania Water Company, claiming the franchises of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>the Penn Company, that is here contesting with Braddock borough as to the right to supply water. As the case proceeded, doubt was suggested as to the right of the Penn Company to transfer its franchises to the other company, but this point was not pressed upon the argument, and the right to thus merge the two companies seems to be now conceded by counsel for the borough. Under these circumstances, we will assume that the Pennsylvania Company has, as to Braddock township, all the rights which the Penn Company would have had if no consolidation had been effected.!</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-4\">The facts relevant to the controversy are found as follows, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-5\">1. The borough of Braddock was incorporated in 1867, under the borough act of 1851.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-6\">2. It constructed its own system of waterworks, completing the same in the autumn of 1886.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-7\">8. Beginning in 1886, and continuing up to the time of filing the bill in this case, the borough of Braddock, under contracts made by authority of the Act of June 10, 1885, P. L. 81, has laid pipes and supplied water to various districts of Braddock township adjoining said borough, to wit: to a small district on the east of Thirteenth street, a district known as North Braddock and a district known as Copeland.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-8\">4. On June 2, 1894, the district called Copeland was annexed to the borough of Braddock, and with slight additions of territory, now constitutes the fourth ward of said borough.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-9\">5. The water companies, defendant, presented their articles of association and letters patent issued to each of them on March 18, 1887, under the provisions of the Act of April 29, 1874, P. L. 73, the purpose of the Pennsylvania Company being the supply of water to the citizens of Sterrett township, Allegheny county, and that of the Penn Water Company the supply of water to the citizens of Braddock township, Allegheny county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-10\">6. These charters were recorded on May 3, 1888, in the recorder\u2019s office of Allegheny county, in charter book, volume 13, pages 20 and 23.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-11\">7. The Penn Water Company was merged in the Pennsylvania Water Company, August 10,1888, under the authority and proceedings above referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>8. Beginning at about the time of the recording of the charters, i. e., early in May, 1888, some surveys were made by Mr. J. H. Harlow, one of the promoters of the enterprise, and now the president of the Pennsylvania Company. But no other work was done until after the merger or consolidation. In February, 1889, property in Penn township, on a hill overlooking the Allegheny river, was purchased as a site for a reservoir\u2019, and in the same month a contract with Mr. J. H. Harlow to build the works was executed by the Pennsylvania Company. Pipes were laid from the reservoir through Penn and Sterrett townships to Braddock township. The first pipes were laid in Braddock township in March, 1889, and water was turned into the pipes in the autumn of 1889. Since that date the company has extended its system, laid a large amount of pipe, reaching the vicinity of Braddock borough with its pipe line early in 1890, is increasing the capacity of its works, and seems to have used due diligence in providing for the supply of water to the citizens of Braddock township.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-3\">Note. Braddock borough is situate on the Monongahela river, at the south end of Braddock township. Sterrett township is north of Braddoek township, and Penn township lies north of Sterrett, extending to the Allegheny river.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-4\">9. This water company began to supply water to the North Braddock and Copeland districts in August, 1890, and was supplying water to residents of Copeland when it became the fourth ward of the borough of Braddock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-5\">10. In the fall of 1896 the water company asked permission of Braddock councils to open Corey avenue, in the Copeland district (then fourth ward), to lay thereon a line of water pipe, and the request was refused. The request was renewed in February, 1897, permission being asked to open the streets after April 16,1897, and the request was refused. On April 20,1897, the company commenced to lay its line on said Corey avenue, when the borough of Braddock filed the bill in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-6\">11. On January 12, 1897, the Pennsylvania Water Company notified Braddock borough to discontinue its water supply in the fourth ward, formerly Copeland, as said company claimed exclusive rights therein under its charter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-7\">12. In this connection attention is called to the fact that after the issuing of letters patent, March 18, 1887, and before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>recording of the same, May 3, 1888, to wit: on June 2, 1887, P. L. 310, the corporation act of 1874 was so amended that water companies created thereunder do not secure exclusive franchises. See Luzerne Water Co. v. Toby Creek Water Co., 148 Pa. 568.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-5\">It is plain that the controlling question in this case is, Did the corporate existence of the water companies begin March 18, 1887, or not until May 3,1888 ? If it began at the former date, then the water company now defending took under its charter and the transfer from the other company the exclusive right to furnish water to Braddock township, and would still retain that right even as to the portion of that township which has been annexed to the borough. While the borough of Braddock would, even in that case, doubtless, have the right to continue to furnish water to parties outside the borough where contracts were made under the act of 1885, before March 18, 1887, as long as the parties who had contracted with it chose to take the water, no definite term having been fixed in any of the contracts. Its subsequent contracts would give it no rights with respect to the furnishing of water within the limits of Braddock township. If, however, the corporate existence began May 3, 1888, when the articles of association, etc., were recorded, then the water companies did not take an exclusive franchise, and whilst they, or the surviving one, would have the right to furnish water to the Copeland district, now fourth ward of Braddock, it could not exclude the borough as a supplier of water either from that district or from the other districts involved in this controversy. We do not regard the question as to when the corporations began to exist as such, as open for discussion. It was settled by the case of G-uckert v. Hacke et ah, 159 Pa. 303. It is there said: <em>\u201c </em>It is plain from a cursory reading of the Act of April 29,1874, P. L. 73, that recording of the certificate <em>\u2018 </em>in the office for the recording of deeds in and for the county where the chief operations are to be carried on,\u2019 was intended to be made one of the conditions precedent to corporate existence.\u201d And if, as is there said in support of the conclusion, the exemption from personal liability is a matter of sufficient importance to call for the giving of notice by recording, with greater reason can we base an argument upon the importance of the charter provisions granting and defining the primary franchises of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>corporation. For almost eleven months after the amendment to section 34 of the corporation act of 1874, the promoters of this enterprise did nothing to indicate that they claimed any rights with respect to the furnishing of water to Braddock township, nothing even to indicate that they intended to accept the franchises offered them by the state. The importance of holding them strictly within the powers and privileges granted to them, is emphasized not only by the fact that they are now attempting to exclude a large borough, with a waterworks, from laying pipes in one of its own wards ; but also, by the fact that if the city of Pittsburg adds any more territory on the east, it will have no right to extend its water system to cover it, if the franchise contended for is exclusive. But we are told that the introductory sentence of clause 34, of the corporation act of 1874, provides that water companies, etc., \u201c incorporated under the provisions of this statute \u201d shall \u201c from the date of letters patent creating the same,\u201d have the powers, etc., conferred by the succeeding clauses of section 34; and therefore as to these companies, whatever may be the rule as to other corporations, the franchises date from the issuing of the certificate. But this is a begging of the question. If, as is held in Guckert v. Hacke, these companies were not incorporated until May 3,1888, their privileges were defined by section 34 as it then stood, and at that time it conferred no exclusive franchise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-5\">We conclude that the parties plaintiff and defendant have the right to furnish water in the districts invol ved in this controversy; the defendant (the Pennsylvania Water Company) under its charter, and the borough of Braddock under contracts made by authority of the act of 1885 as to the districts still within Braddock township, and by virtue of its charter rights as to the Copeland district, now its fourth ward. The borough of Braddock should pay one half of the costs, and the Pennsylvania Water Company the other half. The Pennsylvania Water Company has the right, upon compliance with reasonable borough restrictions, to lay pipe, etc., in the Copeland district.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-6\">The court entered the following decree:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-7\">And now, April 2, 1898, the above bill and cross-bill having been heretofore heard on bills, answers, replications and testimony, and the court having found the facts and its conclusions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>of law, and the same having been filed, it is now ordered, adjudged and decreed as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-4\">1. The Pennsylvania Water Company, as the assignee of the franchises of the Penn Water Company, and the borough of Braddock, for the reasons stated in the findings of fact and conclusions of law, each have the right to furnish water to consumers in the districts involved in this controversy, namely, the Copeland district, now the fourth ward of said borough, and the territory still within Braddock township. But neither of above parties has exclusive rights in the district and territory above named.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-5\">2. The Pennsylvania Water Company, as assignee of the Penn Water Company, has the right, upon compliance with reasonable borough restrictions, to lay pipes and furnish water in the said Copeland district.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-6\">3.

MeKee, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQ2\">The court below ignored the proposition that charters take effect immediately on their acceptance by the incorporators, and that, when granted, as in this case, on the application of the incorporators, charters take effect immediately upon their issuance: Beach on Private Corp. sec. 15; Rathbone v. Tioga Navigation Co., 2 W. &amp; S. 79.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-9\">In disregard of these canons the court undertook to follow the construction put on the corporate act of 1874, in the case of Guckert v. Hacke et al., 159 Pa. 303, and in so doing, we contend, fell into error. This, we think, arose through a misapprehension of the sense in which the word existence is used in a dictum found in the opinion referred to, and taking it for an authority to the effect that the recording of the certificate, as required by the act of 1874, is a prerequisite to corporate existence in the sense of having corporate life; instead of gathering from the case that the recording is to be regarded as one of the lawful conditions of corporate existence, in the sense of living in the full observance of all the statute requires of corporations after their creation and as going concerns.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>The law clearly defines the legal effect of letters patent; they create a new being, and are the evidence of a new relation between the commonwealth and the incorporators, and it has never been held in Pennsylvania that the letters patent issued under this act do not have the effect which they purport to have, and which the law gives them. The best evidence of the existence of a corporation is the grant of the corporate powers of the commonwealth: Gibbs\u2019s Est., 157 Pa. 69.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b405-3\"><em>W.
