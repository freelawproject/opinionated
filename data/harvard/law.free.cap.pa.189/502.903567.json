Before Slagle, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-11\">The contract, dated December 28, 1895, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-12\">\u201c For and in consideration of the sum of f2,000, R. M. Barbin, does hereby agree to transfer, sell and assign to the said Charles F. Wentzel, all his right, title and good-will to the Oakland paper route until now controlled by the said R. M. Barbin. It is further agreed that R. M. Barbin, shall use his best efforts in familiarizing the said Charles F. Wentzel with the territory he now assumes as agent for the Pittsburgh Daily and Sunday newspapers, by giving the said Charles F. Wentzel his personal attention for at least three weeks, during which time the said Wentzel shall become familiar with the subscribers for the various newspapers.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-13\">At the trial plaintiff offered to prove by his own testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>that, within a month after this contract was signed and the plaintiff had taken possession of the route, defendant undertook to get possession again, by calling on the subscribers and inducing them, if possible, not to take from the plaintiff, but, in violation of the agreement and contract, to take again from him ail the papers mentioned in this agreement and contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-4\">Defendant objected to the offer for the reason that there was no agreement made by which the defendant was to stay off, or refrain from doing business on, this same route.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-5\">By the Court: The objection is overruled and bill sealed for the defendant. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-6\">Defendant\u2019s points and the answers thereto among others were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-7\">4. Under the agreement, as admitted by the parties, there was nothing to prevent Barbin from selling papers over this route, after he had signed the written contract, and it is not only his privilege but his right to continue in possession and exercise full control over the route until the $2,000 was all paid by Wentzel to him. <em>Answer : </em>This is refused. [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-8\">5. Under the uncontradicted evidence in this case, Barbin had a legal right to sell papers on this route, at any and all times since the date of the agreement with Wentzel, and no damage or breach of contract in this suit can be predicated upon any attempt by him to sell papers on the route after the date of the contract, and especially if such attempts were made prior to the payment of all the purchase money by Wentzel. <em>Answer : </em>This is refused. [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-9\">The court charged in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-10\">[Mr. Wentzel claims further that, on or about January 20 (about the time the three weeks had expired), Mr. Barbin then became actively engaged in interfering with his business. If there were nothing else in the case than that, I would be inclined to think that this action was not properly brought, and it leaves a question that may possibly be considered hereafter, whether or not this action was properly brought. At present, I instruct you that that is properly set up here as a claim.] [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-11\">[In reference to the matter of Mr. Barbin\u2019s refusal to turn over these other newspapers, he says now, as I understand, that he was not bound to deliver them, because he had not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>fully paid. And it appears that at the time of this difficulty on January 9 or 10, he demanded payment of the balance due upon this contract. He did not demand simply that a note should be given, as agreed upon, but he demanded the money. He said, \u201c Have you got the money here or the security? \u201d And Mr. Wentzel said \u201cNo; \u201d and Mr. Barbin then said, that until the money or security was furnished he was not bound to give Mr. Wentzel anything. That was about the position.] [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-5\">[So that you have now, in the first place, the question whether or not Mr. Wentzel did comply with his contract. If he did not, was he excused in any way for those matters in which he was deficient. Mr. Barbin did not furnish the list of subscribers ; he did not furnish the service that he was bound to do, and then finally he interfered by taking away the subscribers. Was he justified in so doing? If he was, you will find for the defendant. If he was not, you will find for the plaintiff. The question is now, what is the measure of damages, and here comes the question of difficulty. In the first place, as I said before, Mr. Wentzel, if the contract was rescinded, would be entitled to have his money back, and if Mr. Barbin\u2019s conduct was equal to a rescission; that is, if he did that which he could only do if the contract had been rescinded,\u2014go in and take the customers away from Mr. Wentzel and destroy the value of his contract,\u2014he would be in the same position, and Mr. Wentzel would be then entitled to recover back at least the money he had paid on account of it, less what he had got back.] [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-6\">Yerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $1,025.

M. Barbin,\u201d he became bound in honor and in law to carry out his contract in good faith. He was certainly not at liberty, especially after receiving a large part of the purchase money, to filch away from the plaintiff the veritable substance of that which he had sold. It was not like the setting up of another business of the same kind, but it was the taking away of the very thing he had sold that was complained of by the plaintiff. There was no error in the admission of the proposed testimony nor in the ruling of the court in the general charge nor in the answers to points.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
