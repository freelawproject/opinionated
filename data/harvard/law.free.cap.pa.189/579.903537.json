Before Finletteb, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-13\">At the trial the uncontradicted evidence on behalf of the defendant was that the insured in his application had answered \u201c no \u201d to the question whether he had ever been rejected, declined or postponed by another insurance company. He had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>also stated in his application that he had no serious illness. The proof showed that he had been rejected by an insurance association known as the Catholic Knights of America, and that at the time of the insurance he had cirrhosis of the liver, of which he died about four months after the policy was issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-4\">Charles Stable was called on behalf of the plaintiff .to prove that, at the time of the examination by the physician representing the defendant, the insured, Frank Meyer-Bruns, told him that he had been rejected as a member of the Catholic Knights of America; and that the doctor said that it was a beneficial insurance and not an old line company, and it would not affect it; this for the purpose of rebutting the statement in the application for insurance that he was not rejected by an insurance company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b600-5\">Defendant\u2019s objection was sustained. Exception for plaintiff.

In this case the evidence of the defense is complete and absolute, and therefore it is my duly to direct you to find a verdict for the defendant.

Fidelity Mut. Life Assn., 151 Pa. 17; Home Mut. Life Assn. v. Gillespie, 110 Pa. 84; Carson v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 1 Pa. Superior Ct. 572; Equitable Life Assurance Society v. Hazlewood, 7 L.

L. 134, providing that policies of life insurance shall not be forfeited on account of incorrect statements of the applicant, if such statements are immaterial to the risk, cannot be waived by the assured: Hermany v. Mut. Life Assn., 151 Pa. 17; Keatley v. Ins.

Royal Soc. of Good Fellows, 179 Pa. 366.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ARX\">January 30, 1899:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b601-9\">Per Ctjriam,</author>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">The proposed testimony referred to in the first specification was rightly excluded because it was incompetent for the purpose stated in the offer or for any other legitimate purpose in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">We find nothing in the testimony that would have justified the learned trial judge in submitting the case to the jury. There was no disputed question of fact for their consideration. It was conclusively shown by uncontroverted evidence that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover on the policy in suit, and there was therefore no error in directing a verdict in favor of the defendant company.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
