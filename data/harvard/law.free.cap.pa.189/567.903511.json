Before Pennypacker, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-9\">At the trial it appeared that plaintiff, who was employed by the defendant as a brakeman, was injured on June 7, 1889, at Newark, New Jersey, while operating a defective brake.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-10\">The court entered a compulsory nonsuit, stating its reasons therefor as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-11\">I think that this case utterly fails upon its proofs. The plaintiff has been seriously injured and naturally we all sympathize with him, but his case is to be determined upon legal proofs. The doctrine of the law is that he takes the risks of the employment, and among those risks is the negligence of a fellow servant. It therefore becomes very important to know exactly what is the cause of the accident, and whether it is due to negligence and to whose negligence. Now in this case it is not shown at all how it was that this brake came to be broken. All we have before us is the evidence of the plaintiff that after he had made several revolutions of bis wheel he found that the chain was broken, but to what the break was due we cannot tell; it is amere conjecture. It may have been that the car was out of repair or it may have been that there was some de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>fects, some concealed defect in this brake, and that the revolution itself caused the break just at that moment, but this is entirely conjecture. The theory of the plaintiff appears to be that this was a case where there was a broken chain before the cars were inspected at Elizabethport, but there is no evidence to support that and nothing from which the inference can properly be drawn. I think, therefore, that the nonsuit will have to be entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-4\">The court subsequently refused to take off the nonsuit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-5\"><em>JError assigned </em>was refusal to take off nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b588-6\"><em>J.

Smith, 80 N. Y. 458.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-7\">Owing to the increase of suits for personal injuries the tendency of the lower courts has been to require of the plaintiff proof of facts which preclude the possibility of an inference of due care on the part of the defendant. This tendency was encouraged by the learned court below in the case at bar, but it is without the sanction of law either in England or in the United States: Paterson v. Wallace, 28 Eng. L. &amp; Eq. 50; Jetter v. R. R. Co., 2 Abb. Ct. of App. Dec. 458; Hart v. Hudson River Bridge Co., 80 N. Y. 622; Delaware, etc., R. R. Co. v. Jones, 128 Pa. 398; Longenecker v. R. R.
