Code, \u00a7 192, subd. (b)) following a court trial. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>sentenced him to the midterm of three years in state prison and enhanced the punishment five years pursuant to Penal Code section 667, finding that both his current offense and a prior conviction of robbery were serious felonies within the meaning of Penal Code section 1192.7, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">We determine as a matter of first impression that involuntary manslaughter may constitute a serious felony within the meaning of section 667 if the record establishes that the defendant \u201cpersonally inflict[ed] great bodily injury\u201d in the commission of the crime. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(8).) Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The information originally charged appellant with the murder of 14-inonth-old Chela Brown. Chela died of sepsis resulting from second and third degree burns over 75 percent of her body. On March 26, 1985, as on several prior occasions, she had been left in appellant\u2019s care while her mother, Cheree Taylor, went to work. When appellant picked up Taylor that afternoon, Chela was with him wrapped in a blanket, and he indicated she had had an accident. Taylor noticed the child\u2019s skin \u201cwas a little red,\u201d and they took her to three hospitals where she was treated for severe burns.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Chela died one month later after \u201cheroic measures\u201d failed to control the resulting infection. During that period she was constantly in pain. Dr. William Davies, a burn specialist at Torrance Memorial Hospital, testified that Chela\u2019s burns were consistent with \u201cthe typical distribution of an immersion burn similar to sometimes seen in bathtubs.\u201d The severity of her injuries could have been caused by placing her in a tub of 122-degree water three to five minutes, which would have caused the child \u201cmortal pain.\u201d Dr. Davies further opined that \u201c[i]t is not possible to produce this type of a burn with spilling water.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">Los Angeles Police Detective Connie Castruita investigated the incident. At the victim\u2019s residence, she examined the bathtub and filled it with hot water. With a thermometer she determined the temperature to be 122 degrees; she also placed her hand in the water for \u201cjust a few seconds,\u201d which caused her skin to turn red. The victim\u2019s grandmother, Emma Stokes, also reported to the police that she found \u201csome burned skin in the tub\u201d two days after her granddaughter\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>Based upon her investigation, Detective Castruita and her partner arrested appellant for child abuse and transported him to jail. En route he related to the officers that he had been cooking potatoes and had accidently spilled some water on the victim, who was on the floor. When the officers indicated this was inconsistent with the physical evidence, he gave them a second explanation: He was holding the victim in his arms while cooking at the stove. She kicked a pot of boiling water, which flew back and burned her; he then accidently dropped her onto more hot water on the floor. Upon arrival at the police station for booking, appellant told yet a third version of the events, which also was inconsistent with the physical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Issue Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The sole issue presented is whether involuntary manslaughter constitutes a serious felony within the meaning of Penal Code section 667. We hold that it may if the prosecution pleads and proves the defendant \u201cinflict[ed] great bodily injury\u201d in committing the offense. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(8).)</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">Penal Code<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> section 667 provides for a five-year enhancement upon conviction of a serious felony when the defendant also has suffered a prior conviction for a serious felony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cSerious felony\u201d is defined by reference to section 1192.7, subdivision (c), which lists specific crimes as well as certain circumstances for which the enhancement shall be imposed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>No reviewing court has yet ruled on the precise question of whether a current conviction for involuntary manslaughter can constitute a serious felony despite its nonenumeration as such in section 1192.7, subdivision (c). (But see <em>People </em>v. <em>Cook </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 948 [205 Cal.Rptr. 105].) However, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Equarte </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 456 [229 Cal.Rptr. 116, 722 P.2d 890], the California Supreme Court examined an analogous question of whether assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)) may invoke the five-year enhancement notwithstanding its omission from section 1192.7, subdivision (c). The Supreme Court answered that question in the affirmative. It held that the provisions of section 667 obtain if the prosecution establishes the defendant \u201cpersonally used a dangerous or deadly weapon,\u201d thus making the crime a \u201cserious felony\u201d under one of the more general classifications of section 1192.7, subdivision (c), relating to the manner of committing the offense rather than the specific offense itself. (\u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(23).) We are persuaded the analysis in <em>Equarte </em>applies with equal logic to the legal and factual issues before us; and we reach a similar conclusion: While not specified as a serious felony, involuntary manslaughter may come within the purview of section 667 if the defendant \u201cpersonally inflict[ed] great bodily injury\u201d in the commission of the crime. (\u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(8).)</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Since <em>Equarte </em>is dispositive, we review the opinion in some detail: The defendant was charged with two counts of assault with a deadly weapon. (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1).) In a separate paragraph, he was further charged with having been previously convicted of a \u201cserious felony\u201d within the meaning of sections 667 and 1192.7, subdivision (c)(25), attempted robbery. However, \u201c[t]he complaint did not explicitly allege either generally or by reference to any specific provision of section 1192.7, subdivision (c), that [his] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number><em>current </em>offenses were \u2018serious felonies\u2019 . . . , and it contained no allegation that [he] had \u2018personally used a dangerous or deadly weapon\u2019 in the current offenses.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Equarte, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p.459.)</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The jury found the defendant guilty of one count of assault with a deadly weapon; and the facts established that he acted alone in perpetrating the crime. <em>(Id., </em>at p.467.) At sentencing, the trial court imposed a five-year enhancement pursuant to sections 667 and 1192.7, subdivision (c)(23), apparently finding that the defendant\u2019s \u201cpersonal use\u201d of a weapon had been adequately established by the trial testimony and that a more explicit pleading of the basis for the enhancement was unnecessary. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 460.)</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">In reviewing the propriety of the sentence, the Supreme Court first reaffirmed its conclusion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 826, 831-832 [210 Cal.Rptr. 623, 694 P.2d 736], that section 1192.7, subdivision (c), does not confine its enumeration of serious felonies to \u201cspecific, discrete offenses.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Equarte, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 463-464.) Rather, the statute \u201cis an amalgam of different elements.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 832.) Accordingly, \u201c \u2018the enhancement provisions . . . refer to the criminal <em>conduct </em>described therein, <em>not </em>to specific criminal <em>offenses </em>and thus these provisions apply whenever the prosecution pleads and proves the specified conduct. . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Equarte, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 463-464, quoting <em>People v. Arwood </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 167, 174-175 [211 Cal.Rptr. 307].)</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">From the foregoing analysis, the court determined that \u201c[b]y incorporating section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(23) into section 667, the drafters evidenced their conclusion that a defendant who \u2018personally uses a dangerous or deadly weapon\u2019 in the commission of a felony should be classified as a \u2018serious\u2019 felon and should be subject to an additional five-year enhancement if he has previously been convicted of a serious felony.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Equarte, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 464.) Consequently, \u201cunder subdivision (c)(23), \u2018any felony\u2019\u2014including assault with a deadly weapon\u2014may be found to constitute a serious felony if the prosecution properly pleads and proves that defendant personally used a deadly or dangerous weapon in the commission of the offense.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 465.) Since the trial evidence established that the enhancement applied to defendant Equarte, the sentencing court properly augmented his punishment by five years notwithstanding the possible uncertainty created by the prosecution\u2019s failure to specify the basis for declaring the current offense a serious felony within the meaning of section 667. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 466-467.)</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">The manifest correspondence between subdivision (c)(23) and subdivision (c)(8) dictates a similar resolution of the case at bar. Although arguably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>dictum, we find particularly compelling the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat in the case of the categories\u2014like subdivision (c)(23)\u2014that apply to \u2018any felony\u2019 if committed in a particular manner, a defendant\u2019s conduct may place him into the \u2018serious felony\u2019 classification under a number of different categories.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 465; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 832, fn. 8.) Subdivision (c)(8), which classifies a \u201cserious felony\u201d as <em>\u201cany other felony </em>in which the defendant personally inflicts great bodily injury on any person, other than an accomplice . . . [italics added]\u201d clearly comes within this interpretation. On this basis the court below enhanced appellant\u2019s sentence an additional five years; and in light of <em>People </em>v. <em>Equarte </em>we find no error in this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The original amended information charged appellant with murder and further alleged that he had suffered a prior conviction for robbery, \u201ca serious felony . . . within the meaning Penal Code Section 667(a).\u201d The court found appellant guilty of involuntary manslaughter but still imposed a five-year enhancement because he had personally inflicted great bodily injury in the commission of the crime. The evidence fully supports this finding: The victim suffered massive second and third degree burns and was in pain not only when they were inflicted but constantly for the month preceding her death. Such injuries were anything but \u201ctransitory and short-lived\u201d or \u201ctrivial, insignificant or moderate.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Caudillo </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 562, 588-589 [146 Cal.Rptr. 859, 580 P.2d 274].) Nor is there any doubt that appellant personally inflicted the injuries. Although he attempted to evade responsibility by explaining that the burns were accidental, he never denied his involvement. Since the record thus demonstrates that he committed involuntary manslaughter in a manner constituting it a \u201cserious felony\u201d within the meaning of section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(8), i.e., by the personal infliction of great bodily injury, we find no sentencing error.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Appellant raises several arguments previously resolved against him in <em>People </em>v. <em>Equarte, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d 456. For one, the fact that section 1192.7, subdivision (c), does not specify involuntary manslaughter as a serious felony is of no consequence if the circumstances of the crime otherwise bring it within one of the listed categories.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 463-464.) Likewise, the prosecution is not required to plead and prove the personal infliction of great bodily injury as a separate enhancement. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 465-466.) Even if the complaint did not explicitly inform appellant of the basis for claiming his current offense was a serious felony for purposes of section 667, he could have rectified any notice problem by special demurrer. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 466-467; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 837, 843 [226 Cal.Rptr. 107, 718 P.2d 94].)</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>Appellant also relies heavily on <em>People </em>v. <em>Cook, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.3d 948, 951, which held that involuntary manslaughter is not a serious felony within the meaning of section 667. We find that decision distinguishable in several respects. First, the substantive analysis and conclusions in <em>Cook </em>antedate both <em>People </em>v. <em>Equarte, supra, </em>and <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>and hence must be read in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s later explication of the intended scope of section 1192.7, subdivision (c). (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Arwood, supra, </em>165 Cal.App.3d at pp. 174-175.) In particular, we note that the Supreme Court expressly rejected use of \u201cthe cardinal maxim of construction, <em>expressio unius est exclusio </em>alterius\u2014expression of one thing implies the exclusion of another\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cook, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.3d at p. 952) in interpreting this statute. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Equarte, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 463-464; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at pp. 831-832, fn. 8.) Procedurally as well, any reference in <em>Cook </em>to lack of notice probably has been superseded as inconsistent with holdings in <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at page 843, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Equarte, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pages 466-467. (See <em>In re Lane </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 99, 105 [22 Cal.Rptr. 857, 372 P.2d 897].)</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Second, in <em>Cook </em>involuntary manslaughter was alleged as the <em>prior </em>serious felony conviction, and the prosecution did not establish any of the circumstances of the crime. Thus, neither at sentencing nor on review did the court have any evidentiary basis for determining the defendant had personally inflicted great bodily injury or for finding the offense constituted a serious felony within the meaning of section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(8). (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Cook, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.3d at pp. 955-956.) \u201cIt is axiomatic that cases are not authority for propositions not considered. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gilbert </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 475, 482, fn. 7 [82 Cal.Rptr. 724, 462 P.2d 580].)</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Finally, the Court of Appeal rejected involuntary manslaughter as a serious felony in part because it is not specificially enumerated in section 1192.7, subdivision (c), while murder and voluntary manslaughter are. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cook, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.3d at pages 953-954.) However, this analysis fails to consider the following crucial distinction: Every person convicted of murder or voluntary manslaughter is guilty of a serious felony within the meaning of section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(1), regardless of the nature or extent of his or her participation. By contrast, one convicted of involuntary manslaughter is guilty of a \u201cserious felony\u201d only if he or she <em>personally </em>inflicted great bodily injury in the commission of the crime. (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Equarte, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p. 465.) As previously noted, the court in <em>Cook </em>did not have an evidentiary basis for examining this distinction since the underlying facts of the defendant\u2019s prior involuntary manslaughter conviction had not been established on the record. Hence, its pronouncement \u201cthat involuntary manslaughter is not a serious felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>enhancement simply because it results in great bodily injury\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cook, supra, </em>158 Cal.App.3d at p. 953) at best can only be regarded as dictum, which we find unpersuasive in light of more compelling authority and a more substantial evidentiary record.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed in all respects.
