Ressler argued that his two prior convictions for \u201chouse breaking\u201d were not burglaries and thus not \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d as defined under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). He contended that he had not presented this claim earlier because his counsel had not investigated the nature of the prior convictions and he did not learn of the statutory definition until after he had filed his first \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-24\">The government answered and argued that Ressler was procedurally barred from raising this issue because he could have raised it on direct appeal or in his first \u00a7 2255 .motion but he had not done so and had not shown either cause or prejudice for the default. The government further argued that his claim was meritless because the elements of \u201chouse breaking\u201d satisfied the elements of \u201cgeneric burglary\u201d as defined in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2158-59, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), and his convictions were thus crimes of violence under \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>The district court dismissed Ressler\u2019s successive \u00a7 2255 motion because Ressler had not first obtained permission from a Judge of the Court of Appeals to file a successive \u00a7 2255 as required by the provisions of AEDPA, enacted on April 24, 1996. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). The district court applied the amended version of \u00a7 2244 to Ressler\u2019s successive \u00a7 2255 motion even though Ressler filed his motion before the AEDPA was signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Ressler timely appealed and requested this Court to issue a Certificate of Appealability (COA). This Court granted Ressler a COA limited to the question of the district court\u2019s application of AEDPA to his pending \u00a7 2255 motion. On June 23, 1997, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Lindh v. Murphy,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997), which establishes the rules and criteria for determining whether the provisions of AEDPA would be applied to cases pending prior to the effective date of that Act. On July 14, another panel of the Fifth Circuit held that under <em>Lindh v. Murphy </em>the requirement for certification by the Court of Appeals of a successive application under \u00a7 2255 does not apply because the petitioner\u2019s application was pending on April 24, 1996, the date AEDPA was enacted. <em>Williams v. Cain, </em>117 F.3d 863 (5th Cir. 1997). Ressler\u2019s petition in this case was likewise pending on the effective date of AEDPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is VACATED and this case is REMANDED to the district court for further proceedings under the law as it existed prior to the adoption of AEDPA.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
