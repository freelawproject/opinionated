United States,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995). Finding Thompson\u2019s contentions to have merit, we reverse her conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b385-23\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b385-24\">Thompson was convicted pursuant to a plea bargain of, <em>inter alia, </em>using and carrying firearms in relation to the commission of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). Thompson\u2019s arrest followed the execution of a search warrant on her residence. At Thompson\u2019s house Drug Enforcement Agency (\u201cDEA\u201d) agents found amphetamine, chemicals used in the manufacturing of amphetamine and two semi-automatic pistols. The firearms charged to Thompson were found in two different bureau drawers in a bedroom, with one of the pistols being in a purse within a bureau drawer. Thompson was not in the bedroom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>when the search warrant was executed and no drugs were found in the room in which the firearms were found.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">On March 8, 1996, Thompson filed this \u00a7 2255 motion seeking to have her conviction and sentence on the firearm charge overturned in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Bailey </em>decision. The district court denied the \u00a7 2255 motion. Thompson timely appealed the denial to this court, filing her notice of appeal prior to April 24, 1996, the date on which the President signed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The AEDPA amended 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 to require a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) before an appeal may proceed in a \u00a7 2255 action. This court recently determined that the COA requirement does not apply retroactively to petitioners who filed \u00a7 2255 appeals in which the final judgment and notice of appeal were entered before the AEDPA\u2019s effective date. <em>United States v. Rocha, </em>109 F.3d 225, 229 (5th Cir.1997). Accordingly, Thompson is not subject to the COA requirement and we proceed to the merits of her appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we examine the lower court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law <em>de novo. United States v. Faubion, </em>19 F.3d 226, 228 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">Thompson argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Bailey </em>decision should be applied retroactively and that in light of that decision, the evidence is insufficient to sustain her conviction for using or carrying a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking offense. She argues that the firearms with which she was charged were not found on her person, in her possession or within the vicinity of her arrest and therefore she could not be found to be either \u201cusing\u201d or \u201ccarrying\u201d the firearms, as required by the statute under which she was convicted. Thompson contends that under <em>Bailey, </em>she could not have been convicted based on the mere storage of a firearm near drugs or drug proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">Section 924(c)(1) is violated when a defendant \u201cduring and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... uses or carries a firearm.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). Prior to <em>Bailey, </em>this court had held that \u00a7 924(c) merely \u201crequires evidence that the firearm was available to provide protection to the defendant in connection with his engagement in drug trafficking.\u201d <em>United States v. Ivy, </em>973 F.2d 1184, 1189 (5th Cir.1992) (internal quotation and citation omitted). In <em>Bailey, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the \u201cuse\u201d aspect of a conviction under \u00a7 924(c) and held that such a conviction requires evidence sufficient to \u201cshow active employment of the firearm\u201d by the defendant. <em>Bailey, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 116 S.Ct. at 506. <em>Bailey </em>defined \u201cuse\u201d as including \u201cbrandishing, displaying, bartering, striking with, and most obviously, firing or attempting to fire, a firearm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 116 S.Ct. at 508. The <em>Bailey </em>Court did not alter the understanding of criminal liability for the \u201ccarry\u201d component of \u00a7 924(c). <em>United States v. Still, </em>102 F.3d 118 (5th Cir.1996), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>65 U.S.L.W. 3632 (U.S. Mar. 10, 1997) (No. 96-1440); <em>United States v. Rivas, </em>85 F.3d 193, 195 (1996), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 117 S.Ct. 593, 136 L.Ed.2d 521 (1996). Because Thompson pleaded guilty to an indictment stating that she \u201cknowingly used <em>and </em>carried a firearm\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>(emphasis added), the Government is only required to prove evidence to support one of the acts charged, <em>i.e., </em>the use prong <em>or </em>the carry prong. <em>See Turner v. United States, </em>396 U.S. 398, 420-21, 90 S.Ct. 642, 654-55, 24 L.Ed.2d 610 (1970). Thus, Thompson\u2019s conviction may stand if the \u201ccarry\u201d prong of the statute is satisfied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">The district court denied Thompson\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion based on a finding of sufficient evidence to support Thompson\u2019s conviction under the \u201ccarry\u201d prong of \u00a7 924(c). As mentioned previously, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. </em>In this case, it appears that the district court committed error by relying on the Government\u2019s synopsis of what <em>it would have produced </em>to convict Thompson had she not pleaded guilty to deny Thompson\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. The record and the Government\u2019s own recitation of facts in its brief reflect that the firearms were found in a different room than that in which Thompson was arrested and were found in bureau drawers, rather than in Thompson\u2019s possession as suggested by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Relying on these facts as presented in the record, we now consider their sufficiency to fulfill the \u201ccarry\u201d prong of \u00a7 924(e)(1). We have previously articulated the meaning of \u201ccarry\u201d in \u00a7 924(c)(1). In <em>United States v. Hall, </em>110 F.3d 1155, 1161 (5th Cir.1997), and in <em>United States v. Fike, </em>82 F.3d 1315, 1328 (5th Cir.1996), we explained that \u201ccarry\u201d in \u00a7 924(c)(1) involves moving or transporting the firearm in some fashion, or bearing the firearm upon one\u2019s person in some way. It is clear that \u201ccarry\u201d connotes more than mere possession. <em>Hall, </em>110 F.3d at 1161. In this case, the firearms were not on Thompson\u2019s person, within her reach, or even in the same room. Rather, they were stored in bureau drawers in a separate room, a factual situation vastly insufficient to support a conviction under the \u201ccarry\u201d prong of \u00a7 924(c)(1). <em>See Hall, </em>110 F.3d at 1161-62 (citing eases holding that \u201ccarry\u201d involves some dominion or control and a showing that gun was within reach and holding that there was no factual basis for plea of guilty to \u201ccarry\u201d conviction where firearm in same room as defendant but no evidence that defendant transported firearm, had it on person, or would have been able to reach firearm).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">The Government argues that even if a <em>post-Bailey </em>consideration of the factual basis for Thompson\u2019s guilty plea to the \u00a7 924(c)(1) charge reveals there to be an insufficient factual basis to sustain the conviction, as we have already found, Thompson\u2019s conviction may be sustained under the <em>Pinkerton </em>doctrine, of coconspirator liability because Thompson\u2019s coconspirator used and carried one of the described firearms in relation to the business of the drug conspiracy on an occasion prior to the search of Thompson\u2019s home. <em>See Pinkerton v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 640, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489 (1946). Under <em>Pinkerton, </em>a defendant can be held hable for the acts of a coconspirator committed in furtherance of a conspiracy, including a violation of \u00a7 924(c)(1), as long as the acts were reasonably foreseeable. <em>Pinkerton, </em>328 U.S. at 645-48, 66 S.Ct. at 1183-84; <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>105 F.3d 219, 221 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Fike, </em>82 F.3d at 1327-28 <em>(post-Bailey </em>decision utilizing <em>Pinkerton </em>theory of liability). The Government urges that we sustain Thompson\u2019s conviction under a <em>Pinkerton </em>theory of liability. We cannot. It may be that Thompson can be held hable for her eo-eonspirator\u2019s actions to support her conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1), however, there is no factual basis in this record on which to do so. Before accepting a guilty plea, a district court must determine if there is an adequate factual basis to support the plea. Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(f); <em>see also Hall, </em>110 F.3d 1155; <em>United States v. Briggs, </em>920 F.2d 287, 293 (5th Cir.1991). Because there is no fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>tual basis in this record to support a <em>Pinkerton </em>theory of liability for Thompson\u2019s conviction, we cannot sustain the conviction on such a basis. <em>See United States v. Oberski, </em>734 F.2d 1030, 1031 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that there is not a factual basis for Thompson\u2019s plea of guilty to the use and carrying of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). When a plea has been accepted in violation of Rule 11(f), our practice is to reverse, vacate and remand for entry of a new plea. <em>Hall, </em>110 F.3d at 1162. Accordingly, Thompson\u2019s conviction and sentence with respect to the use and carrying of a firearm are REVERSED and VACATED, and this case is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-11\">. The AEDPA also added a requirement for petitioners seeking to file successive \u00a7 2255 motions. Under amended \u00a7 2255, a petitioner seeking to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 petition must apply for leave to do so from this court in the form of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3) motion. <em>See Liviano v. United States, </em>95 F.3d 119, 122 (2d Cir.1996). A second or successive \u00a7 2255 petition must be certified as provided in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 by a panel of this court to contain either newly discovered evidence or \"a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (as amended by the AEDPA). Because Thompson filed the instant successive \u00a7 2255 motion and notice of appeal from final judgment prior to the AEDPA\u2019s enactment, no such order was required. <em>See Rocha, </em>109F.3d225.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b387-6\">.
