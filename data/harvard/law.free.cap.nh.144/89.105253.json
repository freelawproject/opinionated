We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In July 1996, department of labor officials visited the petitioner\u2019s establishment. After interviews with employees and inspection of employee records, the department in October 1996 cited the petitioner for violations of, <em>inter alia, </em>RSA 276-A:4 and proposed a civil fine. The petitioner requested a formal hearing, arguing that a one-year statute of limitations, <em>see </em>RSA 276-A:9 (1987), had run on the alleged violations of RSA 276-A:4. After a hearing, the department in February 1997 rejected the petitioner\u2019s argument that the administrative proceeding was time-barred. The petitioner then appealed to the penalty appeal board, which upheld the department\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">We will uphold the penalty appeal board\u2019s decision unless \u201cthe substantial rights of the appellant [have] been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, or conclusions are\u201d unconstitutional, unlawful, or clearly erroneous. RSA 273:ll-d, IV (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The sole issue before us is whether the one-year statute of limitations under RSA 276-A:9 barred the department\u2019s assessment of civil penalties for violations occurring beyond the one-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">RSA 276-A:9 provides: \u201cNo prosecution pursuant to this chapter shall be undertaken later than one year after the violation has been committed.\u201d Neither party disputes that the violations supporting the civil penalties at issue occurred over one year prior to the commencement of agency proceedings against the petitioner. The question is whether the department\u2019s assessment of civil penalties constitutes \u201cprosecution,\u201d and is thus barred, under RSA 276-A:9.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">In statutory interpretation, \u201cthis court is the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of a statute considered as a whole.\u201d <em>K &amp; J Assoc. v. City of Lebanon, </em>142 N.H. 331, 333, 703 A.2d 253, 254 (1997) (quotation omitted). We look first at the statutory language, construing its plain and ordinary meaning if possible. <em>N.H. Div. of Human Services v. Hahn, </em>133 N.H. 776, 778, 584 A.2d 775, 776 (1990). If the language is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, we will resolve the ambiguity by determining the legislature\u2019s intent in light of legislative history. <em>Nashua Y.W.C.A. v. State, </em>134 N.H. 681, 682-83, 597 A.2d 535, 536 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">\u201cProsecution\u201d is not defined under the statute. <em>See </em>RSA 276-A:3 (1987). Given its plain and ordinary meaning, however, \u201cprosecution\u201d can refer to either a criminal or civil action, or both. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>BLACK\u2019S Law Dictionary 1221 (6th ed. 1990). In its broadest sense, \u201c[p]rosecution . . . means to follow up or carry forward a judicial action, be it civil or criminal, from its beginning to its final determination.\u201d <em>Oliveira v. Santosuosso, </em>230 A.2d 864, 866 (R.I. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The State argues that under RSA chapter 276-A, the term refers exclusively to criminal proceedings. Because \u201cprosecution\u201d is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, we proceed to examine legislative intent. Prior to the enactment of chapter 276-A, the employment of minors was governed by chapter 276. <em>See </em>RSA ch. 276 (1955). Violations of the statute were criminal offenses, <em>see </em>RSA 276:21 (1955); <em>State v. Richardson, </em>92 N.H. 178, 179, 27 A.2d 94, 96 (1942) (decided under prior law), for which \u201c[n]o prosecution [was to be] sustained unless begun within one year after the offense [was] committed,\u201d RSA 276:31 (1955). Chapter 276 was repealed and replaced by chapter 276-A in 1969. <em>See </em>Laws 1969, ch. 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">In its original form, chapter 276-A retained the penalties provided by chapter 276 and the one-year statute of limitations for prosecutions. <em>See </em>Laws 1969, 243:1. The legislature subsequently amended the penalties section, replacing the provision of specific punishments with the express designation of violations as misdemeanors or felonies. <em>See </em>Laws 1973, 528:171. The one-year limitations period remained the same. The legislature did not provide for civil penalties until 1989 when it amended RSA 276-A:5 and added RSA 276-A:7-a. <em>See </em>Laws 1989, 385:4, :5. Neither at that time nor at any time since has the legislature changed the limitations provision. <em>See </em>Laws 1989, ch. 385; RSA 276-A:9.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">\u201cA law means what it meant to its framers and its mere repassage does not alter that meaning.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>92 N.H. at 181, 27 A.2d at 97 (citations omitted). Legislative history shows that from its inception, chapter 276-A contemplated only criminal prosecutions. The addition of civil penalties to chapter 276-A, with no change in the language governing the statute of limitations, did not expand the original meaning of \u201cprosecution\u201d to encompass civil proceedings. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 180-81, 27 A.2d at 97. Hence, we hold that the one-year limitations period under RSA 276-A:9 applies only to criminal actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The petitioner argues that our interpretation would leave civil actions under RSA chapter 276-A perpetually subject to prosecution. We disagree. Where no statutory time limitations apply to an administrative proceeding, whether an action is barred by time depends on the equitable doctrine of laches. <em>Appeal of Plantier, </em>126 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>N.H. 500, 504-05, 494 A.2d 270, 272 (1985); <em>see also Sahu v. Iowa Bd. of Medical Examiners, </em>537 N.W.2d 674, 676 (Iowa 1995) (general statute of limitations inapplicable to administrative proceedings protecting public interest). \u201cThe party asserting laches bears the burden of proving both that the delay was unreasonable and that prejudice resulted from the delay.\u201d <em>Plantier, </em>126 N.H. at 505, 494 A.2d at 272 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Even if the sounder policy would be to apply the same limitations period to both civil and criminal prosecutions under RSA chapter 276-A, \u201c[i]t is not the function of the judiciary to provide for present needs by an extension of past legislation.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>92 N.H. at 180, 27 A.2d at 97. Having considered the petitioner\u2019s remaining arguments, we find them meritless and warranting no further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b116-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
