The defendant contends that the Superior Court <em>(Gray, </em>J.) erred by: (1) admitting evidence of other bad acts while excluding evidence that the defendant had been acquitted \u25a0 of committing those acts; and (2) allowing a therapist to testify to multiple incidents of abuse. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The following facts were adduced at trial. The defendant\u2019s daughter, the victim, was in first grade when she lived with the defendant in Portsmouth. While in Portsmouth, the victim performed fellatio on her father. The defendant told her that he would go to jail if she told anyone about this incident. Soon after, the family moved to Maine. In 1995, the victim informed her mother about the assault that had occurred in Portsmouth. Before the defendant was tried for the Portsmouth assault, he was charged with and tried for sexual assaults against his daughter that allegedly occurred in Maine. He was acquitted of those charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial court erred in admitting evidence that the defendant had assaulted the victim in Maine while not admitting evidence that he had been acquitted of those charged acts. The defendant argues that crimes of which a defendant has been acquitted cannot be used as bad acts evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">During cross-examination of the victim, the defendant introduced a letter written by the victim to the defendant on June 8, 1995, in which the victim expressed her anger at the defendant for not supporting their family, not attending events in which she participated, and not paying for her car. The defendant then questioned the victim about the letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">Q: And would [the June 8th letter] have been an opportunity to say something to your father about this sexual abuse ten years before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">A: Yes, it could have been.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">Q: But you chose not to say anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-11\">A: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-12\">Q: And you never said anything to your father [about the abuse], either in writing or in person, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-13\">A: Right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-14\">At the end of cross-examination, a bench conference was held on whether the defendant opened the door to other allegations of sexual assault by introducing the June 8th letter into evidence. On redirect, the State had the victim read a portion of the June 8th letter that said, \u201cEven when we were a family, you treated me with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>no respect at all. You didn\u2019t treat me like a daughter, you treated me like <em>something </em>else, and I think you know what that is. I will never forget that. You don\u2019t know how wounded I am because of it.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The State, without objection, questioned the victim regarding the June 8th letter.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">Q: Okay. Now, what did you mean by that when you said, \u201cYou treated me like something else\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">A: I meant he treated me like a sex object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">Q: Now, on what basis did you say that to him. Was it solely what you\u2019ve told the jury so far today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">A: I\u2019m sorry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">Q: [W]hy do you say in thinking to yourself that he was treating you like a sex object?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-10\">A: Because that\u2019s what he was doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-11\">Q: Okay. Now, you told the jury about what happened in Portsmouth so far today, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-12\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-13\">Q: Was there any other reason why you felt this way about your father?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-14\">A: Yes, [because] he did it many, many, many times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-15\">Q: Okay. Now that we\u2019ve got \u2014 we\u2019re going into this letter, how many times would you say your father had you perform fellatio?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-16\">A: I can\u2019t count that high.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-17\">Q: Okay. When you were in Portsmouth, do you know how many times, about how many times it happened in Portsmouth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-18\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-19\">Q: Where did you move after Portsmouth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-20\">A: Auburn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-21\">Q: Okay. Auburn, Maine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-22\">A: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-23\">Q: And when you were in Auburn, Maine, did this ever happen in Auburn, Maine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-24\">A: Yes, it did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-25\">Q: Okay. And by this, what \u2014 what do you mean? What happened in Auburn, Maine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-26\">A: Performed sexual acts on my father, oral sex.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-27\">The defendant objected at this point, stating that the defendant had been acquitted of these acts in Maine. The State explained that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>testimony was offered only to explain a passage in <em>the </em>letter that the defendant had introduced. The court allowed the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Assuming, without deciding, that the defendant did not open the door to the allegations of abuse in Maine by introducing the letter, we find that the admission of this testimony was harmless error given the victim\u2019s other testimony to which the defendant did not object. See <em>State v. Thibedau, </em>142 N.H. 325, 328-29, 702 A.2d 299, 300-01 (1997).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">The State bears the burden of proving that an error is harmless, a burden satisfied by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the erroneously admitted evidence did not affect the verdict. In deciding whether the State has met its burden, we consider the strength of the alternative evidence presented at trial. We also consider the character of the inadmissible evidence, including whether the evidence was cumulative or inconsequential in relation to the State\u2019s evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 329, 702 A.2d at 301 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">The victim testified without objection that her father treated her like a sex object and had her perform fellatio many times not only in Portsmouth but also in Maine. The defendant\u2019s objection came after all of this testimony. We, therefore, find that the State has demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the evidence, if incorrectly admitted, was cumulative and any error is harmless. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">The defendant also alleges that the trial court erred in not admitting evidence of the acquittal of the Maine acts. The State alleges that this argument has not been preserved for appellate review. We agree. The defendant asked the victim on recross examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-10\">Q: [Yjou\u2019re telling the jury that there were accusations in Maine, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-11\">A: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-12\">Q: Do you want to tell the jury what happened to those accusations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-13\">The Court: Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-14\">[State]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-15\">(BEGIN BENCH CONFERENCE)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-16\">The Court: I kind of hoped you\u2019d know better, but this jury is not going to hear anything about Maine accusations or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>the result of Maine accusations. They came out to explain what she meant \u2014 her story as to what she meant in the letter, but you\u2019re not going to introduce a court result in Maine in an attempt to show this jury that they should do the same thing. Only you\u2019ve gone too far already. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">[Defense Counsel]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">(END OF BENCH CONFERENCE)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">[Defense Counsel]: I\u2019ll withdraw the question, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">The Court: The jury will disregard the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">(Pause)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-10\">[Defense Counsel]: I have no further questions, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">By withdrawing the question, the defendant has waived his argument that his acquittal of the Maine charges was admissible. We therefore find that this issue was not preserved for our review. <em>Cf. Hudon v. City of Manchester, </em>141 N.H. 420, 422, 686 A.2d 306, 307 (1996) (agreement by plaintiffs that claims against two defendants could be dismissed waives plaintiffs\u2019 ability to attack court\u2019s order granting motion to dismiss); <em>State v. Newcomb, </em>140 N.H. 72, 81-82, 663 A.2d 613, 619 (1995) (issue not preserved where defendant withdrew request for relief from counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness depriving court of the opportunity to rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">Finally, the defendant contends that the trial court erred in allowing the victim\u2019s social worker to testify that the victim was abused by her father until she was thirteen years old. The State again contends that this issue has not been preserved for our review. We again agree. On redirect, the State asked the social worker:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-13\">Q: Okay. Now, you were asked about her disclosing a history of sexual abuse on direct examination. Did she tell you how long that abuse lasted until, how old she was when that abuse ended?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-14\">A: She did tell me that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-15\">Q: And how old was it she told you \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAz\">[Defense Counsel]: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-17\">Q: \u2014 that the abuse ended?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-18\">The Court: Just a moment. Basis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-19\">[Defense Counsel]: Well, it\u2019s \u2014 this is not alleged in the indictment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-20\">The defendant\u2019s objection put the court on notice that the State was, in the defendant\u2019s mind, trying to put before the jury crimes not alleged in the indictment. The argument presented in the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>dant\u2019s brief and at oral argument, however, is that the door to other allegations of sexual abuse, as was alleged by the State at trial, was not opened by defense counsel\u2019s question to the therapist about the victim\u2019s \u201chistory of abuse.\u201d This objection to the therapist\u2019s testimony was not clearly presented to the trial court, <em>see State v. Seymour, </em>142 N.H. 620, 625-26, 707 A.2d 130, 133 (1998), and therefore was not preserved for our review, <em>State v. Sullivan, </em>142 N.H. 399, 403, 702 A.2d 339, 342 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b462-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
