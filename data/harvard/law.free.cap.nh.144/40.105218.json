We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">The parties submitted an agreed statement of facts. The plaintiff owns commercial real estate in Bedford. In April 1996, the plaintiff learned that a toilet installed by one of its tenants had malfunctioned. As a result of the toilet \u201csticking,\u201d excess water had drained into the septic system causing the septic tank to become overloaded and a leach field to fail. During one fifteen-hour period, 5,000 gallons drained into the system, more than four times the system\u2019s capacity. The situation continued for at least fourteen days, causing the plaintiff to incur various expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">On April 29, the plaintiff notified the defendant of the loss. The defendant subsequently notified the plaintiff that its loss was not covered under the terms of the insurance policy. The plaintiff then sued the tenant that had installed the toilet and filed a petition for declaratory judgment against the defendant seeking coverage under the policy. <em>See </em>RSA 491:22 (1983 &amp; Supp. 1996) (amended 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-13\">The trial court concluded that a specific exclusion in the policy applied. That exclusion states: \u201cWe will not pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from . . . [continuous or repeated seepage or leakage of water that occurs over a period of 14 days or more . . . .\u201d The trial court found the exclusion to be clear and unambiguous and that the plaintiff\u2019s damages were caused by \u201cleakage\u201d that continued for more than fourteen days.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-14\">On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in interpreting the cause of the damages to constitute \u201cleakage.\u201d \u201cLeakage,\u201d according to the plaintiff, cannot fairly be interpreted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>include \u201can excessive overload of liquid into the system due to plumbing fixture malfunction.\u201d Rather, the plaintiff asserts that an ordinarily intelligent insured would understand the term to imply a low volume movement of water. The defendant counters that \u201cleakage\u201d unambiguously refers to anything that escapes through some opening accidentally, regardless of how much of the substance \u201cflows\u201d through the opening.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\u201cThe interpretation of insurance policy language is ultimately a question of law for this court to decide.\u201d <em>Calabraro v. Metropolitan Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>142 N.H. 308, 310, 702 A.2d 310, 312 (1997) (quotation omitted). In interpreting an insurance policy, \u201cwe take the plain and ordinary meaning of the policy\u2019s words in context, and we construe the terms of the policy as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based on more than a casual reading of the policy as a whole.\u201d <em>Deyette v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>142 N.H. 560, 561, 703 A.2d 661, 662 (1997) (quotation and brackets omitted). If more than one reasonable interpretation is possible, and an interpretation provides coverage, the policy contains an ambiguity and will be construed against the insurer. <em>See High Country Assocs. v. N.H. Ins. Co., </em>139 N.H. 39, 41, 648 A.2d 474, 476 (1994). We will not, however, \u201cperform amazing feats of linguistic gymnastics\u201d to find a term ambiguous. <em>Hudson v. Farm Family Mut. Ins. Co., </em>142 N.H. 144, 147, 697 A.2d 501, 503 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">An examination of the definition of \u201cleakage\u201d certainly supports the defendant\u2019s interpretation. <em>See </em>WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 1285 (unabridged ed. 1961) (defining \u201cleakage\u201d as \u201cthe act ... of leaking\u201d and \u201cleak\u201d as \u201cto enter or escape through a hole, crevice, or other opening [usually] by a fault or mistake\u201d). Reading the exclusion in the context of the policy as a whole, however, we conclude that a reasonable person in the position of the insured could interpret the exclusion as does the plaintiff. In particular, we note that the exclusion immediately following the exclusion at issue in this case denies coverage in certain circumstances for damages caused by \u201c[w]ater . . . that <em>leaks or flows </em>from plumbing . . . caused by or resulting from freezing.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The common meaning of \u201cflow\u201d is \u201cto issue in a stream: GUSH, SPRING, WELL.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 875. This implies precisely the constant movement of water in a high volume through the septic system that occurred in this case. Because the term \u201cflows\u201d is used disjunctively with \u201cleaks\u201d in the later exclusion, a reasonable person in the position of the insured could understand the term \u201cleak\u201d to connote a low volume movement, and thus the term \u201cleakage,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>viewed in the context of the entire policy, to mean water that escaped in a low volume. Moreover, at least one other court has interpreted the phrase \u201cleakage or seepage of water\u201d in an insurance policy exclusion to connote \u201ca gradual and slow moving event.\u201d <em>Primm v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>426 So. 2d 356, 360 (La. Ct. App. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the term \u201cleakage\u201d as used in the policy \u201cis, at the very least, not so clear as to create no ambiguity which might affect the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>142 N.H. at 149, 697 A.2d at 504 (quotation omitted). Although the defendant could have defined \u201cleakage\u201d in the policy, it chose not to do so, and as such we construe the provision against the defendant. <em>See Weaver v. Royal Ins. Co. of America, </em>140 N.H. 780, 783, 674 A.2d 975, 978 (1996). Because the defendant concedes that what occurred in this case did not constitute \u201cseepage,\u201d we reverse the order of the trial court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">We decline to address the defendant\u2019s argument that an additional provision of the policy precludes coverage in this case. The trial court addressed that provision and ruled that it did not preclude coverage. Because the defendant neither cross-appealed the trial court\u2019s order on this issue nor moved to add the question on appeal, the issue is not properly before us. <em>See Concord Hosp. v. N.H. Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Assoc., </em>137 N.H. 680, 686, 633 A.2d 1384, 1388 (1993); <em>but see </em>SUP. CT. R. 16(3)(b) (amended May 6, 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Finally, we decline the plaintiff\u2019s invitation to rule on whether it is entitled to recover from the defendant attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the liability action against its tenant. <em>Cf. </em>RSA 491:22-b (1997) (authorizing attorney\u2019s fees in a declaratory judgment action to determine coverage under an insurance policy when the insured party prevails). As the defendant correctly points out, the trial court has not addressed the issue of attorney\u2019s fees, and we decline to do so for the first time on appeal. <em>Cf. High Country Assocs., </em>139 N.H. at 45, 648 A.2d at 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b67-9\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
