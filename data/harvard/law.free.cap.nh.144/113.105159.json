The defendant appeals, arguing that the trial court denied his right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>to a trial by jury by answering an ambiguous question from the jury without seeking clarification or, in the alternative, by improperly instructing the jury in response to its question. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The defendant was indicted for murdering his parents with his younger brother. During deliberations, the jury sent out the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">If an individual juror, when considering evidence, speculates [the defendant] may not have been involved and further this juror provides other possible scenarios conforming to the evidence as that juror sees it, does this constitute reasonable doubt?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The trial court answered the question as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-8\">Each individual juror is required to follow the court\u2019s instructions in their entirety. Any conclusions you reach must be based on the evidence introduced at trial, not on guesswork or speculation. You should rely on all the evidence and the reasonable inferences from that evidence. \u201cInferences\u201d are conclusions which reason and common sense lead you to draw from the facts that are proven to your satisfaction. A doubt based on reason, is a reasonable doubt. A doubt based on speculation is not a doubt based on reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the jury question was ambiguous and that the trial court should have either engaged in further dialogue with the jury to ascertain its specific meaning, or referred them to the instructions already given. He alleges that by failing to ascertain the meaning of the jury\u2019s question, the trial court could not have responded in a concrete and unambiguous manner. The defendant contends that this created a risk that the court\u2019s answer violated his right to a trial by jury under Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Because \u201cthe constitutional dimension of the defendant\u2019s argument was not called to the trial court\u2019s attention, nor . . . raised in the notice of appeal[,] . . . we . . . consider his argument under an abuse of discretion standard . . . .\u201d <em>State v. Plante, </em>134 N.H. 456, 459, 594 A.2d 1279, 1282 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">The defendant contends that the trial court erred when it concluded that the word \u201cspeculates\u201d in the question meant the jury was asking, \u201c[C]an we speculate and conclude that that\u2019s reasonable doubt?\u201d He argues that the question could be interpreted several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>ways and, therefore, was ambiguous. We disagree. The question from the jury was not ambiguous and the trial court\u2019s instruction responding to it was, under the circumstances, appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\">\u201cThe response to a jury question is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Hammell, </em>189 N.H. 404, 406, 653 A.2d 1122, 1123 (1995). \u201cThe instruction must be judged as a reasonable juror would probably have understood it and the defendant\u2019s position must be evaluated in the context of the whole charge and in light of all the evidence in the case.\u201d <em>State v. Prisby, </em>131 N.H. 57, 59, 550 A.2d 89, 90 (1988) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion. The court\u2019s answer distinguished impermissible \u201cguesswork or speculation\u201d from permissible \u201cinferences\u201d that reason and common sense allow a juror to draw from the facts. The answer stated that a doubt is reasonable if it is based on \u201cinferences\u201d from the evidence and not \u201cspeculation.\u201d A reasonable juror would have understood the court\u2019s answer to indicate that inferences based on the evidence are permissible, while naked speculation is impermissible. Finding no error in the trial court\u2019s answer to the jury\u2019s question, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b139-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
