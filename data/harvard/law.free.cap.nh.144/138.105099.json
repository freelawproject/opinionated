This court referred the matter to a Judicial Referee <em>(Temple, </em>J.). After a hearing, the referee recommended that the petition against the respondent be dismissed. The committee objects to the referee\u2019s recommendation. We agree with the referee and dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>In professional conduct matters, although we defer to the referee\u2019s factual findings if supported by the record, see <em>Wehringer\u2019s Case, </em>130 N.H. 707, 716, 547 A.2d 252, 257 (1988), we retain the ultimate authority to determine whether, on the facts found, a violation of the rules governing attorney conduct has occurred and, if so, the appropriate sanction. <em>See Wood\u2019s Case, </em>137 N.H. 698, 701, 634 A.2d 1340, 1342 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">The record in this case supports the findings of the referee that the respondent was acting in an individual capacity rather than in a lawyer-client relationship and that she did not engage in any intentional misrepresentation which would subject an attorney to discipline when acting in a personal capacity. We uphold the referee\u2019s determination that no violation of New Hampshire Rule of Professional Conduct (Rule) 3.4 occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The referee\u2019s finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that the respondent, under the unique circumstances of this case, did not violate Rule 8.4(c) by recording a telephone conversation is also supported in the record. Therefore, we adopt the referee\u2019s findings and dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b163-7\">THAYER, HORTON, and BRODERICK, JJ., did not sit; BATCHELDER, J., retired, participated by special assignment under RSA 490:3; all who participated concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
