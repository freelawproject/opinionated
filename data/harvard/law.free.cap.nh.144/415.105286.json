Gould, was charged with four counts of felonious sexual assault. RSA 632-A:3, III (1996). At trial, the Superior Court <em>(Gray, </em>J.) granted the State\u2019s mistrial motion after the defendant made a remark that the court found to be a deliberate attempt to influence the jury. Prior to the defendant\u2019s retrial, the superior court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, ruling that the double jeopardy provisions of the Federal and State Constitutions did not bar a second trial. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>The defendant\u2019s trial for felonious sexual assault began on January 6, 1997. As the defendant approached the witness stand to testify the following day, the trial judge heard him say, \u201cIt\u2019s about time!\u201d The judge immediately excused the jury and expressed his belief that the defendant \u201cdeliberately waited until [he] got right in front of the jury before [he] made that comment in a deliberate attempt to influence the jury.\u201d After asking the prosecutor if he wanted a mistrial, the judge reprimanded the defendant and informed his counsel that he would be charged with contempt if he did not control his client. Thereafter, the court recessed to determine if the jury heard the defendant\u2019s remark. After a six-minute recess, the judge announced that the jury had, in fact, heard the defendant. He reiterated his opinion that the defendant\u2019s behavior was intended to prejudice the jury and, in response to the State\u2019s motion, granted a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">On appeal, the defendant argues that because \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d did not exist, the trial court abused its discretion in declaring a mistrial. He asserts that a retrial would violate the double jeopardy provisions of the New Hampshire and United States Constitutions, which forbid placing a person twice in jeopardy for the same offense. N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 16.; U.S. CONST, amend. <em>Y.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\"> We first analyze the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim under the New Hampshire Constitution, <em>see State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231, 471 A.2d 347, 350-51 (1983), and use federal law only as a guide to our analysis. <em>See State v. Paquin, </em>140 N.H. 525, 527, 668 A.2d 47, 49 (1995). We confine our double jeopardy analysis to the State Constitution because the United States Constitution affords the defendant no greater protection. <em>See State v. Ringuette, </em>142 N.H. 163, 165, 697 A.2d 507, 509 (1997). The Double Jeopardy Clause of the New Hampshire Constitution as interpreted by this court provides that a defendant may not be twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense. <em>See id. </em>Because a defendant is put in jeopardy at the moment a jury is empaneled and sworn, <em>see id., </em>the constitution recognizes the defendant\u2019s \u2018\u201cvalued right\u2019 to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.\u201d <em>State v. Bertrand, </em>133 N.H. 843, 853, 587 A.2d 1219, 1225 (1991). When this \u201cvalued right\u201d is frustrated by the declaration of a mistrial without the defendant\u2019s consent, the prosecution must demonstrate that the mistrial was justified by \u201cmanifest necessity.\u201d <em>See Brady v. Samaha, </em>667 F.2d 224, 228 (1st Cir. 1981). Absent such proof, a retrial is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The power to declare a mistrial without the defendant\u2019s consent should be exercised only \u201cwith the greatest caution, under urgent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes.\u201d <em>Bertrand, </em>133 N.H. at 853, 587 A.2d at 1226 (quotation omitted). Although a high degree of necessity is required before a mistrial is declared, \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d is a variable standard which cannot be applied mechanically. <em>See id. </em>at 853, 587 A.2d at 1225.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Although we generally defer to a trial court\u2019s discretion in declaring a mistrial, especially where the defendant\u2019s conduct triggered its declaration, <em>see Pleas v. State, </em>495 S.E.2d 4, 6 (Ga. 1998)(\u201cthe trial court ... is especially empowered to avoid the absurdity of a defendant benefitting from the prejudicial error he created\u201d), it is our duty to ensure that the \u201cscrupulous exercise of judicial discretion led to the decision.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>667 F.2d at 229 (quotations omitted). Whether the trial court allowed counsel to comment on a proposed mistrial, considered other alternatives, or made a decision without sufficient reflection are all important factors to be considered. <em>See United States v. Simonetti, </em>998 F.2d 39, 41 (1st Cir. 1993). Failure of a trial court to exercise such prudence may reflect an inadequate concern for a defendant\u2019s constitutional protections, and therefore diminish the deference otherwise due the trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>See Brady, </em>667 F.2d at 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">In this case, we are unable to determine whether the trial court exercised the requisite discretion so essential to a mistrial order. <em>See id. </em>It is undisputed that the court terminated the trial very quickly, failed to discuss lesser sanctions with counsel, and took little time for reflection. While the trial court was appropriately irritated with the defendant\u2019s intemperate remark, this alone cannot justify the infringement of a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a trial before the sworn tribunal. <em>See Simonetti, </em>998 F.2d at 41. Although the trial court spoke with the jury, its colloquy was off the record. We do not know what the jury was asked nor how it responded. Whether a curative instruction would have been sufficient to remedy any perceived prejudice or whether it was ever considered is unknown. Accordingly, we owe no particular deference to the trial court\u2019s mistrial order, and review the record de novo to determine whether, on its face, the defendant\u2019s conduct created the requisite manifest necessity to justify a mistrial. <em>See Brady, </em>667 F.2d at 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Although the trial court viewed the defendant\u2019s remark as a deliberate attempt to influence the jury, we are not persuaded that his words were inherently prejudicial. The defendant\u2019s comment is capable of more than one interpretation. He could have been expressing frustration as a result of waiting a day to testify, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>commenting on the credibility of those who had testified before him, or vouching for his own credibility. We cannot conclude, however, that the defendant\u2019s remark, although inappropriate, left the trial court with no meaningful choice other than a mistrial. <em>See Paquin, </em>140 N.H. at 529, 668 A.2d at 50 (trial court should ascertain and consider whether the jury was prejudiced by conduct that is insufficient as a matter of law to justify a mistrial). The trial court is obliged to ensure that the jury has in fact been prejudiced, <em>see id. </em>at 528, 668 A.2d at 50, and to exhaust all reasonable alternatives to remove any jury taint before declaring a mistrial. <em>See State v. Pugliese, </em>120 N.H. 728, 730, 422 A.2d 1319, 1321 (1980). On the record before us we cannot state that this occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">At best, the record reflects a defendant intent on causing a mistrial but does not contain evidence of \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d so essential to its declaration. We discern no circumstance on the face of the record supporting a mistrial and find no record evidence of actual prejudice. Because the record is silent on the jury\u2019s reaction to the defendant\u2019s remark and contains no explanation from the trial court as to why or whether lesser sanctions would have been ineffective, we are left to speculate whether manifest necessity existed. We cannot let a mistrial stand where its justification is neither obvious nor supported by record evidence of actual, incurable prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">While we appreciate that \u201ca criminal trial is, even in the best of circumstances, a complicated affair to manage,\u201d <em>United States v. Jorn, </em>400 U.S. 470, 479 (1971), a mistrial is of such gravity and implicates such a fundamental constitutional right that we will defer to a trial court\u2019s finding of manifest necessity only where the record affirmatively supports it. Because it is uncertain whether the trial court exercised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial and the record does not independently support it, the trial court\u2019s order cannot stand. <em>See Paquin, </em>140 N.H. at 529, 668 A.2d at 50 (jury foreperson taking notes in violation of instructions was not manifest necessity); <em>Pugliese, </em>120 N.H. at 730, 422 A.2d at 1321 (where jury considered manslaughter and lesser-included offense of negligent homicide, hung jury not manifest necessity requiring mistrial before inquiring whether jury had reached verdict on greater offense of manslaughter).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Finally, in accordance with our general superintendence power under RSA 490:4 and Part II, Article 73(a) of the New Hampshire Constitution, <em>see Opinion of the Justices (Judicial Salary Suspen: sion), </em>140 N.H. 297, 300, 666 A.2d 523, 525 (1995), we direct that, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>the future, all communications between the trial court and jury before the jury is excused occur on the record. <em>Cf. State v. Alexander, </em>143 N.H. 216, 227, 723 A.2d 22, 30 (1998) (directing that no face-to-face communications between the judge and jury prior to the verdict occur in the jury room absent extraordinary circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b443-5\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
