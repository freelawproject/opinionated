It is further provided that when benefits are payable by the injured person\u2019s insurer and would also be payable under the policy of the person\u2019s spouse or a relative, the injured person\u2019s insurer shall pay all the benefits and \"shall not be entitled to recoupment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the other insurer.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-3\">The act does not, however, expressly provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>whether, when an injured person is not \"named\u201d in a policy of no-fault insurance, but is covered pursuant to the no-fault act under both a spouse\u2019s policy and a policy of a relative, both insurers are in the same order of priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Allstate Insurance Company contends that the insurer of a spouse is in a higher order of priority than the insurer of a relative because in the phrase, \"the person named in the policy, the person\u2019s spouse, and a relative of either domiciled in the same household,\u201d \"spouse\u201d appears before \"relative,\u201d and because such a construction of the act would eliminate the sometimes difficult factual question whether a person is \"domiciled in the same household\u201d of a relative and facilitate thereby the administration of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The Court of Appeals, in <em>Martin v DAIIE, </em>135 Mich App 588; 354 NW2d 267 (1983), where, as here, the injured person did not have a no-fault policy, was separated from her husband and was living with her mother at the time of the accident, held that the insurer of the spouse was in a higher order of priority and was required to pay the full no-fault benefits without recoupment from the insurer of the mother.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">In the instant case, the Court of Appeals considered, but rejected, the reasoning of <em>Martin </em>and held that there should be recoupment. The Court certified the question for conflicts resolution pursuant to Administrative Order No. 1984-2, 418 Mich lxxxii (1984). We agree with the Court of Appeals in the instant case and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The no-fault act provides with considerable precision for priorities between insurers. A person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>injured<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in a motor vehicle \"operated in the business of transporting passengers,\u201d except as delineated in the act, shall receive benefits from the insurer of that vehicle. A person injured in his employer\u2019s motor vehicle shall receive benefits from the insurer of the employer\u2019s vehicle.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Both such insurers are in a higher order of priority than an insurer of the injured person\u2019s vehicle, his spouse\u2019s vehicle, or a relative\u2019s vehicle.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If no such coverage applies, a person suffering injury shall recover no-fault benefits from the \"insurer of the owner or registrant of the vehicle occupied\u201d by the injured person or, where not an occupant, the \"insurers of owners or registrants of motor vehicles involved in the accident.\u201d Last in the \"order of priority\u201d stated in the act is the insurer of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>operator of \"the vehicle occupied,\u201d or, as the case may be, \"involved in the accident.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">As previously noted, the Legislature carefully spelled out the order of priority between the insurer of the injured person\u2019s vehicle, on the one hand, and an insurer of a spouse\u2019s or relative\u2019s vehicle, on the other. There is nothing that would indicate that, in providing for coverage by insurers of a spouse\u2019s or relative\u2019s vehicle, the Legislature intended also to provide an order of priority between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Martin </em>ignored the provision of the act establishing that the insurer of the person named in the policy is in a higher order of priority than an insurer of a spouse or relative and the implication from that provision that no order of priority was established between an insurer of a spouse or relative. Treating the order in which the insurers are identified for coverage as also establishing an order of priority would render superfluous that provision establishing the insurer of the person named in the policy as primary.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">While the issue of domicile may in some cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>be, as Allstate argues, troublesome,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> in other cases it will be as clear or almost as clear as who is a spouse or relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\">Some might agree with the Court of Appeals in <em>Martin </em>that \"a spouse is a more natural and logical source of benefits under the no-fault insurance statute than any other relative of the injured party with whom the injured party is living at the time of the accident.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Legislature did not, however, so provide and we find no basis for concluding that it so intended. In this connection, we observe that some might believe that when spouses are separated the goal of prompt compensation of injured persons is better served by subjecting to liability both the spouse\u2019s insurer and the insurer of a relative in whose household the spouse is domiciled with a right of recoupment, by a no-fault insurer who paid more than its share, to accomplish equitable distribution of the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">In sum, the Legislature carefully spelled out the order of priority of insurers. There is nothing in the structure or purpose of the act that would be defeated by a literal construction of the act. We conclude that we would not be justified in reading the phrase \"the person\u2019s spouse, and a relative of either domiciled in the same household\u201d as providing that a spouse\u2019s insurer is in a higher order of priority than a relative\u2019s insurer to eliminate the factual issue of domicile or the cost to insurers of maintaining and defending actions for recoupment where they are unable to agree on their responsibilities in a particular case._</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>We hold that an insurer of an injured person\u2019s spouse and the insurer of a relative domiciled in the same household are in the same order of priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b428-6\">Williams, C.J., and Brickley, Cavanagh, Boyle, Riley, and Archer, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b423-4\"> MCL 500.3114(1); MSA 24.13114(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-5\"> The act provides that when two or more insurers \"are in the same order of priority\u201d an insurer paying benefits is entitled to \"partial recoupment from the other insurers in the same order of priority\u201d \"to accomplish equitable distribution of the loss among\u201d such insurers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">When 2 or more insurers are in the same order of priority to provide personal protection insurance benefits an insurer paying benefits due is entitled to partial recoupment from the other insurers in the same order of priority, together with a reasonable amount of partial recoupment of the expense of processing the claim, in order to accomplish equitable distribution of the loss among such insurers.
