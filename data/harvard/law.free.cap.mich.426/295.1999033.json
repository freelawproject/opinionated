The first is whether <em>Ed Zaagman, Inc v City of Kentwood, </em>406 Mich 137; 277 NW2d 475 (1979), should be overruled or modified. The second is whether the declaratory judgment and order entered by the circuit judge pursuant to the <em>Zaagman </em>procedure, as affirmed and modified by the Court of Appeals, unconstitutionally deprived the plaintiff of his property without compensation or without due process of law. Because we answer the first question by overruling <em>Zaagman, </em>we do not find it necessary to reach the specifics of the second question, other than to hold that the relief granted in this case was improper for the same reasons that the <em>Zaagman </em>procedure is now rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"AFL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">This case traces its origins to 1967, when the plaintiff, Joseph Schwartz, requested that the City of Flint rezone his property. After nearly fifteen years of litigation, the plaintiff\u2019s land remains undeveloped.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Schwartz owns a twenty-eight acre parcel of undeveloped land in the City of Flint. Immediately west of the Schwartz parcel is Thread Lake, part of which passes through the Schwartz parcel. Approximately eleven acres of the parcel, including most of the western boundary and all the northern boundary, are located within the one-hundred-year flood plain of Thread Lake and Thread Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">The property immediately north of the Schwartz parcel is owned by the city. The property immediately east is an eleven-acre parcel that, like the Schwartz parcel, is privately owned and undeveloped. Immediately south are several subdivided residential lots containing single-family homes on the north side of Woodslea Drive, which runs roughly east and west. These homes are on the northern edge of a large residential neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">At the time Schwartz purchased the parcel in 1966, it was zoned A-2, which permitted single-family homes with minimum lot sizes of 5,000 square feet. An outlot owned by the plaintiff provides access to the property. In 1967, Schwartz requested that the parcel be rezoned from A-2 to C-l, to permit construction of multiple-family garden apartments and townhouses. In 1971, after the city denied the request to rezone, Schwartz commenced this action, seeking a declaration that the A-2 classification was unconstitutional and an order requiring the issuance of a building permit for the proposed garden apartments and townhouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">The judge, after an apparent settlement between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Schwartz and the city, declared the A-2 classification unconstitutional as applied to the Schwartz parcel. On the city\u2019s motion, however, the judgment was set aside, and several neighboring landowners were permitted to intervene.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">The city subsequently rezoned the Schwartz parcel from A-2 to A-l, which permits single-family homes with minimum lot sizes of 10,000 square feet.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge sustained the A-l classification. The Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, reversed and held the A-l classification unconstitutional as applied to the Schwartz parcel. Const 1963, art 10, \u00a72. Similarly, see US Const, Am V, applicable to the states under US Const, Am XIV, <em>Chicago, B &amp; Q R Co v Chicago, </em>166 US 226; 17 S Ct 581; 41 L Ed 979 (1897). It found that the ordinance was \"taking from plaintiffs the use of their property without just compensation . . . .\u201d <em>Schwartz v Flint, </em>92 Mich App 495, 503; 285 NW2d 344 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Pursuant to the procedure set forth in <em>Zaagman,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court of Appeals remanded the cause to the Flint City Council. The city, however, failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>submit an amendatory ordinance or other proposal to the circuit court within the sixty-day period prescribed in Zaagman.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Consistent with paragraph (v) of the <em>Zaagman </em>procedure,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the judge received proposals from both parties and conducted an evidentiary hearing for the purpose of determining \"the most equitable or 'midsatisfactory use\u2019 to be made\u201d of the Schwartz parcel._</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>The city\u2019s proposal suggested development of the parcel as a \"community development project.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under this proposal, garden apartments or townhouses might be constructed even in an A-l zoning district; density restrictions would, however, limit the total number of residential units in the development project to twenty-five percent more than the number of detached single-family homes that could be constructed in the same area on minimum lots of 10,000 square feet.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Schwartz proposed the construction of 144 single-family townhouses, divided into several clusters of attached units. With regard to access to and from the development, it appears that Schwartz proposed directing traffic away from the large residential neighborhood to the south and westerly of the parcel. Schwartz indicated that it might be possible to obtain a right-of-way across an adjoining undeveloped parcel, leaving the out-lot for emergency use only.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The order<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> entered by the judge did not adopt either the city\u2019s or Schwartz\u2019 proposal. The order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>prescribed different uses for various \"tiers\u201d of the Schwartz parcel. The first tier, consisting of approximately 3.7 acres immediately north of the single-family homes on Woodslea Drive, was restricted to single-family homes under the A-l zoning classification (10,000 square-foot minimum lots). The second tier, consisting of approximately 1.15 acres immediately north of the first tier, was restricted to \"duplexes.\u201d On the remaining property, Schwartz would be permitted to construct 120 or, depending on the flood plain level, 124 single-family attached townhouse units, provided that the total number of units on the entire parcel did not exceed 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The order also prohibited the use of the outlot as a means of access to and from the Schwartz parcel, and would require that Schwartz obtain a right-of-way over an adjoining privately owned parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The Court of Appeals modified the judge\u2019s order to permit \"detached single-family townhouses\u201d as well as \"duplexes\u201d in the second tier of the parcel; the judge\u2019s order was affirmed in all other re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>spects. <em>Schwartz v City of Flint (After Remand), </em>120 Mich App 449; 329 NW2d 26 (1982).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">After careful reconsideration of the procedure of <em>Zaagman, supra, </em>we conclude that that case should be overruled as an improper usurpation by the judiciary of a legislative function. In light of the extraordinary facts of this case and of the experience of the bench and bar, generally, under the <em>Zaagman </em>rule, we are replacing the <em>Zaagman </em>decision with a more judicially appropriate directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\"><em>Zaagman </em>was a well-intentioned effort to utilize the court\u2019s equity powers to minimize the side effects of resolving lawsuits having obvious ramifications beyond the parties to the suit. However, neither the parties nor the amici curiae<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in this case are entirely satisfied with the <em>Zaagman </em>procedure as it has been implemented to date.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The separation of powers provision of the Michigan Constitution reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-8\">The powers of the government are divided into three branches: legislative, executive and judicial. No person exercising powers of one branch shall exercise powers properly belonging to another branch except as expressly provided in this constitution. [Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">Our state system is modeled after the federal system. The United States Supreme Court described the separation of powers as follows:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>The functions of government under our system are apportioned. To the legislative department has been committed the duty of making laws; to the executive the duty of executing them; and to the judiciary the duty of interpreting and applying them in cases properly brought before the courts. The general rule is that neither department may invade the province of the other and neither may control, direct or restrain the action of the other. <em>[Massachusetts v Mellon, </em>262 US 447, 488; 43 S Ct 597; 67 L Ed 1078 (1923).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">We, too, have emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">[I]n harmony with American political theory, the State government is divided into three historic departments, the legislative, the executive, and judicial ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">\"This historical and constitutional division of the powers of government forbids the extension, otherwise than by explicit language or necessary implication, of the powers of one department to another.\u201d <em>[Civil Service Comm v Auditor General, </em>302 Mich 673, 683; 5 NW2d 536 (1942).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">Option (v) of the <em>Zaagman </em>holding permits the court, under certain conditions,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-11\">to conduct a hearing supplemented by the submission of proofs by all affected parties <em>to determine and implement </em>the most equitable or \"midsatisfactory use\u201d to be made of plaintiff\u2019s parcel. <em>[Zaagman, supra, </em>p 167. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">In addition, options (i) and (ii) require the \"chancellor\u201d to \"order the implementation of such 'mid-satisfactory\u2019 amendatory ordinance.\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 166-167.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">These directives, in the words of Justice T. G. Kavanagh, amount to \"judicial zoning.\u201d We agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>with some of his observations, made in dissent in <em>Daraban v Redford Twp, </em>383 Mich 497, 501-506; 176 NW2d 598 (1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-4\">The role of the Court is not to control the direction of zoning. It is not to determine what is the best use of the land. Our role is to prevent the abuse of the zoning power \u2014 as when the ordinance in question so restricts the use of land that it amounts to confiscation by the local government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">Zoning is a legislative function that cannot constitutionally be performed by a court, either directly or indirectly \u2014 in law or in equity. <em>[Id., </em>pp 502-503.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Justice Kavanagh\u2019s comments were in keeping with <em>pre-Zaagman </em>precedent in this Court. In <em>Roll v City of Troy, </em>370 Mich 94, 99; 120 NW2d 804 (1963), we \"recogniz[ed] that zoning is a legislative function [and] we affirm[ed] the principle that courts cannot write zoning laws.\u201d Likewise, in <em>Christine Building Co v City of Troy, </em>367 Mich 508, 515-516; 116 NW2d 816 (1962), we approved of the trial court\u2019s opinion that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">there devolved upon it no legal duty, right, or obligation to switch from the role of chancellor to that of municipal legislator for the purpose of rezoning the subject property ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">And in <em>Brae Burn, Inc v Bloomfield Hills, </em>350 Mich 425, 430-431; 86 NW2d 166 (1957), we emphasized that \"this Court does not sit as a superzoning commission. . . . The people of the community, through their appropriate legislative body, and not the courts, govern its growth and its life[,]\u201d assuming, we would now add, that that governance is performed in a constitutional manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>On the other hand, in contrast to Justice Kavanagh\u2019s view, we also recognize the judiciary\u2019s positive role in granting appropriate relief in zoning cases where unconstitutionality has been alleged and proven. We agree with the majority in <em>Zaagman, </em>pp 176-179, and with Justice Black\u2019s opinion in <em>Dequindre Development Co v Warren Charter Twp, </em>359 Mich 634, 642-643; 103 NW2d 600 (1960), to the extent that they express the need for courts to exercise their equitable powers in order to fashion sufficient remedies for successful plaintiffs, while doing so expediently and within the constraints of the separation of powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Thus, while we reaffirm and endorse the judicial role in declaring the unconstitutionality of zoning ordinances generally, see <em>Delta Charter Twp v Dinolfo, </em>419 Mich 253, 268-269; 351 NW2d 831 (1984), we believe that the <em>Zaagman </em>decision simply went too far in its effort to guarantee a replacement for an unconstitutional ordinance. There are less extreme remedies available that are within the judicial power and that would provide adequate relief in cases such as this one. We advocate adoption of the one articulated in Part III-B.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">By overruling <em>Zaagman, </em>we bring Michigan in line with the holdings of a majority of state jurisdictions on this question. Although other states have adopted a variety of remedies in cases involving unconstitutional zoning ordinances, the majority are in agreement that courts should not attempt to perform the legislative functions of the zoning authority. See 4 Anderson, American Law of Zoning (2d ed), \u00a7 28.10, pp 378-379, n 36; 3 Rathkopf &amp; Rathkopf, Law of Zoning &amp; Planning (4th ed), \u00a7 36.01, p 36-1 (\"Most courts hold that since zoning is a legislative function, it is beyond the judicial power to determine what the restric<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>tions applicable to property should be\u201d); \u00a7 36.04, p 36-11, n 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Such rezoning by the court, has been held to be contrary to the separation of powers. See, e.g., <em>Longboat Key v Kirstein, </em>352 So 2d 924 (Fla App, 1977). In general, \"[z]oning is primarily a legislative function, subject to judicial review only to determine 'whether the power, as exercised, involves an undue invasion of private constitutional rights without a reasonable justification in relation to the public welfare.\u2019 \u201d <em>Norwood Builders v City of Des </em>Plaines, 128 Ill App 3d 908, 917; 471 NE2d 634 (1984). The Arkansas Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">[T]he Legislature gave the rezoning power to the City Council or legislative body of the City and it is not within the province of the court to rezone property. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-7\">\"Courts are not super zoning commissions and have no authority to classify property according to zones.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">. . . Placing the property in a specific zone is beyond the Court\u2019s power. <em>[Little Rock v Breeding, </em>619 SW2d 664, 672-673 (Ark, 1981).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">In New York, when ordinances have been found unconstitutional, but not discriminatory per se, \"the new zoning [must] be determined not by the court, but by the [zoning authority].\u201d <em>Stilbell Realty Corp v New York, </em>54 AD2d 962, 963; 388 NYS2d 648 (1976).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">Even among states that grant to their courts fairly broad declaratory and injunctive power in these cases, there is great reluctance to allow courts to actually zone the property in question, as judges may do under options (i) and (ii) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number><em>Zaagman </em>procedure, and as the trial judge and Court of Appeals in this case did by following option (v).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">The courts may not rezone property to specific categories upon a finding of the invalidity of a zoning ordinance. It is not the province of courts to zone or rezone, thereby substituting their judgment for that of the legislative body. <em>[Bd of Supervisors v Allman, </em>215 Va 434, 445; 211 SE2d 48 (1975).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Although the Ohio Supreme Court agreed with some of our reasoning in <em>Zaagman, </em>that court rejected a trial court\u2019s ordering of a change in a use classification applicable <em>to the </em>property in question. <em>Union Oil Co v City of Worthington, </em>62 Ohio St 2d 263, 266; 405 NE2d 277 (1980). Although it appeared that the trial court in <em>Worthington </em>had \"merely deferred to what it believed the city\u2019s wishes were[,]\u201d the Ohio Supreme Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">[nevertheless ... believe[d] the trial court exceeded its proper judicial role in zoning matters in ordering the property rezoned to a substitute zoning classification. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Commentators have also questioned the <em>Zaagman </em>rule under the separation of powers doctrine.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">The court\u2019s role is to resolve disputes, applying statutes and making new common law where no statutes exist or where the statutes fail to provide for the situation in dispute. Since zoning laws typically establish a statutory procedure for amending zoning maps and allowing for development, it can be argued that the courts should play no role in providing for the orderly and equitable development of communities. The proper role for the courts is to assure that the legislature allows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>for development without violating the constitutional rights of property owners or other citizens. The <em>Zaagman </em>process would allow the court to usurp the legislative function by ordering legislation even though the court itself has deemed such action inappropriate under the constitution. In addition, the process appears to supercede, or render ineffectual, traditional statutory rezoning procedures. Presumably, the city must follow those procedures when it implements the court\u2019s order. If so, the city must notify surrounding property owners and hold the public hearing typically required by zoning enabling acts, even though the outcome has been judicially determined in advance. The court\u2019s order thus makes a farce out of the legislatively mandated rezoning hearing. If, however, the court\u2019s order exempts the city from the required procedures, the court has even more seriously invaded the legislative sphere by judicially waiving enforcement of a valid statutory requirement. [Prahl, <em>The rezoning dilemma: What may a court do with an invalid zoning classification?, </em>25 SD L R 116, 123-124 (1980).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">See Rohan, Zoning &amp; Land Use Controls, \u00a7 52.07(2)(a), pp 52-63, 52-64; Ellmann,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>The </em>Turkish <em>rhapsody </em>\u2014 More <em>dissonance in the zoning game, </em>1983 Det C L R 1195, 1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Thus, relying on our former pronouncements on this issue, and in recognition of the reasoning of a majority of state jurisdictions as well as of the plain language of Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2, we hold that the <em>Zaagman </em>procedure impermissibly offends the separation of powers. Moreover, we find that the procedure outlined in <em>Zaagman </em>should be overruled for pragmatic reasons as well. There is simply no doubt that the procedure has resulted in excessive delay when applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">This litigation has prevented Mr. Schwartz from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>developing his property for over fifteen years. In the companion case to <em>Zaagman, Turkish v City of Warren, </em>it was eight years after rezoning proceedings had been initiated before the plaintiffs could effectively use their land. Ellmann, <em>supra, </em>p 1199, n 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The <em>Zaagman </em>procedure, even as modified by the separate opinion, perpetuates a litigation merry-go-round in zoning cases, providing no effective relief for successful plaintiffs, even while stepping outside the proper judicial role. As Justice Brennan pointed out in dissent in <em>San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co v San Diego, </em>450 US 621, 655, n 22; 101 S Ct 1287; 67 L Ed 2d 551 (1981), there is always the possibility in these cases that a municipality will \"merely amend the regulation and start over again.\u201d The <em>Zaagman </em>rule, by further lengthening the process of judicial review of a zoning ordinance challenge, does nothing to alleviate this problem, and in effect, adds to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Although the dissent\u2019s proposed rule of deference to the municipality\u2019s proposed alternative use, if reasonable, might enhance the predictability of zoning review, it does not adequately remove the judiciary from the \"zoning business.\u201d Ultimately, if the municipality\u2019s alternative use proposal were untimely or unreasonable, the dissent would continue <em>Zaagman\u2019s </em>endorsement of the courts as superzoning authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Cutting, as it does, into private property ownership, zoning is an onerous legislative task for those who must withstand the political pressures attendant to its exercise. It is no wonder, then, that in our first post <em>-Zaagman </em>experience the defendant municipality and amici curiae are urging us on with even further policy and rulemaking suggestions, little of which could not be provided for in the zoning enabling statute or by individual zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>authorities.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, our continued intrusion into this troublesome area would feed on itself, thrusting us further into this quagmire.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Even if the practice did not offend the separation of powers, the judiciary\u2019s zoning track record is not good. See, generally, Babcock, <em>The Zoning Game Revisited </em>(1985). Zoning, by its nature, is most uniquely suited to the exercise of the police power because of the value judgments that must be made regarding aesthetics, economics, transportation, health, safety, and a community\u2019s aspirations and values in general. By the same token, zoning, which requires linedrawing that oftentimes \"by its nature [is] arbitrary,\u201d <em>Dinolfo, supra, </em>p 269, is uniquely unsuited to the judicial arena.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Thus, for doctrinal and practical reasons, the procedure that we established in <em>Zaagman </em>for providing relief in zoning cases once an ordinance has been found unconstitutional is hereby repudiated and replaced with a rule that better comports with the role of the judiciary and the separation of powers doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">In the next portion of this opinion, we indicate our preference among the options presented in <em>Zaagman, supra, </em>pp 168-179, and those culled from other jurisdictions and the relevant literature. Relying somewhat on the experience and suggestions of other courts and commentators, as well as on our own post <em>-Zaagman </em>experience, we adopt an approach that does not move the judiciary into the realm of the municipal legislature, yet one that retains the courts\u2019 power to grant meaningful relief to successful plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">It has been noted that \"confusion over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>proper relief to be awarded in zoning cases has continued at least since the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Nectow v City of Cambridge, </em>277 US 183; 48 S Ct 447; 72 L Ed 842 (1928).\u201d <em>Belkin v City of Birmingham, </em>87 Mich App 690, 703; 276 NW2d 465 (1978), modified 406 Mich 949 (1979) (quoting Ellickson, <em>Suburban growth controls: An economic and legal analysis, </em>86 Yale L J 385, 490 [1977]). Ellickson observed that <em>Nectow </em>has had several detrimental effects, among them the fact that the case</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">has been construed to mean that a landowner\u2019s standard remedy against overly restrictive zoning should be some form of injunctive relief and not damages. [Also,] by failing to specify what type of injunctive relief the landowner was to receive, <em>Nectow </em>reinforced the judicial tendency toward sloppiness in the specification of remedies in zoning cases. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Although the Court of Appeals in <em>Belkin, </em>p 704, observed that this Court had never \"explained under which circumstances the court may depart from the general rule and invoke injunctive restraints against future municipal action[,]\u201d it nevertheless found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">that such a foundation must exist ... in the traditional power, inherent in courts of equity, to shape the relief granted according to the circumstances of the instant case. [Id.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">We agree with the Court of Appeals in <em>Belkin </em>that the power of the judiciary should extend far enough in zoning cases to allow courts to shape necessary relief without usurping legislative prerogative. We also feel constrained to select an alternative to the <em>Zaagman </em>procedure that is consistent with the <em>Nectow </em>approach to the problem. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Although the concept of awarding damages in this type of case is an intriguing one, see <em>San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co v San </em>Diego, 450 US 621; 101 S Ct 1287; 67 L Ed 2d 551 (1981) (Brennan, J., dissenting), we decline the opportunity at this time to fully consider or to endorse that alternative.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Plaintiffs have not asked for that type of relief;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>nor would it be an appropriate way to terminate this particular litigation, given its history.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Thus, in selecting an alternative to <em>Zaagman, </em>we seek to provide appropriate injunctive relief in an efficient, expedient manner without injecting courts into the legislative realm. After careful consideration of the many alternative avenues of relief proposed by the parties and amici curiae or employed by foreign jurisdictions, we conclude that the approach adopted by our sister state, Illinois, meets these criteria, and we therefore adopt it. Before describing that approach, however, we will briefly review the rejected options.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The State Bar amici curiae advocate overruling <em>Zaagman; </em>however, their joint proposal nevertheless would vest the trial court with overly broad powers, ignoring one of the major problems of <em>Zaagman. </em>The proposal, as enunciated by the Real Property Law Section, would allow the court to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">decree such relief as permits reasonable use of the land, does not have substantial adverse effect on the public health, safety or welfare, and otherwise comports with the dictates of equity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">The dispute between the two State Bar sections over an amendment to the proposal, offered by the Public Corporation Section, best highlights the weaknesses of the joint proposal. The Public Corporation Law Section adds a gloss to the proposal in an effort to recognize the \"legislative prerogatives of local government.\u201d It recommends that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">[t]he final judgment shall provide that the munici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>pality may exercise its zoning authority over the land described in the judgment, but any ordinance, amendment or regulation shall not preclude the use determined by the Court to be reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The Real Property Section maintains that this additional proposal is \"unwise and unnecessary.\u201d Tellingly, this section\u2019s objection to the gloss observes that the additional proposal</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">could . . . caus[e] delay and put[] the landowner and municipality back into the same problem area which has been created by <em>Zaagman, i.e., by giving the municipality an opportunity to re-legislate. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The Public Corporation Section responds that the joint proposal (without the amendment) is \"close to legislating by the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">We find that both versions of the proposal are flawed. A court has no power either to give or to take away a municipality\u2019s authority to legislate or relegislate; nor may it legislate in lieu of the municipality. Such is the essence of the separation of powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The Real Property Section claims that the process of zoning legislatively is too long and burdensome, but the same reasoning may support the argument that a court has inadequate resources and is an inappropriate forum for performing the \"several levels of consideration,\u201d noted by the amicus curiae, that are necessary to zoning determinations. Thus, we find the State Bar proposals to be inadequate substitutes for the <em>Zaagman </em>procedure. While we agree that <em>Zaagman </em>should be overruled, the joint proposal does little to correct the basic infirmities of that decision. The additional proposal neither corrects the separation of powers problem nor does it provide a procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>that will ultimately be any less burdensome, from the successful plaintiffs perspective, than <em>Zaagman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">We also reject the defendant\u2019s proposal for similar reasons. The city advocates revision of the <em>Zaagman </em>procedure so as to disallow a court\u2019s actual rezoning of a parcel of land, but it defends the court\u2019s power to \"determin[e] which of the lesser restrictive zoning classifications that are already impliedly contained within the classification declared unconstitutional can be constitutionally applied to this property.\u201d The city, of course, retains its right to rezone the property later if the court\u2019s \"rezoning\u201d ends up permitting inappropriate uses of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">This alternative was not considered in the <em>Zaagman </em>decision. See <em>Zaagman, </em>p 165.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This alternative is like <em>Zaagman, </em>though, in that it allows the court to grant relief in the form of a whole <em>classi\u00f1cation, </em>rather than a specific proposed use. By so doing, a court would be violating rules that require zoning regulations to be enacted according to zoning enabling acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">A separation of powers problem is most apparent where the court is granting a classification, rather than a use, whether that classification is one proposed by the plaintiff or already \"included\u201d within the invalidated classification.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>implementation of this proposal could result in the implicit approval of all types of uses of the property not even described or presented to the judge during the course of litigation. Thus, we reject the city\u2019s proposal as one that contains all of the problems of <em>Zaagman, </em>while presenting new ones of its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">A sibling to the \"most restrictive included\u201d approach is the relief granted in <em>Long v Highland </em>Park, 329 Mich 146; 45 NW2d 10 (1950). In <em>Long, </em>this Court approved of the trial court\u2019s invalidation of an unconstitutional zoning ordinance and also of the trial court\u2019s conclusion</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">that said property might be used for any of the purposes allowed by the ordinance under the classification B2, for business purposes. <em>[Id., </em>p 154.][<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-8\"><em>Zaagman, </em>itself, rejected the <em>Long </em>approach as \"too expansive,\u201d noting that it allows the landowner to develop the land in any manner that falls within the approved zoning classification. <em>Id., </em>p 172. Prahl, <em>supra, </em>p 119, notes that this alternative provides</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">no predictability for surrounding property owners and no requirement that the community\u2019s plan be considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">A majority of state courts also appear to reject this alternative as violative of the separation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>powers. See Anderson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 28.10, pp 270-277 (August, 1985, supp) and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">We object to adoption of this alternative for the same reason. By designating a classification, or requiring the municipality to adopt a particular classification, the court is clearly sitting as a superlegislature. This approach grants plaintiffs far more relief than they normally request and allows a successful plaintiff to change its proposed use to a potentially more disruptive use, although one that is within the approved classification.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">An alternative that falls at the other end of the spectrum from <em>Long </em>is that advocated by Justice Kavanagh in dissent in <em>Daraban, supra. </em>Dubbed the \"unzoned\u201d approach, this proposal provides that once the court has declared an ordinance unconstitutional, the property is left unzoned, and the municipality must act to rezone if it wishes to prevent plaintiff\u2019s intended use. If plaintiff\u2019s use is precluded by a new ordinance, then, presumably, he must begin the process all over again.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Most courts and commentators find the unzoned approach undesirable; however, some states have adopted it. See <em>City of Cherokee v Tatro, </em>636 P2d 337 (Okla, 1981); <em>Atlanta v McLennan, </em>237 Ga 25; 226 SE2d 732 (1976).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Plaintiffs in this case argue in favor of the unzoned approach in theory, but, of course, they insist upon their right to use the property as they have proposed. They note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">Of course, invalidation of a zoning ordinance which offends the State or Federal Constitution means that the Plaintiff\u2019s property is \"unzoned.\u201d . . . There is no presumption that land is to be burdened with restrictions even if they are invalid or not yet in being.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Courts that reject the unzoned approach do so for reasons similar to those articulated in <em>Zaagman. </em>We continue to endorse that view. While it is theoretically appealing, the unzoned approach ignores the court\u2019s power to grant relief tailored to the equities of the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\"><em>Zaagman </em>noted in regard to the unzoned alternative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">Although a technically logical position, we are of the opinion that restricting the Court\u2019s declaratory powers in such an absolute manner may operate to produce a result neither generally prayed nor argued for by an aggrieved landowner and potentially incompatible with the orderly development of the general community or abutting parcels of property. <em>[Id., </em>p 168.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">The Ohio Supreme Court, in <em>Worthington, supra, </em>p 266, noted its agreement with <em>Zaagman </em>on this point. It opined that to leave the property in an unzoned condition would \"afford the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>owner complete freedom of choice as to the future use of his property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">The Illinois Supreme Court also found two problems with the unzoned approach. As to the defendant municipality, the court noted that it might</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">rezone the property to another use classification that still excludes the one proposed, thus making further litigation necessary as to the validity of the new classification. <em>[Sinclair Pipe Line Co v Richton Park, </em>19 Ill 2d 370, 378; 167 NE2d 406 (1960).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-6\"><em>Sinclair </em>also noted the possibility that the property owner would not be constrained to implement the use proposed during the course of litigation and that \"he might thereafter use the property for an entirely diiferent purpose.\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 378-379.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Thus, even courts that articulate separation of powers concerns are hesitant to adopt a pure unzoned approach. Commentators are equally unenthusiastic about leaving property unzoned after a declaration of unconstitutionality invalidates an existing zoning ordinance.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In our view, the only way that an unzoned approach could be workable would be if it were combined either with a proscription against any future zoning of the property, like the Georgia rule,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> or with a compensation scheme, whereby the successful plaintiff would be awarded damages for the \"temporary taking\u201d of his property. The Georgia rule embodies a major separation of powers problem; it also opens the door to totally unregulated land use. The compensation alternative, as noted above, is appealing, but its consideration must await future briefing and argument in a more appropriate case.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Having rejected variations on the two extreme forms of relief, we now turn to the middle ground. We have chosen to adopt an alternative that confines the trial court to its more traditional role, but that allows some latitude in granting appropriate relief to a plaintiff who has successfully challenged an unconstitutional zoning ordinance. Illinois has also adopted such an approach._</p>\n<p id=\"A2j\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\">By borrowing the Illinois approach, we are essentially hearkening back to earlier pr <em>e-Zaagman </em>precedent. The <em>Sinclair </em>rule is very similar to, but narrower than, that employed by this Court in <em>Daraban, supra. </em>See <em>Zaagman, supra, </em>pp 173-174, and n 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">In <em>Daraban, supra, </em>p 500, we approved a trial court order that had enjoined the defendant municipality from interfering with the plaintiff\u2019s use of the land \"in accordance with plaintiff\u2019s exhibit number 4, . . . and in accordance with the R-3 zoning classification . . . .\u201d Thus <em>Daraban </em>allowed the court to declare the plaintiff\u2019s <em>use </em>permissible as well as to approve a specific use classification. This latter type of relief had already been approved in <em>Long, supra, </em>and we reject it for the reasons noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">We approve of the <em>Daraban </em>approach only insofar as it allows a court to enjoin the municipality from interfering with a plaintiff\u2019s proposed use. We would also add an important gloss to this limited version of the <em>Daraban </em>rule: The plaintiff\u2019s use must be shown to be a reasonable one, and the plaintiff must bear the burden of so proving by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">This \"specific use\u201d approach is endorsed by a number of jurisdictions and has the benefit of providing a successful plaintiff with some tangible relief. In addition, the task to be performed by the judge in awarding this type of relief is not unlike the findings that must be made initially in order to find a particular zoning ordinance unconstitutional as applied.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Ohio is one of the states that has adopted a variation of this approach. In <em>Worthington, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>p 267, the court held that once an existing zoning ordinance is found unconstitutional</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-4\">the trial court should give notice to the zoning authority that, within a reasonable time certain, it may, at its option, rezone the property. Further notice should be given that, if the property is not rezoned within such period of time, <em>the court will authorize the property owner to proceed with the proposed use if, on the basis of the evidence before it, the court determines the proposed use to be reasonable. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The Ohio courts may enjoin the landowner from disturbing the status quo during the interim, and may later conduct further proceedings \"to determine whether the new zoning restrictions may constitutionally proscribe the owner\u2019s proposed use.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The Virginia rule is similar.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">[W]hen the evidence shows that the existing zoning ordinance is invalid and the requested use reasonable, and when, as here, the legislative body produces no evidence that an alternative reasonable use exists, then no legislative options exist and a court decree enjoining the legislative body from taking any action which would disallow the one use shown to be reasonable is not judicial usurpation of the legislative prerogative. <em>[City of Richmond v Randall, </em>215 Va 506, 513; 211 SE2d 56 (1975).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">See <em>Bd of Supervisors v Allman, supra, </em>pp 445-446.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">We prefer the Illinois approach because of its specificity and its elimination of delay. It combines the two types of action (declaration of unconstitutionality and relief) into one proceeding. By plac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>ing the burden of proof of reasonableness on the plaintiff, some degree of compromise and potential settlement is undoubtedly encouraged.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">The rule originated in <em>Sinclair Pipe Line Co v Richton Park, supra. </em>The <em>Sinclair </em>court noted first:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">The problem thus presented as to the kind of relief to be awarded in a zoning case is a recurrent one, and one toward which this court has not manifested an unwavering attitude. <em>[Id., </em>p 377.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The same may be said of our own precedent on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">In developing the \"specific reasonable use\u201d relief rule, the Illinois court sought to avoid leaving property unzoned after a declaration of unconstitutionality. It observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\">[i]n most of the cases that have come before us in recent years, a specific use was contemplated and the record was shaped in terms of that use. <em>[Id., </em>p 379][<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">The court opined that by granting the plaintiff\u2019s proposed use, further litigation can be avoided, but the plaintiff is also prevented from proceeding with a different, possibly more disruptive, use (as might be the case if the property is left unzoned or a whole classification is approved).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">The Illinois courts have firmly limited the type of relief available to a court when an ordinance has been declared invalid. The court must not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>assume[] the legislative function of determining the ultimate zoning classification of the property in question. . . . The most that a court may do after declaring an existing zoning ordinance void as applied to certain property is to find that the specific use contemplated by the owner is reasonable and may be permitted. <em>[Fiore v Highland Park, </em>76 Ill App 2d 62, 76; 221 NE2d 323 (1966).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">See <em>Exchange Natl Bank v Waukegan, </em>85 Ill App 2d 461, 466-467; 229 NE2d 562 (1967) (reversed trial court\u2019s decree that divided the property for zoning purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">On the other hand, if the plaintiff does not show reasonableness by a preponderance of the evidence, the zoning authority is free to rezone the property, unrestrained by a use that has been declared reasonable. The court generally looks to the existing uses and zoning of nearby properties in determining reasonableness. Presumably, the defendant and any intervening parties will submit evidence on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The reasonableness burden should, in our view, be appropriately high, so that a plaintiff who has successfully challenged an unconstitutional ordinance will not automatically be free to proceed with its proposed use. See, e.g., <em>Drogos v Bensenville, </em>100 Ill App 3d 48, 56; 426 NE2d 1276 (1981), where the Illinois Court of Appeals affirmed the finding of invalidity, but found the plaintiff\u2019s proposed gas station to be an unreasonable use. See also <em>LaSalle Nat'l Bank v Chicago, </em>130 Ill App 2d 457, 462; 264 NE2d 799 (1970) (remand for submission of further evidence regarding reasonableness of use). A plaintiff\u2019s proposed use must be specific, but it need not amount to a \"plan.\u201d See <em>Norwood Builders v City of Des Plaines, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">Under the Illinois rule, the zoning authority is always left free to rezone. When a plaintiff meets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>the burden of proving the reasonableness of his proposed use, the zoning authority is simply prevented from prohibiting the approved use when it acts to rezone the property. Other Illinois cases decided under this rule are discussed in <em>Zaagman, </em>pp 174-176, n 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\"><em>Zaagman </em>rejected the Illinois approach along with <em>Daraban; </em>however, it found <em>Sinclair </em>and its progeny \"persuasive.\u201d <em>Id. Zaagman </em>described <em>Sinclair </em>and <em>Daraban </em>as \"too restrictive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">It goes without saying that we disagree on this point. In our view, <em>Sinclair </em>represents a unique accommodation of both the desire to provide relief and the necessity for keeping judicial action within constitutional bounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">After a zoning ordinance has been declared unconstitutional, in addition to that declaration, a judge may provide relief in the form of a declaration that the plaintiffs proposed use is reasonable, assuming the plaintiff\u2019s burden has been met, and an injunction preventing the defendant from interfering with that use. The defendant is always free to rezone consistent with the limiting conditions of plaintiffs proposed use, or not so limited, where plaintiffs use has not been declared reasonable. In contrast to <em>Daraban, </em>the Illinois rule prevents the plaintiff from \"shooting the moon\u201d with its proposed use, because if the plaintiff does not demonstrate reasonableness, the municipality\u2019s further zoning will be limited only by the court\u2019s declaration of unconstitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">It is a practical rule, because, as the <em>Sinclair </em>court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-8\">Normally the land owner is interested particularly in a specific use which he proposes, and so it is natural that he will try the case and the judge will reach his decision in terms of the reasonableness of excluding that specific use. <em>[Id., </em>p 378.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>The finality aspect of the Illinois rule is also appealing. In contrast to a purely unzoned approach, it does not set the stage for future litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">We would prefer to terminate this litigation now, rather than extend it further. However, in the interests of rectifying a rule that has proved to be cumbersome and unworkable, and of providing a more manageable, efficient, and less theoretically problematic alternative approach, we find it necessary to remand this cause yet again in order to allow for a determination of reasonableness by the trial court. Since plaintiff still seeks to develop his property as he proposed in his original complaint, this would not prove to be a difficult task, although further evidence from all sides might be received on the question of reasonable use.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Thus, we overrule <em>Zaagman </em>and reverse and remand this case to the trial court for consideration of the question of relief in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b406-7\">Cavanagh, Boyle, and Riley, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b406-8\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AgV\">In this appeal we are called upon (1) to reexamine the procedure, applicable after a judicial determination that a zoning classification is invalid as applied to a particular parcel of land, prescribed by this Court in <em>Ed Zaagman, Inc v Kentwood, </em>406 Mich 137, 166-167; 277 NW2d 475 (1979), and (2) to determine whether the declaratory judgment and order, entered pursuant to the <em>Zaagman </em>procedure by the circuit judge, as modified and affirmed by the Court of Appeals, constitutes an improper exercise by the judiciary of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>power vested in the Legislature,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a deprivation of property without due process of law,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or a taking of private property without just compensation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Joseph Schwartz owns a twenty-eight acre parcel of undeveloped land in the City of Flint.

The first tier, consisting of approximately 3.7 acres immediately north of the single-family homes on Woodslea Drive, was restricted to single-family homes under the A-l zoning classification (10,000 square foot minimum lots). The second tier, consisting of approximately 1.15 acres immediately north of the first tier, was restricted to \"duplexes.\u201d On the remaining property, Schwartz would be permitted to construct 120 or, depending on the flood plain level, 124 single-family attached townhouse units, provided that the total number of units on the entire parcel did not exceed 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The order also prohibited the use of the outlot<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> as a means of access to and from the Schwartz parcel, and would require that Schwartz obtain a right-of-way over an adjoining privately owned parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The Court of Appeals<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> modified the judge\u2019s order to permit \"detached single-family townhouses\u201d as well as \"duplexes\u201d in the second tier of the parcel;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the judge\u2019s order was affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Schwartz, the city, and two sections of the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Bar of Michigan, appearing as amici curiae, urge that the remand procedure set forth in <em>Zaagman</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>should be repudiated or modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Schwartz asserts that the <em>Zaagman </em>procedure should be repudiated in its entirety and overruled. He argues that delay and prolonged litigation are invited by the procedure, which gives local zoning authorities at least a second chance after a classification has been determined invalid as applied. He also argues that the search for a \"midsatisfactory use\u201d in effect requires a landowner to \"bargain against himself\u2019 after a successful challenge to a zoning restriction. He further asserts that the procedure improperly leads courts to \"devise and impose restrictions on land use\u201d that may threaten sound economic development and perhaps even constitute a \"taking\u201d by inverse condemnation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Schwartz argues that when a zoning restriction is declared unconstitutional as applied to a parcel of land, the parcel should be deemed \"unzoned,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the landowner should be free to develop the property in a manner consistent with the classification originally sought in the complaint for relief, or the municipality should be ordered to pay just compensation for the \"taking\u201d of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">The city argues that the <em>Zaagman </em>procedure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>which requires the judge to \"determine and implement the most equitable or 'midsatisfactory use\u2019 to be made of plaintiffs\u2019 parcel,\u201d leads courts improperly to exercise legislative powers delegated to municipal zoning authorities. The solution, according to the city, is to require that the judge determine \"the most restrictive, yet constitutional, lesser-included zoning classification within the classification determined unconstitutional.\u201d The city urges that the <em>Zaagman </em>procedure be replaced with a modified version of the proposal submitted by amici curiae,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> limiting the judge\u2019s choice of remedies to a declaration and injunction based on existing zoning classifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Alternatively, the city urges that if the <em>Zaagman </em>procedure is retained, the sixty-day remand period should be lengthened, and the term \"midsatisfactory use\u201d should be redefined to avoid any implication that a compromise, or \"middle use,\u201d must be implemented in every case.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The Real Property Law and Public Corporation Law Sections of the State Bar of Michigan, as amici curiae, have jointly submitted a proposal that would replace the <em>Zaagman </em>remand procedure. The Real Property Law Section argues that the <em>Zaagman </em>procedure invites costly delay and provides no incentive to the local zoning authorities to \"zone reasonably in the first instance\u201d or reach a settlement with the landowner. The Public Corporation Law Section argues that the <em>Zaagman </em>procedure forces both parties to prepare for further litigation, creating an atmosphere not conducive to productive land use planning.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The joint proposal of the State Bar Sections would eliminate the remand procedure and require that a judge fashion an appropriate remedy after it has been determined that a zoning ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>nance is invalid as applied; the proposal identifies factors that the judge should consider when fashioning a. remedy, and the forms of relief that might be granted.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aeh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">We are not persuaded that the <em>Zaagman </em>procedure should be repudiated or overruled in its entirety. Legitimate concerns regarding that procedure, however, prompt us to modify and clarify certain aspects of the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">All the parties have expressed concern that focusing on \"midsatisfactory use\u201d may imply that there is in all cases an appropriate compromise or \"middle use\u201d that must be reflected in the order of relief from an invalid zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">We see no need to attempt to assess whether the term \"midsatisfactory use\u201d is confusing or misleading. We disavow any implication that the term \"midsatisfactory use\u201d means that both the landowner\u2019s proposed use and a modified version of the original zoning classification must be rejected in all cases.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In some cases the landowner\u2019s proposed use will be the only constitutionally reasonable use of the property; in other cases the original zoning classification, with modifications, might present the landowner with a reasonable use of his property. The judge is not foreclosed from consideration of these uses in his determination of an appropriate remedy._</p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">We adhere to the view that, when a zoning restriction is declared unconstitutional as applied to a parcel of land, the parcel should not be considered \"unzoned.\u201d The effect of leaving a parcel temporarily unrestricted, and preventing the judge from entering appropriate declaratory or injunctive relief, might be development of the parcel in a manner incompatible with the general development of the surrounding area.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The city should be provided an opportunity to demonstrate the feasibility of uses other than those proposed in the landowner\u2019s complaint. A determination that an existing zoning restriction is unconstitutional as applied does not mean that the landowner must be permitted to use the land in the manner he has proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Nor should the judge\u2019s choice of remedies be limited to issuance of a general injunction based on a determination of the most restrictive, yet constitutional, \"lesser-included\u201d zoning classification within the classification previously invalidated. Adoption of the city\u2019s proposal would introduce another area of controversy concerning what constitutes the \"most restrictive\u201d zoning classification and unnecessarily constrict the city\u2019s and the judge\u2019s alternatives.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">If there is more than one constitutionally reasonable use of the property, the city\u2019s choice should, we continue to believe, generally prevail. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>If, however, the city fails to identify its choice\u2014 through a specific use proposal for the property\u2014 within a reasonable period of time, then the judge properly is called upon to determine and implement an appropriate remedy without being limited to, although he should consider, existing zoning classifications and untimely proposals submitted by the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Specifically, we would hold that, as before, after a judicial determination that a zoning classification is unconstitutional as applied, enforcement of the ordinance should be enjoined and an alternative specific use proposal submitted by the city would be considered by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">In lieu of the remand procedure, not later than sixty days <em>before </em>the trial date, the city might present an alternative specific use proposal for the property. The judge could require the landowner to submit an alternative use proposal within the same time limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">If the city\u2019s presentation is timely, the judge would, upon a determination of unconstitutionality, expeditiously determine whether the city\u2019s proposal provides the landowner with a feasible alternative use that is not unreasonable as applied to his property.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> If the judge determines that a feasible alternative use has been provided by the city, he would be obliged to enter a judgment declaring that to be the use that may be made of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">If the judge determines that no feasible alternative use has been provided, or that the city\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>presentation was made in bad faith or for the purpose of delay, or if the city fails timely to submit a specific use proposal, the judge would conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine an appropriate remedy. Both parties could submit specific use proposals to the judge, but a feasible use proposed by the city would not then be given priority over other feasible alternative uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">After conducting the evidentiary hearing, the judge, considering at least (1) the objectives set forth in the applicable zoning enabling act, (2) reasonable uses of the land, including economic considerations, (3) compatibility with surrounding properties and developments, and (4) the zoning plan contained in the zoning ordinance, would fashion a remedy that identifies a feasible specific use or uses to be permitted on the land, eliminates unreasonable or inappropriate zoning land use restrictions, and which might include conditions on the use of the land and appropriate injunctions and other provisions and orders as might be deemed necessary to effectuate the remedy.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Findings of-fact would be required to be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The foregoing modification of the <em>Zaagman </em>procedure would reduce delay and the length of litigation. While, as before, the city would be given a \"second chance\u201d to provide a feasible alternative use for the property, the modified procedure would provide the city with an incentive to act reasonably and without delay. Under the modified procedure the city need not formally adopt an amendatory ordinance, and might instead submit a specific use proposal. The city\u2019s choice among feasible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>alternatives would lose its preferred status if the city acts in bad faith or for the purpose of delay, or if it fails timely to submit a feasible alternative use proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The city would be required to submit a specific use proposal, if at all, sufficiently in advance of the trial date so that if the judge determines that the challenged zoning is unconstitutional, he might, and the parties could reasonably be expected to, proceed, without rescheduling the case and the attendant further delay, immediately to consider the feasibility of the city\u2019s alternate specific use proposal. The city should be authorized to file the alternative specific use proposal with opposing counsel rather than the judge so that the judge need not know before he determines the constitutionality of the challenged zoning whether the city has made an alternative specific use proposal and, if so, the nature of the proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Adoption of the modified procedure would eliminate \"bargaining against himself\u2019 by the landowner or the city. Any implication that a remedy must include a compromise \"midsatisfactory\u201d use has been disavowed; the landowner might argue that his originally proposed use is the most, or perhaps the only, reasonable use of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">A judgment entered by a trial court is not final until it contains a remedial order. As in all cases, however, a party may file an application for leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals from a judgment or order of the court \"which is not a final judgment appealable of right.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">The foregoing procedure would not permit a court to exercise legislative power delegated to local zoning authorities. It is only <em>after </em>a court finds that local authorities have failed timely to provide a feasible alternative to an unconstitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>tional application of a zoning ordinance that the court would be called upon to formulate a remedy for the unconstitutional deprivation of property rights. Nor would this procedure preclude the city from rezoning the property; existing zoning and such a rezoning would not, however, bar or impede construction and use of the parcel pursuant to the judgment and order of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">We turn to consideration of the declaratory judgment and order entered by the circuit judge.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">We review the judgment and order of the judge, as modified and affirmed by the Court of Appeals, pursuant to the clearly erroneous standard.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Under that standard, the findings of the judge may be set aside when \" 'the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">Schwartz asserts that the judgment and order constitute an impermissible exercise of legislative power, a deprivation of property without due process of law, and a taking of private property without just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">We have indicated that the <em>Zaagman </em>procedure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>as we would modify that procedure in this opinion, does not permit a court to exercise legislative power delegated to local zoning authorities.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In the instant case, the city failed to submit an amendatory ordinance or other proposal to the judge within the time provided. The judge conducted an evidentiary hearing, receiving testimony and proposals from both parties concerning an appropriate use of the Schwartz property.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">In formulating a remedy after a determination that a zoning classification was unconstitutional as applied, and after the local zoning authorities failed timely to provide a feasible alternative use for Schwartz\u2019 property, the judge did not impermissibly exercise powers belonging to the legislative branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Schwartz presents several arguments in support of his claim that the judgment and order deprive him of property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">First, Schwartz argues that the decision to permit an A-l restriction (single family home with a minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet) on part of the property repudiated the \"law of the case,\u201d insofar as the Court of Appeals originally held that the A-l classification precludes the use of the property \"for any purpose to which it is reasonably adapted.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We do not read the first decision of the Court of Appeals as barring the judge on remand from designating a <em>portion </em>of the parcel as subject to the A-l classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">Second, Schwartz argues that the focus on a \"midsatisfactory use\u201d led the judge to \"dismiss out of hand\u201d his originally proposed use of the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>erty. While the number of multiple-family units permitted by the judge\u2019s order was less than the number that Schwartz originally wished to construct, it does not appear that the judge failed to consider the use proposed by Schwartz.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">Third, Schwartz argues that he had no advance notice of the plan adopted by the judge, and thus had no realistic opportunity to oppose the remedy proposed and adopted by the judge. Schwartz participated in the remand procedure and submitted a proposal for consideration by the judge. The judge was not required to provide the parties with a proposal for decision or advance notice of the precise contours of the remedy he was formulating.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Finally, Schwartz asserts that the restriction of the first tier to single-family homes and the second tier to duplexes, combined with the overall maximum of 140 units on the entire parcel, bears no relation to public health, morals, safety, or welfare. The judge considered several potential uses of the land as well as their anticipated effect on the surrounding properties and neighborhood. He did not clearly err in imposing separate restrictions on different portions of the property or in limiting the total number of residential units.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Schwartz asserts that the judgment entered by the judge constitutes an unconstitutional taking of his property without just compensation. He argues that, because the judge prohibited the use of the outlot as a means of access to and from the property, the judgment prohibits any and all use of the property. The city argues that the decision to prohibit access through the outlot was \"invited\u201d by Schwartz\u2019 own proposal to obtain a right-of-way over an adjoining privately owned parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>We are persuaded that the decision to prohibit access through the outlot was clearly erroneous. Schwartz had no enforceable agreement to obtain the proposed right-of-way over the adjoining parcel. While some streets<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> in the residential area south of the Schwartz parcel were narrow or without sidewalks, that does not justify a decision that, in effect, completely landlocks an otherwise developable parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">If local authorities perceive a potential safety problem due to an increase in traffic,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> they might post reasonable restrictions or condemn private property to widen streets or add sidewalks or to provide a different means of ingress or egress to Schwartz\u2019 parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">The city urges that, if this Court decides that access to the Schwartz parcel must be provided over the outlot, the matter should be remanded once again to the circuit court for reconsideration of the appropriate use of the parcel in light of that decision. We decline to do so. After more than fifteen years, it is time for this litigation to come to an end so that Schwartz may develop his property if he wishes to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">We would vacate those portions of the judgment and order of the judge that prohibit access through the outlot and require that Schwartz obtain a right-of-way over an adjoining parcel. We would hold that until such time as other means of access <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>to and from the Schwartz parcel are in place, access may be provided through the outlot.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">In all other respects, we would affirm the judgment and order of the circuit judge, as modified and affirmed by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b421-5\">Williams, C.J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b421-6\">Archer, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-6\"> The intervening landowners have not appeared in this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b377-7\"> The city asserts that the more restrictive A-l classification was adopted on the basis of a recommendation in an independent planning study commissioned by the city.

In 1979, the Court of Appeals held that the ordinance challenged by this plaintiff \"is taking from plaintiffs the use of their property without just compensation, contrary to the Federal and State Constitutions.\u201d <em>Schwartz v Flint, </em>92 Mich App 495, 503; 285 NW2d 344 (1979). See <em>Schwartz v Flint (After Remand), </em>120 Mich App 449, 451; 329 NW2d 26 (1982). This is not a regulatory case in which the value of plaintiffs land is merely lessened by the application of the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">In <em>San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, supra, </em>p 653, Justice Brennan, in dissent, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">In my view, once a court establishes that there was a regulatory \"taking,\u201d the Constitution demands that the government entity pay just compensation for the periods commencing on the date the regulation first effected the \"taking,\u201d and ending on the date the government entity chooses to rescind or otherwise amend the regulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Justice Brennan\u2019s further comments are conceivably applicable here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-10\">Police power regulations such as zoning ordinances and other land-use restrictions can destroy the use and enjoyment of property in order to promote the public good just as effectively as formal condemnation or physical invasion of property. From the property owner\u2019s point of view, it may matter little whether his land is condemned or flooded, or whether it is restricted by regulation to use in its natural state, if the effect in both cases is to deprive him of all beneficial use of it. From the government\u2019s point of view, the benefits flowing to the public from preservation of open space through regulation may be equally great as from creating a wildlife refuge through formal condemnation or increasing electricity production .... But \"the Constitution measures a taking of property not by what a State says, or by what it intends, but by what it does.\u201d <em>[Id., </em>pp 652-653.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">The Just Compensation Clause \"was designed to bar the government from forcing some individuals to bear burdens which, in all fairness, should be borne by the public as a whole.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>This reasoning may be analogized to the City of Flint\u2019s decision to zone plaintiffs property for large-lot single family residences when there is no demand for such housing. Justice Brennan\u2019s opinion seems to say that it is permissible for a municipality to make such a decision as a matter of policy and land-use planning, but that it must pay for the privilege to use private land for such public purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Several states have recognized the temporary-takings remedy, although none are directly analogous to <em>Schwartz. </em>See <em>Rippley v City of Lincoln, </em>330 NW2d 505 (ND, 1983); <em>Fifth Ave Corp v Washington Co, 282 Or </em>591; 581 P2d 50 (1978); <em>Scheer v Evesham Twp, </em>184 NJ Super 11; 445 A2d 46 (1982); <em>State v Zinn, </em>112 Wis 2d 417; 334 NW2d 67 (1983). These cases are easily distinguished from <em>Schwartz </em>in that they involved zoning or regulations that <em>clearly </em>had a public purpose. Nonetheless, if the doctrine is accepted in theory, there must be no critical distinction between takings for obviously public purposes and those effected through normal zoning, assuming that a <em>taking </em>has been found.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">A commonly cited advantage of compensation for temporary takings is the tempering effect it may have on the municipality\u2019s future zoning. \"The existence of some damages liability may serve to encourage more conscientious application of land use controls.\u201d Rathkopf, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 46.04, p 46-30. Moreover, unlike some of the other alternatives, it does provide plaintiff with a remedy. The zoning authority is left free to exercise its legislative duties without any kind of intrusion by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">There are a number of disadvantages associated with temporary-takings compensation, the primary one being the financial stress placed on municipal budgets. See Badler, <em>Municipal zoning liability in damages </em>\u2014 A <em>new cause of action, </em>5 Urban Lawyer 25, 54 (1973); Bricklemyer, <em>Regulatory takings </em>\u2014 Call <em>the question, </em>60 Fla B J 77, 80 (1986) (citing similar arguments against compensation: \"the potential strain on the public coffers and the chilling effect on innovative land use planning\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">We do not attempt to balance the advantages and disadvantages of the \"temporary takings\u201d alternative here, as the approach is a novel one and not one even mentioned by the parties or amici curiae in this case. There have also been a number of \"glosses\u201d on the rule proposed in the literature. See, e.g., Rathkopf, <em>supra, </em>p 46-33. Consideration of the whole picture would thus require full briefing and argument in another case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b392-9\"> The plaintiff-appellant in the instant case does not argue for temporary damages. Rather, he seems to allude only to inverse condemnation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">If Defendants advise this Court that they are unwilling to abide by this result, the City of Flint should be directed immediately to perfect its condemnation of Plaintiffs\u2019 land and to pay Plaintiffs just and reasonable compensation for the deprivation of their property and its economic use from the date of the original complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>\"Temporary takings\u201d damages are a much less extreme remedy than inverse condemnation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b395-7\"> The Florida courts apparently follow a variation of the \"most restrictive lesser included\u201d approach. Although Florida courts do not allow a court to rezone directly, they permit courts to direct the zoning authority to rezone to a less restrictive classification. See, e.g., <em>Clearwater v Curls, </em>366 So 2d 1238 (Fla App, 1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b395-8\"> The defendant\u2019s proposal appears to assume a Euclidean, or pyramidal, approach to zoning. The State Bar Real Property Section noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">Not only is this approach not universally followed, but modern planning philosophy generally discredits the approach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Our impression of current trends in land use planning supports this statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b396-12\"> It is unclear whether this B2 classification was one proposed or sought by the plaintiffs in <em>Long. </em>It has been so characterized, however. See <em>Daraban, supra, </em>p 506 (dissent). <em>(\"Long </em>[and subsequent cases] have apparently come to stand as authority for the issuance of injunctions which can restrain municipalities from zoning the property involved in a manner different from that sought by the plaintiff.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\"> There is a factual scenario in which the court\u2019s implicit designation of a different zoning classification is more palatable. In <em>Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank v Duggan, </em>105 Ill App 3d 839; 435 NE2d 130 (1982), the trial court had invalidated an amendatory ordinance. The court noted that the invalidation of the amendment did not cause the property to be unzoned, but rather, effected a \"reversion\u201d to the preamendment classification. It held that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-8\">declaration does not, therefore, constitute judicial rezoning but rather a statement of the necessary consequences of the court\u2019s having declared the zoning amendment invalid. <em>[Id., </em>p 847.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b397-9\"> Georgia has adopted a variation of the unzoned approach. When an ordinance is declared unconstitutional, the court must first remand the case to the zoning authority. If the board fails to act within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>the time allotted, then the trial court may declare the property free of all zoning. <em>Atlanta v McLennan, </em>237 Ga 25; 226 SE2d 732 (1976). In order to avoid a declaration of unzoned status, however, under which the neighboring residential property owners would suffer, the Georgia Supreme Court, in at least one case, allowed the county a second chance to rezone before going the unzoned route. See <em>DeKalb Co v Flynn, </em>243 Ga 679; 256 SE2d 362 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b399-7\"> The Supreme Court of Virginia also described a worst-case scenario under the unzoned alternative.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">[EJntry of a simple adjudicatory decree granting no definitive relief would work a legal absurdity; the governing body might be left with an island of unzoned land, and the landowners might be left free to put their land to any use, short of a nuisance, they saw fit. Left in that posture, the governing body would be constrained to act hurriedly to zone the unzoned island to a new category. In the rush, and absent definitive guidelines from the court, it might select a category that would not allow the one use shown by the record to be reasonable. In such case, new litigation would ensue. If the new court decree declared the new category unreasonable but again granted no definitive relief, the process of re-zoning and re-litigation could continue <em>ad inf\u00ednitum. [City of Richmond v Randall, </em>215 Va 506, 512; 211 SE2d 56 (1975).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">We would note that while there may be no real danger of the average plaintiff constructing a slaughterhouse or incinerator on his property, the concern over municipal foot-dragging is real. As the city attorney quoted in footnote 22 of <em>San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, supra, </em>p 655, advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-10\">\"If all else fails, merely amend the regulation and start over again. . . . One of the extra 'goodies\u2019 contained in [a recent California case] appears to allow the City to change the regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>tion in question, even after trial and judgment, make it more reasonable, more restrictive, or whatever, and everybody starts over again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">\"See how easy it is to be a City Attorney. Sometimes you can lose the battle and still win the war. Good luck.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b400-10\"> Ellickson, <em>supra, </em>p 491, describes the judicial merry-go-round that is created when municipalities rezone in an equivalently stringent, though different, manner. Prahl, <em>supra, </em>p 119, agrees with our assessment that most courts find the unzoned alternative unacceptable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b400-11\"> See n 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b401-8\"> Again, the analysis is confined to situations in which the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>has found a particular ordinance to be unconstitutionally <em>applied. </em>Exclusionary zoning is an entirely different type of determination, necessitating potentially broader relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b403-11\"> Plaintiff-appellant in this case makes a similar argument. He notes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-12\">Property owners do not attack zoning ordinances for the abstract satisfaction of proving a municipality to have exceeded its authority; they seek to develop their property in a particular way for a specific class of uses as specified in the ordinance.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-10\"> Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b407-11\"> Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17.
