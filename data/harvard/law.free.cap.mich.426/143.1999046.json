We hold that, in the present case, in light of the express contractual limitations upon arbitral jurisdiction and authority reflected in the arbitration agreement, the award is unenforceable. In granting the award, the arbitrator clearly exceeded the scope of his authority as expressly circumscribed in the arbitration contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">In accordance with the labor agreement between the Port Huron Area School District and the Port Huron Education Association, the school district instituted layoffs in the spring of 1980, because of financial difficulties the school district was experiencing. Prior to 1980, it had always been possible to have at least one male and one female physical education teacher on duty for all of the classes. Additionally, teachers\u2019 aides (of the same sex as their assigned students) had been employed to assist in locker room supervision when it had not been possible to match teachers of the same sex as the students with the position in one previous year. The teacher\u2019s aide positions, however, were eliminated during the 1979-80 school year in an overall austerity program to address the financial problems experienced by the school district.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The school district established a procedure by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>which it would have both a male and a female physical education instructor at each of its two high schools and that these instructors would be of the same sex as their students and be responsible, without the assistance of aides, for locker room supervision which consumes approximately twenty-five percent of the teachers\u2019 time. During the restaifing process, it appears that one male physical education teacher resigned and was replaced by a laid-off male teacher. There also appears to have been a rescheduling error and the recalled male teacher was assigned a teaching schedule which included some time periods when he would be the only teacher on duty and, thus, the only supervisor on duty for the girls\u2019 locker room. The school district resolved this error by adjusting the teaching schedules, thereby creating a vacancy for the position of girls\u2019 physical education teacher. Consistent with the same sex qualifications previously established by the school district, and the policy decision to eliminate the employment of teachers\u2019 aides, the most senior available male teacher was passed over, and the position was offered to the most senior available female physical education teacher. The male teacher was given another assignment in the school district.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The male teacher who was passed over filed a grievance on September 19, 1980, alleging that he was the most senior qualified teacher to hold the position and that he was not offered the position in violation of the recall and seniority provisions incorporated in Article II of the collective bargaining agreement. Section 3, \u00b6\u00b6 C(3)(e) and 4(c) of that article read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">If a vacancy arises for which a teacher on layoff is qualified, the District shall notify such teacher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>of the vacancy in writing by certified mail notice ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\">In the event that anyone on the Placement List resigns, the Division for Personnel Administration shall take action to issue a contract to the next available teacher on the Seniority List who qualifies for the vacancy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The grievant asked that the position in question be given him.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The employer, responding on October 22, 1980, denied the grievance, asserting that the grievant was not offered the position because he was not a teacher who qualified for the vacancy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">One of the qualifications used by the District during the placement and staffing process was that a teacher who teaches girls physical education classes must be a female instructor in order to provide locker room supervision. As there would have been no afternoon female physical education teacher at Port Huron High School if Mr. Grinder had been recalled from layoff to that position, it was necessary that we recall the next female physical education teacher, which we did. Mr. Grinder did not meet the qualifications required to fill the position, therefore, there is no violation of the Agreement and the grievance is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">The grievance proceeded to arbitration,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the hearing was conducted on May 26, 1981. The arbitrator upheld the grievance, finding that the use of gender as a criterion in offering the girls\u2019 physical education teaching position violated the professional agreement. The arbitrator, in his written opinion, expressly found that the use of sex as a qualification was prohibited by the preamble of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>the contract, and that his authority, consistent with arbitral jurisdiction generally,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> extended to determining whether the school district\u2019s management decision was \"reasonable and necessary.\u201d The arbitrator concluded that the school district had not established the \"reasonableness and necessity\u201d of its management decision, that the use of sex as a qualification was prohibited by the preamble of the contract, and, therefore, that pursuant to the seniority provisions of the contract, the grievant was entitled to the girls\u2019 physical education position, notwithstanding the required locker room supervision responsibilities. The arbitrator emphasized that his decision did not authorize other sex supervision and, apparently, implied that the school district must increase its staff to execute that function.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">The school district commenced the present action in circuit court on September 16, 1981, seeking to have the award set aside as being in excess of the arbitrator\u2019s jurisdiction and authority which was expressly limited and circumscribed by provisions of the arbitration contract. The education association answered, asking the court to confirm the award, and the matter was submitted on cross-motions for summary judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The circuit court granted the school district\u2019s motion and set aside the arbitration award on the ground that the arbitrator clearly exceeded his contractual authority in granting the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The education association appealed, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Court of Appeals reversed in an unpublished opinion. We granted the school district\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 422 Mich 856 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The parties are generally in agreement with regard to the law to be applied in this case. It is well-settled that arbitration is a favored means of resolving labor disputes and that courts refrain from reviewing the merits of an arbitration award when considering its enforcement. To that extent, judicial review of an arbitrator\u2019s decision is very limited; a court may not review an arbitrator\u2019s factual findings or decision on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">The United States Supreme Court expressed the federal policy of judicial deference in the context of labor arbitration in the celebrated <em>Steelworkers\u2019 Trilogy,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This Court expressed its general acceptance of such a policy, similarly, in <em>Frazier v Ford Motor Co, </em>364 Mich 648; 112 NW2d 80 (1961). See <em>Carr v Kalamazoo Vegetable Parchment Co, </em>354 Mich 327; 92 NW2d 295 (1958). See also <em>Kaleva-Norman-Dickson School Dist v KND Teachers\u2019 Ass\u2019n, </em>393 Mich 583; 227 NW2d 500 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">The legal basis underlying this policy of judicial deference is grounded in contract: the contractual agreement to arbitrate and to accept the arbitral decision as \"final and binding.\u201d Labor arbitration is a product of contract, and, therefore, its legal basis depends entirely upon the particular contracts of particular parties. Arbitration contracts may vary, according to their specific terms, in the scope of the matters entrusted to final and binding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>arbitration, and in the arbitral authority conferred to resolve disputes concerning such matters.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> An arbitrator\u2019s jurisdiction and authority to resolve a particular dispute concerning the appropriate interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement derives exclusively from the contractual agreement of the parties; an arbitrator possesses no general jurisdiction to resolve such matters independent of the arbitration contract.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">There is no contention, in the present case, that the merits of the award here in question are subject to review. The only issue is whether the arbitrator, in granting the award, disregarded the terms of his employment and the scope of his authority as expressly circumscribed in the arbitration contract. Parties consenting to arbitration pursuant to written agreements consent to arbitrate within the framework of the terms and conditions of such agreements. An arbitrator who refuses to recognize the terms and conditions expressly circumscribing his jurisdiction and authority in resolving a submitted dispute, thereby exceeding the limits upon which the contractual submission is based, exceeds the consensual au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>thority bestowed upon him by the contract, and the award resulting therefrom is without legal sanction. Whether an arbitrator exceeded his contractual authority is an issue for judicial determination. This well-established principle is within the limited scope of judicial review of labor arbitration awards and was articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>United Steelworkers v Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp, </em>363 US 593, 597; 80 S Ct 1358; 4 L Ed 2d 1424 (1960):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">[A]n arbitrator is confined to interpretation and application of the collective bargaining agreement; he does not sit to dispense his own brand of industrial justice. He may of course look for guidance from many sources, yet his award is legitimate only so long as it draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. When the arbitrator\u2019s words manifest an infidelity to this obligation, courts have no choice but to refuse enforcement of the award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Although the judicial policy favoring labor arbitration warrants a strong presumption in favor of enforcing arbitral awards, an award is properly vacated when that award is dependent upon an arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of provisions expressly withheld from arbitral jurisdiction, or upon an arbitrator\u2019s disregard and contravention of provisions expressly limiting arbitral authority.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AI\">Thus, while an arbitrator has considerable lati<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>tude, his powers are not unlimited in the resolution of labor disputes; the arbitrator remains a creature of the contract, and his \"subject matter\u201d jurisdiction and general remedial authority remain entirely subject to the agreement of the parties. See, generally, St. Antoine, <em>Judicial review of labor arbitration awards: A second look at </em>Enterprise Wheel <em>and its progeny, </em>75 Mich LR 1137 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">ill</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The circuit court vacated the award, in the instant case, on the ground that the award was dependent upon the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of a provision of the preamble to the collective bargaining agreement which was expressly withheld from arbitral jurisdiction. Additionally, the court found that the award was dependent upon the arbitrator\u2019s disregard of a provision of the arbitration contract expressly limiting arbitral authority in the resolution of otherwise arbitrable disputes with respect to the specific reservation of management rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The Court of Appeals, reversing the decision of the circuit court, agreed that the arbitrator relied upon the interpretation of provisions expressly withheld from arbitral jurisdiction, but held that the award was not dependent upon it: that an independent basis, within the arbitral authority conferred by the contract, may have existed to support the award. The Court further held that the school district had waived its right to challenge the award on the ground that it was in excess of the arbitrator\u2019s authority because the school district failed to challenge the \"arbitrability\u201d of the grievance in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">We consider first whether the arbitrator ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>ceeded his contractual authority and whether the award was dependent on it, and, second, whether the school district waived its right to challenge the award by voluntarily submitting to arbitration without challenging the arbitrability of the grievance in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The parties in the instant case addressed, in specific terms, the arbitrator\u2019s authority in their agreement. Some of the relevant provisions circumscribing arbitral jurisdiction and authority expressly set forth in the arbitration agreement are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">2. Powers of Arbitrator</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">a. The arbitrator shall be empowered, <em>except as limited herein, </em>... to make a decision in cases of alleged violations, misinterpretations, or misapplications of a specific Article and Section of this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">(1) <em>He shall have no power to </em>add to, subtract from, <em>disregard, </em>alter, <em>or modify any of the terms of this Agreement.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-11\">(2) <em>He shall have no power to </em>establish salary scales, change any salary figures in the Agreement, or <em>increase or change any staffing requirements </em>set forth in this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-12\">(4) His powers shall be limited to deciding whether the District has violated specific Articles or Sections of this Agreement. <em>It is agreed ... he shall have no power to change any practice, policy or rule of the District through substituting his judgement for that of the District as to the reasonableness of any practice, policy, rule or any action taken by the District.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-13\">(6) In rendering decisions, <em>he shall give full </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>recognition to the responsibilities of the Board as indicated in Article IX, Paragraph E, </em>which establishes the District\u2019s rights, powers and authority as that exercised or had by it prior to the date of this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-4\">His decision shall be consistent with the rights reserved to the District by this provision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">(7)----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">b. Although the Arbitrator may cite case law in making his award <em>he shall have no power to interpret State and/or Federal Law, </em>to hear any matters involving constitutional rights or to render any provisions of this Agreement inapplicable by reason thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">c. The Arbitrator\u2019s decision shall be submitted in writing and shall set forth his findings and conclusions with respect to the issue submitted to arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">d. There shall be no appeal from an Arbitrator\u2019s decision <em>if within the scope of his authority </em>as set forth herein, and it shall be final and binding ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">N. Grievances concerning the following <em>shall not proceed </em>past Step 5 of the grievance procedure [the last step before arbitration]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-10\"><em>Preamble </em>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-11\">Article IX \u2014 Miscellaneous</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-12\">A. <em>This Agreement </em>constitutes the sole and entire existing Agreement between the parties and <em>supersedes all prior practices, </em>whether oral or written, and expresses all obligations of, and restrictions imposed upon, the District and the Association. This <em>Agreement is subject to amendment, alteration or additions, only by a subsequent written agreement </em>between, and executed by, the District and the Association. The waiver of any breach, term or condition of the Agreement by either party shall not constitute a precedent in the future enforcement of all its terms and conditions. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>The arbitrator, in the present case, issued a written decision in which his findings and conclusions were outlined in detail in accordance with the contractual provision reflected in the arbitration agreement requiring him to do so.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That written decision reflects the conclusions and authority upon which the award was based as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">First, although neither the grievance nor the answer which was submitted implicated the preamble to the collective bargaining agreement which was, indeed, expressly withheld from arbitral jurisdiction,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the arbitrator, on his own initiative, proceeded to interpret \u00a7 F as prohibiting the use of sex as a qualification for the position of girls\u2019 physical education teacher. That section of the preamble reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">The District and the Association mutually pledge themselves to continue to recognize the full constitutional and civil rights of all teachers. . . . The provisions of this Agreement shall be applied without regard to race, creed, religion, color, sex, age or national origin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">The arbitrator interpreted that section of the preamble as prohibiting the use of sex as a bona fide occupational qualification, notwithstanding the arbitration contract\u2019s specific and unambiguous provision that the appropriate interpretation of that section of the preamble was expressly withheld from arbitral jurisdiction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Next, the arbitrator, considering \"what contractual authority the District use[d] to support its action,\u201d said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-4\">It is customary for arbitrators to review broadly the powers conferred upon the Employer by the management rights clause. However, many arbitrators seek to determine <em>whether the disputed power is related in a reasonable manner to the orderly and efficient operation of the enterprise. </em>This is the view taken here where the contractual limitations on such rights are so unambiguous. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The arbitrator concluded that \"the District has some affirmative burden to persuade the arbitrator of the operational reasonableness and necessity for its action,\u201d and, that in the \"absence of compelling reasons to the contrary\u201d the use of a same-sex qualification for the position of girls\u2019 physical education teacher violated \u00a7 F of the preamble, and, therefore, could not be used in applying the seniority and recall provisions of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The arbitrator questioned the reasonableness of the school district\u2019s decision to eliminate the use of aides, which were used in one previous school year to fulfill the teachers\u2019 locker room supervision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>functions, and, in effect, his award required the school district to recreate those positions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Arbitral authority to determine the \"reasonableness and necessity\u201d of management policy decisions was limited by express contractual provision.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The arbitrator\u2019s reasoning that the school district was required to establish the \"reasonableness and necessity\u201d of its management decision making gender a bona fide occupational qualification for the position of girls\u2019 physical education teacher, a position which requires locker room <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>supervision as a significant responsibility,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> was contrary to that express contractual provision which specifically limited arbitral authority to employ such an approach.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">The arbitrator, in his written decision, did not determine that the school district\u2019s past action of employing teachers\u2019 aides to assist in discharging the locker room supervision responsibilities of physical education teachers had, by accretion, modified the original collective bargaining agreement and become a part of the agreement binding the school district from discontinuing the use of such aides. We note, moreover, that, again, by express contractual agreement, the arbitrator was prohibited from making such a determination.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The Court of Appeals reasoned that the award in the instant case was, at least in part, based upon the arbitrator\u2019s independent interpretation of the seniority and recall provisions of the agreement and, accordingly, that the arbitrator\u2019s opinion \u2019\u2019drew its essence from the contract and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>not based on the arbitrator\u2019s own brand of personal justice.\u201d We are persuaded, however, that the award was dependent upon the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 F of the preamble and his disregard for the parties\u2019 specific agreement limiting arbitral authority in the management rights reservation provisions. We agree that, ordinarily, unless otherwise expressly agreed, an arbitrator has great latitude in the sources he may rely upon in resolving disputes concerning the appropriate interpretation of specific contractual provisions, including aspirations expressed in a preamble, the past practices of the parties, and, in some circumstances, the reasonableness of policy decisions within the management rights reserved to an employer. That the parties to an arbitration agreement are free to circumscribe and limit arbitral jurisdiction and authority, however, is beyond question, and such contractual terms and conditions are valid and entitled to judicial enforcement.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">In vacating the arbitral award in the present case, the circuit court did not substitute its opinion on the merits of the grievance for that of the arbitrator. The court was careful to appropriately limit its review to whether the arbitrator had exceeded his contractual jurisdiction and authority. In the present case, that jurisdiction and authority was expressly and specifically limited, and the award was dependent upon the arbitrator\u2019s disregard of those specific terms and conditions which were reflected in the provisions of the arbitration agreement itself, and by reference to them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>In this case, the arbitrator clearly exceeded his contractual authority; the award is unenforceable and was properly vacated by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The issue whether the school district waived its right to challenge the award in the present case, as having been granted in excess of the arbitrator\u2019s jurisdiction and authority, was not before the circuit court; the association failed to assert that defense during the proceedings instituted by the school district to set aside the award. Accordingly, that issue was not properly before the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Because the Court of Appeals decision addressed that issue, even though it had not been raised in the trial court, we discuss it briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">A party who voluntarily agrees to submit a specific grievance to arbitration may be precluded from later challenging the \"arbitrability\u201d of that grievance. See, e.g., <em>American Motorists Ins Co v Llanes, </em>396 Mich 113; 240 NW2d 203 (1976).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It does not follow, however, that by voluntarily submitting to arbitrate a specific grievance a party waives his rights completely to later challenge the arbitral award on the ground that the arbitrator exceeded his authority. The most obvious example is when an arbitral award reaches beyond the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>boundaries of the \"submission.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> That a particular grievance is arbitrable \"on its face\u201d does not empower an arbitrator to disregard the terms and conditions of his commission; nor does it preclude a party to the arbitration contract from having that contractual agreement enforced in accordance with those specific terms and conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The policy of this state is in favor of arbitration. While questions of \"arbitrability\u201d in the first instance are appropriate for judicial resolution unless otherwise agreed,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> a court\u2019s function in this regard is limited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">[W]hile the question whether a dispute is arbitrable is for the court, the judicial inquiry \"is confined to ascertaining whether the party seeking arbitration is making a <em>claim which on its face </em>is governed by the contract.\u201d Whether the moving party is right or wrong is a question of contract interpretation for the arbitrator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">\"An order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the <em>arbitration clause </em>is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute. Doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.\u201d . . . Absent an <em>\u2019\u2019express provision </em>excluding [a] particular grievance from arbitration\u201d or the <em>\u2019\u2019most forceful evidence </em>of a pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>pose to exclude the claim,\u201d . . . the matter should go to arbitration. <em>[Kaleva, supra, </em>591-592 (quoting <em>United Steelworkers of America v American Mfg Co, </em>363 US 564, 568; 80 S Ct 1343; 4 L Ed 2d 1403 . [1960]).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">It follows that an order compelling arbitration may not be denied by accepting an employer\u2019s assertion.that a perfect contractual defense to the grievance exists. See, e.g., <em>Butte Miners\u2019 Union v Anaconda Co, </em>159 F Supp 431 (D Mont, 1958) (discussed in <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co v United Rubber Workers, </em>168 Cal App 2d 444; 335 P2d 990 [1959]).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The issue in such cases is not whether the grievance is meritorious, but whether the party is entitled to have the issue determined in the forum designated in the agreement.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In the present case, the school district has not contested the arbitrability of the grievance on its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>face in the first instance. The school district emphasizes that the submitted grievance did not implicate the preamble: nor did it require the arbitrator to determine the reasonableness and necessity of policy decisions within the scope of management rights specifically reserved, and to order, by implication, the school district to increase its staff.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">In exceeding his authority, the arbitrator went beyond the specific provisions alleged to have been violated by the grievant. It could not have been \"said with positive assurance,\u201d however, \"that the arbitration clause [was] not susceptible of an interpretation that coverfed] the asserted dispute.\u201d <em>Kaleva, supra, </em>591-592 (quoting <em>American Mfg Co, supra, </em>568). The school district did not waive its right to meaningful judicial review, however limited, by not anticipating that the arbitrator would disregard express provisions of the arbitration contract circumscribing his jurisdiction and authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The school district did not waive its legal right to have the arbitration agreement between itself and the association enforced in accordance with its terms by not challenging the arbitrability of the grievance in the first instance. Whether the grievance was arbitrable on its face is entirely distinguishable from the issue whether the award was properly vacated on the ground asserted by the school district.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">In conclusion we note that, while the analysis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>the dissent is arguably not illogical to the extent that it expands upon the Court of Appeals reasoning, we are persuaded that taken to its logical conclusion that analysis would defeat the clearly expressed intent of the parties concerning the scope and terms of their arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">The dissent\u2019s conclusion that the arbitrator was \"required\u201d to construe \u00a7 F of the preamble (which reflects the \"mutual pledge\u201d of \"[t]he District and the Association ... to continue to recognize the full constitutional and civil rights of all teachers\u201d) <em>notwithstanding </em>the parties\u2019 clearly expressed intent not to entrust the appropriate interpretation of that provision to final and binding arbitration, is problematic. As noted by the dissent, the grievance <em>did not </em>assert \"sex discrimination\u201d; <em>nor </em>did it specifically challenge the school district\u2019s authority to establish gender as a bona fide occupational qualification for the position of girls\u2019 physical education teacher. The grievance was narrowly confined to the seniority and recall provisions, and, as the dissent also notes, had it asserted \"sex discrimination\u201d it would not have been arbitrable, because disputes concerning such matters were expressly excepted from the arbitration agreement. The dissent fails to acknowledge, however, that the answer filed in response to that narrowly confined grievance was equally confined; the school district did not defend by asserting that it was entitled to make gender a bona fide occupational qualification any more than the grievance contended otherwise. To the extent that the grievance did not make such an assertion, it was unnecessary for the school district to defend against it. In deciding that narrowly confined and, therefore, arbitrable grievance, the arbitrator was not required to interpret \u00a7 F of the preamble and to decide the bona fide occupational qualification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>question which all agree would not have been arbitrable if implicated in the grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Nevertheless, the arbitrator\u2019s award was dependent upon his conclusion that sex could not be made a qualification in this case because the school district failed to shoulder its burden of establishing the \u201creasonableness and necessity\u201d of that qualification.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In our judgment, in so concluding, the arbitrator exceeded the narrow confines of the submission which rendered the grievance arbitrable in the first instance. To agree with the dissent that the arbitrator was actually \u201crequired\u201d to do so would nullify the parties\u2019 express agreement excepting such matters from their arbitration contract. Pursuant to that agreement, <em>neither </em>party could compel the other to submit to final and binding arbitration concerning such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Notwithstanding whether \u201call would agree that race, creed, religion, color, or national origin should not be a job qualification in a public school,\u201d <em>post, </em>p 173, the parties agreed, by express provision in their arbitration contract, to exclude such matters from those subject to final and binding arbitration. Without discussing whether \u201c[s]ex or age may in some cases appropriately be made a job qualification,\u201d <em>post, </em>p 174, a question entirely irrelevant to the disposition of this case, we agree and it has not been disputed that \"[wjhether a school district may properly [do so] in a particular case is a question [at least in part] of the construction of the agreement.\u201d The proper forum in which to resolve such a constructional issue, however, is an entirely separate matter which, in the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>case, was expressly agreed upon in the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">The discussion set forth in parts iv and v of the dissenting opinion is, for the most part, misplaced. With regard to the discussion in part iv, we express no opinion concerning the soundness of any of the specific provisions of the arbitration agreement, or the construction of the collective bargaining agreement as a whole. Nor do we comment on the merits of the arbitral award granted in this case. Respecting part v, we note that the arbitrator\u2019s award has not been challenged as \"unreasonable,\u201d or as \"unsupported by principles of contract construction [or] the law of the shop.\u201d Finally, we express no opinion concerning the dissent\u2019s comment with regard to the hypothetical possibility, or likelihood, of another arbitral decision in this case except to note that that question is entirely irrelevant to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals, and reinstate the circuit court\u2019s decision vacating the award on the ground that the arbitrator clearly exceeded his authority which was expressly and unambiguously circumscribed in the arbitration contract.</p>\n<judges id=\"b243-6\">Williams, C.J., and Brickley, Cavanagh, Boyle, and Archer, JJ., concurred with Riley, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b243-7\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AS9\">The question presented is not whether a male physical education teacher should or will supervise a high school girls\u2019 locker and shower room.

Conversely, failure to enforce the school district\u2019s decision would most likely mean that the school district would be obliged to provide female supervision of the locker and shower room.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The arbitration award upholding Grinder\u2019s grievance states that he \"must be permitted\u201d to exercise his seniority rights without regard to sex. Because Grinder could not appropriately supervise the girls\u2019 locker and shower room, the award in effect means that the school district could not make locker and shower room supervision a duty and qualification of the job, when to do so would deprive a teacher of a job to which he would otherwise be entitled under the seniority clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The question presented is whether the arbitrator misunderstood or exceeded his authority in deciding that the seniority clause of the collective bargaining agreement required that the position of physical education teacher be assigned without regard to the sex of the teacher, although this in effect rendered unenforceable, in the case of a male teacher, the school district\u2019s decision to include locker and shower room supervision as a duty and qualification of the job. I would hold that the arbitrator did not exceed his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">The circuit judge set aside the award on the ground that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in relying, in reaching his decision, on the statement in the preamble of the collective bargaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>agreement that \"[t]he provisions of this Agreement shall be applied without regard to race, creed, religion, color, sex, age or national origin.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The Court of Appeals reversed, stating that \"an arbitrator is justified in taking the parties\u2019 recitals, such as are contained in the preamble in the present case, into consideration to determine the parties\u2019 intentions.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court also said that the school district\u2019s reliance on the provision of the collective bargaining agreement stating that \"grievances based on\u201d the \"preamble shall not proceed past step 5 of the grievance procedure\u201d\u2014 which means that grievances concerning the preamble are not arbitrable \u2014 \"[was] misplaced\u201d because the grievance was based on the seniority clause and \"was not based on the preamble.\u201d The Court also rejected the school district\u2019s argument that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by failing to give full recognition to the management rights clause of the collective bargaining agreement, stating that \"[i]n finding that the [school district] was not empowered by the management rights provision to make gender a qualification for the job at issue, the arbitrator was merely interpreting the contract, and thus acting within his authority.\u201d I agree with the analysis of the Court of Appeals and would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The collective bargaining agreement provided that if a teacher resigns, the position shall be awarded to \"the next available teacher on the Seniority List who <em>qualities </em>for the vacancy.\u201d (Em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>phasis supplied.) Grinder filed a grievance asserting that a vacancy arose for which he was qualified, but the position was not offered to him although he was the next available teacher on the seniority list. The school district responded that Grinder did not meet the qualifications required to fill the position because \"[o]ne of the qualifications used by the [district] during the placement and staffing process was that a teacher who teaches girls\u2019 physical education classes must be a female instructor in order to provide locker room supervision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The arbitrator noted the seniority clause of the collective bargaining agreement and the language of the preamble. He concluded that the violation of the seniority clause and \"of the Preamble is clear and the competing reference to the use of the management rights clause\u201d was not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The management rights clause provided that the school district \"retains all rights, power and authority exercised or had by it prior to the date hereof, <em>except as specifically limited by express provisions of this Agreement and under [the public employees relations act].\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis supplied.) The school district claimed that it had retained under the management rights clause the right to establish qualifications for the job of physical education teacher. Although it had in the past provided for locker room supervision by aides or teachers of the same sex as the students, and teachers then could have qualified as physical education instructors without regard to sex, the school district claimed that it had retained the right to include as a qualification for the job that a physical education teacher be of the same sex as the students so that the teacher could supervise the locker and shower rooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>In upholding the grievance, the arbitrator said that locker room supervision had always been one of the responsibilities of a physical education teacher and part of the job, with the exception of the use of aides for one year. It had not, however, \"been <em>applied </em>as a sex qualification up to this point only because it had been possible to arrange assignments in the past so that locker room supervision was done by same-sex teachers.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">The arbitrator said that the \"use of sex in the application\u201d of the seniority provision \"is not authorized\u201d and \u2014 referencing the management rights clause \u2014 is \"specifically limited by express provisions of this agreement,\u201d namely, the provision of the preamble which \"forbids use of sex in applying provisions of the agreement.\u201d He said that the school district\u2019s \"power under the management rights clause to establish sex as a bona fide occupational requirement is juxtaposed against the clear limitations expressed in the recall and nondiscrimination provisions. Under these circumstances, especially considering the traditional importance any union places on seniority protection, the District has some affirmative burden to persuade the arbitrator of the operational reasonableness and necessity for its action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The arbitrator said that while \"making sex a bona fide occupational requirement\u201d might \"be desirable and to not do so might be inconvenient,\u201d \"in the face of such clear and express contractual language limiting the District\u2019s rights and in the absence of compelling reasons to the contrary the conclusion must be made that the contract has been violated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The arbitrator rejected the school district\u2019s claim that locker and shower room responsibility is a significant part of the teachers\u2019 total responsi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>bility, saying that while such responsibility consumes twenty-five percent of the class period, \"it is difficult to conclude that the time involved remotely is representative of the educational content involved in the other seventy-five percent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The arbitrator added that the award does not authorize other-sex supervision of locker and shower rooms, but rather provides that in \"the fact situation presented sex cannot be used as an occupational requirement here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">The opinion of the Court reverses the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstates the circuit court\u2019s decision vacating the award on the ground that the arbitrator, in relying in construing the collective bargaining agreement on the language of the preamble requiring that the provisions of the agreement be applied without regard to sex, exceeded his authority because the agreement expressly provided that a grievance concerning a violation of the preamble was not subject to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Grinder\u2019s grievance did not, however, \"concern\u201d a violation of the language of the preamble requiring that the agreement be applied without regard to sex. His grievance concerned an asserted violation of the seniority clause of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">The question whether Grinder\u2019s seniority rights were violated depends on whether he was \"qualified] for the vacancy.\u201d Whether he was qualified or not depends in turn on whether the school district retained the right under the management rights clause to establish sex as a job qualification. The arbitrator, in construing the contract, decided that the school district did not retain the right to establish sex as a job qualifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>tion because the school district\u2019s rights under the management rights clause were limited by the words, \"except as specifically limited by express provisions of this Agreement,\u201d and the preamble, requiring that the provisions of the agreement shall be applied without regard to sex, was a specific limitation by express provision of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Because the preamble is a specific limitation by express provision of the agreement, the arbitrator did not exceed his authority in considering the language of the preamble \u2014 indeed he was required to do so \u2014 in deciding the correct construction of the agreement. Although a grievance could not be based on the preamble, it was nonetheless a specific limitation to be considered in the construction of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">If the school district had made race, creed, religion, color, or national origin a qualification for becoming a physical education teacher and the arbitrator had, in upholding a grievance on the basis of the seniority clause, relied on the language of the preamble stating that \"[t]he Provisions of this Agreement shall be applied without regard to race, creed, religion, color, sex, age, or national origin\u201d in deciding that the school district could not do so, it would I think be clear \u2014 because all would agree that race, creed, religion, color, or national origin should not be a job qualification in a public school \u2014 that reliance on the language of the preamble in construing the agreement, where the grievance was not based on the preamble, was entirely proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">If Grinder had filed a grievance asserting sex discrimination or discrimination on the basis of race, creed, religion, color, age, or national origin, the grievance could not have been taken beyond Step 5 and hence would not have been arbitrable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>In claiming that the seniority provisions of the agreement had been violated, Grinder did not assert sex discrimination. It was rather the school district that defended against his grievance on the basis that it had a right to establish sex as a job qualification. The question whether it did or did not have the right to establish sex as a job qualification under the circumstances of the instant case was a question concerning the construction of the agreement and not a question of arbitral authority; the preamble \u2014 being a specific limitation in the agreement \u2014 was properly considered in deciding the correct construction without regard to whether a grievance could be based on the preamble.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Sex or age may in some cases appropriately be made a job qualification. Whether a school district may properly make sex a job qualification in a particular case is a question of the construction of the agreement. On that question, the limitation in the agreement requiring that the provisions of the agreement shall be applied without regard to sex was properly, indeed was, required to be, considered by the arbitrator in construing the agreement. The arbitrator did not exceed his authority in deciding, in partial reliance on the preamble, that the correct construction of the agreement was that the school district could not make sex a job qualification where to enforce a same-sex limitation would deprive a male teacher of the job he would otherwise be entitled under the seniority clause of the agreement, the grievance having been based on the seniority clause and not the preamble.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The school district also contends that the arbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>trator exceeded his authority in substituting his judgment for that of the school district concerning the reasonableness of the decision of the district to establish sex as a job qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">The collective bargaining agreement provided that the arbitrator \"shall be limited to deciding whether the District has violated the specific Articles or Sections of this Agreement. It is agreed (except as to the provisions set forth in this Agreement) he shall have no power to change any practice, policy or rule of the District through substituting his judgment for that of the District as to the <em>reasonableness </em>of any practice, policy, rule or any action taken by the District.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The arbitrator stated, as previously noted, that \"the District has some affirmative burden to persuade the arbitrator of the operational <em>reasonableness </em>and necessity for its action,\u201d and of \"the absence of compelling <em>reasons </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Earlier in his opinion he said that \"many arbitrators seek to determine whether the disputed power is related in a <em>reasonable </em>manner to the orderly and efficient operation of the enterprise.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The foregoing limitation on the power of the arbitrator, relied on by the school district, by its terms excepts \"the provisions set forth\u201d in the collective bargaining agreement. The foregoing limitation thus does not preclude the arbitrator from deciding \u2014 on the contrary he is obliged to decide \u2014 \"whether the District has violated the specific Articles or Sections of this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The article or section of the collective bargaining agreement invoked by Grinder was the seniority clause. The seniority clause is a \"specific\u201d article or section of the agreement. The \"provisions set forth\u201d in the seniority clause were \"ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>cept[ed]\u201d from the foregoing limitation on the authority of the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Grinder\u2019s rights under the seniority clause and the school district\u2019s prerogatives under the management rights clause were in conflict. The resolution of that conflict required a construction of the collective bargaining agreement read as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">It is not surprising that the arbitrator concluded that the collective bargaining agreement, read as a whole, did not confer on the school district an unbridled power to establish the duties and qualifications, of a job. If the agreement were construed as conferring on the school district the power under the management rights clause to establish the duties and qualifications of a job without regard to \"reason,\u201d \"reasonableness,\u201d or any standard or limitation, then the school district could at will vary and change, as each job opening arose, the criteria for each job, and the seniority clause would then be considerably reduced in importance if effectual at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Nor is it surprising that the arbitrator concluded that read as a whole \u2014 including in that reading the preamble barring consideration of sex \u2014the agreement did not confer on the school district an unbridled power to establish sex as a job qualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">In deciding whether, reading the agreement as a whole, the school district properly established sex as a job qualification, the arbitrator necessarily considered the relative importance of the competing rights and prerogatives, and made a judgment based on reason. It does not appear that the arbitrator\u2019s decision, although he considered what was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>\"reasonable\u201d in his assessment of reason, was the result of a misapprehension by him of his powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">The arbitrator concluded that although the school district could lay off teachers and reduce staff as an austerity measure, it could not, in light of what the arbitrator saw as the relative unimportance of locker and shower room supervision in comparison to the educational responsibility of a physical education teacher, consistent with the \"traditional importance\u201d of the seniority clause, establish sex as a job qualification. That decision was not in \"manifest disregard of the agreement, totally unsupported by principles of contract construction and the law of the shop . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The arbitrator did not require the school district to increase or change the staffing requirements. He required that Grinder be assigned as a physical education teacher. How, or if at all, the girls\u2019 locker or shower room was supervised was not covered by his award. A senior student or students, a parent volunteer or volunteers, classroom teachers other than physical education teachers or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>administrators might have assumed or shared this responsibility. Then again it might have been or become necessary or advisable to hire part-time or other assistance, but that would be because the school district found that to be the preferable solution. An arbitrator is not necessarily precluded from making an award because one side or another of the controversy might feel constrained thereafter to incur expenditures that the arbitrator could not order.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">In reversing the decision of the Court of Appeals and affirming the circuit court\u2019s decision vacating the arbitrator\u2019s award, the majority acknowledges that \"[t]here is no contention, in the present case, that the merits of the award here in question are subject to review.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The majority thus does not preclude another arbitral decision in which the arbitrator avoids reference to the preamble, \"reasonableness,\u201d and other expressions viewed by the majority as indicating that the arbitrator exceeded his contractual authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals._</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-9\"> The school district found that the teachers\u2019 aides could not satisfactorily assist in the locker room supervision responsibilities of physical education teachers because they were not trained to advise and assist the students regarding personal hygiene, lacked disciplinary skills, and reported to the principal and not the teacher. Thus, as a means of addressing their force crisis, the school district elected not to assume the extra expense of employing teachers\u2019 aides to perform that function.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b224-9\"> The grievance proceeded through each of the five steps provided for in the collective bargaining agreement to precede arbitration and was denied at each step.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b225-6\"> The arbitrator said that \"many arbitrators\u201d employ such an approach.

See <em>Collins Radio Co, </em>n 19 <em>supra, </em>219.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b239-7\"> The typical arbitration contract in a collective bargaining agreement does not restrict arbitration to meritorious grievances. In <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co, supra, </em>the court quoted the following passage from Cox, <em>Current problems in the law of grievance arbitration, </em>30 Rocky Mtn L R 247, 261 (1958), to express this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">[The typical arbitration clause] do[es] not restrict its scope to meritorious disputes or two-sided disputes, still less are they limited to disputes which a judge will consider two-sided. Frivolous cases are often taken, and are expected to be taken, to arbitration. What one man considers frivolous another may find meritorious, and it is common knowledge in industrial relations circles that grievance arbitration often serves as a safety valve for troublesome complaints. Under these circumstances it seems proper to read the typical arbitration clause as a promise to arbitrate every claim, meritorious or frivolous, which the complainant bases upon the contract. The objection that equity will not order a party to do a useless act is outweighed by the cathartic value of arbitrating even a frivolous grievance and by the dangers of excessive judicial intervention.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b240-10\"> The grievance stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-11\">On or about August 21, 1980 a vacancy arose for which I was qualified. This position was not offered to me in accordance with Article II, Section 3, Paragraph C[3][e] (Page 13).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b242-6\"> The arbitrator\u2019s analysis in this regard seems to have been an attempt to apply the bona fide occupational qualification provision of the Michigan Civil Rights Act, MCL 37.2208; MSA 3.548(208), which imposes upon an employer \"the burden of establishing that the qualification is <em>reasonably necessary </em>to the normal operation of the business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added.)

At the very least this means that the interpretation of labor arbitrators must not be disturbed so long as they are not in \"manifest disregard\u201d of the law, and that \"whether the arbitrators misconstrued a contract\u201d does not open the award to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Accordingly, we hold that a labor arbitrator\u2019s award does \"draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement\u201d if the interpretation can in any rational way be derived from the agreement, viewed in the light of its language, its context, and any other indicia of the parties\u2019 intention; only where there is a manifest disregard of the agreement, totally unsupported by principles of contract construction and the law of the shop, may a reviewing court disturb the award. <em>[Ludwig Honold Mfg Co v Fletcher, </em>405 F2d 1123, 1128 (CA 3, 1969).]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b254-8\"> Ante, p 151.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
