In particular, we redefined the term \"governmental function,\u201d which appears in \u00a7 7 of the act, MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107), as we believed the Leg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>islature intended it to be defined.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> None of the nine consolidated cases decided in <em>Ross </em>involved the tort liability of a public general hospital, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">In each of these cases, the plaintiffs seek to hold a public general hospital or medical facility vicariously liable for the negligent diagnosis, treatment, or care rendered by the hospital\u2019s employees or agents. Plaintiffs maintain that such hospitals can be held liable in a tort cause of action pursuant to <em>Parker v Highland </em>Park, 404 Mich 183; 273 NW2d 413 (1978). Two common questions are presented:</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">1) Should <em>Ross </em>be given prospective effect only or retroactive effect?</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">2) Did <em>Ross </em>impliedly overrule that portion of <em>Parker </em>which held that the day-to-day operation of a public general hospital is not a governmental function?</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">We must also decide whether, and under what circumstances, the operation of a public general hospital or medical facility constitutes a proprietary function, which is not entitled to immunity from tort liability under \u00a7 13 of the act, MCL 691.1413; MSA 3.996(113).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">We hold that the rules articulated in <em>Ross </em>apply to all cases commenced after January 22, 1985, the date our opinion was issued, and to those cases pending either in trial or appellate courts on January 22, 1985, in which a governmental immunity issue was properly raised and preserved._</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>We further hold that to the extent that the diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients at a public general hospital or medical facility are activities which are expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by constitution, statute, or other law, the hospital or facility is entitled to immunity from tort liability under \u00a7 7. To the extent that <em>Parker </em>held that such activities do not constitute the exercise or discharge of a governmental function, it was impliedly overruled by <em>Ross. </em>In light of 1986 PA 175, however, a governmental agency can be held liable for torts arising out of the ownership or operation of a hospital or county medical facility where the cause of action accrues on or after July 1, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Finally, we hold that only activities which are conducted primarily for the purpose of producing a pecuniary profit, <em>and </em>which are not normally supported by taxes or fees, are proprietary functions under \u00a7 13. The fact that a governmental agency produces a pecuniary profit may be evidence that the agency is engaged in a proprietary function, but it is not conclusive evidence. The focus instead should be on the primary intended purpose of the governmental activity and how the activity is normally funded.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"Aql\">A. <em>HYDE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Plaintiff Marcia Hyde was treated at the University of Michigan Hospital on July 8, 1974. On June 28, 1976, plaintiffs filed a medical malpractice suit in the Court of Claims, alleging that the hospital employees\u2019 negligent diagnoses and medical treatment caused Ms. Hyde to develop a serious post-surgical infection. Defendant Board of Regents asserted governmental immunity as an affirmative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>defense in its answer. Following a pretrial conference, a pretrial summary was filed on March 30, 1977. The summary indicated that the trial court had given plaintiffs permission to amend their pleadings to allege that the injury had arisen out of the performance of a proprietary function.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further proceedings apparently were held in abeyance pending this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Parker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">After <em>Parker </em>was decided, defendant moved for accelerated judgment in April, 1979. Although <em>Parker </em>had held that public general hospitals are not immune from tort liability, defendant argued that this holding should not be given retroactive effect. Before a decision was rendered, this precise issue was resolved by <em>Murray v Beyer Memorial </em>Hospital, 409 Mich 217; 293 NW2d 341 (1980). <em>Murray </em>held that <em>Parker </em>was to be applied to all cases pending on December 27, 1978, in which an express challenge to governmental immunity had been made and preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Plaintiffs did not file an amended complaint alleging that defendant had been engaged in a proprietary function until October 29, 1982. Defendant moved again for accelerated judgment, claiming that plaintiffs had not made or preserved an express challenge to its governmental immunity until the amended complaint was filed. Since the filing occurred long after <em>Parker </em>was decided, defendant argued that <em>Parker </em>was inapplicable. Plaintiffs countered that they had expressly challenged defendant\u2019s immunity prior to <em>Parker </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>the pretrial conference and the challenge had been preserved by the pretrial summary.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">The trial court accepted defendant\u2019s argument and entered a judgment for defendant in an order filed February 9, 1983. A majority of the Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 application for leave to appeal was pending in this Court when <em>Ross </em>was issued. We thereafter granted leave to appeal. 424 Mich 858 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\n<em>B. FAIGENBAUM</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Plaintiff is the guardian of his mother, Anita Katz. Ms. Katz has a long history of mental illness and has been hospitalized several times. On November 20, 1976, she was admitted to Clinton Valley Center, a state psychiatric facility, exhibiting abnormal twitching and movements of her mouth, face, limbs, and tongue.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">In February, 1977, Ms. Katz was referred to Oakland Medical Center for a physical examination. The center was administered by the Department of Mental Health and provided general medical services to psychiatric patients. Dr. Joseph Chandler, a neurologist at the center, concluded that Ms. Katz was suffering from a degenerative nerve disease known as Huntington\u2019s chorea. Dr. Chandler prescribed Haldol for the condition. Ms. Katz had previously been treated for her mental illness with Haldol and other neuroleptic drugs, such as Thorazine, Stelazine, and Mellaril. When Ms. Katz\u2019 condition did not improve, her family insisted that the Clinton Valley Center discontinue administering any neuroleptic drugs. However, her condition did not substantially improve.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">In 1979, plaintiff sued eleven doctors, two hospi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>tais, and three drug companies in the Wayne Circuit Court, alleging, inter alia, malpractice and products liability. A suit was also commenced in the Court of Claims against the Oakland Medical Center and Clinton Valley Center. Plaintiff alleged that the doctors had failed to diagnose and treat Ms. Katz for tardive dyskinesia, a motion disorder caused by neuroleptic drugs such as Haldol.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It was further alleged that a psychiatrist or neurologist should consider tardive dyskinesia as a possible diagnosis when presented with a patient exhibiting abnormal bodily movements who has a history of exposure to neuroleptic drugs. Proper treatment requires discontinuation of all neuroleptic drugs to prevent the condition from becoming permanent. Plaintiff maintained that Ms. Katz had sustained severe and permanent brain damage and irreversible motor disturbances from repeated administrations of Haldol.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The two actions were joined for trial. Clinton Valley Center was granted summary judgment on the ground of governmental immunity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Several doctors employed by the center were dismissed either on governmental immunity grounds or because plaintiffs failed to show at trial that the doctors were responsible for Ms. Katz\u2019 care. A contract claim against the Oakland Medical Center was struck as being duplicative of plaintiff\u2019s tort claim. Plaintiff eventually settled with six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>doctors (including Dr. Chandler), the two hospitals, and the drug companies for $378,000. The only defendant remaining at the close of proofs was Oakland Medical Center. A key issue at trial was whether the center was immune from tort liability under <em>Perry v Kalamazoo State Hospital, </em>404 Mich 205; 273 NW2d 421 (1978), because the center treated psychiatric patients and was run by the Department of Mental Health.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">On July 27, 1982, the circuit court concluded that the Oakland Medical Center could be held liable under <em>Parker </em>because it rendered only general medical care. The court also concluded that Dr. Chandler had been negligent in failing to obtain a complete medical and drug history, to consider tardive dyskinesia as a possible diagnosis, and to familiarize himself with the potential side effects of Haldol. Plaintiff was awarded $1,000,000 in damages (less settlements), $30,000 in attorney fees, and over $15,000 in expert witness and other fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The center\u2019s appeal was pending in the Court of Appeals when <em>Ross </em>was decided. The Court initially concluded that <em>Ross </em>should be applied to those cases pending on appeal when <em>Ross </em>was decided. Applying the new definition of \"governmental function,\u201d the Court held that the center was entitled to immunity because the medical treatment rendered was expressly and impliedly authorized by the state constitution, statutes, and administrative regulations. It rejected the argument that the operation of a governmental care facility is a proprietary function because a fee is charged for medical services or an incidental profit is generated. Plaintiff\u2019s belated argument that the center could be held liable for breach of contract was rejected because plaintiff had failed to cross-appeal the dismissal of the contract count. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>judgment for plaintiff was therefore reversed. 143 Mich App 303; 373 NW2d 161 (1985). We granted plaintiff\u2019s application for leave to appeal. 424 Mich 857 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\n<em>C. POWERS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">On January 10, 1981, Frank Powers was admitted to Annapolis Hospital, a public general hospital operated by defendant Peoples Community Hospital Authority (pcha). Mr. Powers was diagnosed as suffering from a myocardial infarction. He died several days later, allegedly after his pacemaker malfunctioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Plaintiff, decedent\u2019s wife, filed suit in April, 1982, against the pcha and two of its physicians, Drs. Bercu and Jahan. She alleged that the doctors and staff had failed to monitor and treat decedent\u2019s heart condition properly. Plaintiff and Dr. Bercu settled for $25,000. The pcha was granted partial summary judgment to the extent that plaintiff sought to hold it vicariously liable for Dr. Bercu\u2019s negligence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">After <em>Ross </em>was decided, the pcha moved for summary disposition on the ground of governmental immunity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> An evidentiary hearing was held, primarily to determine whether Mr. Powers\u2019 death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>arose during the performance of a proprietary function. The undisputed evidence showed that Annapolis Hospital charged for its medical services. It also received tax money from the twenty-four southeastern Michigan communities which participate in the pcha. The pcha had amassed substantial sums in its depreciation, excess revenue, and bond and interest accounts. However, none of these funds had been distributed to the state, the participating communities, or the directors and officers of the pcha or the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Relying on <em>Faigenbaum, </em>the circuit court concluded that <em>Ross, </em>rather than <em>Parker, </em>should be applied. It found that the operation of the hospital by the pcha constituted a governmental function because it was expressly authorized by statute. The court further concluded that under \u00a7 13 of the governmental immunity act, it had to determine whether the hospital\u2019s rendering of medical care for a fee was conducted primarily for the purpose of producing a pecuniary profit. It found that the primary purpose of the pcha and Annapolis Hospital was to provide health care to the surrounding communities. The pcha\u2019s motion for summary disposition was therefore granted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Plaintiff filed an application for leave to appeal with the Court of Appeals. This Court sua sponte granted leave to appeal prior to the decision of the Court of Appeals. 424 Mich 858 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">II. RETROACTIVITY OF <em>ROSS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Our first task is to determine what case law is applicable in each case. Prior to <em>Parker, </em>the operation of a public general hospital was considered a governmental function under both common law and \u00a7 7 of the governmental immunity act. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number><em>Parker, </em>404 Mich 190-191; <em>Martinson v Alpena, </em>328 Mich 595; 44 NW2d 148 (1950); <em>Nicholson v Detroit, </em>129 Mich 246; 88 NW 695 (1902). <em>Parker </em>rejected this well-established case law and concluded that a public general hospital can be held liable for torts committed during its day-to-day operations. Although <em>Parker </em>did not state whether its new rule of law should be given retroactive effect, the question was resolved in <em>Murray v Beyer Memorial Hospital:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">[T]he rule of <em>Parker </em>is to be applied to all cases pending on December 27, 1978, in which an express challenge to the defense of governmental immunity was made and preserved as well as all cases started after that date. [409 Mich 221.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The Court justified this limited retroactive application as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">Defendant [hospital] . . . urges that <em>Parker v Highland Park, supra, </em>be applied prospectively from the date the opinion was released and not cover other cases pending on that date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">We are satisfied that the adventitious disposition of <em>Parker </em>while we held plaintiffs\u2019 application in abeyance should not deprive plaintiffs of the benefit of the rule or make available to defendant a defense we will no longer enforce for others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">We acknowledge that whenever a new rule of law is promulgated some unfairness to those who have relied on the old rule may be claimed. Courts, however, do not alter an established rule of law without thorough evaluation of the policy considerations involved. When the decision to overrule precedent is finally made, the Court is satisfied that the importance of the result reached outweighs any unfairness to those negatively affected by the decision. Applying the ruling prospectively with the exception of that case and cases pending on appeal in which the issue was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>raised and preserved is an attempt to limit any such unfairness. <em>[Id., </em>pp 222-223.][<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">Justice Williams further noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">[U]nfortunately, the state of the law as to what constitutes governmental immunity, without further legislative definition, has for some years been in flux. . . . [T]he opinions of this Court have been such as should warn those who might possibly be affected that they had better seek protection either through insurance or through legislative redefinition. <em>[Id., </em>p 224.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Like <em>Parker, Ross </em>did not indicate whether it should be applied retroactively. Nevertheless, the opinion repeatedly noted that the rules and definitions articulated therein are new<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that the judiciary has the power to redefine the term \"governmental function.\u201d 420 Mich 609-610.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Plaintiffs present several reasons why <em>Ross </em>should be applied only to cases commenced after the opinion was issued. First, <em>Parker </em>clearly held that immunity from tort liability did not extend to public general hospitals. This holding has never been seriously challenged in the courts or by the Legislature. Second, there was no indication that <em>Ross </em>would overrule <em>Parker, </em>since none of the nine consolidated cases decided in <em>Ross </em>involved the immunity of a public general hospital. Finally, plaintiffs note that other decisions have been given prospective effect only. See, e.g., <em>Putney v Haskins, </em>414 Mich 181; 324 NW2d 729 (1982); <em>Tebo v Havlik, </em>418 Mich 350; 343 NW2d 181 (1984)._</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Similar arguments were unsuccessfully presented by public general hospitals to the <em>Murray </em>Court in an effort to limit the effect of <em>Parker. </em>Although the tort liability of public general hospitals may not have been seriously questioned after <em>Parker, </em>the definition of \"governmental function\u201d was vigorously debated. The judiciary has wrestled with this problem for over a century with little guidance from the Legislature.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We therefore place little reliance on plaintiffs\u2019 \"legislative acquiescence\u201d argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Furthermore, the consolidation of nine factually diverse cases should have signaled to the bench and bar that this Court was reevaluating the definition of \"governmental function.\u201d Beginning with <em>Parker, </em>no single definition had been adopted by a majority of this Court. In addition, the case law in general was \"confused [and] often irreconcilable.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>420 Mich 596. Given the uncertainty of the law in this area, the bench and bar should have realized that some of our prior decisions, including <em>Parker, </em>might not survive after <em>Ross.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Finally, the general rule is that judicial decisions are to be given complete retroactive effect. We often have limited the application of decisions which have overruled prior law or reconstrued statutes. <em>Tebo, </em>418 Mich 360-361. Complete prospective application has generally been limited to decisions which overrule clear and uncontradicted case law. <em>Id., </em>pp 361-363.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>We believe that <em>Ross </em>should be given the same limited retroactive effect that <em>Parker </em>was given by <em>Murray. </em>We therefore hold that the rules articulated in <em>Ross </em>should be applied to all cases commenced after the date our opinion was issued (January 22, 1985), and to those cases pending either in trial or appellate courts on that date which properly raised and preserved a governmental immunity issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">In <em>Hyde, </em>the initial complaint was filed prior to <em>Parker. </em>The amended complaint, which alleged that the University Hospital had been engaged in a proprietary function, was filed after <em>Parker, </em>but before <em>Ross. </em>The amended complaint was filed with the trial court\u2019s permission, and defendant has never argued that the pleading should be struck. Defendant only claimed that plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to its immunity came too late to take advantage of <em>Parker. </em>Even if we were to accept defendant\u2019s argument, the fact remains that this case was pending in this Court when <em>Ross </em>was issued.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Since plaintiffs properly raised and preserved a challenge to defendant\u2019s immunity from tort liability in their amended complaint and subsequent appeals, plaintiffs\u2019 malpractice claim should be decided pursuant to <em>Ross.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In <em>Faigenbaum, </em>plaintiff\u2019s complaint against the Oakland Medical Center was filed after <em>Parker </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>was decided. The center unsuccessfully argued that it was engaged in a governmental function under <em>Perry. </em>The center\u2019s appeal was pending in the Court of Appeals when <em>Ross </em>was decided. Since the center properly raised a governmental immunity issue in that appeal, the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the case should be decided pursuant to <em>Ross.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">In <em>Powers, </em>plaintiffs malpractice claim was filed after <em>Parker </em>was decided. <em>Ross </em>was issued while the case was still pending in circuit court. The court correctly concluded that plaintiffs claim should be decided pursuant to <em>Ross.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">III. VIABILITY OF <em>PARKER </em>AFTER <em>ROSS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Our second task is to determine whether <em>Ross </em>impliedly overruled Parker\u2019s holding that the operation of a public general hospital is not a governmental function under \u00a7 7 of the governmental immunity act.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">Three opinions were written in <em>Parker, </em>each adopting a different definition of \"governmental function.\u201d Justice Fitzgerald, joined by Chief Justice Kavanagh and Justice Levin, adopted the narrow \"of essence to government\u201d test, i.e., the activity must be of such a peculiar nature that it can only be performed by government. Justice Fitzgerald concluded that the operation of a hospital is essentially a business, regardless of who operates it. Therefore, a governmental agency which decides to engage in such activities should not be entitled to immunity from tort liability. 404 Mich 194-195.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">Justice Moody concurred, but applied the broader \"essence of governing\u201d test, i.e., the activity must be one which can be effectively accomplished only by government. Noting the large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>number of private general hospitals and the governmental agency\u2019s lack of direct involvement in a hospital\u2019s day-to-day operations, Justice Moody concluded that public general hospitals are not entitled to immunity. <em>Id., </em>pp 200-202.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Justice Ryan, joined by Justices Williams and Coleman, dissented. Applying the \"common good of all\u201d test, Justice Ryan concluded that the examination, diagnosis, and treatment of patients are activities entitled to immunity because they promote the general public health. <em>Id., </em>pp 203-204.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">None of the cases decided in <em>Ross </em>involved the tort liability of a public general hospital. However, <em>Ross </em>explicitly rejected each of the definitions of \"governmental function\u201d used in <em>Parker. </em>420 Mich 614-619. \"Governmental function\u201d was redefined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">an activity which is expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by constitution, statute, or other law. <em>[Id., </em>p 620.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">We noted that this definition \"is broad and encompasses most of the activities undertaken by governmental agencies.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Under <em>Ross, </em>a public general hospital or medical facility is engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function whenever its activities are expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by constitution, statute, or other law. To the extent that <em>Parker </em>held that such activities do not constitute a governmental function, <em>Parker </em>was impliedly overruled by Ross.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Plaintiffs vehemently argue that it is \"unjust\u201d to overrule <em>Parker </em>and deny an injured person the right to recover damages merely because he sought medical care from a public hospital.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We are not unsympathetic to these arguments. However, the parameters of sovereign and governmental immunity are governed by statute. Our duty is to interpret the statutory language in the manner intended by the Legislature which enacted \u00a7 7 in 1964 and amended it in 1970.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">\"The controlling test as to the meaning of a statutory provision is always the legislative intent when fairly ascertainable. But the 'intent\u2019 referred to is the one entertained by the legislature at the time of the passage of the act, and not the intent expressed by a subsequent amendment. In the instant case, to interpret the subsequent amendment as an indication of the legislature\u2019s original intent would be mere speculation, not judicial construction.\u201d <em>[Detroit Edison Co v Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>320 Mich 506, 519; 31 NW2d 809 (1948).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">See also <em>People v Gilbert, </em>414 Mich 191, 200; 324 NW2d 834 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The governmental immunity act was passed in 1964 to halt this Court\u2019s attempts to abolish sovereign and governmental immunity. See <em>Ross, </em>pp 603-606. In both 1964 and 1970, the operation of a public general hospital was considered a governmental function. <em>Parker, </em>404 Mich 190-191. There is no indication, either in the words of the act or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>the legislative history, that these Legislatures intended to abrogate a public general hospital\u2019s immunity from tort liability. As noted in <em>Ross:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-4\">The consensus which our efforts produce today should not be viewed as this Court\u2019s individual or collective determinations of what would be most fair or just or the best public policy. The consensus does reflect, however, what we believe the Legislature intended the law to be in this area. <em>[Id., </em>p 596.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">We suggested in <em>Ross </em>that plaintiffs\u2019 arguments would be better addressed to the Legislature. <em>Id., </em>p 621. In response to <em>Ross, </em>1986 PA 175 was enacted, effective July 1, 1986. The <em>Ross </em>definition of \"governmental function\u201d is codified in \u00a7 1(f).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, \u00a7 7(4) specifically allows tort liability to be imposed on a governmental agency which owns or operates a public general hospital or county medical facility.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> By adopting this narrow exception to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>broad immunity granted by <em>Ross </em>and codified by 1986 PA 175, it is clear that the Legislature believed that <em>Ross </em>had impliedly overruled <em>Parker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">In light of this recent legislative activity, today\u2019s holding will have limited effect. Sovereign or governmental immunity from tort liability will be extended to a governmental agency operating a public general hospital or medical facility only in those cases involving a cause of action accruing prior to July 1, 1986, which was pending on January 22, 1985, or commenced on or after that date.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Where the cause of action accrues on or after July 1, 1986, a governmental agency may be held liable for torts arising out of the ownership or operation of a hospital or county medical facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">IV. APPLICATION OF <em>ROSS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">In each case, plaintiffs seek to hold the defendant vicariously liable for the negligence of its employees or agents. Vicarious tort liability can only be imposed upon a governmental agency where:</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">1) the employee or agent committed a tort while acting during the course of employment and within the scope of his authority, and</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">2) the employee or agent committed the tort while engaged in an activity which was nongovernmental or proprietary or which fell within an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>exception to the governmental immunity act. <em>Ross, </em>pp 623-625.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">There is no suggestion that the employees or agents in each case were acting outside the course of employment or scope of authority when the alleged torts were committed. Other than the \"proprietary function\u201d exception, plaintiffs have not alleged that any other exception is applicable. We first decide whether the diagnosis, treatment, and care rendered by each hospital, through its employees and agents, constituted the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">\n<em>HYDE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Plaintiffs alleged that the employees of the University Hospital negligently diagnosed and treated Ms. Hyde\u2019s fracture. The question is whether the diagnosis and treatment of patients were activities which were expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by constitution, statute, or other law.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The University of Michigan is statutorily required to maintain a department of medicine. MCL 390.8; MSA 15.908. The Legislature expressly authorized the construction and operation of the University Hospital through several appropriation acts.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The operation of a hospital implicitly includes the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Since these activities were implicitly authorized by statute, the employees were engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function when the alleged tort was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">\n<em>FAIGENBAUM</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">Plaintiff argues that the operation of defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Oakland Medical Center by the Department of Mental Health was an unauthorized, ultra vires activity. Thus, any diagnosis and treatment rendered to Ms. Katz as part of the center\u2019s general medical operations did not constitute the exercise or discharge of a governmental function. To evaluate this argument fully, the history and purpose of the center must be detailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Oakland Medical Center at all times was operated by the dmh. The center was established in 1968 as the medical-surgical unit of the Clinton Valley Center (then the Pontiac State Hospital). It became a separate administrative unit within the dmh in 1971. The center was created because local medical facilities were reluctant to render medical treatment to mentally ill and developmentally disabled persons residing in state facilities. The center rendered medical treatment primarily to patients from Clinton Valley Center, other state psychiatric facilities, and centers for the developmentally disabled.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> By 1978, several community hospitals had contracted with the dmh to provide medical and surgical services to mentally ill and developmentally disabled patients. The Oakland Medical Center thereafter discontinued operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Plaintiff argues that there is no constitutional or statutory authority which permitted the dmh to establish and operate a general medical care facility. Plaintiff believes that the Court of Appeals incorrectly relied upon \u00a7 116 of the Mental Health Code, MCL 330.1116; MSA 14.800(116). That stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>ute allegedly permits the dmh to function only in areas concerning mental health.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">We do not interpret the dmh\u2019s powers so narrowly. The Legislature expressly authorized the creation and operation of a general medical-surgical unit within the dmh through several appropriations acts. See, e.g., 1967 PA 32; 1971 PA 126. The latter act specifically noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">The goal of the medical services component [program] is to restore and maintain the physical well-being of the hospital patient population by providing diagnostic, laboratory, medical, surgical, dental services and specialized nursing care for infirm patients.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Each resident of a mental health facility must be given a comprehensive physical and mental examination prior to, or soon after, admission and must be reexamined at least annually. MCL 330.1710; MSA 14.800(710). Recipients of mental health services are entitled to \"basic human dignity\u201d under MCL 330.1704(3); MSA 14.800(704)(3), which would include the right to prompt and adequate general medical care. Even if these statutes did not exist, the care and treatment of persons residing in state mental health facilities include an implied responsibility to protect both the residents\u2019 physical and mental well-being. See <em>Ross, </em>pp 641, 643. The dmh was ultimately responsible for ensuring that Ms. Katz received necessary treatment for both her physical and mental conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">There is nothing in \u00a7 116 of the Mental Health Code which would prevent the dmh from fulfilling its statutory duties by operating a general medical care facility for mentally handicapped patients. Section 116 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Pursuant to section 51 of article 4 of the constitution of 1963, which declares that the health of the people of the state is a matter of primary public concern; and pursuant to section 8 of article 8 of the constitution of 1963, which declares that services for the care, treatment, or rehabilitation of those who are seriously mentally handicapped shall always be fostered and supported; the department shall continually and diligently endeavor to ensure that adequate and appropriate mental health services are available to all citizens throughout the state. To this end the department shall have the following general powers and duties:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">(a) It may function in the areas of mental illness, mental retardation, organic brain and other neurological impairment or disease, alcoholism, and substance abuse. Priority shall be given to the areas of mental illness and mental retardation. Within the area of mental illness priority shall be given to the more severe forms of such disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">(b) It may provide, on a residential or nonresidential basis, any type of patient or client service including but not limited to prevention, diagnosis, treatment, care, education, training, and rehabilitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-8\">(d) It may operate directly or through contractual arrangement such facilities as are necessary or appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-9\">(j) It may enter into any agreement, contract, or arrangement with any public or nonpublic entity that is necessary or appropriate to fulfill those duties or exercise those powers that have by statute been given to the department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-10\">(1) It shall have such powers as are necessary or appropriate to fulfill those duties and exercise those powers that have by statute been given to the department and which are not otherwise prohibited by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Subsection (a) specifically permits the dmh to function in areas of organic brain disease and neurological impairment. (Ms. Katz was referred to the Oakland Medical Center because her treating psychiatrists suspected neurological problems.) Subsection (b) authorizes the dmh to provide <em>any </em>type of patient service, including diagnosis, treatment, and care. There is no requirement that the services must be related solely to the patient\u2019s mental health. The dmh can provide these services directly, or through contractual arrangement under subsections (d) and (j). Defendant Oakland Medical Center was created because the dmh was unable to provide sufficient medical and surgical services on a contractual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">We conclude that the dmh was expressly and impliedly mandated by statute to secure, in some manner, those general medical services necessary for Ms. Katz\u2019s physical well-being. The dmh was expressly authorized by statute to provide such services directly through the Oakland Medical Center. The operation of a general medical facility implicitly includes the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Therefore, the employees of defendant center were engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function when the malpractice occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\n<em>POWERS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Plaintiff initially argues that Annapolis Hospital is not entitled to immunity from tort liability because it is not a \"governmental agency.\u201d Section 1(d) of the governmental immunity act, MCL 691.1401(d); MSA 3.996(101)(d), defines \"governmental agency\u201d as \"the state, political subdivisions, and municipal corporations.\u201d These terms are also defined in \u00a7 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>(a) \"Municipal corporation\u201d means any city, village, township or charter township, or any combination thereof, when acting jointly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">(b) \"Political subdivision\u201d means any municipal corporation, county, township, charter township, school district, port district, or metropolitan district, or any combination thereof, when acting jointly, and any district or authority formed by 1 or more political subdivisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">(c) \"State\u201d means the state of Michigan and its agencies, departments, and commissions, and shall include every public university and college of the state, whether established as a constitutional corporation or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">Although hospitals are not listed in these definitions, plaintiff has overlooked the entity she actually sued. Plaintiff properly sued the Peoples Community Hospital Authority, an entity formed by twenty-four southeastern Michigan communities, which runs five community hospitals, including Annapolis Hospital. An authority formed by one or more political subdivisions is included within \u00a7 l(b)\u2019s definition of \"political subdivision.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AC\">Plaintiff also argues that there is no statute or other law authorizing or mandating the specific types of routine medical care provided by public general hospitals. Plaintiff has misperceived how the <em>Ross </em>definition of \"governmental function\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>should be applied. It is not necessary that there be a specific statutory provision mandating or authorizing a hospital to set bones or deliver babies. Such an interpretation would emasculate the governmental immunity act and <em>Ross, </em>as well as result in a proliferation of unnecessarily detailed legislation. <em>Ross </em>only requires that there be some constitutional, statutory, or other legal basis for the activity in which the governmental agency was engaged when the alleged tort was committed. The governmental immunity act, as interpreted by <em>Ross, </em>permits imposition of tort liability upon a governmental agency only where the agency was engaged in an ultra vires activity, i.e., an activity which is not expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by constitution, statute, or other law. <em>Ross, </em>p 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">We conclude that the care and treatment of patients by Annapolis Hospital were expressly authorized by statute. Defendant authority was established pursuant to the joint hospital authority act, MCL 331.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.2456(1) <em>et seq. </em>This act authorizes two or more cities, townships, and villages to incorporate a hospital authority in order to construct, own, and operate one or more community hospitals. \"Hospital\u201d is specifically defined in the act as a building, structure, or related facility \"intended for, incidental, or ancillary to the care of the sick or wounded, or for the care of persons requiring medical treatment . . . :\u201d MCL 331.1(2); MSA 5.2456(1)(2). The employees and agents of Annapolis Hospital were therefore engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function when the alleged torts occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">v. \"proprietary function\u201d exception</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Although the employees and agents in each case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>were engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function when they allegedly committed a tort, this does not mean that defendants are automatically entitled to immunity from tort liability. It must also be determined whether the activity at issue constituted the performance of a proprietary function. See <em>Ross, </em>p 613. If so, defendants can be held vicariously liable under \u00a7 13 of the governmental immunity act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">The immunity of the state shall not apply to actions to recover for bodily injury or property damage arising out of the performance of a proprietary function as herein defined. Proprietary function shall mean any activity which is conducted primarily for the purpose of producing a pecuniary profit for the state, excluding, however, any activity normally supported by taxes or fees. No action shall be brought against the state for injury or property damage arising out of the operation of proprietary function, except for injury or loss suffered on or after July 1, 1965. [MCL 691.1413; MSA 3.996(113).][<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Although \u00a7 13 only refers to the state, <em>Ross </em>judicially extended the statutory definition of \"proprietary function\u201d to nonsovereign governmental agencies. <em>Id., </em>pp 613-614. Thus, the following discussion of the \"proprietary function\u201d exception applies to all state and local governmental agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">In each case, plaintiffs maintain that the hospital or medical facility was performing a proprietary function because it charged a fee for the diagnosis, treatment, and care rendered to its patients. In <em>Hyde, </em>plaintiffs raised this allegation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>in their amended complaint. However, the lower courts have never passed upon the merits of this allegation. Nor is the record complete enough to permit full review of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">In <em>Faigenbaum, </em>the \"proprietary function\u201d exception was not raised until after <em>Ross </em>was decided and shortly before oral arguments were held by the Court of Appeals. That Court held, apparently as a matter of law, that the operation of a governmental care facility cannot be deemed a \"proprietary function,\u201d even where the facility charges for its services and produces an incidental profit. 143 Mich App 313-314. However, this precise issue was not fully litigated at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\"><em>Powers </em>is the only case in which a full evidentiary hearing has been conducted, and findings of fact and law made, as to whether the diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients at Annapolis Hospital constituted a proprietary function. We therefore begin our analysis of the \"proprietary function\u201d exception with a summary of the undisputed evidence presented in <em>Powers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Defendant pcha was organized in 1945 to provide medical services to the rapidly growing western Wayne County communities. The pcha currently operates five community hospitals, which serve approximately 250,000 patients annually. The number of participating communities has grown from nine to twenty-four. Each community levies an assessment on its residents to redeem construction bonds. In return, the residents are charged a lower fee for medical services than that charged to nonresident patients. Most of the pcha\u2019s revenue is generated from fees charged for medical services rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">The pcha actively competes with other health care providers for both resident and nonresident patients. In response to changing medical needs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>the communities and competition from private health care providers, the pcha has created an HMO-type health plan, built outpatient health care facilities, and entered into contractual arrangements with non-PCHA hospitals and local employers to gain -more patients. Currently, the pcha is a well-managed and fiscally sound governmental agency. As of June 30, 1983, the pcha had $9.9 million in its operation, maintenance, and receiving fund; over $30 million in its depreciation (capital expenditures) fund; and $8.3 million in its bond and interest redemption fund.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In addition, the revenue over expense account contained over $5.5 million as of June 30, 1983, and $8.4 million as of June 30, 1984.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The pcha has never distributed excess revenues to the state, participating communities, or its board of directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The trial court found that \u00a7 13 of the governmental immunity act contains two tests: 1) was the activity in question conducted primarily for the purpose of producing a pecuniary profit, and 2) was the activity supported by taxes or fees? The court concluded that even though the pcha had excess revenues, it did not operate its hospitals primarily to produce a pecuniary profit. Rather, the history of the pcha clearly indicated that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>was established to provide hospital and medical care to the participating communities. The court noted that the excess revenues were channeled into other accounts when necessary and were used solely to operate the hospitals. The fact that the pcha actively competed with other health care providers went more to Justice Moody\u2019s \"essence of governing\u201d test, which the court believed was \"ostensibly overruled\u201d by <em>Ross. </em>The court also noted that the pcha was funded in part by taxes. Summary disposition was granted to the pcha because the operation of the hospitals was a governmental, nonproprietary function.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">The trial court correctly interpreted \u00a7 13. Prior to the enactment of the governmental immunity act, decisions of this Court had differed as to how much, if any, incidental profit could be generated before an activity was deemed to be a proprietary function.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> However, the Legislature has specifically defined \"proprietary function\u201d in \u00a7 13 of the act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">Proprietary function shall mean any activity which is conducted primarily for the purpose of producing a pecuniary profit for the state,[<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>] excluding, however, any activity normally supported by taxes or fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Unlike the definition of \"governmental function,\u201d the definition of \"proprietary function\u201d is quite specific and needs no interpretation. Before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>an activity is deemed a proprietary function, it must satisfy two tests:</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">1) The activity must be conducted primarily for the purpose of producing a pecuniary profit, <em>and</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">2) The activity cannot normally be supported by taxes or fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">There is nothing in \u00a7 13 which requires that the activity actually generate a profit before it can be deemed a proprietary function. If the availability of immunity turned solely upon an examination of the ledgers and budgets of a particular activity, a fiscally responsible governmental agency would be \"rewarded\u201d with tort liability for its sound management decisions. Such a rule could discourage implementation of cost-efficient measures and encourage deficit spending. Moreover, the rule would be difficult to implement and inconsistent in its results. If an activity operates at a loss one year, but makes a profit the next year, does the availability of immunity from tort liability also change? If one of the hospitals operated by the pcha consistently operates at a loss, would immunity be granted to that hospital, but not the other fiscally sound hospitals?</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The existence of a profit is not an irrelevant consideration, however. The fact that a governmental agency pursues an activity despite consistent losses may be evidence that the primary purpose is not to make a pecuniary profit,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> but it is not conclusive evidence.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Conversely, the fact that the activity consistently generates a profit may evidence an intent to produce a profit. However, \u00a7 13 permits imposition of tort liability only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>where the <em>primary </em>purpose is to produce a pecuniary profit. It does not penalize a governmental agency\u2019s legitimate desire to conduct an activity on a self-sustaining basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Another relevant consideration is where the profit generated by the activity is deposited and how it is spent. If the profit is deposited in the governmental agency\u2019s general fund or used to finance unrelated functions, this could indicate that the activity at issue was intended to be a general revenue-raising device.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> If the revenue is used only to pay current and long-range expenses involved in operating the activity, this could indicate that the primary purpose of the activity was not to produce a pecuniary profit.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The trial court concluded that the pcha\u2019s primary purpose in operating its hospitals was to provide hospital and medical care to area residents. In light of all the evidence presented, this finding is not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Even if the funds accumulated in the revenue over expense account are deemed \"profit,\u201d this is not conclusive evidence that the pcha\u2019s primary purpose was to produce a pecuniary profit. The excess revenues were not distributed to the state, the participating communities, or members of the pcha. If other accounts were insufficient to meet current expenses, funds were withdrawn from the revenue over expense account. Thus, the first test of \u00a7 13 was not satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Even if we were to conclude that the pcha\u2019s primary purpose was to produce a pecuniary profit, the operation of the hospitals was in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>financed primarily by fees charged for medical services rendered and, to a lesser extent, taxes levied by participating communities.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Thus, the second test of \u00a7 13 was not satisfied. The trial court properly granted defendant pcha\u2019s motion for summary disposition.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The Legislature has defined \"proprietary function\u201d in a very narrow, unambiguous manner. The focus is on the primary intended purpose of the activity and how the activity is normally funded. A plaintiff who merely alleges that a governmental agency provides goods or services for a fee has not sufficiently alleged that the agency is engaged in a proprietary function. Often, an agency is required by statute or other law to charge a fee for its goods and services.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Instead, the plaintiff must allege that the primary purpose of the activity is to produce a pecuniary profit <em>and </em>that the activity is not normally supported by taxes or fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">In <em>Hyde, </em>U 5 of plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint stated</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>[t]hat the Plaintiff paid valuable consideration for the medical services rendered to her and therefore the Defendants were engaged in a proprietary function by viture [sic] of the fact that there are health care providers in the private sector of society who render the same sort of services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Plaintiffs bear the burden of pleading facts in their complaint which would justify a finding that recovery in their tort cause of action is not barred by the governmental immunity act. <em>Ross, </em>p 621, n 34; <em>Galli v Kirkeby, </em>398 Mich 527, 532, 540-541; 248 NW2d 149 (1976).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Paragraph 5 of the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint merely alleges that plaintiffs paid the University Hospital for medical services which are routinely provided by private medical facilities. Plaintiffs did not allege that the diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients at the hospital was primarily intended to produce a pecuniary profit for the state, and that this activity was not normally supported by taxes or fees. Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint failed, as a matter of law, to state a tort cause of action which falls within \u00a7 13\u2019s \"proprietary function\u201d exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">In <em>Faigenbaum, </em>plaintiff did not allege in his Court of Claims complaint that the Oakland Medical Center was engaged in a proprietary function when the malpractice occurred. Nor was this issue litigated. Plaintiff first raised the argument in his supplemental brief filed with the Court of Appeals shortly after <em>Ross </em>was decided. We will not consider this untimely and unpreserved argument. See <em>Swartz v Dow Chemical Co, </em>414 Mich 433, 446; 326 NW2d 804 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Plaintiff also asks that his contract claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>against the Oakland Medical Center be reinstated. Prior to trial, the circuit court struck Count n of plaintiffs complaint, and denied his motions for reconsideration, because the contract claim was supposedly duplicative of the tort claim. Plaintiff did not appeal any of these decisions, or raise the contract claim via a cross-appeal. The issue was raised before the Court of Appeals in plaintiffs supplemental brief filed after <em>Ross </em>was decided. The Court refused to consider the issue because it had not been properly appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The fact that substantially identical facts underlie a plaintiffs tort and nontort causes of action does not automatically render them duplicative. <em>Ross, </em>pp 647-648. The trial court should have instead determined whether plaintiff had properly pleaded and could prove the elements of a breach of contract claim. Although we do not condone plaintiffs failure to appeal this issue in a proper manner, we remand this case to the trial court for a determination on this issue. Plaintiff raised the contract claim in his complaint and its viability will determine the outcome of this litigation. <em>Swartz, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">In <em>Hyde, </em>the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed on different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">In <em>Faigenbaum, </em>the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed insofar as it held that <em>Ross </em>is to be given limited retroactive effect, and that <em>Parker </em>was impliedly overruled by <em>Ross. </em>The case is remanded to the Wayne Circuit Court for further proceedings on plaintiffs breach of contract claim.

See <em>Detroit Edison Co v Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>320 Mich 506, 519-520; 31 NW2d 809 (1948). Such an amendment has been viewed as a legislative ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>pression of the \"true construction and meaning\u201d rather than a change in law.

Because <em>Ross </em>did not consider the factual situation presented in <em>Parker, </em>it cannot properly be said today that <em>Parker </em>was impliedly overruled by <em>Ross.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">When <em>Ross </em>was decided the Court, aware of <em>Parker, </em>left open the question of <em>Parker\u2019 </em>s continued viability in recognition of the impropriety of deciding a question not before it. A question left open to be decided at a later date could not have been impliedly decided when <em>Ross </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">To be sure, there are situations where, because the facts and context are essentially the same as those in an earlier case, the Court could not properly fail to apply a rule announced in the earlier case and, hence, there has been an implied overruling by the earlier case of any still earlier contrary decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">This is not such a case. While the language of the <em>Ross </em>definition of governmental function in terms left no room for a distinction, what was said in <em>Ross </em>should, under long-established principles, be read in the context of what was then before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Ross </em>dealt with governmental operations and services that, while duplicated somewhat in the private sector, are mainly provided and funded by government and operations and services solely provided and funded by government.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">What was said in <em>Ross </em>could not foreclose this Court from recognizing, when the issue was presented, the difference and distinction between one governmental activity and another \u2014 the difference and distinction between a governmental activity mainly provided and funded by government and a governmental activity mainly provided in the private sector funded by users without significant governmental subvention.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The opinion of the Court acknowledges that \"[n]one of the nine consolidated cases decided in <em>Ross </em>involved the tort liability of a public general hospital . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It nevertheless concludes that <em>Ross </em>impliedly overruled <em>Parker </em>because <em>Ross </em>rejected all the definitions proffered by the justices in <em>Parker </em>and because the definition stated in <em>Ross </em>\"is broad and encompasses most of the activities undertaken by governmental agencies.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That explanation begs the question whether <em>Ross </em>impliedly overruled <em>Parker </em>by bootstrapping on the obiter dictum of <em>Ross.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">To the extent that the <em>Ross </em>definition embraced within its sweeping ambit \"governmental\u201d operations and services mainly provided in the private sector and mainly funded by user fees \u2014 to the extent it dealt with the question theretofore decided in <em>Parker </em>\u2014 it went beyond the ambit of what was before the Court for decision and beyond the appropriate exercise of judicial authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">What the Court says in an opinion beyond what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>is necessary to decision is necessarily obiter dictum. It can be rejected in a later case, as <em>Ross </em>rejected all the definitions of governmental function proffered in <em>Parker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">What the Court does in a particular case rather than what it says is more likely to stand the test of time. What the Court did in <em>Ross </em>was to hold that operations of schools, the Departments of Natural Resources and Mental Health, 911 and police department operations \u2014 operations without an equivalent counterpart in the private sector, operations largely funded by taxes \u2014 are governmental functions within the intendment of the governmental tort liability act. That is all the Court did or could properly do.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The view that <em>Ross </em>impliedly overruled <em>Parker </em>presupposes either that (i) there is no meaningful difference between such tax-supported governmental operations as police and fire departments, public schools, state-operated mental institutions, and the Department of Natural Resources, on the one hand, and user-supported government operations of a general hospital, on the other, or that (ii) this Court is incapable of defining the term \"governmental function\u201d in a manner both consistent with what the Court decided (as distinguished from what it said) in <em>Ross </em>and, in recognition of the difference and distinction between such governmental operations, consistent with what was decided in <em>Parker/Perry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">The Supreme Courts of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Kansas, and Minnesota,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> along with this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Court in <em>Parker/Perry, </em>differentiated between tax-supported governmental operations and the user-supported operations of a general hospital in holding that a general hospital is subject to tort liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Justice Moody recognized the difference and distinction in <em>Parker/Perry. </em>By his fourth vote, he implemented the difference and distinction for six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">It is within the competence of this Court to recognize the difference and distinction and to say, for example, that it is beyond the policy and intent of the Legislature \u2014 in excepting from the general rule of tort liability the operations of government that constitute a \"governmental function\u201d \u2014 to except from the general rule of tort liability the governmental operation of a general hospital because such hospitals, in contradistinction from other governmental operations, generally provide services obtained by most of the state\u2019s population in the private sector that are largely funded in the same manner as like services obtained in the private sector.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The Court might thus define (or redefine) \"government function\u201d for the period January 22, 1985 (the day <em>Ross </em>was announced), through June 30, 1986 (the day before Act 175 became effective), as any government activity, not ultra vires, other than a service mainly provided the state\u2019s population in the private sector that is largely funded, where provided in the public sector, in the same manner and from the same sources as like services obtained in the private sector.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">If this Court were in these consolidated cases to recognize the distinction between a general hospital and all other government operations, and to so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>define or redefine <em>Ross, </em>the result would be the same as that enacted in Act 175. The exception for services mainly provided by, and largely funded in the same manner as like services obtained in, the private sector would plainly, because of the context in which stated, mean general hospitals.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The legislative adoption of the <em>Ross </em>definition was no more than a convenient way of stating what could be said in another way with the same result. Act 175 does not imply that the Legislature viewed <em>Ross </em>as overruling <em>Parker, </em>and most importantly the enactment of Act 175 did not imply that the Legislature viewed <em>Ross </em>as correctly overruling <em>Parker </em>and a correct expression of legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\"By adopting this narrow exception to the broad immunity granted by <em>Ross </em>and codified by 1986 PA 175, it is clear\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u2014 not \"that the Legislature believed that <em>Ross </em>had impliedly overruled <em>Parker\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u2014but that the Legislature believed that the <em>Ross </em>formulation was deficient and inconsistent with sound public policy insofar as general hospitals are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">If one focuses on the effective date of July 1, 1986, one could argue, and correctly so, that the Legislature did not make the rules announced in Act 175 \u2014 the <em>Ross </em>definition modified by the <em>Par</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number><em>ker/Perry </em>distinction and qualification \u2014 effective before July 1, 1986. It does not follow that the <em>Ross </em>definition should, to the extent it is obiter dictum, be effective before July 1, 1986, or that <em>Parker/Perry </em>are overruled or superseded before July 1,1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">This Court should not insist that its word formulation in <em>Ross, </em>rejected in this one application by the Legislature, must govern decision in this case. No grand design, plan, or symmetry would be offended by continuing the rule of <em>Parker </em>through July 1, 1986, the effective date of the new legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The codification of the <em>Ross </em>definition effective July 1, 1986, as amended by the exception for general hospitals, means that the codification of the <em>Ross </em>definition as amended did not become effective until July 1, 1986. There is, to repeat, no implication from the July 1, 1986, effective date that the unamended <em>Ross </em>formulation is to be effective before July 1, 1986, or that it is codified and written in stone for the period of January 22, 1985, through June 30, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">One can as readily argue that the application before July 1, 1986, of the <em>Ross </em>definition was rejected by the Legislature, as that the continued application of <em>Parker </em>through June 30, 1986, was rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The question when, if at all, the obiter dictum of <em>Ross </em>becomes effective is a separate question which the Legislature left to the courts. This Court can readily justify delaying the effective date of the <em>Ross </em>dictum or modifying the dictum in recognition that it is dictum and the impolicy of creating a window of immunity by overruling <em>Parker. </em>There is nothing in the legislatively ordained July 1, 1986, effective date that militates for or against either result.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><em>Parker </em>should not be overruled. The result of <em>Parker </em>is now the law for causes of action that arise on and after July 1, 1986. <em>Parker </em>has governed, since 1978, in hundreds, perhaps thousands, of lawsuits settled or tried on the basis of <em>Parker. </em>There are hundreds or perhaps thousands of cases pending in the courts where litigants and lawyers in reliance of <em>Parker </em>have expended considerable energy and large sums in cases awaiting trial. Partial settlements have been entered into and nonhospital defendants not named or released from liability in reliance on the rule of <em>Parker </em>in the expectation of a day in court against a governmental hospital defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The argument that <em>Parker </em>was not precedentially binding because \"no single definition had been adopted by a majority of this Court,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> ignores both the reliance by bench and bar on the rule of <em>Parker </em>and that the <em>Ross </em>definition is not precedentially binding beyond what was before the Court in <em>Ross </em>and properly then decided. The argument that \"the consolidation of nine factually diverse cases should have signaled to the bench and bar that this Court was reevaluating the definition of 'governmental function\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> ignores that the Court could not properly reevaluate the definition of \"governmental function\u201d as applied to a general hospital because none of the nine factually diverse cases concerned the activities of a general hospital. The argument that litigants were warned by judicial dictum assumes that dictum is precedent. The argument that litigants were warned by the inability of four justices to agree on a rationale ignores the need, recognized in <em>Tebo v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number><em>Havlik, </em>418 Mich 350; 343 NW2d 181 (1984), and <em>Gusler v Fairview Tubular Products, </em>412 Mich 270; 315 NW2d 388 (1981),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of bench and bar to proceed in reliance on the last word from this Court until it speaks more decisively.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Even if <em>Ross </em>impliedly overruled <em>Parker </em>it would not be consequential if it is not overruled effective before July 1, 1986. The same considerations of fairness that prompted this Court to delay the effective date of the new rules announced in <em>Tebo </em>and <em>Gusler </em>require, at least, that the effective date of any overruling of <em>Parker </em>be delayed until January 22, 1985, the day the <em>Ross </em>definition (together with the <em>Ross </em>obiter dictum) was announced.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The opinion of the Court states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">We hold that the rules articulated in <em>Ross </em>apply to all cases commenced after January 22, 1985, the date our opinion was issued, and to those cases pending either in trial or appellate courts on January 22, 1985, in which a governmental immunity issue was properly raised and preserved.[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Footnote 35 of the opinion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-10\">Unlike other claims of immunity, sovereign and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>governmental immunity are not affirmative defenses, but characteristics of government which prevent imposition of tort liability. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">It thus appears that a governmental hospital need not plead governmental immunity as an affirmative defense and that the failure to plead an affirmative defense would not be a failure to \"preserve\u201d the governmental immunity issue. Nevertheless, under the Court\u2019s formulation, the issue must be \"properly raised.\u201d The opinion does not state whether this might have been done by motion for summary judgment, in the pretrial statement,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">It appears, since the opinion of the Court speaks in the past tense \u2014 \"was properly raised and preserved\u201d (emphasis supplied) \u2014 that the governmental immunity issue must have been properly raised and preserved by January 22, 1985. If that is a correct reading, then if a motion for summary judgment were filed after January 22, 1985, it would be too late. And since the governmental immunity issue need not be raised as an affirmative defense, raising it by answer on or before January 22, 1985, might not be to \"properly\u201d \"preserve\u201d it.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (At least those are some of the arguments one can foresee in the trial courts in the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of cases affected by what is said in today\u2019s decision.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">If, as appears, the window of immunity announced by the Court today applies only to cases where motions for summary judgment were filed on or before January 22, 1985, the effect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>decision will indeed be less because there was no reason before this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Ross </em>to file such a motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><em>Parker </em>thus is <em>not </em>overruled as to cases commenced on or before January 22, 1985, in which the defendant hospital failed to file a premature motion for summary judgment and, possibly, also is not overruled as to cases in which the defendant hospital filed a superfluous affirmative defense. If a case was filed on, say, January 15, 1985, <em>Parker </em>would probably govern because the defendant hospital\u2019s answer was not due until after January 22, 1985. If, however, the defendant hospital filed a premature motion for summary judgment that was denied, <em>Parker </em>governs despite the expenditure of energy and money preparing the case for trial in reliance on that denial which presumably would have been predicated on <em>Parker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The Court has not adequately explained why it has reached such a peculiar result now that the Legislature has spoken and clearly said that the public policy of this state is that general hospitals are not immune from and rather are subject to tort liability.</p>\n<judges id=\"b353-6\">Archer, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-6\"> MCL 691.1401; MSA 3.996(101).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b339-7\"> 1. <em>Ross, supra, </em>p 637.

Although the act does not apply to these cases, the decision of the Legislature which will apply to future cases is a helpful and valuable guide.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In <em>Parker, </em>the majority held that public general hospitals are not immune from tort liability. None of the nine cases decided in <em>Ross </em>involved that issue. The Legislature decided not to grant immunity to governmental agencies that own or operate hospitals or county medical facilities and provided that the agents or employees of such hospitals were not immune from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Months after the <em>Ross </em>decision, the Legislature held hearings on proposals to reform tort law in this state. Although the Legislature limited the noneconomic damages that some plaintiffs could recover in medical malpractice cases, other reforms were not enacted. The Legislature decided to retain tort liability for governmental agencies that own or operate certain general hospitals. Since the Legislature has expressed a clear judgment requiring certain public general hospitals to remain liable, this Court should respect that judgment. Legislators are elected representatives of the peo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>pie of this state. This decision is particularly unjust since <em>Parker </em>provides the plaintiffs with a remedy, and the Legislature has specifically provided redress for plaintiffs who are similarly situated whose causes of action happen to arise after 1986 PA 175 takes effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">The government and its agents have a duty to act responsibly in the name of the people who authorize them to act. This is especially true in the area of public health where the sick and injured are especially vulnerable and must rely upon the professional expertise of their caretakers. In expanding the scope of governmental immunity in these cases, the Court is protecting the government and its agents from the legal consequences of negligent acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">While absolute immunity from liability may be required in limited instances in order to allow some governmental agencies and employees the freedom in which to exercise their mandate from the people, such freedom is not justified in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">By authorizing the government to engage in certain activities, such as operating a public hospital, the public has not at the same time relieved the government of its duty to act with care.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">As Justice Levin correctly observed in his partial dissent in <em>Ross:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">Virtually all government activity is expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by the constitution, a statute, or other law. By perusing the statute books rather than focusing on the specific activity complained of by the plaintiff, the Court casts the net of governmental immunity too far, enabling a governmental entity to expand the scope of its immunity by promulgating an ordinance or other law relating to its activities. <em>[Ross </em>at 684.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>The majority here cites statutory authority which empowers public hospitals to function in the name of the people and then maintains that the same statute immunizes the agency and its employees when they breach the very responsibilities the statute created. The answer to the agency\u2019s liability should be determined by focusing upon the specific act or omission of the agency, not by citing the overall governmental objective of the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The determination whether a governmental agency acted within the limits of its authority still requires judicial interpretation. To state that an activity is expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by constitution, statute, local charter or ordinance, or other law adds little to the analysis we must use to determine the nature of the responsibilities of the agency and whether the specific acts alleged were beyond the public mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Because the majority ignores the precedence of <em>Parker, </em>and extends the immunity of government to an unacceptable degree, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-9\"> MCL 691.1407(4); MSA 3.996(107)(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-10\">This act does not grant immunity to a governmental agency with respect to the ownership or operation of a hospital or county medical care facility or to the agents or employees of such hospital or county medical care facility.
