The Tax Tribunal found that, if there were no zoning change, there would be no increase in the value of either property as a result of the assessment and that, even if there were a zoning change, the value of the land would increase by only $5,000 per acre for the Novi land and $15,000 per acre for the Dixon land. We hold that, while the factual findings of the tribunal are supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence, because of the large disproportionality between the cost and the benefit, as a matter of law, we cannot uphold the special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">The Dixon Road Group and Novi-Twelve Associates are limited partnerships which own land in the City of Novi. The parcels are located on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Twelve Mile Road, one-half mile west of the intersection of Twelve Mile and Novi Roads.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The properties are currently zoned R-l-F, Small Farm Agricultural Residential District. An area development plan adopted by Novi in 1978 designated the northerly portion of the Dixon Road parcel and the Novi parcel for PD-2 development and the southerly portion of the Dixon Road parcel for PD-3 development.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The PD-2 option is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>intended to permit limited mid- and high-rise development. The PD-3 option is intended to encourage intensive major nonresidential use of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">In 1981, the city determined that road improvements, water mains, and storm sewers were necessary for the area and created a special assessment district for each improvement. The total cost of these special assessments is $264,736.16 or $13,236.81 per acre for the Novi land and $765,302.33 or $38,769.11 per acre for the Dixon Road land.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Petitioners argue: 1) that the assessments are invalid because the cost of the improvements exceed the increase in value of the property and 2) that there is no special benefit conferred upon the property beyond that to the community as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The hearing officer at the Tax Tribunal found that the benefit conferred upon the properties was disproportionate to the costs allocated and therefore vacated the special assessments. The Tax Tribunal adopted most of the findings of the hearing officer, but deleted the findings on increased value. The tribunal did not adopt any specific finding of its own, but found that the land was specially benefited as a result of the improvements. The Court of Appeals affirmed the opinion of the Tax Tribunal in an opinion released on December 26, 1984. This Court then remanded the case to the Tax Tribunal with directions to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">make specific findings on <em>any </em>benefits conferred on the petitioners\u2019 properties, including any increase in valuation after the proposed improvements, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>any, 1) if the zoning is not changed, and 2) if the zoning is changed to planned development or some other use. [422 Mich 858 (1985). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In a response dated May 28, 1985, the tribunal found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">1. If the subject properties are not rezoned, the special assessment improvements will not increase the true cash value of the subject properties. This finding is consistent with the proposed judgment of the hearing officer, and based upon the reasons stated therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">2. If the subject properties are ultimately rezoned and can then be developed for use as permitted by the PD options, then the increase in value to the subject properties owing to the improvements would be $5,000/acre for the Novi Twelve parcels (010 and Oil); and $15,000/acre for the 001 parcel. This finding is also consistent with the proposed judgment of the hearing officer, and for the reasons expressed therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">I. FACTUAL FINDINGS MADE BY THE TAX TRIBUNAL ON REMAND ARE SUPPORTED BY COMPETENT, MATERIAL, AND SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE ON THE RECORD</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">On remand, the Tax Tribunal stated that the benefits which accrued to the property, assuming rezoning, were $5,000 per acre for the Novi land and $15,000 per acre for the Dixon land. These factual findings were said to be \"consistent with the proposed judgment of the hearing officer, and based upon the reasons expressed therein.\u201d The figures adopted were taken from the testimony of appraiser McDonnell.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">The primary approach used by McDonnell in evaluating the properties both before and after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>improvements involved a \"comparison of properties recently sold in the area to the subject property, and adjustment] for location, physical differences and lot size . As a result of this market data approach, McDonnell arrived at a price of $55,000 per acre for the improved Dixon Road property.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">As a further justification for this figure, he stated that on the basis of projections for future office space in the area and considering other more desirable properties available, the Dixon Road property would not be in demand for office space for about four years. He stated that \"it just seems to me that office use is really, very, very, speculative for this area . . . .\u201d He therefore took the price at which nearby small parcels of land were currently being sold for <em>immediate </em>office construction and discounted that price to reflect his belief that it would be a number of years before there would be a buyer willing to pay the going rate for either the Dixon Road or the Novi-Twelve land. The result of these calculations is a price very close to his original market data estimate as indicated in the last paragraph.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the estimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>of value adopted by the Tax Tribunal on remand is supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the record, Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 2, we uphold these factual findings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">II. SPECIAL BENEFITS MUST BE REFLECTED BY AN INCREASE IN MARKET VALUE</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The hearing officer, the Tax Tribunal in its original opinion, and the Court of Appeals all assumed that a special assessment could be supported by a showing which did not necessarily include an increase in the market value of the assessed property. We disagree. As Cooley stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">It has been said that, in assessing benefits, the only safe and practicable course, and the one which will do equal justice to all parties, is to consider what will be the influence of the proposed improvement on the market value of the property; what the property is now fairly worth in the market, and what will be its value when the improvement is made. [2 Cooley, Taxation (3d ed), ch XX, p 1254.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">Other authorities support this position._</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Undoubtedly, the simplest, fairest and most just rule, and one that best conforms to the underlying theory of the local assessment, is that the existence and amount of special benefits is to be determined by the effect of the improvement upon the market value of the property which it is claimed is benefited by such improvement. If the construction of such improvement increases the market value of such property, such property receives a benefit and the amount of such benefit is measured by the amount of such increase. [Page &amp; Jones, Taxation by Local and Special Assessment, vol II, \u00a7 653, p 1114.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\">The benefit by reason of which a special assessment is authorized to be imposed must be understood to be a pecuniary benefit resulting from the increased market value of the land, and if the use of the land imposed by law is such that it can have no market value, an assessment cannot be levied. [70 Am Jur 2d, Special or Local Assessments, \u00a7 18, p 859.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">Subject to some exceptions, the general rule is well settled that the benefits which property will derive from a local improvement and for which it may be assessed should be determined by the difference in the market value of the property before and after the making of the improvement. [63 CJS, Municipal Corporations, \u00a7 1372, p 1130.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In holding that special benefits did not need to be reflected by an increase in market value, the tribunal and the Court of Appeals relied on a Court of Appeals decision which stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">[a] special benefit may be found from an increase in value, relief from a burden or in the creation of a special adaptability in the land. <em>[Soncoff v Inkster, </em>22 Mich App 358, 361; 177 NW2d 343 (1970).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">The language of this case derives from 63 CJS, Municipal Corporations, \u00a7 1371, p 1128 and the complete sentence reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Property is specially benefited within the meaning of the law governing special assessments where the <em>improvement would increase the value of the land, relieve it from a burden, or make it specially adaptable to a purpose which enhances its value, </em>and where the assessment is fair, having regard to the value of realty benefited, and is proportioned to the property assessed, the assessment will be deemed proper. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">We do not agree with the Court of Appeals that the emphasized portions suggest that there are three <em>alternative </em>methods of calculating benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">The first phrase, \"would increase the value of the land\u201d clearly reflects the increase in market value which we believe to be the appropriate basis for determining special benefits. The third phrase, when read in its entirety, also refers to the increase in value resulting from the special adaptability of the land. It clearly does not anticipate that a finding of a special adaptability <em>without a corresponding increase in value </em>would support a finding of a special benefit. The four cases cited in support of the second phrase, \"relieve it from a burden\u201d do not support the proposition that the relief of a burden without an increase in value can be used to support a finding of a special benefit. Two of these cases explicitly require a finding that the <em>value </em>of the property be increased by the improvement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A third states that in order \"to sustain a special assessment it must appear that a benefit has been occasioned to the premises as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>sessed at least equal to the burden imposed.\u201d <em>Satter v Littleton, </em>185 Colo 90, 97; 522 P2d 95 (1974). Only the oldest case even arguably supports the proposition that the relief of a burden on the land which is not reflected in an increase in its value is a special benefit. However, in that case the court was only considering whether a cemetery derived any benefit from the installation of sewers. <em>Mullins v Mt St Mary\u2019s Cemetery Ass\u2019n, </em>268 Mo 691; 187 SW 1169 (1916). The idea that either the relief of a burden on the land or a special adaptability without an increase in the market value can justify a special assessment is at odds with the entire concept of market value which necessarily includes such improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">We believe that a determination of the increased market value of a piece of property after the improvement is necessary in order to determine whether or not the benefits derived from the special assessment are proportional to the cost incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">III. PROPORTIONALITY BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF THE SPECIAL ASSESSMENT AND THE BENEFITS RECEIVED</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">There is general agreement that there must be some proportionality between the amount of the special assessment and the benefits derived therefrom. Although various formulations of this relationship have been stated,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the concept of propor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>tionality is not new in Michigan. In <em>Fluckey v Plymouth, </em>358 Mich 447; 100 NW2d 486 (1960), this Court found that no benefits accrued to the property as a result of the special assessment, but the Court also stated that the amount of the property increased in value as a result of the expenditure had to be at least equal to the amount of the assessment. 358 Mich 453. See also <em>German Lutheran Church Society v Mt Clemens, </em>179 Mich 35, 40; 146 NW 287 (1914). (\"There can be no justification for any proceeding which charges the land with an assessment greater than the benefits.\u201d) In another case we stated that there must be reasonable proportionality between the amount of the assessment and the value of the benefits. See <em>St Joseph Twp v Municipal Finance Comm, </em>351 Mich 524, 533; 88 NW2d 543 (1958). (\"It is an essential of a special assessment that the improvement concerned should be of value to the property assessed in <em>reasonable relationship </em>to the assessment . . . .\u201d) (Emphasis added.) See also <em>Crampton v Royal Oak, </em>362 Mich 503, 520; 108 NW2d 16 (1961). (\"This court . . . accepted the view that an assessment must be levied in proportion to benefits.\u201d) We have also suggested that we would not invalidate a special assessment unless there was a \"substantial excess\u201d between the cost of an improvement and the benefits accruing to the land as a result. <em>Blades v Genesee Co Drain Dist No 2, </em>375 Mich 683, 695; 135 NW2d 420 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">While we certainly do not believe that we should require a rigid dollar-for-dollar balance between the amount of the special assessment and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>amount of the benefit, a failure by this Court to require a reasonable relationship between the two would be akin to the taking of property without due process of law. Such a result would defy reason and justice. Therefore, we conclude that while decisions made by municipalities with respect to special assessments generally should be upheld, this Court will intervene where there is a substantial or unreasonable disproportionality between the amount assessed and the value which accrues to the land as a result of the improvements. In this case, the cost of the improvements is approximately 2.6 times the increase in value of the properties and for that reason we hold the special assessment invalid.</p>\n<judges id=\"b479-5\">Levin, Cavanagh, and Archer, JJ., concurred with Williams, C.J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b479-6\">Boyle, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ArA\">Petitioners began the present action on March 24, 1981, seeking to invalidate the creation of certain special assessment districts in the City of Novi. Petitioners are landowners in the assessment districts which cover an area across from Twelve Oaks Mall, one-half mile west of Novi Road and in between Twelve Mile Road and the I-96 expressway.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The land is currently zoned for large lot, low density, single family dwellings. In anticipation of further development after the construction of Twelve Oaks Mall, the Novi City Council amended its zoning ordinance to create planned development options for multiple, commercial, and office development in the area at issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The city later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>determined that a new road system, water main, and storm drainage improvements were necessary and created special assessment districts to defray the costs of the improvements. The properties were then assessed according to the special benefits to be derived.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The parcel owned by petitioner Dixon Road Group was assessed a total cost of $765,302.33, or $38,769.11 per acre. The parcels owned by petitioner Novi-Twelve Associates were assessed a total cost of $264,736.16, or $13,236.81 per acre. Petitioners sought to vacate the assessments, contending that they were invalid because 1) the improvements did not confer a special benefit on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>the properties beyond that conferred upon the community as a whole, 2) the allocations of cost were unreasonable and out of proportion to any benefits derived from the improvements, and 3) the special assessment districts were not created pursuant to the local ordinance and statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">The hearing officer at the Michigan Tax Tribunal agreed with petitioners and in her proposed opinion and judgment declared the special assessments invalid. While adopting the bulk of the facts found by the hearing officer, the Tax Tribunal refused to accept the hearing officer\u2019s ultimate conclusion and corresponding factual support and affirmed the special assessments. The Court of Appeals upheld the decision of the Tax Tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Pursuant to petitioners\u2019 application for leave to appeal, this Court remanded this cause to the Tax Tribunal to make specific findings on the benefits conferred on petitioners\u2019 properties, including increase in valuation after the proposed improvements, if any, under the following alternative hypotheses: a) if the zoning were not changed, and b) if the zoning were changed to planned development or some other use. On remand, the Tax Tribunal simply adopted findings consistent with the findings of the hearing officer as to these questions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This Court then granted petitioners leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">\"A special assessment is in the nature of a tax upon property levied according to benefits conferred on the property.\u201d <em>Cooper, Wells &amp; Co v City of St Joseph, </em>232 Mich 255, 260; 205 NW 86 (1925) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>(quoting 1 Cooley, Taxation [4th ed], p 105).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The theory sustaining special assessments is that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>party assessed is locally and peculiarly benefited, to the extent of the assessment, over and above the ordinary benefit which one of the community receives from the public improvement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Kuick v Grand </em>Rapids, 200 Mich 582, 588; 166 NW 979 (1918). A special benefit may be found from an increase in value, relief from a burden, or in the creation of a special adaptability in the land.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Soncoff v </em>Inkster, 22 Mich App 358, 361; 177 NW2d 243 (1970), citing 63 CJS, Municipal Corporations, \u00a7 1371, p 1128. In determining whether a special benefit exists, the inquiry is not limited to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>the present use of the property, but also includes the uses rendered more feasible by the completion of the improvements. <em>Crampton v Royal Oak, </em>362 Mich 503, 514-516; 108 NW2d 16 (1961). See also 14 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d ed), \u00a7 38.33, p 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The creation of a special assessment district through the legislative powers of a municipality enjoys a presumption of validity. <em>Auditor General v Maier, </em>95 Mich 127, 131; 54 NW 640 (1893); <em>Crampton, supra. </em>Whether there is any benefit at all, or the amount of the benefit, is a decision best made by the legislative body imposing the assessment. Courts are reluctant to interfere in this legislative determination where a municipality acts in good faith and has a good reason to believe that benefits will accrue and there is no showing of fraud, mistake, discrimination, or a clear absence of the benefits claimed. <em>Frischkorn Investment Co v Detroit, </em>257 Mich 546, 552-553; 241 NW 903 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">In the case at bar, the Tax Tribunal found that a reasonable basis<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> existed for the city\u2019s conclusion that petitioners\u2019 properties would be specially benefited by the improvements at issue. In reviewing a decision of the Tax Tribunal, this Court must determine whether the decision is authorized by law and whether the decision is supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record. Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">The hearing officer in this case found that the allocated costs to the petitioners for the improve-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>merits were approximately 2.6 times the increase in value that the improvements would confer upon the parcels assessed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The hearing officer then vacated the assessments, concluding that the assessments were both unreasonable and out of proportion to the benefits conferred. <em>Axtell v City of Portage, </em>32 Mich App 491, 497; 189 NW2d 99 (1971). The Tax Tribunal refused to adopt the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion. The petitioners claim this was error. We disagree because the hearing officer\u2019s finding on increase in value was based on considerations which are contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Special assessments for improvements like the ones at issue must be based on the special benefits to the land assessed. Contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention and the assertion of the majority, however, a finding of special benefit is not limited to a measurable increase in value equal to or more than the sum they are required to pay.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>has never held that the measure of a special benefit is limited to the enhanced value of the property after it is improved. Actual and exact monetary benefit is incapable of precise quantification.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, such a rule is totally unworkable where there has been a general depression in the market value of real estate. See 63 CJS, Municipal Corporations, \u00a7 1372, p 1130.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The existence and extent of a special benefit may be determined, therefore, by considering also whether the improvements result in the relief of existing burdens or the creation of a special adaptability in the land.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These are considerations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>which embrace the actual and potential uses of the land as a result of the improvements and normally go hand in hand with an enhancement of value. So long as the value of the land is not diminished by the improvements and the relief of a burden or creation of a special adaptability in the land is clearly ascertainable, it cannot be said that the finding of a benefit to those specially assessed is without a reasonable basis. See <em>Fluckey v Plymouth, </em>358 Mich 447, 453; 100 NW2d 486 (1960); <em>Oakland Co Drain Comm\u2019r v Royal Oak, </em>325 Mich 298; 38 NW2d 413 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">The majority holds that \"a determination of the increased market value of a piece of property after the improvement is necessary in order to determine whether or not the benefits derived from the special assessment are proportional to the cost incurred.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>p 401.) It appears from this holding that the essential thrust of the majority opinion is that an increase in value established by an appraisal is a prerequisite to the validity of a special assessment. Such a holding is clearly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">A municipality\u2019s determination of the existence and extent of special benefits is presumed valid. It is well-established that this determination may be based upon an increase in value, relief of burdens to the land, or the creation of special adaptabilities in the land which enhance the land\u2019s value. While we agree that an increase in value established by an appraisal is appropriate evidence, we note that a paper valuation of each property to be assessed has never been a prerequisite to the proper initial apportionment of a special assessment. Our disagreement with the majority concerns its apparent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>holding that a finding of special benefits must be supported by an appraisal reflecting market value. In our view, such evidence is appropriate, but not a necessity to justify a special assessment, unless the presumption of validity has been legitimately overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Indeed, as early as 1892, this Court rejected increase in value as the only method of apportioning the costs of improvements because such valuations do not approach uniformity. <em>Grand Rapids School Furniture Co v Grand Rapids, </em>92 Mich 564, 569; 52 NW 1028 (1892).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Further, this Court has long accepted the front-footage method for measuring the costs of assessments. <em>Auditor General v Konwinski, </em>244 Mich 384; 221 NW 125 (1928); <em>Foren v Royal Oak, </em>342 Mich 451; 70 NW2d 692 (1955).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> McQuillin also recognizes that \"[t]he prohibition is that special taxes or local assessments shall not be levied in excess of the benefits conferred, <em>whether by the valuation, front foot, area, or any other method.\u201d </em>14 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d ed), \u00a7 38.02, p 20. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The majority also believes that \"[t]he idea that either the relief of a burden on the land or a special adaptability without an increase in the market value can justify a special assessment is at odds with the entire concept of market value which necessarily includes such improvements.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>We have never intimated a contrary position. Indeed, we agree with this statement. We further submit that an increase in value without correlative concrete advantages in the land resulting from the improvements smacks of pure sophistry and is fundamentally suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">There is no guarantee that assessments based on valuation will be uniformly upheld. See <em>St Joseph Twp v Municipal Finance Comm, </em>351 Mich 524, 533; 88 NW2d 543 (1958). As pointed out by this Court in <em>Grand Rapids School Furniture Co, supra, </em>pp 570-571:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">Is there any practical difference between a finding that the several owners of property within a given district have been benefited in a given amount, and a finding that the same property has been increased in value to that amount? The only difference is that in the one case the finding is the basis of the assessment, and in the other it is itself the assessment. In the one case the finding concludes the assessment, and in the other a percentage is to be calculated based upon the finding. Each finding is a valuation of benefits. But are they not both equally open to the same objections? Is not the valuation in each case equally arbitrary? The adjustment of percentages is purely a question of mathematics, and courts are rarely troubled with mistakes in figures. It is the valuation that the tax-payer objects to. Does it make any difference whether the amount assessed is denominated \"increased value\u201d or \"benefits?\u201d Is not this Court as well informed as to this assessment as though the amount assessed were a percentage of a larger amount? The question does not involve the taking of private property for public uses, but is simply the exercise of the inherent right of taxation. The power of taxation implies apportionment, and, when that power has been exercised, courts will not assume to declare it void unless the invasion of private rights is flagrant and its demonstration clear. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>The holding of the majority increases the risk that the method of apportionment will not achieve uniformity and will not ensure that assessments will be validly laid in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">We believe the majority has confused the theory of special benefits with the applicable standard of review. The theory of special benefits is that the land to be assessed must be specially benefited by the improvements above those benefits enjoyed by the public at large and that the exactions for the improvements must not exceed the benefits. <em>Kuick v Grand Rapids, supra. </em>Review of a special assessment, on the other hand, begins with a presumption of validity in the determination of benefits by the municipality. As explained in McQuillin, <em>supra, </em>pp 19-20 and quoted by this Court in <em>St Joseph Twp, supra, </em>pp 533-534:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">It would seem that the legislature is competent to judge of benefits. This is assumed by the current of authority. A public improvement having been made, the question of determining the area benefited by such improvement is generally held to be a legislative function, and such legislative determination, unless palpably unjust, is usually conclusive, and not subject to judicial interference unless arbitrariness, abuse or unreasonableness be shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The holding of the majority seems to be that the presumption of validity does not attach where the determination of benefits is challenged by an appraisal indicating an increase in value which differs from the municipality\u2019s determination. It therefore appears to require that the reviewing tribunal make a de novo determination as to the existence and extent of special benefits and substitute its judgment for that of the municipality. The majority would therefore replace the established standard of review with a new standard of review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>that destroys the presumption of validity. Compare <em>Foren v Royal Oak; supra; Frischkorn, supra, </em>553; <em>Fluckey, supra, </em>454.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">We adhere to the standard of review firmly established by more than a century of jurisprudence in Michigan. Under this standard, we do not believe that the petitioners in this case have rebutted the presumption of validity. In the case at bar, the Tax Tribunal found that the assessed parcels would increase in value. The amount of the increase was widely disputed. The figures adopted by the Tax Tribunal on remand as barometers of the increase in value are the same figures originally proposed by the hearing officer. The findings of the Tax Tribunal on remand are inconsistent with its original opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In its original opinion the Tax Tribunal held in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">According to <em>Crampton, supra, </em>the court must consider potential uses of the property made more feasible by the improvements as well as actual uses to determine if a special benefit exists. From the proofs submitted, there exists a strong possibility that the area could be rezoned in accordance with the master plan, to allow commercial development in the future. Thus, the proposed improvements would greatly aid Petitioners in developing the land. But even if the property is not rezoned, Petitioners would not be able to develop the property for residential use without these improvements. Further, both parties\u2019 appraisers found that the improvements would result in an increase in value, although they substantially disagreed as to how much of an increase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">As set forth in <em>Soncoff, supra, </em>the three criteria for establishing the existence of a special benefit to the property are an increase in value, a relief from an existing burden, or the creation of a special adaptability in the land. In this cause the proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>ties are increased in value by the improvements and existing burdens on the property are relieved so as to create a special adaptability in the land for profit, i.e., development either under the existing zoning or under rezoning if obtained in the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">This passage seems to state that an increase in value will inure to the land, because of the improvements even if the land is not rezoned. On remand, however, the Tax Tribunal stated that no increase in value would occur in the absence of rezoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">While this inconsistency is inexplicable and therefore troubling, it is not fatal to the decision of the Tax Tribunal upholding the special assessments. It is the future and best use of the land which is to be considered in evaluating benefits. In this case, it is not disputed that the highest and best use of the land at issue includes those uses made possible by rezoning. Therefore, the finding on increase in value after rezoning may be considered in reviewing whether the assessment was laid by arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable means if it properly takes into consideration the highest and best use of the property. In this case the finding did not. In fact, it appears that the appraisal upon which the Tax Tribunal based its finding was limited to an estimation of market value based on the land\u2019s current use.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Increase in market value based on current use is a standard too inflexible to determine whether a special benefit accrues to an affected property.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Indeed, the settled law in Michigan is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">[I]n determining whether property is benefited by a particular improvement the inquiry is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>limited to the present use of the property but, rather, to uses to which it may be put, including such as may be rendered more feasible by the carrying out of the project in connection with which the assessment is levied. <em>[Crampton v Royal Oak, supra, </em>517.][<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The appraisal which was the basis of the Tax Tribunal\u2019s findings on increase in value was made pursuant to the market data approach to estimating market value. According to the appraisal, this approach involves \"the comparison of properties recently, sold in the area to the subject property, and adjusting for location, physical differences and lot size between the properties to indicate value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZ7v\">The appraisal was calculated twice using two different sets of comparables. The first set of com-parables consisted of similar-type land sales in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>volving similar acreage and land use similar to its current use. The second set of comparables consisted of smaller parcels sold for mid- to high-rise office use. This second comparison resulted in an increase in value substantially greater than that derived under the first comparison. However, this potential price of the land was discounted to current market value to reflect the appraiser\u2019s belief that the land could not be developed as the present proposed zoning indicates for five to eight years. It is clear that if this latter value had not been discounted, the increase in value of the land would exceed the cost of the improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The majority disagrees that the appraiser considered only current use in evaluating the properties, notwithstanding that the highest and best future use of the property as improved was discounted to doublecheck a determination of market value <em>on the basis of current land use </em>and was thereby <em>totally </em>negated in the final determination. Petitioners\u2019 appraiser admitted that the reason for the discounting was his opinion that this future use is \"really, very, very speculative for this area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AS6\">According to McQuillin:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">Chances and probabilities of future use, as sufficiently near in time and definite in kind to be of practicable importance, enter into present market value, and so far as they enhance or diminish it, <em>are to be given full weight. But where they are so remote as to rest chie\u00f1y in the imagination, and do not in fact in\u00f1uence the price which customers would be willing to pay in a present sale, they cannot be the basis of a determination of bene\u00f1t or value. </em>[14 McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d ed), \u00a7 38.33.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">I would submit that if such use is so speculative that in all fairness it should be discounted for its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>effect on market value, then, in keeping with the teaching of McQuillin, supra, it cannot be the basis of a determination of benefit based on enhanced value. Yet neither the petitioners nor the majority argues that this future use for the properties is so remote as to rest chiefly in the imagination. Indeed, it seems that the majority finds the future use an appropriate consideration. I note that the hearing officer who originally formulated the findings on increase in value gave no explanation for rejecting the city\u2019s appraisal in favor of petitioners\u2019. She found no fraud or abuse of discretion. Nor is fraud or an abuse of discretion on the city\u2019s part manifest to this Court on appeal. Because I am not prepared to state that the city acted unreasonably in considering this future use as a basis for a determination of benefit to the land, it should be given full weight in a determination of market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Given that the appraisal relied upon by the Tax Tribunal limited the evaluation of the properties to their current use, we consider the amount of increase in value derived from that appraisal an inappropriate basis for invalidating the special assessments and confine our review to the remaining findings of the Tax Tribunal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"ADU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In addition to an increase in value, the Tax Tribunal, in its first opinion, found that the proposed improvements would result in relief from existing burdens because the improvements would create internal access to the petitioners\u2019 parcels and drainage and water service where none existed before. The tribunal further found a strong possibility that the parcels could be rezoned in accordance with the city\u2019s master plan to allow for commercial development. The tribunal thus concluded that the proposed improvements would create a special adaptability in the land for development. It noted that even if the property were not rezoned, the petitioners would not be able to develop the property for residential use without the improvements. The record established that due to the long, narrow shape of the parcels, the southern portions have no direct access to any public right of way. These portions are unreachable and cannot be separately developed. Petitioners\u2019 own witness agreed that the improved road system would provide a special benefit to these parcels to the extent that it made separate development of the lower portions possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">We would hold that these latter findings sustain the city\u2019s initial determination that special benefits would accrue to the properties assessed. We cannot ignore the obvious benefits conferred upon petitioners\u2019 properties when the finding of benefits is supported by material, competent, and substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>tial evidence in the record as a whole.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Foren v Royal Oak, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Petitioners also contend that the city did not act properly in creating the special assessment districts. They submit that the city failed to consider and prescribe \"what part or proportion of the cost shall be paid by special assessment upon the property especially benefited, [the] determination of benefits received by affected properties, and what part, if any, shall be paid by the City at large.\u201d Novi City Ordinance No. 79-1.04, \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The Tax Tribunal found that the city council did give due consideration to this issue and complied with the city ordinance. The record supports the Tax Tribunal\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The record also refutes petitioners\u2019 claim that they will not receive benefits from the improvements which are unique from the community as a whole. The instant case is distinguishable from <em>Stybel Plumbing, Inc v Oak Park, </em>40 Mich App 108, 113; 198 NW2d 782 (1972), cited by petitioners in support of their position. In <em>Stybel, </em>the Court of Appeals found that while the landowners directly benefited from construction of a service drive and parking lot, the public at large also received the benefit of less traffic on a major thoroughfare. The fact that this benefit was not incidental, but the purpose of the project, caused the Court of Appeals to hold that the public must bear its fair share of the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">In the case at bar, the proposed road system is consistent with the city\u2019s regional plan. The record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>indicates, however, that it is designed solely as an access road for development west of Novi Road and any effect on current traffic on Novi and Twelve Mile Roads would be nonexistent or incidental. Moreover, the parcels assessed will peculiarly benefit from the water and drainage systems not only because such systems are not existing there now, but also because the risk of failing to secure easements from neighboring lands for the development of alternative privately placed systems is removed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Therefore, petitioners\u2019 claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Petitioners\u2019 final contention is that the hearing officer\u2019s decision should be adopted in toto by this Court because the hearing officer had a firsthand opportunity to view the witnesses and was in the best position to determine credibility and make findings of fact. We cannot accept petitioners\u2019 contention. This is not a case which turned upon credibility. Cf. <em>MERC v Detroit Symphony Orchestra, Inc, </em>393 Mich 116; 223 NW2d 283 (1974). Nor did the hearing officer extend credibility as one of the reasons for accepting petitioners\u2019 appraisal of the property over the city\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">It is sufficient that the Tax Tribunal\u2019s decision affirming the city\u2019s levy of the special assessment is supported by material, competent, and substantial evidence on the whole record. Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28. For the foregoing reasons, the Court of Appeals decision affirming the decision of the Tax Tribunal should be affirmed._</p>\n<judges id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Brickley and Riley, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\"> According to the Tax Tribunal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">[W]hen application for development under either option requires rezoning the land, an application to rezone shall be made to the planning board for review and recommendation to the city council.

This Court, in <em>Cooper, </em>also quoted with approval the following language from <em>Town of Macon v Patty, </em>57 Miss 378; 34 Am Rep 451 (1879), which further explained the differences between a tax and special assessment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">A local assessment can only be levied on land; it cannot, as a tax can, be made a personal liability of the taxpayer; it is an assessment on the thing supposed to be benefited. A tax is levied on the whole State, or a known political subdivision, as a county or town. A local assessment is levied on property situated in a district created for the express purpose of the levy, and possessing no other function, or even existence, than to be the thing on which the levy is made. A tax is a continuing burden, and must be collected at stated short intervals for all time, and without it government cannot exist; a local assessment is exceptional both as to time and locality, \u2014 it is brought into being for a particular occasion, and to accomplish a particular purpose, and dies with the passing of the occasion and the accomplishment of the purpose. A tax is levied, collected, and administered by a public agency, elected by and responsible to the community upon which it is imposed; a local assessment is made by an authority <em>ab extra. </em>Yet it is like a tax, in that it is imposed under an authority derived from the legislature, and is an enforced contribution to the public welfare, and its payment may be enforced by the summary method allowed for the collection of taxes. It is like a tax, in that it must be levied for a public purpose, and must be apportioned by some reasonable rule, among those upon whose property it is levied. It is unlike a tax, in that the proceeds of the assessment must be expended in an improvement from which a benefit clearly exceptive and plainly perceived must enure to the property upon which it is imposed, or else the courts will interfere to prevent its enforcement.

Property may derive a special benefit from the construction of a sewer forming part of a general sewer system. So, the benefit accruing to property by reason of the greater facility with which fire protection can be afforded it, is proper for considering benefits derived from the paving of a street. The improved sanitary condition of surrounding property, made more healthful by the construction of a sewer, may be considered in determining the benefits to a lot from such sewer. If a sewer takes surface water from a lot more speedily than it was removed before, that fact may be considered as a benefit. In opening or extending a street it is proper to consider the benefit accruing to property from fronting on a street that is a thoroughfare. Under a statute creating a corporation to build a railroad passenger station and requiring the extension of streets and widening of one to accommodate the public in the use of the station, benefits accruing to land by reason of the construction of the station by the corporation may be considered, as well as those derived from widening and extending the streets, and such do not invalidate the statute.

While the amount of the increase is disputed, what has not been established, as was in <em>Fluckey, </em>is a detriment other than that to the pocketbooks of the assessed property owner. It has not been established in this case that the property itself will be detrimentally affected by the improvements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b486-9\"> It is true that special assessments for a public improvement, such as a drain, must be based on the special benefits to the land assessed therefor. Cross-appellants claim that such benefits must be measured by the enhanced value of the land due to the drain as determined many years after the drain was constructed. This is not correct. Drains are not only for the purpose of improving the land, but are also for improving the sanitation and health of the residents and municipalities of the entire district. The exact and actual monetary benefit to any individual parcel of land would be difficult to measure and at most can only be estimated with a fair degree of exactness. <em>[Oakland Co Drain Comm\u2019r v Royal Oak, </em>325 Mich 298, 313; 38 NW2d 413 (1949), cert den 338 US 890 (1949).

Assume that two properties front upon a dirt road which is later determined to be in need of paving. One property is already improved with a building while the other is not. If the assessments for the paving are apportioned according to valuation, it may well be that the improved property will be assessed a greater proportion than the unimproved property because the paving increases its value more than the unimproved property. Yet the advantages to both properties are clearly the same.

Minnesota has apparently adopted the rule that the value of special benefits is found by determining what increase, if any, there has been in the market value of the benefited land. <em>In re Village of New Brighton Resolution 862, </em>293 Minn 356, 199 NW2d 435 [1972], The difficulty with rigidly applying this rule is that a search for increased market value resulting from the special benefit tends to examine the property\u2019s increased value in terms of the current use of the property. The better rule looks to the benefits accruing to the property in light of highest and best future use of the property that can reasonably be expected. <em>Goodell v City of Clinton, </em>Iowa, 193 NW2d 91 [1971]. See also 63 CJS Municipal Corporations \u00a7 1372b. Accordingly, the strict market value increase rule has been rejected in a number of jurisdictions. See, e.g., <em>Chicago, RI &amp; P Ry Co v City of Centerville, </em>172 Iowa 444, 153 NW 106 [1915]; <em>Foren v City of Royal Oak, </em>342 Mich 451, 70 NW2d 692 [1955]; <em>Beh v City of West Des Moines, </em>257 Iowa 211, 131 NW2d 488 [1965]; <em>Soo Line Railroad Co v City of Wilton, ND, </em>172 NW2d 74 [1969]; <em>Davis v City of Westland, </em>45 Mich App 497, 206 NW2d 750 [1973]; <em>Buehler v City of Mandan, ND, </em>239 NW2d 522 [1976]; <em>NEBCO, Inc v Speedlin, </em>198 Neb 34, 251 NW2d 710 [1977].</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b495-6\"> Given the fact that we do not consider the finding on the amount of increase in value a competent basis for our review in this case, we do not address the issue of proportionality framed by the parties, that is, whether a special assessment must fail where an increase in fair market value is not equal to or more than the cost of the improvement. We would note, however, that increase in value is a factor which is often subject to conflicting expert testimony. Due to the fluctuating economic climate, an estimated increase in value may either never come to pass or may come to pass many times its current expectation. Therefore, while depreciated value is a clear sign of no special benefit, see <em>Fluckey v Plymouth, supra, </em>the same cannot always be said of an increase in value which is less than the cost of the improvements. In the latter case, it seems necessary for a court, in reviewing the validity of a special assessment, to examine the nature of the benefits conferred in terms of relieving existing burdens and creating special uses for the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Moreover, because exact equality of taxation is not always attainable, the excess of cost over increase in value would have to be substantial and of material character before a court should restrain the enforcement of the special assessment. <em>Norwood v Baker, </em>172 US 269; 19 S Ct 187; 43 L Ed 443 (1898); see also <em>Fluckey v Plymouth, supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b497-10\"> Our review is not limited to the finding of the Tax Tribunal presented to us on remand.
