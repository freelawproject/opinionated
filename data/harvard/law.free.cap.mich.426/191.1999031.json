This subsection provides that an employee \"who suffers accidental bodily injury while an occupant of a motor vehicle <em>owned or registered by the employer, </em>shall receive personal protection insurance benefits to which the employee is entitled <em>from the insurer of the furnished vehicle \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) We find, however, that an out-of-state vehicle not required to be registered in Michigan and not operated in this state for more than thirty days is not subject to the security provisions or \u00a7 3114(3) of the no-fault act and that when an employee is injured while an occupant of such a vehicle, the employee\u2019s personal insurer, if there is one, must pay the employee\u2019s personal protection benefits under \u00a7 3101(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Roadway Express, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Ohio, is engaged in the interstate transportation of goods. Roadway employed Wayne Parks, a resident of Michigan, as a driver, salesperson, and dock worker. On March 13, 1981, Parks was working inside a Roadway trailer located at Roadway\u2019s Muskegon terminal. In the course of lifting a carton of brass fittings, he suffered an injury subsequently diagnosed as an hiatal hernia.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">The trailer in which Parks was injured, No. 95836, was owned by Roadway and registered in the State of Tennessee and several states other than Michigan. The tractor to which the trailer was attached was owned by Roadway and licensed and registered in the State of Michigan. Roadway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>was self-insured, and thus no no-fault insurance policy covered trailer No. 95836. An uncontested affidavit from Roadway\u2019s director of systems and procedures established that the trailer had been operated in Michigan for only three days in 1981, up to and including March 13, 1981. An uncontested affidavit from Roadway\u2019s director of equipment registration established that the trailer was not required to be registered under a multistate agreement between the States of Michigan and Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">On July 15, 1981, Parks filed suit to recover no-fault benefits against Roadway, his self-insured employer, and against the Detroit Automobile Inter-Insurance Exchange, his personal automobile insurer. Parks subsequently added the Department of State Assigned Claims Facility as a defendant. The trial court granted Roadway\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that Roadway\u2019s ownership of trailer No. 95836 could not subject Roadway to liability under the no-fault act because the trailer was not subject to the act\u2019s security requirements. The trailer was not required to be registered in Michigan because a multistate registration agreement between Michigan and Tennessee exempted the trailer from the registration requirement and because the trailer had been operated in Michigan for less than thirty days within the calendar year when Parks was injured. The trial court held, without indicating its rationale, that the no-fault act required the daiie to provide Parks with no-fault benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the act required Roadway to assume responsibility for Parks\u2019 no-fault benefits because Roadway was the self-insured owner of the vehicle furnished to Parks. <em>Parks v DAIIE, </em>138 Mich App 520, 527-529; 360 NW2d 238 (1984). The Court of Appeals rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>soned that the question whether an owner is <em>required </em>to register a vehicle and subject itself to the mandatory security requirements of \u00a7 3101 has no bearing on the question whether the owner could be held liable for benefits under \u00a7\u00a7 3105 and 3114. <em>Id. </em>On June 26, 1985, we granted leave to appeal. 422 Mich 937.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">II. STATUTORY PROVISIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The parties are in agreement about two preliminary conclusions. First, the trailer in which Parks was injured was a \"motor vehicle\u201d with an identity separate from that of the tractor to which it was attached. Under the no-fault act, \"motor vehicle\u201d is defined as \"a vehicle, <em>including a trailer, </em>operated or designed for operation upon a public highway by power other than muscular power which has more than 2 wheels.\u201d MCL 500.3101(2)(c); MSA 24.13101(2)(c). Accord <em>Kelly v Inter-City Truck Lines, Inc, </em>121 Mich App 208, 209-211; 328 NW2d 406 (1982). For this reason, we look to the registration of the <em>trailer </em>to determine which insurer is liable. Second, Parks is entitled to personal protection benefits under the no-fault act because he was using a parked motor vehicle at the time of his injury, and this situation falls within the statutory exception for injuries resulting from contact with property being unloaded from the vehicle. MCL 500.3105, 500.3106(b); MSA 24.13105, 24.13106(b). The only question remaining is which of the three insurers is required to pay Parks benefits, his personal automobile insurer (daiie) pursuant to \u00a7 3101(1), his employer, as a self-insurer (Roadway) pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 3102(1) and 3114(3), or, if neither of these is liable, the Assigned Claims Facility pursuant to MCL 500.3171 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 24.13171 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>To resolve this question, the no-fault act and other relevant statutory provisions must be examined. Our task throughout is to give expression to the underlying legislative purpose by harmonizing different provisions of the same statute, and by construing statutes in pari materia to give the fullest effect to each provision. <em>People v Smith, </em>423 Mich 427, 441; 378 NW2d 384 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">We begin with the first two sections of the no-fault act, which identify vehicles subject to the mandatory security provisions of the act. The first provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\">The <em>owner </em>or registrant <em>of a motor vehicle required to be registered in this state shall maintain security </em>for payment of benefits under personal protection insurance, property protection insurance, and residual liability insurance. Security shall be in effect continuously during the period of registration of the motor vehicle. [MCL 500:3101(1); MSA 24.13101(1). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">The second, applicable particularly to nonresident owners or registrants of motor vehicles, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">A nonresident owner or registrant of a motor vehicle not registered in this state shall not operate or permit the vehicle to be operated in this state for an aggregate of more than 30 days in any calendar year unless he or she continuously maintains security for the payment of benefits. [MCL 500.3102(1); MSA 24.13102(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">The trailer in which Parks was injured does not appear to be subject to the mandatory security requirements of the act under either of these two provisions. First, \u00a7 3101(1) applies only to owners or registrants of vehicles \"required to be registered in this state.\u201d The Legislature created the High<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>way Reciprocity Board and has authorized it to enter into reciprocal compacts with other states regarding the operation of trailers engaged in interstate commerce. MCL 3.161 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 9.1735 <em>et seq. </em>Under a compact entered into by the State of Michigan and the State of Tennessee, the trailer in which Parks was injured was <em>not </em>required to be registered in Michigan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, the trailer was not subject to the mandatory security requirement in \u00a7 3101(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Second, \u00a7 3102(1) applies only to vehicles owned by nonresidents and not registered in this state. Security must be maintained for vehicles operated in this state for more than thirty days in a single calendar year. Roadway falls within \u00a7 3102(1) because it is a nonresident corporation and because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>trailer No. 95836 was not registered in Michigan. However, Roadway\u2019s director of systems and procedures attested that trailer No. 95836 had been operated in Michigan for only three days in 1981, up to and including March 13, 1981, the date of Parks\u2019 injury. Thus, the trailer was not subject to the mandatory security requirements of \u00a7 3102(1) at the time of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The trailer in which Parks was injured was not subject to the vehicle registration requirements of this state; nor was it subject to the mandatory security requirements of the no-fault act. Nevertheless, the daiie contends that the plain language and judicial construction of the priority provisions of the no-fault act permit Roadway to be held responsible for Parks\u2019 benefits. Thus, the priority provisions for insurance liability and the case law interpreting them must be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">III. PRIORITY OF PAYMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The no-fault act begins with \u00a7 3101(1), which for the convenience of the reader is quoted again as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">The owner or registrant of a motor vehicle required to be registered in this state shall maintain security for payment of benefits under personal protection insurance, property protection insurance, and residual liability insurance. Security shall be in effect continuously during the period of registration of the motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">The no-fault act then specifies the order in which various potentially liable insurers will be required to cover a claim for benefits. The relevant sections are set forth below to clarify the legislative plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>(1) <em>Except as provided in subsections </em>(2), <em>(3), </em>and (5), a <em>personal protection insurance policy </em>described in section 3101(1) <em>applies to accidental bodily injury to the person named in the policy, </em>the person\u2019s spouse, and a relative of either domiciled in the same household, <em>if the injury arises from a motor vehicle accident. . . .</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">(2) [Addresses motor vehicles transporting passengers; not relevant here.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">(3) An <em>employee, </em>his or her spouse, or a relative of either domiciled in the same household, <em>who suffers accidental bodily injury while an occupant of a motor vehicle owned or registered by the employer, shall receive personal protection insurance bene\u00f1ts </em>to which the employee is entitled <em>from the insurer of the furnished vehicle.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">(4) Except as provided in subsections (1) to (3), a person suffering accidental bodily injury arising from a motor vehicle accident while an occupant of a motor vehicle shall claim personal protection insurance benefits from insurers in the following order of priority:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\">(a) The insurer of the owner or registrant of the vehicle occupied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-10\">(b) The insurer of the operator of the vehicle occupied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-11\">(5) [Addresses motorcycle operators or passengers; not relevant here.] [MCL 500.3114; MSA 24.13114.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-12\">Sections 3101(1) and 3114(1) set forth the general rule of priority: A no-fault insurance policy, which owners of vehicles required to be registered in the state must maintain as security, covers all injuries arising from the use of motor vehicles suffered by persons named in the policy. In other words, the general rule is that one looks to a person\u2019s own insurer for no-fault benefits unless one of the statutory exceptions, subsections 2, 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>and 5, applies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, under subsection 1, Parks would have to look to his personal insurer, daiie, for coverage of his benefits unless one of the statutory exceptions applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The only rule of exception that may be applicable to the facts of this case is subsection 3, which deals with employees injured while occupying motor vehicles furnished by their employer. The daiie contends that because Parks suffered \"bodily injury while an occupant of a motor vehicle owned or registered by\u201d Roadway, Parks should look to Roadway as \"the insurer of the furnished vehicle\u201d for benefits. Roadway does not deny that it is the owner and insurer of the vehicle furnished to Parks, but responds that it does not come within the priority provision subsection 3 because the vehicle in which Parks was injured was not required to be registered under the no-fault act.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The problem before us is one of examining the mandatory security provisions and the priority provisions, both of which are central to the purposes of the act. While the act\u2019s priority section does not directly address the situation in which security is not required, an analysis of the general provisions of the act and the Legislature\u2019s intention reveals who is liable for Parks\u2019 no-fault benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Case law confirms our construction of the priority provisions of the no-fault act. This Court has recently held that when an employee is injured by occupying a vehicle not required to be registered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>in this state, the employee\u2019s personal insurer should be looked to for coverage. <em>Lee v DAIIE, </em>412 Mich 505; 315 NW2d 413 (1982). In <em>Lee, </em>an employee of the United States Postal Service injured his back unloading mail from a government-owned mail truck. Because government-owned vehicles are not subject to registration requirements, MCL 257.216(f); MSA 9.1916(f), the vehicle was not subject to the mandatory security requirements of \u00a7 3101(1) of the no-fault act, and hence was uninsured. The Court of Appeals held that the employee\u2019s personal insurer could not be held liable for benefits, reasoning that the Legislature did not intend to compensate persons injured in uninsured vehicles. We disagreed, finding that the broad language of \u00a7 3105(1), providing that benefits must be paid \"for accidental bodily injury arising out of the ownership, operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle\u201d required a personal automobile insurer to pay benefits under circumstances in which the vehicle involved was not registered or insured. <em>Id., </em>p 512. We reasoned that this reading of the no-fault act furthered the Legislature\u2019s purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">[T]he Legislature, in its broader purpose, intended to provide benefits whenever, as a general proposition, an insured is injured in a motor vehicle accident, whether or not a registered or covered motor vehicle is involved; and <em>in its narrower purpose intended that an injured person\u2019s personal insurer stand primarily liable </em>for such benefits <em>whether or not its policy covers the motor vehicle involved and even if the involved vehicle is covered by a policy issued by another no-fault insurer. [Id., </em>p 515. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The emphasized portion of the quotation makes clear that our decision was based on the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>decision to impose primary responsibility upon the employee\u2019s personal insurer. The decision did not turn on the absence of coverage for the employer\u2019s vehicle. This distinction is critical in this case, because, while Roadway\u2019s trailer is not <em>required </em>to be registered, Roadway <em>is self-insured, </em>and therefore trailer No. 95836 cannot be considered uninsured in the same sense as the postal vehicle in <em>Lee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Two Court of Appeals opinions support our analysis in <em>Lee. </em>In <em>Covington v Interstate System, </em>88 Mich App 492; 277 NW2d 4 (1979), the Court of Appeals also held that an employee could not recover personal protection benefits from his employer\u2019s insurer when the employer\u2019s vehicle was not required to be registered in this state. The facts in <em>Covington </em>are nearly identical to those in this case. An employee was driving his employer\u2019s vehicle, which was registered and licensed in another state. The employer was self-insured, and refused to provide benefits on the ground that the truck being driven by the employee was not a vehicle subject to the requirements of the no-fault act. <em>Id., </em>p 493. The Court of Appeals agreed with the employer, reasoning that the express language of \u00a7 3101(1) subjected only vehicles required to be registered in this state to the requirements of the act. <em>Id., </em>pp 493-494.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">While <em>Covington </em>was decided before <em>Lee, </em>another decision released following <em>Lee </em>furthers this analysis of the act. In <em>Citizens Ins Co v Roadway Express, Inc, </em>135 Mich App 465; 354 NW2d 385 (1984), lv den 421 Mich 857 (1985), the Court of Appeals again held that an employee\u2019s personal automobile insurer rather than the self-insured employer was liable for no-fault benefits. The facts in <em>Citizens </em>are remarkably similar to those in the case at bar: Roadway\u2019s employee was injured in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>trailer that was licensed in another state and had not been in this state long enough to require insurance coverage under \u00a7 3102(1). The primary issue in the case was whether the trailer was a \"motor vehicle\u201d separate from the tractor. After finding that the trailer was a separate \"motor vehicle,\u201d the Court concluded that the trailer was \"uninsured\u201d for purposes of the no-fault act and held the employee\u2019s personal automobile insurer liable for benefits. <em>Id., </em>pp 469, 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">From a clear reading of the no-fault act and the reasoning of the cited case law, we find the following: First, the plain language of \u00a7 3101(1) subjects only those vehicles required to be registered in this state to the mandatory security requirements. The fact that a vehicle is actually covered by an insurance policy, or that the owner of the vehicle is self-insured, does not alter whether the vehicle itself need or need not conform to the requirements of the act. Second, the policy of the Legislature was to provide a method whereby persons injured in automobile accidents would be readily provided relief from the results of their injury. Third, the primary method of accomplishing this result, from the general rule in \u00a7 3114(1), is that one looks to one\u2019s own insurer for no-fault benefits unless one of the statutory exceptions applies. Fourth, the exception of an employee injured in an employer\u2019s vehicle contained in subsection 3 of \u00a7 3114 applies only in the case in which the insured vehicle is required to be registered in this state. Fifth, because the vehicle was not registered in this state and thus the exception of subsection 3 does not apply, we look to the general intention of the Legislature in \u00a7 3114(1) to provide compensation for liability through the injured person\u2019s personal insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>The no-fault act was intended to minimize uncertainties and to provide a relatively simple means of compensating those injured in automobile accidents. Holding the employee\u2019s personal insurer liable for benefits when the employer\u2019s vehicle is not required to be registered best effects this goal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In conclusion, we hold that when an employee is injured in an employer\u2019s out-of-state vehicle, which is not required to be registered in this state under the motor vehicle registration act and the pertinent multistate agreement, and when the vehicle is not subject to the security provisions of the no-fault act because it has not been operated in this state for more than thirty days within the calendar year, the employee\u2019s personal automobile insurer, in this case the daiie, is liable for no-fault benefits under \u00a7\u00a7 3105 and 3114(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">IV. REMAINING ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Two ancillary issues remain in this case. The first is whether \u00a7 3163 of the no-fault act subjects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Roadway to liability for Parks\u2019 no-fault benefits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That section states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">An insurer authorized to transact automobile liability insurance and personal and property protection insurance in this state shall file and maintain a written certification that any accidental bodily injury or property damage occurring in this state arising from the ownership, operation, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle by an out-of-state resident who is insured under its automobile liability insurance policies, shall be subject to the personal and property protection insurance system set forth in this act. [MCL 500.3163(1); MSA 24.13163(1).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The daiie contends that Roadway was required to file the \u00a7 3163 certificate because it was an \"insurer.\u201d The daiie also argues that Parks\u2019 injury arose out of the use of the trailer by an out-of-state resident because Roadway is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Ohio. Assuming this to be true, then Roadway is \"subject to the . . . insurance system\u201d and must cover Parks\u2019 benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">This argument must fail under the plain language of the statute. First, Roadway\u2019s status as a self-insurer does not place it in the category of \"[a]n insurer authorized to transact automobile liability insurance and personal and property protection insurance in this state . . . .\u201d MCL 500.3163(1); MSA 24.13163(1). See also MCL 500.3101(3); MSA 24.13101(3) (specifically addressing insurers \"duly authorized to transact business\u201d; by contrast, self-insurers are addressed in \u00a7 3101(4) with language stating that the required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>security \"may be provided by any other method approved by the secretary of state as affording security equivalent to that afforded by a policy of insurance\u201d). Cf. MCL 500.3105(1); MSA 24.13105(1) (referring generally to an insurer\u2019s liability to pay benefits). Because the language of \u00a7 3163 is specific to \"authorized\u201d insurers, this is not a situation in which the \"context\u201d permits treating self-insurers as insurance companies, pursuant to \u00a7 3101(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Second, \u00a7 3163 applies to situations in which the injury arises out of the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle by an out-of-state resident. <em>Mills v Auto-Owners Ins, Inc, </em>413 Mich 567, 571-572; 321 NW2d 651 (1982). In <em>Mills, </em>the injured out-of-state motorcyclist was entitled to no-fault benefits because, even though a motorcycle is not a \"motor vehicle\u201d as defined in the no-fault act, the other party involved in the accident was using a motor vehicle. The <em>Mills </em>Court held that \u00a7 3163 did not require the insurer of the out-of-state motorcyclist to cover his injuries because the injuries did not arise from the use of a \"motor vehicle\u201d <em>by </em>the out-of-state resident; rather, the insurer of the Michigan-insured vehicle was required to cover the motorcyclist\u2019s injuries. Accord <em>Guibord v Farmers Ins Exchange, </em>110 Mich App 218; 312 NW2d 219 (1981). Because the injury at issue in the case at bar arose out of the use of the trailer by Parks, a Michigan resident, \u00a7 3163 is simply not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Some may consider \u00a7 3163 to apply to Roadway because the accident arose from Roadway\u2019s <em>ownership </em>of the motor vehicle. However, the mere fact that Roadway owned trailer No. 95836 would not subject it to liability for Parks\u2019 injury. The critical word is the possessive \"its\u201d in the phrase \"who is insured under its automobile liability insurance policies.\u201d The \"its\u201d refers to the \"insurer\u201d in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>opening phrase of the section; therefore Roadway, as the out-of-state resident owner of the implicated motor vehicle, would be subject to liability only if it were an \"insurer authorized to transact automobile liability insurance ... in this state.\u201d Because Roadway is not \"an insurer authorized to transact automobile liability insurance,\u201d it is not subject to \"the personal and property protection insurance system set forth in this act.\u201d Thus, Roadway is not liable for Parks\u2019 injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The final question to be resolved in this case is whether the daiie can escape liability for Parks\u2019 injuries and shift the burden of coverage to the Assigned Claims Facility. A person entitled to no-fault benefits may obtain them through an assigned claims plan \"if no personal protection insurance is applicable to the injury, no personal protection insurance applicable to the injury can be identified, ... or the only identifiable personal protection insurance applicable to the injury is, because of financial inability of 1 or more insurers to fulfill their obligations, inadequate to provide benefits up to the maximum prescribed.\u201d MCL 500.3172; MSA 24.13172.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The preceding analysis of the no-fault act and the decisions interpreting it make clear that Parks\u2019 own personal protection insurance is \"applicable to the injury.\u201d To reiterate: Roadway cannot be held liable for Parks\u2019 no-fault benefits as the self-insured employer which furnished the vehicle because the vehicle was not required to be registered in Michigan. However, this does not mean that no personal protection insurance applies to the injury. On the contrary, \u00a7\u00a7 3105 and 3114(1) permit Parks\u2019 personal automobile insurer, the daiie, to be held liable for injuries arising out of Parks\u2019 use of the trailer, in spite of the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Roadway did \"cover\u201d the vehicle as a self-insurer. See <em>Lee, supra, </em>pp 515-516; <em>Citizens, supra, </em>p 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">For all the reasons above, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and find that Parks\u2019 personal liability insurer, daiie, must pay his personal protection benefits because Roadway\u2019s trailer No. 95836 was a vehicle which was not required to be registered in Michigan and was not subject to the security provisions of the no-fault act.</p>\n<judges id=\"b287-6\">Brickley, Boyle, and Riley, JJ., concurred with Williams, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-9\"> See pertinent texts of these sections, <em>infra, </em>pp 199, 202.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b276-7\"> Pursuant to the Michigan vehicle act and the multistate agreement authorized by the highway reciprocity act, Roadway\u2019s trailer was not required to be registered in this state.

The majority holds that an employee\u2019s personal no-fault insurance carrier is liable for no-fault benefits when the employee is injured while occupying an employer-owned motor vehicle that is not required to be registered in this state or subject to the state\u2019s mandatory security provisions under the no-fault act. I dissent from this holding because the unambiguous language of the priority provisions of the no-fault act evinces a legislative intent to hold an employer\u2019s insurer primarily liable for personal protection insurance benefits when an employee is injured while occupying a motor vehicle owned or registered by his employer. Since Roadway, the injured employee\u2019s employer, is self-insured, Roadway should be held liable for the payment of plaintiff\u2019s personal protection insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">The no-fault act specifies the order of priority between insurers to pay personal protection insurance benefits. Section 3114 of the act establishes this priority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-10\">(1) Except as provided in subsections (2), (3), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>(5), a personal protection insurance policy described in section 3101(1) applies to accidental bodily injury to the person named in the policy, the person\u2019s spouse, and a relative of either domiciled in the same household, if the injury arises from a motor vehicle accident. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">(2) [Addresses motor vehicles transporting passengers; not relevant here.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">(3) An employee, his or her spouse, or a relative of either domiciled in the same household, who suffers accidental bodily injury while an occupant of a motor vehicle owned or registered by the employer, shall receive personal protection insurance benefits to which the employee is entitled from the insurer of the furnished vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\">(4) Except as provided in subsections (1) to (3), a person suffering accidental bodily injury arising from a motor vehicle accident while an occupant of a motor vehicle shall claim personal protection insurance benefits from insurers in the following order of priority:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-9\">(a) The insurer of the owner or registrant of the vehicle occupied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-10\">(b) The insurer of the operator of the vehicle occupied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-11\">(5) [Addresses motorcycle operators or passengers; not relevant here.] [MCL 500.3114; MSA 24.13114.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">The personal protection insurance policy described in \u00a7 3101(1) refers to the mandatory security requirement for an owner or registrant of a motor vehicle required to be registered in this state. MCL 500.3101(1); MSA 24.1310K1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hence, \u00a7\u00a7 3101(1) and 3114 establish, as a general rule of priority, that one\u2019s personal no-fault insurer is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>liable for benefits for all injuries arising out of the use of any motor vehicle by the named insured. However, \u00a7 3114(2), (3), and (5) are exceptions to this general rule. Subsection (3) is relevant to the facts of this case. To repeat, this subsection provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">An <em>employee, </em>his or her spouse, or a relative of either domiciled in the same household, <em>who suffers accidental bodily injury while an occupant of a motor vehicle owned or registered by the employer, shall receive personal protection insurance benef\u00edts </em>to which the employee is entitled <em>from the insurer of the furnished vehicle. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Pursuant to the unambiguous language of this subsection, an employee need only show that he was injured while occupying a motor vehicle owned or registered by his employer in order to recover benefits from his employer\u2019s insurer. The plain language of the statute does not require that the employer\u2019s motor vehicle be registered in this state or subject to the state\u2019s mandatory security provisions under the no-fault act. Furthermore, as defined in the act, a motor vehicle does not have to be registered in this state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">\"Motor vehicle\u201d means a vehicle, including a trailer, operated or designed for operation upon a public highway by power other than muscular power which has more than 2 wheels.

The certain and unambiguous language of \u00a7 3114(1) and (3) establishes that the Legislature intended that the insurers of employers be liable for personal protection insurance benefits when an employee is injured while occupying an employer-owned or registered motor vehicle. Unlike the majority, I do not believe that the Legislature intended that an employer\u2019s insurer\u2019s liability for no-fault benefits be conditioned upon the employer\u2019s vehicle being registered in this state or subject to this state\u2019s mandatory security provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">We have previously held that an employee can recover no-fault benefits from a self-insured employer when the employee is injured in the employer\u2019s vehicle despite the exclusivity provision in the Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation Act. <em>Mathis v Interstate Motor Freight, </em>408 Mich 164, 175; 289 NW2d 708 (1980). In <em>Lee v DAIIE, </em>412 Mich 505, 516; 315 NW2d 413 (1982), we held that an employee\u2019s personal no-fault insurer may be liable for no-fault benefits when the employer\u2019s vehicle is uninsured. Our holding in <em>Lee </em>was specifically limited to the facts of that case, which involved an uninsured motor vehicle. Furthermore, in concluding that the sections of the no-fault act requiring certain vehicles to be insured have nothing to do with those sections setting forth whether benefits are payable and which insurer is liable, we stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">\n<em>There is no language qualifying the right to bene\u00f1ts or the insurer\u2019s duty to pay them with a </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>\n<em>requirement that such motor vehicle be a \"registered,\u201d \"insured,\u201d or \"covered\u201d motor vehicle as indeed might easily have been done had the Legislature so intended. The requirement is merely that the vehicle involved be a \"motor vehicle\u201d used, maintained, operated or owned \"as a motor vehicle.\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\"><em>We are not left to speculate about whether the Legislature intended the expression \"motor vehicle\u201d to mean a covered or registered or insured motor vehicle when it used those words as an expression of art throughout the statute. </em>The meaning of that expression is explicitly set down in the definitional section of the act, \u00a7 3102(2)(c) ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\"><em>Conspicuously absent is any language limiting \"motor vehicle\u201d to one required to be registered in the state </em>or for which no-fault security must be maintained.4</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\"><em>4 </em>It is interesting to note that while mopeds, like other categories of vehicles . . . are not required to be no-fault covered because under MCL 257.216; MSA 9.1916 they are not required to be registered in the State of Michigan, the section defining \"motor vehicle\u201d in the no-fault act, \u00a7 3101(2)(c), specifically and separately excludes motorcycles and mopeds, but not the others. That fact, we think, adds further weight to the point that the <em>Legislature intended that the kinds of vehicles which constitute \"motor vehicles\u201d under the bene\u00f1t payment provisions of the act and the kinds of vehicles which must be registered and covered under a no-fault policy are separate subjects.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">[412 Mich 512-513. Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">A consistent reading of both <em>Mathis </em>and <em>Lee </em>establishes the rule that where there is no insurer of an employer\u2019s vehicle, the no-fault insurer of the injured employee\u2019s personal automobile may be liable for payment of personal protection insurance benefits. However, where the employer\u2019s vehicle is insured, the employer\u2019s insurer is liable for the payment of personal protection insurance ben<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>efits. Since Roadway self-insured the trailer upon which plaintiff was injured, \u00a7 3114(3) would apply, and Roadway, rather than daiie, is liable for the payment of plaintiff\u2019s personal protection insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">This analysis furthers the legislative purposes in enacting the no-fault act. Where an employer\u2019s vehicle is uninsured, the employee\u2019s personal insurer is liable for the payment of benefits, thus giving effect to the broad purpose of the no-fault act \"to provide benefits whenever, as a general proposition, an insured is injured in a motor vehicle accident, whether or not a registered or covered motor vehicle is involved . . . .\u201d <em>Lee, supra, </em>515. When an employer has insured a motor vehicle, the employer\u2019s insurer is liable for the payment of benefits, thus giving effect to the priority established by the Legislature in \u00a7 3114(1) and (3).

Nonresident occupants of a motor vehicle not registered in this state are generally entitled to no-fault benefits from the insurer of the out-of-state vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The concept \"owned or registered\u201d is repeated in the priority sections of the act applicable, for example, where the injured person does not have a policy of no-fault insurance. The priority sections of the act provide that, in such a case, a person suffering accidental bodily injury shall first claim no-fault benefits from the \"insurer of the owner or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>registrant of the vehicle\u201d occupied<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> by the injured person or, where not an occupant, of the vehicle involved in the accident,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> before claiming insurance benefits from the operator of the vehicle occupied or involved in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Reading the expression \"owned or registered\u201d as qualified by the concept \"required to be registered\u201d would mean that an insurer of an out-of-state vehicle who had complied with \u00a7 3163 would not be subject to liability for the payment of no-fault benefits to a pedestrian who did not have his own no-fault insurance and who was struck by the out-of-state vehicle which it had insured. This might mean that in such a case an insurer assigned by the Assigned Claims Facility rather than the insurer of the out-of-state vehicle would be responsible for the payment of no-fault benefits. That does not appear to be consonant with the apparent purpose of \u00a7 3163 to subject insurers of out-of-state vehicles who are authorized to transact automobile insurance in this state to liability for the payment of no-fault benefits in general as if the vehicle had been registered and insured for no-fault benefits. I see no basis, consistent with \u00a7 3163, for differentiating the liability of insurers depending on whether an insured vehicle was or was not registered in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">It is asserted, however, that \u00a7 3163 does not govern in the instant case because Roadway Express is self-insured and is not an insurer authorized to transact automobile insurance. Roadway Express qualified as a self-insured pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>\u00a7 3101(4) of the no-fault act,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the Department of State issued a certificate of self-insurance stating that the certificate \"covers all vehicles owned by Roadway.\u201d Presumably, Roadway had at least one vehicle registered in Michigan or it would not have qualified as a self-insured and obtained such certificate.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It was, in that sense, like an insurance company that had obtained authorization to transact automobile insurance in this state because it wished to write insurance covering one or more vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The stated purpose of \u00a7 3101(4) is to subject self-insurers to \"all the obligations and rights of an insurer under this chapter.\u201d \"[TJhis [the no-fault] chapter\u201d does not purport to provide for obligations and rights of insurers who are not authorized to transact automobile insurance in this state.
