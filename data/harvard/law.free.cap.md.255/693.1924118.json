In such case Rule P 3 b requires the judge to sign a written order to that effect, which recites the facts known to the court of its own knowledge and the basis for the court\u2019s findings as to any facts not so known. <em>Kandel v. State, </em>252 Md. 668. Rule P 3 c provides that the record in cases of direct contempt shall consist of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">\u201c (1) such order of contempt,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-9\">(2) any affidavit filed by the defendant,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-10\">(3) any affidavit filed by the State\u2019s attorney in support of the order of contempt, if the court directed him to investigate or prosecute the contempt, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-11\">(4) any testimony offered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-12\">Judge Shure afforded the appellant the right to show why he should not be punished for contempt and presided, without objection by the appellant, at a hearing held for that purpose, at which testimony was received from the judge\u2019s bailiff and a deputy sheriff who had knowledge of the facts and circumstances underlying the appellant\u2019s failure to appear at the trial of his accused client, as well as from the appellant himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-13\">The appellant did not print the order of contempt or any of the testimony. The appeal is subject to dismissal under Rules 835 b 5 and 836 d and will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-14\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed, costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
