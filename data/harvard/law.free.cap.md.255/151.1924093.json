None of this material was furnished the Court in printed form. Paragraph i 2 of Rule 828 authorizes the Court to dismiss an appeal for violation of paragraph b of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">We neither see nor sense any merit in the appellant\u2019s case and deem it appropriate to exercise the authority given by the rules to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-14\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed, costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
