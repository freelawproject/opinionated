The trial court sustained a demurrer to the warranty counts and the plaintiffs appealed. The appellee moved to dismiss the appeal as taken from an interlocutory judgment. The situation is just like that in <em>Harkins v. August, </em>251 Md. 108, 112 where the premature appeal was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-16\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
