Vol.) Art. 66^, \u00a7 150 et seq. (the Maryland Fund) and that of New Jersey, N.J.S.A. 39:6-61 (1961) (the New Jersey Fund).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appellants, James Tracey and Mattie Ames, residents of New Jersey, brought suit against Ruby Mae Bracey, a resident of Maryland, for damages for injuries they had sustained in an accident in Maryland involving a car owned and operated by Mrs. Bracey in which the appellants were passengers. When judgments of $1,250 and costs entered in favor of each of the plaintiffs against Mrs. Bracey were not paid, the appellants sought to have their judgments satisfied from the Maryland Fund. From an order denying their petition, this appeal was taken. We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Maryland Code Art. 66x/2, \u00a7 158 permits \u201cany qualified person\u201d who recovers an unsatisfied judgment in excess of $100 for injuries arising out of the use of an automobile to seek payment from the Maryland Fund. Art. 6614, \u00a7 150 (g) defines a \u201cqualified person:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-8\">\u00ab* * * [A] resident of this State or the owner of a motor vehicle registered in this State <em>or a resident of another state, </em>territory or federal district of the United States or province of the Dominion of Canada, or foreign country, <em>in which recourse is afforded to residents of this State, of substantially similar character to that </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number><em>provided for. by this subtitle * * </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Recovery can be had only by a \u201cqualified person.\u201d See <em>United States v. Whitcomb, </em>314 F. 2d 415 (4th Cir. 1963) <em>rev\u2019g </em>200 F. Supp. 249 (D.Md. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The appellants urge that the lower court erred when it dismissed their petition on the ground that they were not \u201cqualified persons\u201d entitled to satisfaction of their judgments from the Maryland Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">The record in this case is a meager one. Apart from the pleadings and brief opinion of the court below, the only matter of substance is the testimony of Ruby Mae Bracey, taken at the hearing on the appellants\u2019 petition. However, counsel in their briefs have included additional facts, which are apparently conceded, and provide a framework within which the case can be considered. The source of much of this is the transcript of testimony taken in the Superior Court of Baltimore City (Sodaro, J.) in an earlier damage suit which ended in a mistrial. Some of this testimony has been printed in an appendix to the appellees\u2019 brief. For the purposes of this opinion we shall assume that this material, which is not a part of the transcript in the present case, is properly before us, because both parties have drawn upon it for their briefs and in their arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">There was testimony in the earlier case from which the jury could have found, in considering the question of liability, that the appellants, Mr. Tracey and Miss Ames, residents of Paterson, New Jersey, came to Maryland in September, 1961, to visit Richard and Ruby Mae Bracey, who were relatives of Mr. Tracey and that within about three hours of their arrival the group agreed to take a trip to North Carolina using a car owned and operated by Mrs. Bracey.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">The nature of the arrangement came from Mrs. Bracey\u2019s testimony at the hearing on the appellants\u2019 petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-10\">\u201cQ: You recall the trip that was taken to North Carolina in September, 1961 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>\u201cA: I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">\u201cQ: With the Traceys <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and your husband?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-7\">\u201cA: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">\u201cQ: What was the arrangement between you and your husband and the Traceys with regard to the expenses of the automobile and how to get to North Carolina?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-9\">\u201cA: Well, James was supposed to bear the expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-10\">\u201cQ: James is who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-11\">\u201cA: Tracey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-12\">\u201cQ: James Tracey. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-13\">\u201cA: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-14\">\u201cQ: He was to bear the expenses of what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-15\">\u201cA: Of everything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-16\">\u201cQ: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-17\">\u201cA: Of the trip.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-18\">This fragmentary testimony, which was neither amplified nor rebutted at the hearing on the petition, is all that was before the lower court and before us as to the arrangement which underlay the trip. It seems to be conceded that the group stopped for gasoline shortly after leaving the Braceys\u2019, and that the accident occurred 15 or 20 minutes later. There is nothing in the record which even intimates who paid for the gasoline.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-19\">Implicit in the conclusion reached by the lower court is the finding that Mr. Tracey and Miss Ames were guest occupants of Mrs. Bracey\u2019s car. On the record before us, there can be no question as to Miss Ames\u2019 status, and we cannot say that the finding as regards Mr. Tracey is clearly erroneous. Maryland Rule 886 a.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-20\">The significance of this finding lies in the fact that the court below grounded the result reached on a narrow concept of reciprocity: If Mrs. Bracey, a resident of Maryland, could not have recovered from the New Jersey Fund for injuries sustained in New Jersey while a guest oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>cupant in a car owned and operated by Miss Ames or Mr. Tracey, who were residents of New Jersey, Miss Ames and Mr. Tracey cannot recover from the Maryland Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Until 14 January 1962,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the New Jersey Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund Law, N.J.S.A. 39:6-70 provided :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">\u201cThe Court shall proceed upon such application in a summary manner, and upon the hearing thereof, the applicant shall be required to show</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">\u201c(c) He was not at the time of the accident, a guest occupant, riding in a motor vehicle owned or operated by the judgment debtor and is not the personal representative of such a guest occupant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">In interpreting the guest exclusion <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in cases involving claims against the New Jersey Fund, the New Jersey courts have distinguished between the person who rides gratuitously, at the express or implied invitation of the motorist or with his permission or acquiescence, <em>Casey v. Cuff, </em>46 N. J. Super. 33, 133 A. 2d 659 (1957), and the person who is being transported in furtherance of an interest shared with the driver of the car, even though no direct payment is involved. <em>Moss v. Govan, </em>52 N. J. Super. 550, 146 A. 2d 227 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">In <em>Moss v. Govan, supra, </em>52 N. J. Super, at 554, 146 A. 2d at 229, New Jersey accepted the passenger-guest distinction found in Restatement, <em>Torts </em>\u00a7 490, Comment a (1934) at 1272-73:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-9\">\u201cDistinction between <em>\u2018passenger\u2019 </em>and <em>\u2018guest\u2019. </em>The phrase \u2018passenger in a vehicle\u2019 is used to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>denote the fact that the plaintiff is one who is being carried by another for hire. The word \u2018guest\u2019 is used to denote one whom the owner or possessor of a motor car or other vehicle invites or permits to ride with him as a gratuity, that is, without any financial return except such slight benefits as it is customary to extend as part of the ordinary courtesies of the road. Thus, one who rides in another\u2019s car does not cease to be a guest by paying the bridge or ferry tolls which it is the local custom for a guest to pay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The same comment is repeated in Restatement, <em>Torts </em>2d \u00a7 490 a (1965) at 546-47, as is the balance of the comment, not cited in <em>Moss v. Go </em>van:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">\u201cOn the other hand, if there is a prior arrangement that there shall be a substantial sharing of the expenses, the host and guest relationship does not exist. The person so sharing expenses may be either a passenger or a participant in a joint enterprise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">On the facts, the court below <em>could </em>have found that Mr. Tracey was not a guest occupant. That it did not, may be explained by testimony which offered more than an intimation of the feckless nature of the enterprise. As Tracey told it in the damage suit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">\u201cQ. * * * [D]id there come a time when you and your brother decided to go to Durham, North Carolina?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-9\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-11\">\u201cQ. Did you have any conversation with your brother; decide to do anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-12\">\u201cA. Yeah, we were sitting down talking and we decide we would go to North Carolina to see my sister for awhile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>\u201cQ. And, how long had you intended to stay ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">\u201cA. We wasn\u2019t intended to stay maybe that night, something like that; go that night and come back the same day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">\u201cQ. Now what time was it that all of you left?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I guess it must have been around 7:30 or something like that, I guess.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">At the hearing on the petition, Mrs. Bracey, in response to the question, \u201cDid anyone have the right to tell you how to get to North Carolina, where you were going?\u201d answered, \u201cNo, I guess not. They didn\u2019t know the road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">Against the backdrop of Mrs. Bracey\u2019s uncorroborated testimony that \u201cJames was supposed to bear the expenses,\u201d the court must have considered a combination of facts which stood out in stark relief: (i) the group set out on a trip of some 300 miles at 7:30 in the evening, intending, according to Mr. Tracey, to \u201cgo that night and come back the same day;\u201d (ii) no one, possibly excepting Mrs. Bracey, knew the way, and (iii) gasoline must have been bought by someone at the very outset of the trip, but there is no evidence to support a finding that Mr. Tracey or Miss Ames paid for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">The lower court had the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses and of determining their credibility. We cannot regard as clearly erroneous its finding that the appellants were guest occupants. Had the situation of the parties been reversed, Mrs. Bracey could not, on the facts found below, have recovered from the New Jersey Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">The appellants earnestly argue that the lower court took too narrow a view: that the test of qualification applied by Code Art. 66%, \u00a7 150 (g) by its very terms includes residents of states in which recourse \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to that provided by the Maryland Fund would be offered to residents of Maryland. In sum, they would have us apply the test of substantial similarity to the purpose underlying the Fund, but not to the relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>which it affords. As we see it, the recourse available under the foreign statute can be substantially similar only if the state from which the non-resident comes would extend an equal benefit to a non-resident on the same facts. 61 C.J.S., <em>Motor Vehicles </em>\u00a7 563.3, Note 76.1 (1939, 1968 Supp.) ; Ward, <em>The Uninsured Motorist: National and International Protection Presently Available and Comparative Problems in Substantial Similarity, </em>9 Buffalo L. Rev. 283 (1959-1960). If the situation had been reversed, we believe that New Jersey would have taken the same view. <em>Betz v. Director, </em>27 N. J. 324, 142 A. 2d 632 (1958) <em>; Kiczales v. Strelecki, </em>103 N. J. Super. 257, 247 A. 2d 48 (1968); <em>Rudnick v. Bentler, </em>66 N. J. Super. 224, 168 A. 2d 813 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">As the New Jersey Superior Court said in <em>Kiczales v. Strelecki, supra, </em>103 N. J. Super, at 262, 247 A. 2d at 51:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">\u201cAlthough the absence of general reciprocity precludes claims by any resident of a foreign jurisdiction lacking comparable legislation, it does not follow that the existence of general reciprocity thereby qualifies as claimants all residents of the foreign state which has the equivalent of our Fund. <em>Specific reciprocity is also required. </em>The two laws must be compared to determine whether there is similarity of <em>relief.\" </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The result which we have reached makes unnecessary a consideration of appellants\u2019 second contention, that there is no source from which recovery can be had, other than the Maryland Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">\n<em>Order affirmed, costs to be paid by appellants.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b693-9\">. The Maryland statute is patterned on that of New Jersey. <em>Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund Board v. Holland, </em>241 Md. 294, 216 A. 2d 525 (1966); <em>Maddy v.
