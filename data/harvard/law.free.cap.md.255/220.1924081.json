Their immediate neighbors are the defendants, Mr. and Mrs. Yommer, who operate a grocery store and gasoline filling station. On 17 December 1967, Mr. McKenzie noticed a \u201csmell\u201d in his well water which, on analysis, proved to be caused by the presence of gasoline in the well. McKenzie complained to Yommer, who arranged to have one of his storage tanks removed and replaced in January 1968. However, it was not until the McKenzies had a filter and water softener installed in April of 1968 that it was possible for them to use the water for cooking and bathing. At the time of the trial of the case in December of 1968 there was testimony that the McKenzies were still bring<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>ing drinking water from Grantsville, about a mile distant.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The McKenzies, alleging a nuisance, sued the Yommers for damages and recovered a verdict of $3,500. The Yommers had moved for a directed verdict at the end of the plaintiffs\u2019 case and renewed their motion at the end of the entire case. The Yommers have appealed from the judgment entered on the verdict, assigning as error the trial court\u2019s refusal to direct a verdict in their favor. We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The thrust of the Yommers\u2019 argument is threefold: (i) that the establishment of a gasoline filling station does not constitute a nuisance; (ii) that the McKenzies failed to show that the damage they sustained was occasioned by the Yommers\u2019 negligence in the operation of the filling station; and (iii) that there was no proof that the McKenzies\u2019 well was contaminated by gasoline from the Yommers\u2019 tanks.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">We have previously held that the establishment of a gasoline filling station does not constitute a nuisance per se, <em>Smith v. Standard Oil Co., </em>149 Md. 61, 130 A. 181. (1925) but that it may become a nuisance because of its location or manner in which it is operated. <em>Adams v. Comm\u2019rs of Trappe, </em>204 Md. 165, 102 A. 2d 830 (1954); <em>Pocomoke City v. Standard Oil Co., </em>162 Md. 368, 159 A. 902 (1932). <em>See also Hendrickson v. Standard Oil Co., </em>126 Md. 577, 95 A. 153 (1915).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">- The argument that the McKenzies must prove negligence in order to recover fails to take into account the doctrine of strict liability imposed by the rule of <em>Rylands v. </em>Fletcher<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which has been adopted by our prior decisions. <em>Susquehanna Fertilizer Co. v. Malone, </em>73 Md. 268, 20 A. 900, 25 Am. St. Rep. 595 (1890); <em>Baltimore Brew</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number><em>eries Co. v. Ranstead, </em>78 Md. 501, 28 A. 273, 27 L.R.A. 294 (1894); <em>compare with Toy v. Atlantic Gulf &amp; Pacific Co., </em>176 Md. 197, 4 A. 2d 757 (1939). Dean Prosser states the rule of the English cases \u201c[T]hat the defendant will be liable when he damages another by a thing or activity unduly dangerous and inappropriate to the place where it is maintained, in the light of the character of that place and its surroundings.\u201d Prosser, <em>Torts </em>(Sol ed. 1964) \u00a7 77 at 522. <em>See also </em>Prosser, \u201cThe Principle of Hylands v. Fletcher\u201d in \u201cSelected Topics on the Law of Torts\u201d (1953) at 135-190. Or, as Mr. Justice Sutherland put it in describing a nuisance in <em>Euclid v. Ambler Co., 272 </em>U. S. 365, 388, 47 S. Ct. 114, 71 L. Ed. 803, 54 A.L.R. 1016 (1926), \u201c[It Is] merely a right thing in the wrong place \u2014 like a pig in the parlor instead of the barnyard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AiC\">Restatement, <em>Torts </em>(1938) \u00a7 519 at 41 relied on by the Yommers, limits the applicability of the rule of <em>Rylands v. Fletcher </em>to what it terms an \u201cultrahazardous activity\u201d and Incorporates a caveat, \u201cThe Institute expresses no opinion as to whether the construction and use of a large tank or artificial reservoir in which a large body of water or other fluid is collected is or is not an ultrahazardous activity.\u201d (at 44). Prosser, <em>Torts, supra, </em>\u00a7 77 at 527, is critical of the ultrahazardous activity concept which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">\u201c* * * goes beyond the English rule in ignoring the relation of the activity to its surroundings, and falls short of it in the insistence on extreme danger and the impossibility of eliminating it with all possible care. The shift of emphasis is not at all reflected in the American cases, which have laid quite as much stress as the English ones upon the place where the thing is done.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Restatement, <em>Torts </em>2d, for which Dean Prosser is the Reporter, \u00a7 519-520 at 52-68 (Tent. Draft No. 10, 1964) provides more guidance for us than its predecessor. For the \u201cultrahazardous activity\u201d test an \u201cabnormally dangerous activity\u201d test has been substituted. The effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>this change is to enlarge the circumstances under which the rule of strict liability will apply. As the Reporter pointed out to the American Law Institute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\">\u201c \u2018Ultrahazardous,\u2019 as it is defined in the old Section, is misleading. There is probably no activity whatever, unless it be the use of atomic energy, which is not perfectly safe if the <em>utmost </em>care is used \u2014 which would of course include the choice of an absolutely safe place to carry it on.\u201d Restatement, <em>Torts </em>2d, <em>supra, </em>Note to Institute at 57.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">The black letter of new \u00a7 520 sets out the definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYG\">\u201c520. <em>Abnormally Dangerous Activities</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">In determining whether an activity is abnormally dangerous, the following factors are to be considered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">(a) Whether the activity involves a high degree of risk of some harm to the person, land or chattels of others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">(b) Whether the gravity of the harm which may result from it is likely to be great;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">(c) Whether the risk cannot be eliminated by the exercise of reasonable care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-11\">(d) Whether the activity is not a matter of common usage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-12\">(e) Whether the activity is inappropriate to the place where it is carried on; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-13\">(f) The value of the activity to the community.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-14\">We believe that the present case is clearly within the ambit of this definition. Although the operation of a gasoline station does not of itself involve \u201ca high degree of risk of some harm to the person, land or chattels of others,\u201d the placing of a large underground gasoline tank in close proximity to the appellees\u2019 residence and well does involve such a risk, since it is not a matter of com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>mon usage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The harm caused to the appellees was a serious one, and it may well have been worse if the contamination had not been detected promptly.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Although there is no evidence of negligence on the part of the Yommers (indeed such a showing is not required as will be discussed below), it is proper to surmise that this risk cannot, or at least was not, eliminated by the exercise of reasonable care.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The fifth and perhaps most crucial factor under the Institutes\u2019 guidelines as applied to this case is the appropriateness of the activity in the particular place where it is being carried on. No one would deny that gasoline stations as a rule do not present any particular danger to the community. However, when the operation of such activity involves the placing of a large tank adjacent to a well from which a family must draw its water for drinking, bathing and laundry, at least that aspect of the activity is inappropriate to the locale, even when equated to the value of the activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">In the Reporter\u2019s notes concerning the new rule of the Restatement, he is careful to make a distinction which is applicable to this case. While in the first Restatement no position was taken on the issue of the storage of water and other liquids, Restatement, <em>Torts </em>2d takes a different view:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">\u201cThe thing which stands out from the cases is that the important thing about the activity is not that it is extremely dangerous in itself, but that it is abnormally so In relation to its surroundings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\"><em>iU * </em>&amp;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">\u201cThe same is true of the storage of gasoline, or other inflammable liquids, in large quantities. In a populated area this is a matter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>strict liability, [citing cases]. But in an isolated area it is not. [citing cases]. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">\u201cThe same distinction is found in the cases of water stored in quantity, as in a reservoir. Rylands v. Fletcher was a case of a reservoir in Lancashire, which was primarily coal mining country; and the basis of the decision in the House of Lords was clearly that this was a \u2018non-natural\u2019 use of the particular land. * * * Where water is stored in large quantity in [a] dangerous location in a city, there [h]as been strict liability, [citing cases].\u201d Restatement, <em>Torts </em>2d <em>supra, </em>Note to Institute at 57-58.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">We accept the test of appropriateness as the proper one: that the unusual, the excessive, the extravagant, the bizarre <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are likely to be non-natural uses which lead to strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">This is precisely the distinction drawn by this Court, speaking through Judge Parke in <em>Toy v. Atlantic Gulf &amp; Pacific Co., </em>176 Md. 197, 4 A. 2d 757 (1939) where our predecessors discussed the circumstances where the rule of <em>Rylands v. Fletcher </em>would be applied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-10\">\u201cThe measure of duty thus imposed on the occupier of premises made him practically an insurer of his neighbors from such damage, and neither the absence of negligence on the part of the occupier nor the precaution taken was material to his liability. If carried to its logical consequences, the rule would impose grievous burdens as incident to the ownership of land, and therefore the courts have strictly limited the application of the rule. The basic concept underlying the rule is that a person who elects to keep or bring upon his land something which exposes the adjacent land or its owner or oceu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>pant to an added danger should be obliged to prevent its doing damage. So, it follows that if the escape be of oil, gas, electricity, explosives, sewage or water artificially accumulated and stored and damage is done to an adjacent property, the occupier is within the rule. In these instances the occupier was not using the land in the common and natural way, and had artificially produced the potential danger whose presence and continuation may well be attributable to negligence, according to the relative circumstances, rather than to the doctrine of liability without fault.\u201d 176 Md. at 212-13.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">It is apparent to us that the storage of large quantities of gasoline immediately adjacent to a private residence comes within this rule and relieved the McKenzies of the necessity of proving negligence. <em>See Berger v. Minneapolis Gaslight Co., </em>60 Minn. 296, 62 N. W. 336 (1895); <em>Sinclair Refining Co. v. Bennett, </em>123 F. 2d 884 (6th Cir. 1941); but <em>compare Greene v. Spinning, </em>48 S.W.2d 51 (Kansas City Ct. of App. 1932), which reached a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">(iii)</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The Yommers argue that there is no proof that it was gasoline from their tank which contaminated the Mc-Kenzies\u2019 well. There was testimony from which the jury could have found that the McKenzies\u2019 well was between 60 and 70 feet from the Yommers\u2019 1,000 gallon tank; that the tank had been in place for about 20 years; that the level of McKenzies\u2019 well was below that of the tank; that when the tank was removed, there was evidence of seepage of gasoline under the tank; and that the dirt in the excavation smelled of gasoline.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">The Yommers complain that the jury failed to consider testimony that tests made on the tank after it had been removed developed no evidence of a leak; that a second and smaller tank was pressure-tested in place with negative results; that in October of 1967 a 1,500 gallon tank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>truck had spilled gasoline in West Grantsville, more than a mile from the McKenzies\u2019 home; and that there was evidence of seepage of gasoline and kerosene on the ground at another filling station some 300 feet from the McKenzies, on the opposite side of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The answer to this contention is that the appeal reaches us not on exceptions to the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, but on the denial of a motion for a directed verdict for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">In determining whether the Yommers\u2019 motion for a directed verdict was properly denied, we must consider the evidence in a light most favorable to the McKenzies, resolving all conflicts in their favor and assuming the truth of all inferences which may be naturally and legitimately drawn from such evidence. <em>Wood v. Johnson, </em>242 Md. 446, 219 A. 2d 231 (1966); <em>Grue v. Collins, </em>237 Md. 150, 205 A. 2d 260 (1964); <em>Smith v. Bernfeld, </em>226 Md. 400, 174 A. 2d 53 (1961). Such a motion should not be granted if there is any legally relevant and competent evidence from which a rational mind can infer a fact at issue. <em>Jacobson v. Julian, </em>246 Md. 549, 229 A. 2d 108 (1967); <em>Plitt v. Greenberg, </em>242 Md. 359, 219 A. 2d 237 (1966); <em>Smack v. Jackson, </em>238 Md. 35, 207 A. 2d 511 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The gasoline had to come from somewhere. The jury could, and apparently did consider the fact that more than a mile and a river separated Grantsville, where the spillage occurred, from the McKenzies\u2019 residence and the testimony that dye added by the county Health Department to the seepage at the more distant filling station never appeared in the McKenzies\u2019 well.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Since there was evidence from which the jury could find that the Yommers\u2019 tank was the source of the contamination of the McKenzies\u2019 well, the motion was properly denied. We need not reach the question whether the motion was defective in failing to state its grounds.
