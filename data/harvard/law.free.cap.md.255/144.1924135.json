In his declaration Khoyan alleged that on 27 March 1967 Turner \u201cnegligently and in violation of the District of Columbia Code and the Maryland Code left the keys to his automobile <em>in the ignition,\u201d </em>and as a result of \u201csuch negligence\u201d his car was stolen. (Emphasis added.) He further alleged that, on the same day, while being driven by the thief, Turner\u2019s vehicle \u201cwas caused to collide with * * * [Khoyan\u2019s] automobile, which was lawfully parked in the District of Columbia.\u201d On 10 July Turner pleaded the general issue. Khoyan served inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>rogatories on Turner on 16 July seeking information as to the place from which the automobile had been stolen and \u201cwhether the keys * * * were <em>in the ignition, </em>or in some other <em>accessible and visible place </em>in the automobile * * (Emphasis added.) On 22 July Turner moved for a summary judgment on the ground that \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact in issue\u201d and that he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The motion was accompanied, not by an affidavit, but a \u201cMemorandum of Points and Authorities\u201d in which Turner stated that he had parked his car \u201cin Bethesda, Montgomery County, Maryland.\u201d Khoyan opposed Turner\u2019s motion on the grounds that \u201cthe substantive rights of the parties * * * are governed by the laws of * * * [the District], where the accident occurred\u201d and that Turner\u2019s \u201cfailure to remove his automobile keys from the ignition * * * [was] a proximate cause, as a matter of law, of the accident * * *.\u201d \u201cWherefore\u201d he prayed \u201cthat he be granted summary judgment against\u201d Turner. In his \u201cMemorandum of Points and Authorities,\u201d filed with the opposition to the motion, he assumed that the \u201cmaterial allegations of his declaration\u201d were admitted for the purposes of the motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">On 5 August Turner filed his answers to Khoyan\u2019s interrogatories. He stated that his car had been stolen \u201cfrom the main visitors\u2019 well at Microbiological Association on River Road, Bethesda, Maryland,\u201d into whose building he had gone and where he had remained \u201cfor two to three minutes,\u201d but he refused to answer in respect of the ignition key. Khoyan, on 7 August, excepted to his refusal to answer and, after a hearing, Turner was ordered to answer. On 21 October he filed the following supplementary answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">\u201c2 (c). The keys to said automobile were <em>not </em>left in the ignition <em>or in any other visible place </em>in the automobile on the date it was stolen.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">On 14 November 1968 the trial judge, R. B. Mathias, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>J., granted Turner\u2019s motion for a summary judgment. It is apparent from his brief opinion that Judge Mathias assumed Turner left \u201cthe ignition keys in the ignition.\u201d It is equally apparent that the pleadings presented a dispute as to whether \u201cthe ignition keys * * * [had or had not been] left in the ignition.\u201d It was at Khoyan\u2019s insistence and Judge Mathias\u2019 order that Turner stated his keys were \u201cnot left in the ignition or in any other visible place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Code, Art. 66*4&gt; \u00a7 247 (1967 Repl. Vol.) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">\u201cNo person driving or in charge of a motor vehicle shall permit it to stand unattended without first stopping the engine, locking the ignition and removing the key, or when standing upon any perceptible grade without effectively setting the brake thereon and turning the front wheels to the curb or side of the highway.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">We think it is quite clear that \u201cleaving the key in the ignition\u201d would be a violation of the statute and, of course, such a violation may be evidence of negligence. We think it is equally clear that placing the key in the automobile where it would not be visible, except in extraordinary circumstances, does not amount to a violation of the statute, assuming of course that the- ignition had first been locked and the key removed from the lock. Had these been the undisputed facts Turner might have been entitled to a summary judgment on that ground. We do not think it requires argument to sustain the notion, in the context of the case at bar, that there is a genuine dispute about a fact which is obviously material. The motion for summary judgment should not have been granted. Maryland Rule 610 d 1; <em>Clifton D. Mayhew, Inc. v. George A.
