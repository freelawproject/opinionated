Medairy, the plaintiff below, presented no evidence that the proposed insured, Paige T. Medairy, husband of the plaintiff, met any objective standard of insurability, the proposed insured having paid the original premium, received a \u201csatisfaction\u201d receipt but having died the day after the receipt was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">The proposed insured on October 11, 1967, made two applications to Peoples for two policies of life insurance, totalling $15,000.00. At the time of completing these applications, a check was given to Peoples in the amount of $25.85, representing the full first premium required under the mode of premium (monthly payment) selected by the applicant for the insurance for which application was made. The agent of Peoples, E. E. Pur key, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>had come to the Medairy home, at the suggestion of Mrs. Medairy, the plaintiff, to discuss the acquisition of some additional life insurance, Mr. Medairy having recently changed his employment and not being covered by the group insurance program of his former employer. Mr. Medairy, the proposed insured, filled out Part 1 of the respective applications (one for $10,000.00, the other for $5,000.00 of life insurance), Part 1 being the standard type used in the life insurance business to acquire non-medical information. Upon receiving the check for the original premium, Mr. Purkey then gave Mrs. Medairy \u2014 the intended beneficiary if living at Mr. Medairy\u2019s death, otherwise to the two daughters of the Medairys\u2014 a receipt which provided in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\">\u201c \u2018RECEIPT\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">\u201c\u2018THIS RECEIPT MUST NOT BE DETACHED UNLESS THE FULL FIRST PREMIUM HAS BEEN DEPOSITED AT THE TIME OF APPLICATION AND IT SHALL OPERATE AS A CONDITIONAL RECEIPT ONLY UNDER THE CONDITIONS HEREAFTER SET FORTH UNDER PARAGRAPH</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">\u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">\u201c \u2018A. If the above payment is made at the time of signing Part 1 of the application and is equal to the full first premium in accordance with the mode of payment selected and the published rates of the Company for the form of policy applied for in Question No. 4, and if Part 2 of the application is duly completed (Part 2 shall be deemed to include medical examination if such examination is required by the Company), then the insurance applied for shall be in force as of the date hereof or of Part 2 \u2014Medical Examination, whichever date is the later, <em>provided that the Company is satisfied that on the later of such dates the applicant is </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number><em>a risk acceptable to the Company tinder its rales, limits and standards on the plan and for the amount of insurance applied for and at the rate of premium declared paid, such insurance being in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the policy contract applied for and in use by the Company at said date; * </em>* *\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-4\">\u201c \u2018B.

The agent has no authority to waive the answer to any question in the application, to modify the application, or bind the Company by making any promise or representation.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Mr. Medairy was examined for Peoples by Dr. Mc-Kendree Boyer the evening of October 16, 1967, who filled out Part 2 of the application (Medical Information). The information obtained relevant to this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>was as follows: Mr. Medairy was 45 years of age, had a height of five feet, five inches in his shoes and weighed in his ordinary clothing 170 pounds, with no change of weight during the past year. His blood pressure readings were done at rest and indicated a pulse rate of 72, with no irregularities, with a systolic pressure of 140 over a diastolic pressure of 88. The pulse rate returned to 80 immediately after exercise and was again 72 three minutes after exercise. In regard to the applicant\u2019s heart, there was no hypertrophy present; and Dr. Boyer in the blank entitled \u201cDiagnosis of the heart condition\u201d wrote \u201cNormal heart.\u201d Under the heading of \u201cFamily Record,\u201d it was stated that both parents lived to the age of 72, the mother having died of heart disease. A sister of the applicant died after open heart surgery. Doctor Boyer completed Part 2, the Medical Information Form, the same evening of the examination, October 16, put it in an envelope addressed to Peoples, stamped the envelope and mailed it the next morning at around 9:30 A.M., there being no mail collection or delivery the evening of October 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Mr. Medairy had been previously treated by Dr. Boyer as a private patient on two occasions, but not in connection with any difficulty with the patient\u2019s heart. The patient had apparently enjoyed good health throughout his life. In the afternoon of the following day, October 17, however, while seated at the telephone, he suffered a heart attack from which he died. The death certificate, signed by Dr. John G. Ball, indicated the cause of death as \u201cCoronary Insufficiency, acute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The deceased had a $3,000.00 life insurance policy with Peoples issued in 1950. About two weeks after the decedent\u2019s death, Mr. Purkey came to see Mrs. Medairy with two checks, one for the proceeds for the $3,000.00 policy and one for a return of premium paid on October 11, 1967. He also had a paper to sign. Mrs. Medairy declined to accept the check for the return of premium and to sign the paper. She demanded the payment of $15,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>from Peoples and after Peoples declined to pay, filed an action in the Circuit Court for Frederick County to recover that sum alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>in the declaration filed by her, that her deceased husband had \u201cpassed\u201d his medical examination on October 16, and that the plaintiff \u201ccontends that at the time of the application for the aforesaid insurance policies the first premium required under the mode of premiums selected by the applicant for the policies was deposited in exchange for a receipt bearing the same date, and that the liability of the Defendant Corporation attached upon the acceptance of the payment aforesaid, and the completion of the medical examination required by the Defendant, absent evidence of fraud, deceit, or concealment on the part of the deceased.\u201d After general issue pleas were filed by Peoples, the case came on for trial before Chief Judge Schnauffer and a jury on December 19,1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">At the trial, by stipulation between the parties, Part 1 of the two applications, Nos. 54-80-42 and 54-80-43 for $5,000.00 and $10,000 respectively, Part 2 (the Medical Information), the receipt of October 11, the $25.85 first premium check (which had been deposited in the Western Maryland Trust Company of Frederick to the account of Peoples) and the death certificate of October 17, 1967, were introduced into evidence as exhibits for the plaintiff. It was also stipulated that the applications were numbered for convenience only and did not constitute policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Dr. Boyer testified for the plaintiff, indicating that he made the examination of October 16 for Peoples and that he had completed Part 2 of the applications. After describing in detail the various entries made by him, he testified over objection that, in his opinion, the applicant \u201cwas insurable,\u201d but immediately qualified his answer as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">\u201cBut I would like to qualify that by saying this, that all an examiner does is to state the facts on the medical examination. Then the insurance company itself, the medical depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>ment, reviews any abnormal findings and then using their tables, actuarial mortality tables and so on, then they draw their own conclusions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Later in his testimony, he also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-5\">\u201cOne point only, that he tended to be overweight. His weight was 17\u00d3 pounds, and according to the tables that are issued by numerous life insurance companies \u2014 I didn\u2019t have one from Peoples, but I do have one from a number of other companies \u2014 152 pounds would be \u2014 -so he was approximately 18 pounds overweight. I mentioned that to him that night and since he was one of my patients I suggested he come back and go on a weight-reducing program.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">On cross-examination, Dr. Boyer stated that he was employed by Peoples \u201cto collect medical facts\u201d and \u201cnot to determine insurability.\u201d He stated that he had never done any underwriting and was quite aware that \u201cthere is a difference between clinical medicine and insurance medicine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">The second and only other witness for the plaintiff was Mrs. Medairy, herself. She testified that Mr. Turkey came to her home some two weeks after her husband\u2019s death and the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">\u201cQ. [on direct examination] What happened when he came to your house; tell us the details ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-9\">A. Well, he came in; he brought the check and he had a paper for me to sign.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">\u201cQ. The check \u2014 that was for the policy that he had some years ago? A. Yes, that was taken out about 1950. And I said \u2014 and he had some papers on the table with him \u2014 and I said, \u2018Now this paper I am signing doesn\u2019t have anything pertaining to the new policy, does it?\u2019 He said \u2018No.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, I just won\u2019t sign anything yet.\u2019 He said this was for the old policy. And he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>had a paper on the table in front of him, and I hadn\u2019t gotten anything or heard anything on the other insurance, and he had a paper there and he had several names on it \u25a0 \u2014 \u25a0 he had my husband\u2019s name on it \u2014 it had \u2018Paige Medairy issued\u2019 \u2014 and I said to Purkey \u2014 I said, \u2018There, it has my husband\u2019s name on that, issued,\u2019 and he said, \u2018Yes,\u2019 something about \u2018your husband died, I can\u2019t give you \u2014 I can\u2019t tell you any answers,\u2019 or something to that effect; and I kidded him and I told him I didn\u2019t want \u2014 he had given me the refund check and I told him I wasn\u2019t accepting it, that it had on there \u2018Paige Medairy issued.\u2019 So 1 gave him back the premium slip that I had \u2014 I mean the check that he gave me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\">\u201cQ. Did you ask him about \u2018issued\u2019 \u2022\u2014 what that \u2018issued\u2019 on the paper meant? A. Well, he said he couldn\u2019t \u2014 he wasn\u2019t- \u2014 I don\u2019t know how he had it \u2014 not qualified \u2014 but he couldn\u2019t tell me anything; in fact he said he didn\u2019t know \u2014 I mean he couldn\u2019t tell \u2014 -the agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">\u201cQ. Did he say anything about a policy of insurance with respect to that \u2018issued\u2019 \u2014 the word \u2018issued\u2019? A. No, that is what I asked him, if it was issued and he said it was, but 1 mean my husband died in the meantime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">\u201cQ. He said it was issued, but your husband had died in the meantime? A. Yes, but I had never received any other policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-7\">\u201cQ. Then you say you returned that? A. I gave him \u2014 I first told him no, and I mean, you know, I took the check, and the more I thought about it I thought no, I am not going to accept the premium back, and I gave him the check back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-8\">\u201cQ. When you gave him the check back what did he say, if anything? A. I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9k_\">On cross examination, Mrs. Medairy testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>\u201cQ. Mrs. Medairy, when Mr. Purkey came to see you did he have two checks ? A. Two checks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-4\">\u201cQ. You said he gave you a check for the old policy then? A. He brought me my policy that I had, you know, ever since about 1950.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">\u201cQ. And he gave you a refund check for the premium which had been\u2014 A. Well, I say I think he had it that night. I either got it in the mail from Mr. White the same day, because I gave it back to Purkey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">\u201cQ. But he didn\u2019t at any time tell you there was any policy? A. No, he didn\u2019t say, but there was a paper; he had a paper with him that I saw my husband\u2019s name on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">\u201cQ. But he never told you there was any policy, is that correct? A. No, the paper was there with his name on it and it said \u2018issued\u2019, and that is when I said something to Purkey about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">\u201cQ. My question was, did Mr. Purkey - ever tell you a policy had been issued? A. Yes, I said to him it said \u2018issued\u2019, and he said yes, but my husband died, he couldn\u2019t tell me anything; he said T am not authorized to tell you anything,\u2019 or something like that, you know, \u2018to tell you anything\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">The unnegotiated check for the return premium, payable to Mrs. Medairy, is dated November 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case, Peoples, the defendant, filed a motion for a directed verdict. The trial court reserved its ruling and Peoples then offered four documentary exhibits and the testimony of R. B. Carter, the vice-president of Peoples in charge of new business.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">Mr. Carter testified in regard to the underwriting routine of Peoples to ascertain whether the applicant will be issued a standard policy, be rated or declined. Peoples has a number of charts against which to compare the medical information furnished by the examining physi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>cian. These charts have been approved aud adopted by the American Society of Actuaries, a nationally recognized society, and are used by between 500 and 600 life insurance companies. The \u201cBuild Chart\u201d is for males Ages 18 and over. It was introduced into evidence and showed the average weight based on height, with a schedule of \u201coverweight debits\u201d used in the rating process. Under this chart, the applicant\u2019s average weight was 149 pounds and as he was 21 pounds overweight, he received 10 debits on the chart.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">A chart entitled \u201cBlood Pressure Tables \u2014 Males\u201d was then considered. This chart, introduced into evidence, was put out by the Lincoln National Life Insurance Company and is in use by between 500 and 600 life insurance companies including Peoples. By this chart, the applicant would receive 25 debits. These debits were increased to 30 because of the two deaths in the applicant\u2019s family from heart disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Although Peoples knew of the applicant\u2019s death, the applications were processed in regular course inasmuch as Peoples had on prior occasions issued a policy even when it knew the applicant had died subsequent to the execution of the application but prior to the issuance of the policy. Mr. Carter stated that of the Peoples\u2019 policies, in regard to which it made a final decision, 92 % were issued \u201cstandard\u201d as applied; \u201capproximately <em>2c/&lt; </em>are declined outright, and about <em>6% </em>are rated.\u201d The underwriting data sheets in regard to the two applications were offered into evidence. They both are dated October 26, 1967, show 10 debits for \u201cBuild,\u201d 30 debits (raised from 25 to 30 as already stated) for Blood Pressure. They also indicate that the \u201cwaiver of premium\u201d requested should be declined. The forms also indicated that Peoples would consider the issuance of a policy with a Table B rating.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Mr. Carter pointed out, however, that because of the applicant\u2019s death, there was no one available to accept Peoples\u2019 counter offer for a rated policy without a waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>of the premium provision. Mr. Carter also testified that no policies had been issued by Peoples.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">On the cross examination of Mr. Carter, counsel for Mrs. Medairy read into the record a letter from Robert N. Price of Peoples to the State Insurance Commissioner\u2019s Office in regard to the Medairy matter, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">\u201c T am enclosing copies of the two applications for insurance executed by Paige T. Me-dairy on October 11, 1967, and a copy of the report of the medical examination which was completed on October 16, 1967, in connection with these two applications. I am also enclosing copies of the Build Chart and Blood Pressure Tables which are included in the Reinsurance Manual of the Lincoln National Life Insurance Company and which are used by this Company in its underwriting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">\u201c \u2018The applicant stated that he was 45 years of age as of his last birthday, and the medical examiner reported that he was 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighed 170 pounds. In accordance with the enclosed Build Chart, this applicant was given ten debit points. The medical examiner further reported that the applicant\u2019s systolic blood pressure was 140 and that the diastolic pressure was 88. The enclosed Blood Pressure Table indicates that 25 debit points should be added for these pressures. When an applicant receives debit points for both his build and his blood pressure, this Company has a general practice of increasing the number of debit points to be added for the blood pressure. In this instance, the Company used 30 debit points for the blood pressure rather than 25 as shown in the chart.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">\u201c \u2018The total debit points for this applicant were 140, and when such points fall between 135 and 150, this Company will consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>issuance of a policy, with a Table B rating. As the insured died on the day following his physical examination, the Company has not actually issued a policy because the applicant was not alive to accept the Company\u2019s counteroffer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\">\u201c \u2018Please contact me if I may supply you with any further information concerning this matter.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">At the close of all the testimony, Peoples renewed its motion for a directed verdict, which the trial court declined. After the trial court\u2019s instructions were given, with the various exceptions taken by Peoples, and the arguments of counsel for the parties, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for $15,000. From the judgment absolute entered on this judgment, Peoples filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">We are of the opinion that the lower court erred in declining to grant the motions for a directed verdict in favor of Peoples and the judgment will be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">This Court in <em>Simpson v. Prudential Insurance Company of America, </em>227 Md. 393, 177 A. 2d 417 (1962) has enunciated the law applicable to the present case. In <em>Simpson, </em>the application for life insurance was made on August 23, 1958, when the applicant filled out Part 1 of the application. A \u201cconditional receipt\u201d was given for the premium paid, which was similar to the receipt given In the present case. The <em>Simpson </em>receipt provided that if Parts 1 and 2 were completed and such other information as the Company might require \u201care received by the Company * * * and if the Company after receipt thereof determines to its satisfaction that the proposed insured was insurable * * *\u201d etc. The applicant\u2019s medical examination was satisfactory except for a \u201ctrace\u201d of sugar in the urine. The application form was forwarded to the Company in regular course. On September 8, 1958, the applicant was killed in an automobile accident and on September 19 a representative of the Company visited the widow and advised her that her husband had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>passed the physical examination. The agent tendered back the premium and denied any other liability on behalf of the Company. No policy on the decedent\u2019s life had been issued. The widow declined to accept the return of premium and sued Prudential for the amount of insurance for which application had been made. The trial court in <em>Simpson </em>directed a verdict in favor of Prudential on the ground that the agent had no power to bind the company to any immediate coverage as the plaintiff had stated the agent had represented was in effect at the time the original premium was paid. On appeal, the Court agreed that the agent lacked power to bind the Company to immediate coverage contrary to the terms of the receipt, but reversed and remanded the case so that the trial court could consider the question of insurability based upon an objective test which had not been considered in the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e, after a comprehensive review of the general law, stated, for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHb\">\u201cWe think that the clause [in the receipt] means that the applicant must meet an objective standard of insurability, and that this standard is the company\u2019s own standard for the plan, the amount and the benefits applied for, and at the rate applied for. Honest satisfaction is the standard usually applied under contracts calling for the satisfaction of a party, in the absence of some clear indication to the contrary. See 5, Williston, <em>Contracts </em>(3rd ed.), \u00a7\u00a7 675A, 675B; 3A Corbin, <em>Contracts, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 644, 645; Restatement, <em>Contracts, </em>\u00a7 265. Somewhat by analogy, we think that in life insurance \u2018satisfaction\u2019 premium receipts an objective standard of satisfaction to comply with a condition should be applied, if such would be its fair meaning to an ordinary person not versed in the niceties of life insurance to whom such a receipt might be offered. Cf. the <em>Gaunt </em>case and see Comment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number><em>supra, </em>44 Yale L.J. at 1227; Carnahan, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at 222. We think that at least an ambiguity is presented and that in accordance with the established rule it should be resolved against the party whose language it is \u2014 that is, against the insurance company. <em>Pennsylvania Thresherman and Farmers\u2019 Mutual Casualty Ins. Co. v. Skirer, </em>224 Md. 530, 168 A. 2d 525.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\">\u201cThe burden is, of course, on the plaintiff to show that the proposed insured met the objective test of insurability. The evidence does not make it clear whether he did or did not do so. The presence of a 'trace\u2019 of sugar in the urine does not seem conclusive, and it would appear from the application form that the company did not think it so. Evidence of insurability of the applicant according to the general standards of the industry would, we think, be sufficient to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case for the plaintiff. This the defendant might rebut by proof of its own objective standard (if different), or by evidence to show that the applicant did not meet this standard (whether the same as the general standard or different from it), or by evidence to support both of these contentions.

Rev. 230, 232 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">In the present case, the issue of insurability was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>sidered in the trial court but the plaintiff, in our opinion, failed to meet the burden of proof which rested upon her to show that the proposed insured met the objective test of insurability. Doctor Boyer clearly stated on direct examination that all he did for Peoples was to \u201cstate the facts on the medical examination\u201d and that the \u201cinsurance company itself, the medical department, reviews any abnormal findings and then using their tables, actuarial mortality tables and so on, then they draw their own conclusions.\u201d He stated on cross-examination that he was not employed by Peoples \u201cto determine insurability,\u201d knew that there was quite \u201ca difference between clinical medicine and insurance medicine\u201d and finally that he did not \u201cpretend to be an expert on the standards of the industry for insurability.\u201d He stated, \u201cThat is a special field.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">In short, Doctor Boyer did not purport to testify, and indicated that he was not qualified to testify, in regard to the insurability of the proposed insured on an objective basis as determined by Peoples \u201cunder its risks, limits and standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Nor, in our opinion, is the testimony of Mrs. Medairy sufficient to raise a jury question in regard to the insurability of her deceased husband on an objective basis as determined by Peoples under its rules, limits and standards. She did not purport to qualify as an expert witness in any regard. Her testimony in regard to seeing a paper with the words \u201cissued\u201d on it is not sufficient to raise a jury issue inasmuch as her somewhat conflicting account, already set forth, stated that Mr. Purkey said, \u201che couldn\u2019t tell me anything\u201d and then stated in answer to the question, \u201cDid he say anything about a policy of insurance with respect to * * * the word \u2018issued\u2019 \u201d \u25a0 \u2014 \u2022 <em>\u201cNo, </em>that is what I asked him, if it was issued and he <em>said it toas, </em>but I mean my husband died in the meantime.\u201d * * * \u201cI had never received any other policy.\u201d She freely admitted that at the same interview, she was tendered a check for a return of the premium and that she decided not to accept it and \u201cgave him the check <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>back.\u201d On cross-examination, Mrs. Medairy in answer to a question, \u201cBut he [Mr. Purkey] didn\u2019t at any time tell you there was any policy?\u201d, replied \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t say, but there was a paper; he had a paper with him that I saw my husband\u2019s name on it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">It was stipulated that no policies were issued and the fact that Mr. Purkey tendered a Peoples\u2019 check for a return of the premium paid must necessarily have indicated to Mrs. Medairy that no policy had been issued and none would be issued. It will be noted that she does not categorically say that the paper with the word \u201cissued\u201d on it was a policy. We note that in Part 1 of the application for the $5,000.00 policy, there is a stamp in capital letters in the space (33) designated \u201cFor Home Office Endorsement Only\u201d, <em>\u201cISSUED </em>WITHOUT EXTENDED INSURANCE.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Under this stamp appears, \u201c#5c. Waiver of Premium not granted. #3. Premium of $20.05 (vs. the original premium of $18.25) payable monthly.\u201d It may well be that this is the \u201cpaper\u201d Mrs. Medairy saw, but it is clear that this was not a policy and, indeed, the stipulation and the uncontradicted evidence establishes that no policy was ever issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Not only did the plaintiff fail to meet her burden of proving that her deceased husband had met the objective test of insurability, but the evidence of Peoples shows affirmatively that he did not meet the test. The facts have already been stated and need not be repeated. There is no suggestion that the tests applied are not objective tests and the testimony was uncontradicted that they are generally used in the life insurance industry. There is also no testimony indicating that Peoples did not apply the tests objectively. The evidence is to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, the appellee to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
