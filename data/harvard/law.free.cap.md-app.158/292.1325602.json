Upon colliding with the front porch of a nearby house, the bus came to rest, leaving Ryan injured and the driver of the bus dead. This tragic mishap spawned the litigation now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">Seeking damages for Ryan\u2019s injuries and reimbursement for the monies they had spent for his care and treatment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ryan\u2019s parents, appellants Duane and Renee McCormack, brought a negligence action, on behalf of Ryan and themselves, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County against appellee, the Board of Education of Baltimore County (\u201cthe Board\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>When the Board conceded liability, the case was tried before a jury solely on the issue of damages. That trial ended in, what was for the McCormacks, a disappointingly small verdict. Blaming this unhappy result on certain evidential rulings made by the circuit court, the McCormacks seek rectification from this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Interestingly enough, the rulings of which they complain do not involve the physical injuries that Ryan sustained as a result of this accident. Rather, they relate to the psychological injuries that he purportedly suffered. The McCormacks claim that the circuit court\u2019s exclusion of certain evidence of those injuries \u2014 specifically, the videotaped testimony of Ryan\u2019s treating psychologist and Ryan\u2019s psychological and psychiatric records \u2014 requires this Court to vacate the judgment below and order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Persuaded by the Board\u2019s argument that the McCormacks\u2019 own claim for medical expenses created a conflict of interest with their son\u2019s patient-psychologist privilege, the circuit court gave the McCormacks a choice: either agree to a postponement of the trial so that a guardian could be appointed, pursuant to section 9-109 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJP\u201d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to assert or waive that privilege or face a court order, prohibiting the introduction of the testimony and records at issue. If they requested a postponement for the appointment of a guardian, the court warned, they would have to pay the Board some or all of the costs and expenses that the Board had incurred in preparing for trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When the McCoimacks chose to forgo the appointment of a guardian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>(presumably to avoid paying the Board\u2019s trial preparation expenses), the court excluded the videotaped testimony and the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">The exclusion of that evidence left the court, in its view, with no alternative but to then prohibit the McCormacks from testifying as to any observations they had regarding Ryan\u2019s behavior that extended beyond the first few days after the accident. Without the records or the psychologist\u2019s testimony, the McCormacks could not establish, the court reasoned, a causal connection between the accident and Ryan\u2019s subsequent long-term behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Pulling all of this together, the issue presented by this appeal is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">Whether the circuit court erred in excluding the videotaped deposition of the McCormacks\u2019 expert, Joseph H. Kaine, Ph.D., a psychologist who evaluated and treated Ryan following the accident; the psychiatric and psychological records of Dr. Kaine, Mahmood Jahromi, M.D., and Steven Zimmerman, Ph.D.; and evidence of Ryan McCormack\u2019s observable, long-term psychological problems.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">For the reasons that follow, we shall vacate the judgment of the circuit court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">On June 7, 1999, Ryan was a passenger on a school bus, taking him home from school. Having dropped off the other children, the bus was empty, except for Ryan, the bus driver, Virginia T. Carter, and the bus aide, Ethel Reinhart.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">While driving on Golden Ring Road in Baltimore County, the bus driver lost control of the bus. After striking an oncoming car, an electric pole, and then a tree, the bus came to a stop upon colliding with the front porch of a nearby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>house. The bus driver was killed; Reinhart and four-year-old Ryan were injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">At trial, a now nine-year-old Ryan testified that he \u201cremember[ed] hitting [his] head ... [a'jbout two or three times.\u201d He also recalled seeing the bus driver fall out of her seat and down the bus stairs. After the accident, the bus aide, in the midst of \u201chelicopters, people, and a woman screaming,\u201d checked Ryan\u2019s seat belt; it was loose but fastened. She then attempted to shield Ryan, who was crying and bleeding from his head, from seeing the bus driver\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Dispatched to the scene of the bus accident, Officer Raoul Willem of the Baltimore County Police Department observed Ryan \u201ccrying very hard.\u201d According to the officer, Ryan was \u201cvery nervous\u201d but then stopped crying and became \u201clethargic.\u201d Fearing that Ryan had gone into shock, the officer immediately sought medical help.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Ryan was thereafter transported to a hospital. When he arrived, he seemed, according to Mrs. McCormack, \u201c[v]ery sleepy.\u201d She said that the doctors \u201cstapled up his head and kept an eye on him for [a] concussion.\u201d To Mr. McCormack, Ryan appeared \u201cvery pale, very quiet ... [and] in shock.\u201d A day or two after the accident, Mrs. McCormack noticed a change in Ryan. She was, however, prohibited by the court ruling now at issue from describing Ryan\u2019s behavioral and emotional problems in the weeks that followed the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The accident left Ryan, in his words, \u201churt\u201d and \u201cscared.\u201d He chose not to ride the school bus for the three days of the school year that remained. After that, he rode on the school bus, except when his fears required his mother to drive him to school. When he does ride the bus, he testified that he sits \u201c[o]ne seat in front of the back of the bus ... [s]o if [he] ever get[s] in another bus accident, [he] can just get out of [his] seat and make sure everybody\u2019s all right, then get people to open the emergency exit and they can escape and [he] could, too.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">He further testified that he had nightmares following the accident and that he thinks about it \u201c[o]nce in a while [sic],\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>especially about \u201cgetting hurt in the bus accident and [the bus driver] dying, [and] stuff[ ] falling downstairs.\u201d Joseph H. Kaine, Ph.D., Ryan\u2019s psychologist, testified, at his videotaped deposition-the judicial exclusion of which is the principal issue before us-that Ryan suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder following the accident, which manifested itself in, among other things, wetting himself during the day, increased anxiety, aggressive behavior, and nightmares.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The McCormacks contend that the circuit court erred in excluding, pursuant to section 9-109(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the videotaped deposition of Ryan\u2019s psychologist, Joseph H. Kaine, Ph.D. and the psychological and psychiatric records of Ryan\u2019s treatment<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that were to be introduced through his testimony. Section 9-109(c)\u2019s requirement that a guardian be appointed to assert or waive the patient-psychologist privilege,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201c[i]f a patient is incompetent\u201d to do so for himself, <em>see </em>CJP \u00a7 9-109(c), applies \u201conly within the context of a custody dispute,\u201d the McCormacks insist. And, furthermore, section 9-109(d)(3)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> permitted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>introduction of Dr. Kaine\u2019s testimony, they assert, because Ryan introduced the subject of his \u201cpsychological injuries ... as an element of his claim,\u201d thereby waiving the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">That error was compounded, the McCormacks claim, when the circuit court excluded their testimony \u201cregarding [their] long term observations of changes in Ryan McCormack\u2019s behavior following the bus accident,\u201d on the grounds \u201cthat without the support of medical testimony, any other testimony regarding behavioral changes that occurred after the first few days of the accident\u201d was immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">After the Board conceded liability for the accident, this matter proceeded to trial on the issue of damages alone. On the first day of trial, the Board moved to exclude Dr. Kaine\u2019s videotaped deposition as well as Ryan\u2019s psychological and psychiatric records, which were to be introduced through Dr. Kaine\u2019s testimony. In support of that motion, the Board argued that, notwithstanding its request to take the deposition of Dr. Kaine, the McCormacks \u201cignored [its] request to schedule the deposition in a collaborative fashion as [required] under the discovery guidelines,\u201d and that when it \u201cserved a deposition notice [it was] informed that he would not appear for that discovery deposition.\u201d It further argued that Ryan\u2019s patient-psychologist privilege, under section 9-109(b), could not be waived by his parents because their interest in obtaining reimbursement for the costs of his psychological and psychiatric treatment conflicted with Ryan\u2019s interest in keeping his mental condition a private matter.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The circuit court rejected the Board\u2019s first ground, but granted the Board\u2019s motion in limine on the second \u2014 that the McCormacks could not waive Ryan\u2019s privilege. Consistent with this ruling, it later prohibited the McCormacks from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>testifying about any post-accident behavior of Ryan\u2019s that occurred more than a few days after the accident, because of the absence of expert testimony linking that behavior to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">In reviewing the circuit court\u2019s decision to exclude the videotaped deposition of Dr. Kaine, Ryan\u2019s records, and the McCormacks\u2019 observations, we note that the question of the admissibility of evidence is ordinarily \u201c \u2018left to the sound discretion of the trial court,\u2019 so that \u2018absent a showing of abuse of that discretion, its ruling[ ] will not be disturbed on appeal.\u2019\u201d <em>J.L. Matthews, Inc. v. Md-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>368 Md. 71, 91, 792 A.2d 288 (2002) (quoting <em>Farley v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>355 Md. 34, 42, 733 A.2d 1014 (1999)). But the \u201c[ajpplication of that standard ... depends on whether the trial judge\u2019s ruling under review was based on a discretionary weighing of relevance in relation to other factors or on a pure conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92, 792 A.2d 288. When \u201cthe trial judge\u2019s ruling involves a weighing, we apply the more deferential abuse of discretion standard. On the other hand, when the trial judge\u2019s ruling involves a legal question, we review the trial court\u2019s ruling <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>(footnote omitted). Because the circuit court\u2019s ruling that the McCormacks could not waive Ryan\u2019s patient-psychologist privilege was based on a conclusion of law, specifically its interpretation of section 9-109(c), we shall review that decision <em>d,e novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">That review will have to wait, however, to permit us to briefly consider two preliminary claims made by the McCormacks. They are: first, that the circuit court erred in granting the motion in limine because it was untimely, having been filed by the Board after the deadline for the filing of such motions had passed and, second, that Ryan\u2019s patient-psychologist privilege was waived, pursuant to section 9 \u2014 109(d)(3), when Ryan, through his parents, \u201cintroduce[d] his mental condition as an element of his claim.\u201d <em>See </em>CJP \u00a7 9-109(d)(3)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>The first issue requires no more discussion than to note that, although the McCormacks opposed the Board\u2019s motion in limine at trial, they never claimed that the Board\u2019s motion was untimely.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Consequently, they cannot do so now. Md. Rule 8-131(a) (\u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court. ...\u201d). Nor does the McCormacks\u2019 second argument, that Ryan\u2019s patient-psychologist privilege was waived when Ryan, through his parents, \u201cintroduce^] his mental condition as an element of his claim,\u201d merit substantive consideration. <em>See </em>CJP \u00a7 9-109(d)(3)(i). It, too, was not raised by the McCormacks at trial and, therefore, as the first claim, it founders upon that procedural rock.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">We turn now to the issue that has been preserved for our review: the McCormacks\u2019 contention that the circuit court wrongly excluded Dr. Kaine\u2019s videotaped deposition and records based upon an erroneous interpretation of section 9-109(c). That section provides that, \u201c[i]f a patient is incompetent to assert or waive this privilege, a guardian shall be appointed and shall act for the patient. A previously appointed guardian has the same authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9-109(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The McCormacks maintained that, as Ryan\u2019s parents, they were his guardians and therefore had the authority to waive his privilege. The Board of course disagreed. While acknowledging that the McCormacks, as Ryan\u2019s parents, might fall within the category of a \u201cpreviously appointed guardian\u201d under section 9-109(c), it insisted that they \u201cas individual [p]laintiffs in their own right in this matter, ha[d] a pecuniary interest in the pursuit and outcome of th[e] litigation, and thus [we]re precluded from acting as guardians to protect Ryan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>interests for purposes of [section] 9-109(c).\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In other words, the Board claimed that the McCormacks\u2019 interest in disclosing information about Ryan\u2019s post-accident mental condition, to recover the costs of Ryan\u2019s psychiatric and psychological care and treatment, conflicted with Ryan\u2019s interest in the non-disclosure of such sensitive information.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">That potential conflict of interest, the court held, necessitated the appointment of a guardian under section 9-109(c), to assist Ryan in deciding whether to waive his patient-psychologist privilege.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> To determine the validity of the court\u2019s ruling, we invoke the canons of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The first such canon, indeed the \u201ccardinal rule\u201d of statutory interpretation, \u201cis to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.\u201d <em>Mona Elec. Servs., Inc. v. Shelton, </em>148 Md.App. 1, 8, 810 A.2d 1022 (quoting <em>Mayor &amp; City Council v. Chase, </em>360 Md. 121, 128, 756 A.2d 987 (2000)), <em>aff'd, </em>377 Md. 320, 833 A.2d 527 (2003). Therefore \u201cwe look first to the words of the statute, giving them their \u2018natural and ordinary signification, bearing in mind the statutory aim and objective.\u2019 \u201d <em>Azarian v. Witte, </em>140 Md.App. 70, 96, 779 A.2d 1043 (2001) (quoting <em>Richmond v. State, </em>326 Md. 257, 262, 604 A.2d 483 (1992)), <em>aff'd, </em>369 Md. 518, 801 A.2d 160 (2002). If possible, \u201c \u2018a statute is to be read so that no word, phrase, clause or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>sentence is rendered surplusage or meaningless.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kerpelman v. Smith, Somerville &amp; Case, L.L.C., </em>115 Md.App. 353, 356-57, 693 A.2d 357 (1997) (quoting <em>Mazor v. State, Dep't of Corr., </em>279 Md. 355, 360, 369 A.2d 82 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Moreover, \u201cwe must always be cognizant of the fundamental principle that statutory construction is approached from a \u2018commonsensical\u2019 perspective. Thus, we seek to avoid constructions that are illogical, unreasonable, or inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106 (1994) (quoting <em>Richmond, </em>326 Md. at 262, 604 A.2d 483) (internal citations omitted). \u201cWe also avoid constructions that would \u2018lead to absurd [results].\u2019 \u201d <em>Azarian, </em>140 Md.App. at 97, 779 A.2d 1043 (quoting <em>Thanos v. State, </em>332 Md. 511, 525, 632 A.2d 768 (1993)). \u201c \u2018[I]f the statute is part of a general statutory scheme or system, the sections must be read together to ascertain the true intention of the Legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kerpelman, </em>115 Md.App. at 357, 693 A.2d 357 (quoting <em>Mazor, </em>279 Md. at 361, 369 A.2d 82).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">We now apply these time-honored canons of statutory construction to the question of whether section 9 \u2014 109(c) required the appointment of a guardian, as the circuit court ruled. We begin our analysis by noting that \u201cthe psychotherapist-patient privilege is \u2018rooted in the imperative need for confidence and trust.\u2019\u201d <em>Jaffee v. Redmond, </em>518 U.S. 1, 10, 116 S.Ct. 1923, 135 L.Ed.2d 337 (1996) (quoting <em>Trammel v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 40, 51, 100 S.Ct. 906, 63 L.Ed.2d 186 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Highlighting the importance of that privilege, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">Treatment by a physician for physical ailments can often proceed successfully on the basis of a physical examination, objective information supplied by the patient, and the results of diagnostic tests. Effective psychotherapy, by contrast, depends upon an atmosphere of confidence and trust in which the patient is willing to make a frank and complete disclosure of facts, emotions, memories, and fears. Because of the sensitive nature of the problems for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>individuals consult psychotherapists, disclosure of confidential communications made during counseling sessions may cause embarrassment or disgrace. For this reason, the mere possibility of disclosure may impede development of the confidential relationship necessary for successful treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">As the Court of Appeals succinctly put it in <em>Laznovsky v. Laznovsky, </em>357 Md. 586, 745 A.2d 1054 (2000), \u201c \u2018[m]any physical ailments might be treated with some degree of effectiveness by a doctor whom the patient did not trust, but a psychiatrist must have his patient\u2019s confidence or he cannot help him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 613 n. 13, 745 A.2d 1054 (quoting <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>222 F.2d 398, 401 (D.C.Cir.1955)). Indeed, the privilege not only serves the private interest of the patient \u201c[b]y protecting confidential communications between a psychotherapist and her patient from involuntary disclosure,\u201d but it \u201cserves the public interest by facilitating the provision of appropriate treatment for individuals suffering the effects of a mental or emotional problem.\u201d <em>Jaffee, </em>518 U.S. at 11, 116 S.Ct. 1923. Nor can anyone dispute that \u201c[t]he mental health of our citizenry, no less than its physical health, is a public good of transcendent importance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Mindful of the compelling policy considerations in favor of this privilege, we turn to the words of the statute itself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">(b) <em>Privilege generally. </em>\u2014 Unless otherwise provided, in all judicial, legislative, or administrative proceedings, a patient or the patient\u2019s authorized representative has a privilege to refuse to disclose, and to prevent a witness from disclosing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">(1) Communications relating to diagnosis or treatment of the patient; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">(2) Any information that by its nature would show the existence of a medical record of the diagnosis or treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\">(c) <em>Appointment of guardian. </em>\u2014 If a patient is incompetent to assert or waive this privilege, a guardian shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>appointed and shall act for the patient. A previously appointed guardian has the same authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">CJP \u00a7 9-109(b)-(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Sections 9-109(b) and (c) plainly state that, in judicial as well as other types of proceedings, a patient has the right to assert or waive his patient-psychologist privilege. <em>Id. </em>But, if the patient is not competent to make such a decision, section 9 \u2014 109(c) requires the appointment of a guardian to act on the patient\u2019s behalf, unless he or she already has such a guardian. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9 \u2014 109(c). Ryan, a four-year-old minor, was obviously not capable of making such a decision. <em>See Nagle v. Hooks, </em>296 Md. 123, 127, 460 A.2d 49 (1983) (\u201cCertainly a minor under the age of 10 years would be incompetent to make such a decision fas whether to waive or assert his patient-psychologist privilege.]\u201d). Therefore, the statute required that a guardian be appointed to assert or waive Ryan\u2019s privilege, unless Ryan already had someone acting on his behalf, who qualified as a \u201cpreviously appointed guardian\u201d under section 9-109(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The McCormacks point out that, as Ryan\u2019s parents, they were his guardians under section 5-203 of the Family Law Article and, as the Board concedes, they also fell within the category of a \u201cpreviously appointed guardian\u201d under section 9-109(c). <em>See </em>Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2003 Supp.), \u00a7 5-203(a)(l) of the Family Law Article (\u201cThe parents are the joint natural guardians of their minor child.\u201d). Consequently, they maintain that they had the authority to assert or waive Ryan\u2019s privilege. But the Board argued below, and the circuit court apparently agreed, that the statute requires the appointment of an independent guardian when the parents are parties to the case and their interests conflict with their child\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Although the statute is silent on that point, the Court of Appeals has considered such a claim in the context of a child custody case, <em>Nagle v. Hooks, </em>296 Md. 123, 460 A.2d 49 (1983), a fact not lost on either the Board or the circuit court; both of which cited <em>Nagle </em>in support of their respective and compatible positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number><em>Nagle </em>involved, an exasperated Court wrote, \u201cthe continuing battle over the custody of the minor child of John Stephen Nagle and his former wife, Beth Ann Nagle Hooks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125, 460 A.2d 49. At a hearing on Nagle\u2019s petition to modify custody, Nagle \u201cattempted to have a psychiatrist, who had been seeing the child, testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But Hooks, the custodial parent, \u201chad not given her consent to waive the privilege.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">\u201c[Reasoning that each parent would have to so consent [to waive the privilege], the chancellor refused to allow the witness to testify regarding matters within the privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court disagreed, holding that only \u201c \u2018the parent having custody under a court order ha[d] authority to assert the privilege.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126, 460 A.2d 49 (quoting <em>Nagle v. Hooks, </em>No. 1644, Sept. Term 1981, slip op. at 3 (Md.Ct.Spec.App. Aug. 10, 1982) (per curiam), <em>rev\u2019d, Nagle, </em>296 Md. 123, 460 A.2d 49). We, in effect, agreed with the chancellor\u2019s conclusion that Nagle could not waive his child\u2019s privilege, but took exception to the chancellor\u2019s insistence that both parents had to consent to the waiver for a waiver to be effective. As occasionally occurs, the Court of Appeals then disagreed with us, taking an altogether different path to an altogether different result. It held that, under section 9-109, neither parent could waive, individually or in concert with the other, their child\u2019s privilege because their interests conflicted with his. <em>Id. </em>at 126, 128, 460 A.2d 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Delving into the history of section 9-109, the Court of Appeals observed that, \u201c[p]rior to 1966, there was no privilege of nondisclosure of communications between patient and psychiatrist relating to diagnosis or treatment of the patient\u2019s mental or emotional disorder,\u201d but that \u201c[i]n the original 1966 legislation, it was specifically provided that disclosure could be compelled by a judge \u2018in cases involving the custody of children if, in [the judge\u2019s] opinion, such disclosure [wa]s necessary to a proper determination of the issue of custody.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126-27, 460 A.2d 49 (quoting 1966 Md. Laws, Chap. 503). And that provision, the Court noted, was eliminated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>General Assembly in 1977. <em>Id. </em>at 127, 460 A.2d 49; <em>see also </em>1977 Md. Laws, Chap. 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">The Court then turned to the current language of section 9-109(c), pointing out that, as a matter of law, a minor is not competent to assert or waive his patient-psychologist privilege and that, under such circumstances, the statute mandates the appointment of a guardian to perform that task, unless the minor already has a \u201cpreviously appointed guardian.\u201d <em>Nagle, </em>296 Md. at 127, 460 A.2d 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">It turned next to the question whether \u201cthe parent who pursuant to court order has custody of a child could qualify as a \u2018previously appointed guardian\u2019 under section 9-109(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the Court observed that such a parent could \u201carguably ... qualify as a \u2018previously appointed guardian\u2019 under section 9-109(c),\u201d it declared that \u201cit is inappropriate in a continuing custody \u2018battle\u2019 for the custodial parent to control the assertion or waiver of the privilege of nondisclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127-28, 460 A.2d 49. \u201c[I]t is patent,\u201d the Court explained, \u201cthat such custodial parent has a conflict of interest in acting on behalf of the child in asserting or waiving the privilege of nondisclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127, 460 A.2d 49. Declaring that, in such circumstances, \u201cthe parents, jointly or severally, may neither agree nor refuse to waive the privilege on the child\u2019s behalf,\u201d the Court held \u201cthat when a minor is too young to personally exercise the privilege of nondisclosure, the court must appoint a guardian to act, guided by what is in the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128, 460 A.2d 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Ten years later, this Court considered the same issue, a parent\u2019s right to waive a child\u2019s patient-psychologist privilege, in the same context, a custody dispute, in <em>Kovacs v. Kovacs, </em>98 Md.App. 289, 633 A.2d 425 (1993). The Kovacs were Orthodox Jews and initially chose to resolve their differences relating to the dissolution of their marriage, including who was to have custody of their six children, before a Beth Din, \u201ca Jewish court [consisting of] a panel of three rabbinic judges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295, 633 A.2d 425. It is not necessary that we recite the complicated procedural history of that case as it bounced back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>and forth between the Beth Din and the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Suffice it to say that one of the issues presented to this Court, in that case, was the propriety of both the Beth Din and the circuit court relying on the \u201cfindings\u201d and \u201ctestimony\u201d of the children\u2019s psychologist, when that information was disclosed \u201cwithout the consent of a guardian appointed on behalf of the children as required by <em>Nagle v. Hooks.\u201d Id. </em>at 806, 633 A.2d 425. Although we chose other grounds on which to reverse the custody portions of the Kovacs\u2019 divorce judgment, we nonetheless took the opportunity to reiterate that \u201cthe patient-psychologist privilege of a minor cannot be waived during a custody hearing, even when the parents agree, unless the chancellor appoints a guardian to make that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308, 633 A.2d 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The holdings of <em>Nagle </em>and <em>Kovacs, </em>according to the McCor-macks, do not extend beyond the boundaries of a custody case. While conceding that section 9-109(c) may require the appointment of an independent guardian in the legal maelstrom of a custody case, where conflicts of interest between parents and between parents and children proliferate, they argue that there is no authority for the proposition that the mandatory language of section 9-109(c) applies to personal injury cases. But, unfortunately for the McCormacks, the plain language of the statute suggests otherwise. It expressly states, without any qualification as to subject matter, that it applies to \u201call judicial, legislative, or administrative proceedings.\u201d CJP \u00a7 9-109(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Moreover, the potential for a conflict of interest between parent and child is not limited to child custody cases. Other states, with similar statutes or comparable common law rules, have recognized the existence of a disqualifying conflict of interest in criminal cases, adoption cases, and child abuse and neglect cases. <em>See, e.g., State v. Hunt, 2 </em>Ariz.App. 6, 406 P.2d 208, 220 (1965) (\u201c[T]he relationship of natural father or mother does not confer upon the holder of that title the right to claim the physician-patient exclusionary privilege if in doing so the claimant is excluding otherwise valid evidence of the parent having committed a crime against his or her child.\u201d); <em>People v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Wood; 447 Mich. 80, 523 N.W.2d 477, 482 (1994) (\u201c \u2018Defendant would assert the privilege ... not to preserve the confidentiality of the child\u2019s statements to the psychologist, but to exclude potentially harmful testimony in a murder trial. Even assuming that defendant was the child\u2019s guardian, we conclude that defendant was not entitled to assert the statutory privilege ....\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>People v. Lobaito, </em>133 Mich.App. 547, 351 N.W.2d 233, 240-41 (1984))); <em>In re M.P.S., </em>342 S.W.2d 277, 283 (Mo.Ct.App.1961) (concluding that in a neglected child case, \u201c[wjhere the privilege is claimed on behalf of the parent rather than that of the child, or where the welfare and interest of the minor will not be protected, a parent should not be permitted to either claim the privilege, ... or, for that matter, to waive it\u201d); <em>Ellison v. Ellison, </em>919 P.2d 1, 3 (Okla.1996) (holding that in a modification of custody proceeding, \u201c[a] custodial parent may not invoke the privilege ... to prevent testimony by a physician or psychotherapist as to the child-patient\u2019s communication relevant to abuse and neglect\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"> What emerges from <em>Nagle, </em>and the cases we have cited from other jurisdictions is that the test for determining whether the appointment of a guardian is necessary is not the nature of the case, as the McCormacks suggest, but the presence or absence of a conflict of interest between parent and child. Where a conflict of interest exists, the parent can neither assert nor waive the child\u2019s privilege under section 9-109(c). But that is so only when the conflict is so substantial that it imperils a significant interest of the child. Otherwise, it does not overcome the presumption that runs throughout Maryland family law-indeed American family law in general<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u2014that parents are presumed to act in the best interests of their child. <em>See, e.g., Ashcraft &amp; Gerel v. Shaw, </em>126 Md.App. 325, 355, 728 A.2d 798 (1999) (\u201c[A] parent is presumed to act in the best interests of his or her child.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>The cases we have cited, in which a parent was denied the right to assert or waive his or her child\u2019s privilege in this and other states, are cases where the child\u2019s health, safety, or welfare hung in the balance. That is not to say that that cannot occur in personal injury cases. It can. But a conflict of interest does not automatically exist in every personal injury case where parents, making a claim to the same pool of money as their child, are faced with the decision of whether to waive the child\u2019s privilege to assure that he and they will receive just compensation. This is particularly true here, where there is no allegation that both claims cannot be met and where the interests of both parent and child would be served by a waiver of privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The McCormacks filed suit on behalf of themselves and their son. Their interest was in obtaining compensation for their child and the monies they expended for his care and treatment. Ryan had a substantial interest in recovering damages for his psychological injuries, and there is nothing in Dr. Kaine\u2019s testimony that would, on its face, appear to be harmful to Ryan if disclosed. Dr. Kaine testified, at his deposition, that Ryan suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder following the accident, which manifested itself in, among other things, wetting himself during the day, increased anxiety, and nightmares.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Indeed, at trial, Ryan himself testified as to the nightmares he suffered and the fears he had following the accident. Dr. Kaine\u2019s testimony would have only attributed these emotional problems to post-traumatic stress disorder, the disclosure of which, it is hard to believe, would have had any impact on Ryan at all. As for the day wetting, while a doctor\u2019s disclosure of this kind of activity might conceivably prove devastating to a sixteen-year-old, it beggars common sense to assume that such a disclosure would have any such effect on a nine-year-old testifying as to what occurred when he was only four. Thus, there is no \u201cpatent\u201d conflict of interest. <em>See Nagle, </em>296 Md. at 127, 460 A.2d 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Moreover, in a custody case, the parents are adversaries and the child is the subject of the litigation. In such a case, \u201cone of two warring parents [may waive or assert the privilege] for reasons unconnected to the polestar rule of \u2018the best interests of the child.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128, 460 A.2d 49. Here, parents and child have common, not conflicting, interests. They seek, for their mutual benefit, compensation for what they both have lost. Because there is no patent conflict of interest, the circuit court should have reviewed the evidence\u2014 Dr. Kaine\u2019s deposition and Ryan\u2019s records \u2014 and made a determination as to whether a conflict of interest existed. If it found a substantial intra-familial conflict of interest, the court, on that basis, could have ruled that the McCormacks could neither assert nor waive Ryan\u2019s privilege, and then appointed a guardian for that purpose. Instead, it chose, without investigation, to, in effect, foreclose Ryan\u2019s right to seek fair and just compensation for any psychological injuries he may have suffered by barring all evidence which supported that claim. Ironically, the decision which, in effect, eviscerated Ryan\u2019s claim for psychological injuries was rendered in the name of protecting his interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">We next turn to the McCormacks\u2019 claim that the circuit court erred in excluding Mr. and Mrs. McCormacks\u2019 own testimony concerning their long-term observations of Ryan. The McCormacks allege in their brief that they \u201cintended to testify regarding Ryan\u2019s refusal to ride the school bus, day wetting of his pants, and other long term observations which would have supported Dr. Kaine\u2019s opinions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">When the Board objected to the McCormacks testifying to long-term observations of Ryan, the court sustained the objection, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">[Y]ou are getting to a couple of weeks after, your transgression, and the Court of Appeals\u2019 pronouncement that since so many things can cause so many things, you need to have medical testimony to connect up changes that are that far. I don\u2019t think that I can allow this. If it happens a day or two after, he is upset, things of that sort, fine. But because it is so long away, so many things can cause so many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>different things, the appellate court says I shouldn\u2019t allow it so I won\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The basis for the circuit court\u2019s refusal to allow the McCor-macks\u2019 testify as to what they observed over time regarding Ryan\u2019s post-accident behavior and emotional problems, was the court\u2019s belief that those problems could not be attributed to the accident without corroborative expert testimony, testimony which the court had previously excluded. Because we are vacating the judgment of the circuit court and remanding this case for a new trial, at which time the circuit court will have the opportunity to reconsider the admissibility of Dr. Kaine\u2019s deposition and Ryan\u2019s psychological and psychiatric records, we need not decide this issue. That being so, we nonetheless feel impelled to make the following observations, in the hope that they may prove of some assistance to the circuit court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Had the circuit court properly excluded Dr. Kaine\u2019s deposition and the psychological records that deposition sought to introduce, it would have been well within its discretion to exclude the McCormacks\u2019 testimony as, in fact, it did. But if, on remand, the court admits the Kaine deposition and attendant records, it should reconsider its decision to exclude the McCormacks\u2019 testimony, as the Kaine deposition and the records at issue may provide the causal link the court found wanting at the first trial of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">JUDGMENT VACATED AND CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b318-13\">.

The circuit court agreed that a guardian had to be appointed, stating tersely: \u201cWhat [section 9 \u2014 X 09(c) ] says is that for a minor the privilege belongs to the child and the parents can\u2019t waive it.\u201d It is not clear from this or other comments made by the court whether, in so ruling, it was holding that section 9-109 requires that whenever parents have a monetary interest in their child's case, a guardian must be appointed to assist the child in asserting or waiving this privilege, or that the appointment of a guardian is only appropriate where the interests of the parents and their child conflict. In reaching the conclusion that it did, however, the court relied solely on <em>Nagle v. Hooks, </em>296 Md. 123, 460 A.2d 49 (1983), which, as we shall later discuss, stands for the proposition that parents cannot waive their child\u2019s privilege when their interests conflict with their child\u2019s.
