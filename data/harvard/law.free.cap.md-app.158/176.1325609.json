Allen L. Schwait, presiding) convicted Marty Dean Imes, appellant, of attempted second degree murder and several related charges. The State\u2019s evidence was sufficient to establish appellant\u2019s guilt. Although appellant does not argue to the contrary, he does argue that he is entitled to a new trial because (1) the jury was permitted to review exhibits not properly admitted into evidence; (2) evidence of his post-<em>Miranda </em>silence was erroneously admitted; and (3) the trial court erroneously denied his mid-trial motions for severance and/or mistrial. In support of those arguments, appellant presents three questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>I. Did the trial court err in allowing an exhibit, not moved into evidence during trial, to be reviewed by jurors in the jury room during deliberation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">II. Does the cumulative prejudicial effect of the admission of evidence regarding Appellant\u2019s post-Mt-<em>randa </em>silence merit the award of a new trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">III. Was the Appellant prejudiced when the trial court erroneously denied his motions for severance, and demand for mistrial related thereto?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">We answer question I in the affirmative, but hold that this error was harmless. We answer questions II and III in the negative. We shall therefore affirm the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Appellant and his co-defendant, Carlos Rodriguez (Rodriguez), were tried together. The jurors were entitled to accept all, part, or none of the State\u2019s evidence, which included the following testimony. Stephen Sirbaugh was shot in his right hand while riding in an automobile being driven by Vasillo \u201cBilly\u201d Harris. The bullet that struck Mr. Sirbaugh was fired by appellant, who was hanging out of the sunroof of an automobile being driven by Rodriguez. Both cars were traveling on Elliott Street in Baltimore City when the shooting occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">Rodriguez called a neighborhood friend to testify that Harris had stated to him that Rodriguez was not the driver. At this point, appellant moved for a severance, contending that Rodriguez\u2019s witness implicated appellant. That motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">Rodriguez was acquitted; appellant was found guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-12\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-14\">Rodriguez consented to a tape recorded interview. During the trial, the jurors listened to the recording of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>interview and a typed transcript of the recording was handed to each juror. Although the tape was admitted into evidence, the transcript was not. Because copies of the transcript were never retrieved from the jury, several jurors took their copies into the jury room. Although this fact was not brought to Judge Schwait\u2019s attention in time for him to take appropriate corrective action, appellant nonetheless argues that the presence of the \u201cunadmitted\u201d evidence in the jury room entitles him to a new trial. There is no merit in that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">While Maryland Rule 4-326 provides that jurors may take \u201cexhibits which have been admitted into evidence\u201d into the jury room, it is clear that \u201cunadmitted evidence\u201d should not get into the jury room. When such an error occurs, however, the appellant is not automatically entitled to a new trial. Merritt v. <em>State, </em>367 Md. 17, 33, 785 A.2d 756 (2001). The harmless error standard is applicable in this situation. <em>See Merritt, </em>367 Md. at 33, 785 A.2d 756; <em>Sherman v. State, </em>288 Md. 636, 641, 421 A.2d 80 (1980); <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In <em>Merritt, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals ordered a new trial to a murder defendant convicted by a jury whose members were exposed to such inadmissible evidence as (1) statements by the investigating officer in an application for a search warrant, (2) the appellant\u2019s statement about his gun ownership that had been redacted from other admitted testimony, and (3) statements about the appellant\u2019s other criminal propensities. 367 Md. at 34-35, 785 A.2d 756. By contrast, in the case at bar, the \u201cunadmitted\u201d evidence that was in the jury room during deliberations had already been (1) presented to the jury by agreement of counsel, and (2) used by appellant\u2019s counsel during cross-examination. Moreover, appellant\u2019s counsel had the opportunity to \u2014 but did not \u2014 request that the jurors be directed to return their copies of the transcript after the recorded conversation had been played in open court.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">It is well settled that a properly authenticated transcript of a tape recording is admissible. <em>Raimondi v. State, </em>265 Md. 229, 232, 288 A.2d 882 (1972). In the case at bar, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>however, the transcript was made available to assist the jurors. Under these circumstances, appellant was entitled to request a jury instruction to the effect that the transcript was being</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\">given to you as an aid or guide to assist you in listening to the tapes [which] are not in and of themselves evidence.... You alone should make your own interpretation of what appears on the tapes based on what you heard. If you think you heard something differently than appeared on the transcript, then what you heard is controlling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Sand, Siffert, Loughlin, &amp; Reiss, <em>Modem Federal Jury Instructions, </em>\u00a7 5-9 (2003). No such instruction was requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">In <em>Vaughn v. U.S., </em>367 A.2d 1291 (D.C.1977), the District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed a drug conviction even though a package of syringes and a chemist\u2019s report had been erroneously sent into the jury room. The <em>Vaughn </em>Court held that the chemist\u2019s report \u201conly confirmed in writing what the jury already heard in the chemist\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Id. at </em>1295 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Like Vaughn,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the transcript at issue in the case at bar \u201conly confirmed in writing what the jury already heard\u201d in open court. In Dorsey,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-9\">[W]hen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d 665. <em>See also Merritt, </em>367 Md. at 31, 785 A.2d 756; <em>Sherman, </em>288 Md. at 641, 421 A.2d 80. Applying this test to the case at bar, we are persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the jurors\u2019 retention of copies of the transcript \u201cin no way influenced the verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Appellant argues that the State should not have been permitted to present the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">[Prosecutor]: Detective Viguel, after you went through this form with [appellant], did [appellant] agree to speak with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">[Viguel]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-10\">[Prosecutor]: Did he agree to speak with you on tape? [Viguel:] No, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-11\">[Prosecutor]: Can you tell us what the nature of this conversation was with [appellant]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-12\">[Appellant\u2019s counsel]: Your honor, T object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-13\">[Appellant\u2019s counsel, at a bench conference]: As soon as he asked him do you agree to speak to him on tape, he said no, that is it. He cannot ask that. That is bringing in that he is invoking his privilege.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-14\">[Appellant\u2019s counsel]: My objection is to what he asked him. He is saying did he speak to you, agree to speak to you. Yes. Did he agree to make a taped statement? Now that is bringing out that he is not doing something. You do not have to give a statement. You do not have to give an oral statement. I think it is improper the way it is being done that is all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-15\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-16\">[The Court, discussing the questioning]: All right, did he agree to speak to you? Then he agreed to give you a taped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>statement? The answer to the first one was yes, and the answer to the second one was no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">[Prosecutor]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">[The Court]: All right, I will strike the questions and the answers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">[Appellant\u2019s counsel]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">[The Court]: I will instruct the jury accordingly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">[The Court to the jury]: Ladies and gentlemen, let me instruct you then on the last two questions and answers. The next to last question -was did he agree to speak to you. The answer is yes. Please strike the question and the answer from your minds. And the last question was did he agree to give you a taped statement. The answer was no. Please strike the question and answer from your minds. Next question, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-11\">[Prosecutor]: Sir, can you tell us what the statements were? [Viguel]: Sure. I asked [appellant] about any possible involvement he may have had in this incident. He denied any involvement. But he further advised that he had heard that the victim had fired from the other vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-12\">[The Court]: Sir, you have to keep your voice up a little better than that. Please \u2014 \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-13\">[Viguel]: Yes, Your Honor, I apologize.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-14\">[The Court]: That is all right, go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-15\">[Viguel]: When I asked [appellant] how he had come to learn his information, he was evasive and didn\u2019t\u2014 [Appellant\u2019s attorney]: Objection. May we approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-16\">[The Court]: I did not hear what he said. What did he say? [Appellant\u2019s attorney]: That is what I do not know, what he said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-17\">[The Court]: All right, come up, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-18\">[Bench conference]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-19\">[The Court]: Yes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>[Appellant\u2019s attorney]: This is what we spoke about earlier. He is giving his opinion: he became evasive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-4\">[The Court]: Oh, he cannot say that. I did not hear that. Did he say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">[Appellant\u2019s attorney]: Well, that is what he said. He said evasive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">[The Court]: All right, I am going to strike that reference to evasive. Please disregard that ladies and gentlemen. Do not give us opinions, sir. Do not give us conjecture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">The record shows that appellant\u2019s counsel requested and received appropriate relief from the trial judge on each occasion at issue. In <em>Ball v. State, 57 </em>Md.App. 338, 470 A.2d 361 (1984), this Court refused to grant a new trial to an appellant who had been granted all the relief that the trial judge was asked to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-8\">When the appellant [ ] objected to the State\u2019s argument ... the court sustained the objection. Nothing more was requested. The appellant [ ] did not ask for a curative instruction. The appellant [ ] did not move for a mistrial. It would certainly have been the height of irresponsibility for the trial judge to have declared a mistrial <em>sua aponte, </em>whether the appellant wanted one or not. The same thing occurred when the appellant [ ] objected to what he deemed to be an oblique reference to the fact that he had not taken the stand. The objection was sustained. In a nutshell, the appellant [ ] got everything he asked for. This is not error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApC\"><em>Id. </em>at 358-59, 470 A.2d 361. We shall, however, consider the merits of appellant\u2019s \u201cunfair prejudice\u201d arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\"> As to the testimony that appellant refused to give a tape recorded statement, because this refusal was simply \u201cnot an invocation of his right to remain silent, the testimony ... regarding this refusal cannot be construed as an infringement upon his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>Crosby v. State, </em>366 Md. 518, 534, 784 A.2d 1102 (2001). As to the testimony about appellant\u2019s <em>post-Miranda </em>evasiveness, we must determine whether \u201cthe damage in the form of prejudice to the defendant transcended the curative effect of the instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>tion.\u201d <em>Rainville v. State, </em>328 Md. 398, 408, 614 A.2d 949 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The <em>Rainville </em>Court examined five factors to determine whether a mistrial was required. We shall consider whether (1) the reference was repeated; (2) the reference was solicited by counsel or was inadvertent and unresponsive; (3) the evidence was important to the case; (4) the credibility of the witness who made the reference is a crucial issue; and (5) a great deal of other evidence exists. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Guesfeird v. State, </em>300 Md. 653, 659, 480 A.2d 800 (1984)). Applying these factors, we conclude as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Factors that favor the State. (1) The reference was not repeated, it was resolved in a bench conference, and a curative instruction was promptly given.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) The reference seems to have been inadvertently solicited while the prosecutor was introducing the admissible statement and a conversation that the appellant actually had with the investigating officer. (3) The State\u2019s case included the victim\u2019s positive identification of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Factors that favor the appellant. (1) Because the witness was a police investigator, his testimony was important to the case. (2) The credibility of the witness was an important factor in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Based on the above analysis, we conclude that Judge Schwait\u2019s prompt action was sufficient to protect appellant from the danger of unfair prejudice. Under these circumstances, the extreme remedy of a mistrial would not have been appropriate, even if one had been requested.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Appellant argues that the cumulative effect of the testimony at issue warrants reversal. \u201cEssentially, it is our task to determine whether the \u2018cumulative effect of the properly admitted evidence so outweighs the prejudicial nature of the evidence erroneously admitted that there is <em>no reasonable possibility that the decision of the finder of fact would have been different had the tainted, evidence been excluded.\u2019 \u201d Harmon v. State, </em>147 Md.App. 452, 468, 809 A.2d 696 (2002)(quoting <em>Ross v. State, </em>276 Md. 664, 674, 350 A.2d 680 (1976)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\"> Because (1) the complained-of testimony was innocuous and slight, and (2) in both instances, Judge Schwait struck the testimony and provided a curative instruction, we are persuaded that appellant was not entitled to any other relief. \u201c[I]t is presumed that the jury was capable of following the instructions of the judge in such matters.\u201d <em>Wilson v. State, </em>261 Md. 551, 570, 276 A.2d 214 (1971); <em>Webster, </em>151 Md.App. at 557, 827 A.2d 910 (citing Wilson). Appellant is not entitled to a new trial on the basis of \u201ccumulative\u201d prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Appellant argues that Judge Schwait committed reversible error when he denied appellant\u2019s mid-trial motion to sever and motion for a mistrial when Rodriguez called a witness to impeach the victim\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As a general rule, because \u201c[t]he trial is not over until all parties have finally rested[,] ... [f]or purposes of what evidence could properly be considered by the fact finder in arriving at the ultimate verdict, each co-defendant at a trial properly joined is susceptible to all of the evidence properly received before the ultimate closing of the entire case and as to all parties.\u201d <em>Murray v. State, </em>35 Md.App. 612, 617-18, 371 A.2d 719 (1977). There are, however, situations in which the denial of a defendant\u2019s mid-trial motion for severance constitutes an abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>discretion. <em>Erman &amp; Brent v. State, </em>49 Md.App. 605, 616, 434 A.2d 1030 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">The following transpired during the cross-examination of Mr. Schaeffer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">Question [by Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: So when was it that Billy lived with you?

When deciding whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying a defendant\u2019s mid-trial request for severance (or mistrial), the appellate court asks: Was there unfair prejudice to the appellant that prevented the appellant from receiving a fair trial? <em>Sye &amp; Bates v. State, 55 </em>Md.App. 356, 365, 468 A.2d 641 (1983) (discussing <em>Erman &amp; Brent, </em>supra,). Prejudice in this context has been defined as \u201cdamage from inadmissible evidence----\u201d <em>Sye &amp; Bates, </em>55 Md.App. at 362, 468 A.2d 641.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">A defendant is deemed to have been prejudiced by a joint trial when the joining of a co-defendant or co-defendants (1) permits the State to introduce, against a particular defendant, otherwise inadmissible evidence, and (2) that otherwise inadmissible evidence tends to contradict the defendant\u2019s theory of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-8\"><em>Moore &amp; Summers v.

This Court concluded that the appellant\u2019s right to a fair trial was not offended because \u201c[t]he State did not offer any evidence admissible against the others but inadmissible against Bates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 363, 468 A.2d 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">In <em>Day v.

Motions for severance were filed and denied. The court was informed that these statements would be used, but nonetheless denied pre-trial motions to sever and attempted to solve any prejudice with a jury instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 387-88, 76 A.2d 729. After reviewing cases from other jurisdictions,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the <em>Day </em>Court concluded that, under those circumstances, \u201cit was an abuse of discretion by the trial court, after it knew what evidence was to be produced, not to grant the severance prayed, and we will therefore reverse the case as to each defendant on this ground so that a new and separate trial may be had as to each.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395, 76 A.2d 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In <em>Erman, supra, </em>this Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">found prejudice to the defendant Erman because of the repeated admission into evidence of items against the co-defendant Brent but not admissible against Erman.
