(\u201cGenstar\u201d), appellee. Chaney and its insurer never contested Windsor\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim. Nevertheless, in late 2000, Chaney filed a civil suit against Genstar, contending that Genstar was Windsor\u2019s special employer when the accident occurred, and therefore Chaney was entitled to indemnification for the workers\u2019 compensation benefits it had paid. The Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County stayed the suit, so that Chaney could present the issue to the WCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">Accordingly, Chaney filed \u201cissues\u201d with the Commission, asking it to determine whether, at the time of the accident, Genstar was Windsor\u2019s \u201cspecial employer\u201d or, alternatively, his \u201cjoint employer.\u201d The WCC determined that, based on \u201cestoppel,\u201d Chaney was the correct employer. Thereafter, Chaney sought judicial review in the circuit court, which affirmed. This appeal followed, in which Chaney poses the following two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-7\">I. Did the circuit court err in not sending the case back to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission for proper factual findings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-8\">II. Did the circuit court err in affirming the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission finding estoppel and/or waiver without any necessary factual support?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL SUMMARY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">The WCC held an evidentiary hearing on December 3, 2001. Among other things, the parties submitted numerous exhibits, including the deposition testimony of Windsor; Rick Sheetz, a Genstar supervisor; Jim Talbott, a Chaney supervisor; Ken<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>neth Gerrity, a former risk manager for Genstar; and Mary Ann Craze Reuschling, Chaney\u2019s Safety Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">For approximately twenty-four years, Windsor worked for Chaney as a heavy equipment operator. At the time, Windsor earned an hourly wage of $12.65. Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cLiberty Mutual\u201d or the \u201cInsurer\u201d) provided worker\u2019s compensation insurance coverage to Chaney, but is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">Genstar was located adjacent to Chaney\u2019s premises. On May 22, 1995, Rick Sheetz, a Genstar supervisor, asked Jim Talbott, a Chaney supervisor, whether Chaney would make a heavy equipment operator available to Genstar \u201cfor a few days.\u201d Chaney verbally agreed to make Windsor available to Genstar. In return, Genstar agreed to pay Chaney $25 per hour. As it turned out, Genstar never made any payments to Chaney.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">For three days in May 1995, Windsor punched in at Chaney\u2019s facility, then reported to work at Genstar, and later punched out at Chaney. During that period, Windsor informed Talbott that the conditions at Genstar were not safe, because the dry screen machinery with which he was working lacked certain safety equipment and was in disrepair. Sam Chase, the Genstar plant manager, was Windsor\u2019s direct supervisor with regard to the operation of the dry screen machine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">Windsor\u2019s fourth day of work at Genstar was an unfortunate one. On that day, May 25, 1995, a root or stick became stuck in the conveyor belt of the dry screen equipment. As Windsor climbed down from the operator\u2019s perch to clear the belt, he was \u201cdragged\u201d into the machine, and suffered very serious injuries. The injuries included a broken bone above the left wrist and elbow, burns on his left side, a bruised chest, and a head laceration that required 40 stitches. After a number of surgeries, Windsor was determined to have a 70% loss of function to his left arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>On or about May 26, 1995, Chaney submitted to the Commission a WCC form reporting Windsor\u2019s injury. The form was signed by Mary Ann Craze (now Reuschling), Chaney\u2019s Safety Director. Among other things, in the spaces provided for the name of the employer, appellant wrote \u201cChaney Enterprises, L.P.\u201d The form also asked if the injury occurred \u201con [the] employer\u2019s premises?\u201d Chaney responded by placing an \u201cX\u201d next to the pre-printed word, \u201cNo\u201d. Immediately next to that response, in the same box, Chaney typed the following word: <em>\u201cSUBROGATION.\u201d </em>In response to a question about where the accident occurred, Chaney wrote \u201cGENSTAR STONE PRODUCTS,\u201d along with Genstar\u2019s address. In answer to a question about the equipment that the employee was using when the injury occurred, Chaney typed: \u201cPOWER SCREEN AT GENSTAR\u2019S PLANT \u2014 TAIL PULLEY WAS NOT GUARDED.\u201d In answer to a question about the sequence of events, Chaney typed: \u201cEMPLOYEE WAS WORKING AROUND TAIL PULLY OF POWER SCREEN, GOT ARM CAUGHT IN BELT CAUSING MULTIPLE INJURIES TO HEAD, CHEST, &amp; L. ARM.\u201d Chaney also identified two witnesses, both of whom were noted as employees of Genstar.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Through Liberty Mutual, Chaney promptly began making worker\u2019s compensation payments to and on behalf of Windsor. Payments from Chaney or its Insurer continued for five years, without objection from Chaney or the Insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">On or about June 12, 1995, Windsor submitted an \u201cEmployee\u2019s Claim\u201d with the Commission, in which he identified \u201cChaney Enterprises, Inc.\u201d as his employer. The form contains the following pre-printed text in a box at the bottom of the page:</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">ATTENTION: FOR EMPLOYER AND INSURER INFORMATION ONLY</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">Consideration Date: Unless the compensability of this claim is contested by the filing of issues with the Commission on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>or before an appropriate award will be passed.<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Between the period June 13, 1995, and July 17, 1995, Chaney did not file any issues with the Commission, nor did it contest the compensability of Windsor\u2019s claim. Moreover, Chaney never requested a hearing regarding Windsor\u2019s claim, and no hearing was held.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">On July 18, 1995, the Commission issued an Award of Compensation, ordering Chaney and the Insurer to pay temporary total disability benefits to Windsor of $525 per week, as of May 29, 1995. Neither Chaney nor Liberty Mutual appealed from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Almost three years after the accident, on May 8, 1998, Bernard and Ruth Windsor, together with Liberty Mutual, filed a tort suit against Genstar.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Alleging that Genstar was negligent in regard to the condition of its equipment, the Windsors sought more than $3,000,000 in damages, while Liberty Mutual sought to recover $300,000 in compensation benefits paid to Windsor or on his behalf. The Insurer\u2019s claim was based on Maryland Code, \u00a7 9-902 of the Labor and Employment Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">Notably, the Insurer and the Windsors averred that Windsor was \u201cemployed by Chaney Enterprises at the time of the accident as a heavy equipment operator ....\u201d, but was working at Genstar\u2019s premises when the accident occurred. In addition, the Insurer asserted that it held a statutory lien for workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid to and for the benefit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Windsor, and claimed it was \u201centitled to recover those benefits against the negligent party, Genstar,\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 9-102 of the Labor and Employment Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">In its Answer, Genstar did not deny liability in tort on the ground that it was Windsor\u2019s employer at the time of the accident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, Genstar asserted that it was not negligent and that, in any event, Windsor was contributorily negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Approximately five and a half years after Windsor\u2019s accident, on November 15, 2000, Chaney filed a two-count suit against Genstar, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the parties had entered into an oral agreement in which Chaney assented \u201cto lend\u201d Windsor to Genstar and, at the time of the accident, Genstar was Windsor\u2019s \u201cspecial employer,\u201d with \u201cexclusive control\u201d over Windsor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Further, Chaney alleged that Gens-tar breached its duty to Windsor \u201cto provide a safe work environment.\u201d Count I was titled \u201cIndemnity.\u201d Chaney claimed that Genstar was liable to Chaney \u201cfor indemnification for any and all worker\u2019s compensation claims paid for by [Chaney] to Bernard Windsor.\u201d In Count II, titled \u201cBreach of Contract,\u201d Chaney alleged that, \u201cunder the implied terms\u201d of the parties\u2019 oral agreement, Genstar was obligated to provide workers\u2019 compensation benefits. In its suit, Chaney did not cite \u00a7 9-902 of the Labor and Employment Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Genstar moved for summary judgment in Chaney\u2019s civil suit. Relying on <em>Temporary Staffing, Inc. v. J.J. Haines &amp; Co., Inc., </em>362 Md. 388, 765 A.2d 602 (2001), Genstar argued that the WCC was the appropriate forum to determine wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>er Genstar was Windsor\u2019s employer. Agreeing with Genstar, the circuit court stayed Chaney\u2019s case to permit Chaney to pursue the matter with the Commission. In addition, the court stayed the suit filed by Liberty Mutual and the Windsors against Genstar.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">Accordingly, on May 24, 2001, a full six years after Windsor\u2019s injury, Chaney submitted WCC Form H24R, titled \u201cIssues,\u201d in which it asked: \u201cIs Redland Genstar, Inc., the Special Employer of Claimant and primarily responsible for payments on this claim, Chaney being the General Employer?\u201d Chaney also filed WCC Form H25R with the Commission, entitled \u201cRequest For Action on Filed Issues,\u201d in which it sought to implead Genstar as a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">On December 3, 2001, the Commission held a hearing, at which Chaney\u2019s counsel admitted that Chaney was Windsor\u2019s general employer. But, it claimed that Genstar was the special or dual employer. The following exchange is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-6\">[COMMISSION]: You\u2019re raising statute of limitations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap\">[WINDSOR\u2019S ATTORNEY]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0\">[COMMISSION]: Or estoppel at least; right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-7\">[WINDSOR\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-8\">\u2756 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-9\">[COMMISSION]: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a limitations argument,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"As\">I think it\u2019s an estoppel argument....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-11\">[CHANEY\u2019S ATTORNEY]: ... Chaney\u2019s claim against Redland Genstar is based on a right of indemnity. And a right of indemnity does not accrue until such time as there has been payment made or until the obligation has been paid in full. Mr. Windsor\u2019s case is still open. Chaney hasn\u2019t finished paying by any stretch of the imagination, at least if [Windsor\u2019s attorney] continues to have his way. So arguably at worst, Chaney is faced with a situation where you go back three years and anything that\u2019s been paid for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>the past three years they\u2019ve got a right of indemnity back over against Redland Genstar. But it would be our position under the statute of limitations cases that we\u2019re entitled to go all the way back until such time as the obligation to Mr. Windsor is terminated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-5\">[GENSTAR\u2019S ATTORNEY]: ... I do have <em>[:Temporary Staffing v. J.J. </em>Haines.] And I believe that, as a matter of law, dictates that Chaney has sat on its rights too long.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">At the end of the hearing, the Commission said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">It sounds to me like there\u2019s no real disagreement as to the facts in this case, at least on the issues that we need to be concerned about, that is the time that [Genstar]\u2019s being brought into the case, the posture of Mr. Windsor and what he was doing at that particular time. There seems to be the one fact in contention is the right of control, and the allegation is that he can be taken off the job at any time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">The Commission then asked the attorneys to submit additional materials, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-9\">[W]e\u2019ll frame the issues as correct employer, dual employment, statute of limitations in terms of bringing in an additional party, estoppel in terms of bringing in the additional party at this juncture, and indemnification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">In its legal memorandum, submitted on January 3, 2001, Chaney argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that, \u201cshould the Commission feel that Genstar was not Windsor\u2019s employer, Genstar is at least culpable as a dual employer.\u201d Moreover, Chaney maintained that its claim against Genstar for indemnification was not barred by the statute of limitations, because the payments are ongoing, and the claim \u201caccrues at the time of payment and not before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-11\">On January 9, 2002, the Commission ruled that \u201cthe employer Chaney Enterprises is estopped from impleading Redland Genstar after six years; and ... that Chaney Enterprises is the correct employer; based on the doctrine of estoppel.\u201d Further, the Commission issued an Order on March 18, 2002, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>ORDERED that the Employer Chaney Enterprises is es-topped from impleading Redland Genstar after six years; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-5\">ORDERED that Chaney Enterprises is the correct employer; based on the doctrine of estoppel; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av\">ORDERED that the claim for indemnification is NOT bared [sic] by the statute of limitations; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af\">ORDERED NO on the issue of indemnification; and further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aj-dedup-0\">ORDERED that the issue of dual employment is hereby moot.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Chaney sought judicial review of the Commission\u2019s Order in the circuit court. Following a hearing on March 20, 2003, the court issued an oral ruling on May 2, 2003, in which it affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">The court noted that, by consent of the parties, it had \u201cthe same record that was presented to the Commission for consideration.\u201d After considering various exhibits, such as Chaney\u2019s First Report of Injury, the WCC\u2019s Award, and Windsor\u2019s Answers to Interrogatories, as well as the depositions submitted by the parties, the court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-8\">One, that Mr. Windsor was an employee of Chaney in May of 1995.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-9\">Two, that he agreed to do some work for Genstar at the request of the supervisor for several days in May of 1995.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdI\">Three, he began doing work for Genstar on May 22, 1995.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7\">Four, that he checked in each morning at Chaney before going across the yard to work for Genstar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-10\">Five, his immediate contact person at Genstar was Mr. Sam Chase, who is now deceased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-11\">Six, on May 25th Mr. Windsor was seriously injured while operating equipment on the job for Genstar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-12\">Seven, that the equipment he was operating belonged to Genstar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-13\">Eight, a Workers\u2019 Compensation case was filed timely by Mr. Windsor. Chaney is identified as the employer and Liberty as the insurance company. <em>Neither /Chaney nor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number><em>Liberty Mutual] ever contested the issue that they were not the correct employer or insurer, or that another employer should also be held responsible.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-4\">Nine, that on July 18, 1995, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission ordered that the employer Chaney and its insurance company to pay compensation to Mr. Windsor and to provide him with medical treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-5\">Ten, that on May 24, 2001 Chaney filed contesting issues impleading Genstar. This was filed five years and 364 days after the event.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-6\">Eleven, the Commission ruled on March 18, 2002 that Chaney is estopped from impleading Redland Genstar after six years; that Chaney is the correct employer, based on the doctrine of estoppel; that the claim for indemnification is not barred by the Statute of Limitations; no on the issue of indemnification. Lastly, that the issue of dual employment is moot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">Twelve, that the six years since the accident Genstar has been bought by another company. Two, that Mr. Chase, Mr. Windsor\u2019s contact at Genstar has died.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">(Emphasis added). The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-9\">Chaney has consistently maintained that they were the employer of Windsor throughout the pendency of the Workers\u2019 Compensation proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-10\">There is enough facts in the record to find that estoppel, or in the alternative waiver of the rights by Chaney \u2014 waiver of the rights by Chaney for failure to assert their rights timely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-11\">After considering all the evidence in this case, and the arguments of counsel, this court is not convinced by a preponderance of the evidence that the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission is incorrect. Therefore, the court affirms the decision of the Commission. That is the ruling of this court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Chaney acknowledges that, when the accident occurred, it was Windsor\u2019s \u201cgeneral employer.\u201d However, Chaney contends that Genstar was Windsor\u2019s \u201cspecial employer\u201d at that time, because Chaney had \u201cloaned\u201d Windsor to Genstar; Windsor\u2019s work was for the sole benefit of Genstar; Genstar had control over Windsor; and Windsor agreed to the arrangement. On that basis, Chaney claims that it is entitled to indemnification from Genstar for the compensation benefits it has paid. Alternatively, Chaney claims that Genstar is liable as a dual or joint employer. It contends that the WCC erred when, on the grounds of estoppel, it determined that Chaney was Windsor\u2019s \u201ccorrect\u201d employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">We pause to explain the concepts of \u201cgeneral,\u201d \u201cspecial,\u201d and joint employer in the context of a workers\u2019 compensation case. \u201cA general employer is an employer who transfers an employee to another employer for a limited period. A special employer is an employer who has borrowed an employee for a limited period and has temporary responsibility and control over the employee\u2019s work.\u201d <em>Temporary Staffing, Inc., </em>362 Md. at 392 n. 1, 765 A.2d 602. Moreover, \u201cunder certain circumstances, a person performing a given function simultaneously may be the employee of two employers.\u201d <em>Mackall v. Zayre Corp., </em>293 Md. 221, 229, 443 A.2d 98 (1982); <em>see Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea, Company, Inc. v. Imbraguglio, </em>346 Md. 573, 591, 697 A.2d 885 (1997); <em>Whitehead v. Safway Steel Products, Inc., </em>304 Md. 67, 79, 497 A.2d 803 (1985); <em>Automobile Trade Ass\u2019n. v. Harold Folk Enterprises, Inc., </em>301 Md. 642, 659, 484 A.2d 612 (1984). \u201cOrdinarily, the existence of the employer/employee relationship is a question reserved for the fact finder.\u201d <em>Imbraguglio, </em>346 Md. at 590, 697 A.2d 885; <em>see Lovelace v. Anderson, </em>366 Md. 690, 716, 785 A.2d 726 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Chaney recognizes that the WCC did not expressly resolve the employer/employee issue. But, it contends that the WCC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>implicitly found that Genstar was the special employer of Windsor, because it determined that Chaney was \u201cestopped from impleading ... Genstar.\u201d Chaney points out that estop-pel is an affirmative defense, and \u201conly comes into play once the party to be estopped has met its burden of proof on the remedy sought to be barred by the doctrine.\u201d Therefore, Chaney insists that the WCC must have first concluded that Genstar was the special employer, or else it would not have found it necessary to reach the estoppel issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Next, Chaney attacks the Commission\u2019s estoppel ruling, asserting that there \u201cis no factual premise in the record to support any type of estoppel defense.... \u201d In particular, Chaney observes that because it never suggested in any prior legal proceeding that Genstar was not the special employer, the doctrine of judicial estoppel is inapplicable here. Similarly, Chaney claims that equitable estoppel does not apply, because Genstar took no action in reliance on any action by Chaney. And, Chaney claims that the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not govern, because Genstar was not a party to any litigation regarding Windsor\u2019s injury. To the contrary, Chaney maintains that the WCC previously considered whether Chaney was Windsor\u2019s general employer, but not whether Genstar was Windsor\u2019s special employer. If the estoppel ruling was erroneous, we are left, says Chaney, with the Commission\u2019s implied ruling that Genstar was Windsor\u2019s special employer. According to Chaney, that ruling is now \u201cthe law of the case,\u201d and we should uphold it.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Alternatively, Chaney suggests that \u201c[t]he meaning of the Commission\u2019s order and the resulting Circuit Court appellate decision in that regard is in dispute.\u201d It complains, therefore, that the Commission erred in failing to resolve the issue of Genstar\u2019s status as an employer, as that was the precise reason for which Chaney filed issues with the WCC. Moreover, Chaney contends that such a determination is \u201cnecessary\u201d with respect to its civil suit against Genstar, which has been stayed pending the Commission\u2019s resolution of the employer issue. Accordingly, it maintains that the circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>should have remanded the matter to the Commission for a determination of Genstar\u2019s status.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">In addition, Chaney notes that \u201cno one appealed the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission that Chaney\u2019s claim for indemnification is NOT bar[r]ed by the statute of limitations.\u201d Accordingly, Chaney suggests that, if its indemnification claim is not barred by limitations, then it is entitled to have the WCC resolve the employer issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">While recognizing that, as to Windsor\u2019s compensation claim, there has been \u201ca final judgment on the merits in a prior litigation,\u201d Chaney asserts that there is no basis to conclude that it ever \u201cintentionally relinquished its rights to have Genstar declared a special employer.\u201d Rather, Chaney insists that \u201cGenstar\u2019s status as an employer was not in issue originally before the Commission,\u201d and the only \u201crelevant issue before the Commission was the status of Chaney as Windsor\u2019s employer.\u201d In contrast, Chaney notes that \u201cthe issue in the subsequent proceeding between Genstar and Chaney involves a breach of contract claim and a claim for indemnity.\u201d In its view, \u201ca determination that Chaney was Windsor\u2019s general employer does not preclude a finding that at the time of the accident, Genstar was Windsor\u2019s special employer,\u201d because those facts and issues were not litigated in the workers\u2019 compensation proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Genstar counters that, because Chaney failed to appeal the 1995 Commission Order, which determined, in effect, that Chaney was Windsor\u2019s sole employer, Chaney is \u201cestopped from denying responsibility for payment of ... benefits.\u201d Regarding appellant\u2019s assertion that it failed to appeal the WCC\u2019s ruling as to the statute of limitations, Genstar contends that it had \u201cno basis for appeal,\u201d given that it prevailed below. In this regard, Genstar asserts that \u201cit is the ultimate decision of the Commission <em>effectively disposing of the case, </em>not each individual finding, which is the basis for judicial review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Windsor submits that, \u201cin the context of this appeal,\u201d the issues of waiver and estoppel are \u201cone and the same.\u201d While recognizing that the Commission did not expressly \u201cuse the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>words \u2018waived its right to raise the issue,\u2019 \u201d Windsor argues that the WCC correctly found, in effect, that Chaney waived its claim against Genstar and was estopped from impleading Genstar.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), codified in Title 9 of the Labor and Employment Article (\u201cL.E.\u201d) of the Maryland Code (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol.), entitles covered employees to recover compensation benefits, without regard to fault, for an occupational disease or an accidental injury that arises out of and in the course of employment. <em>See </em>L.E. \u00a7\u00a7 9-101(b), 9-501, 9-502. <em>See Livering v.

Cornblatt, Meredith, and Sevel, <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Manual </em>(11th Ed.2003), at 39 <em>(\u201cManual </em>\u201d).

There are many cases, civil and criminal, in which a court decides a particular issue because it is dispositive, and obviates the need for the court to address issues that might otherwise be regarded as threshold questions. Merely because the agency chose to address first the issue of estoppel does not mean that it impliedly decided any other issues. To illustrate, a court might first consider whether a party waived a contention, because a determination of waiver obviates the need for the court to reach the merits. Such a ruling cannot be construed as an implied finding by the court that the claim must have had merit, or else the court would not have found that the claim was waived. In the same way, it is completely unreasonable for Chaney to infer from the WCC\u2019s finding of estoppel that the Commission otherwise agreed with Chaney that Genstar was a special or joint employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Appellant complains, alternatively, that the WCC erroneously found estoppel, and failed to determine whether Genstar was a special or joint employer. We agree that, in the ordinary course, it is the Commission\u2019s responsibility to resolve any issue concerning the identity of the correct employer with respect to a work related accident. Indeed, that is why it is difficult to overlook Chaney\u2019s failure to ask the Commission to do so until six years after the accident. <em>Temporary Staffing, Inc., supra, </em>362 Md. 388, 765 A.2d 602, is instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Temporary Staffing, Inc. (\u201cTSI\u201d) sent the claimant, Mr. Jewell, to work at J.J. Haines &amp; Co., Inc. (\u201cHaines\u201d), pursuant to an agreement between the employers. <em>Id. </em>at 392, 765 A.2d 602. Jewell was injured on the job, and subsequently filed a compensation claim with the WCC. The Commission determined that Haines was the employer, without considering the parties\u2019 contractual agreement as to liability. <em>Id. </em>at 392, 765 A.2d 602. On judicial review, the circuit court determined that TSI and Haines were co-employers, and remanded to the WCC for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>The WCC then ruled that \u201cboth employers and their insurers were jointly liable in equal shares.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393, 765 A.2d 602. Thereafter, the circuit court concluded that TSI was primarily liable for payment of the award, but that Haines was obligated to provide excess coverage in the event TSI could not fulfill its obligations. <em>Id. </em>at 393, 765 A.2d 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The Court of Appeals concluded that the circuit court erred by making \u201cfactual determinations that should have been remanded to the Commission for its consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393, 765 A.2d 602. As the Court explained, the intent of the Legislature in creating the Commission was to relieve the court system from the burdens of such claims, and to provide a less expensive and more expeditious way for workers to obtain compensation for work related injuries. <em>Id. </em>at 404, 765 A.2d 602. To that end, the Commission is entrusted with \u201cthe authority to approve claims, reopen cases, <em>make determinar tions on employment relationships, determine liability of employers, </em>award lump sum payments, approve settlements, award fees for legal services, funeral expenses, and medical services.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400, 765 A.2d 602 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Although the employers and their insurers had \u201crequested that the Commission decide which employer and insurer should be liable for payment to Mr. Jewell,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 400, 765 A.2d 602, the Commission declined to resolve the issue; it was of the view that \u201c \u2018interpretation of the contract is beyond [the WCC\u2019s] jurisdiction....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the circuit court, and on appeal, TSI argued that the contract between the employers was not relevant, and \u201cshould be litigated in a separate civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401, 765 A.2d 602. The Court squarely rejected TSI\u2019s contention as \u201ccontrary to the legislative intent of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 404, 765 A.2d 602. Indeed, mindful of the statutory authority granted to the WCC and the legislative intent, the Court said that \u201cthe Commission has the authority to, and should, interpret agreements between general employers and special employers like the one in the case <em>subjudice..\u201d Id. </em>at 403, 765 A.2d 602. Therefore, the Court ruled that \u201cthe Circuit Court ... erred when it interpreted the agreement between J.J. Haines and TSI instead of remanding the matter to the Commission for its consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396, 765 A.2d 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Significantly, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">As relevant to the present ease, the Commission is granted the power to initially determine whether a specific entity is an employer of an injured worker. <em>When a possibility of dual or alternate employers exists, the Commission, out of necessity, must determine the extent of each respective employer\u2019s liability. </em>In the performance of that duty, <em>the Commission, in order to fulfill its obligation, must consider an agreement between employers.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 399, 765 A.2d 602 (emphasis added). It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\"><em>When all relevant employers are part of a Commission proceeding that includes the determination of liability between them for workers\u2019 compensation benefits and one of the employers alleges that there is an agreement that affected the relationship, the Commission should consider whether an agreement exists and the effect of the agreement. This is in accordance with the intent of the Act. </em>If a party before the Commission believes that the Commission did not properly apply or interpret the agreement, the party may seek judicial review of the Commission\u2019s ruling. <em>In this manner, all issues can be finally resolved in the one proceeding, without the necessity of multiple suits.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 404, 765 A.2d 602 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">Accordingly, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>We hold that the Commission, when considering liability for employee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits between co-employers, should interpret and apply any contracts or agreements between the co-employers that validly affects their liability for the payment of such benefits to an entitled worker. This is in accordance with the intent of the Act and the authority granted to the Commission to resolve workers\u2019 compensation cases under the Act. <em>It is also sound judicial policy to resolve all aspects of a, case within the same proceeding and not to have a separate proceeding for each aspect of a case.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 406, 765 A.2d 602 (emphasis added). <em>See also Oxford Cabinet Co. v. </em>Parks, 179 Md. 680, 683, 22 A.2d 481 (1941) (\u201cThe purpose of the Workman\u2019s Compensation Act ... was .. . that the administration of that law should be withdrawn as much as possible from the courts in order to save the expense and delay of litigation.\u201d); <em>Glidden-Durkee (SCM) Corp. v.

In stark contrast to <em>Temporary Staffing, Inc., </em>when Chaney submitted its report of injury to the WCC, as required by L.E. \u00a7 9-707, it never alerted the WCC to its contention that Genstar was a dual employer or Windsor\u2019s special employer, despite Chaney\u2019s knowledge that Windsor had been loaned to Genstar and the accident occurred at Genstar\u2019s premises. Nevertheless, L.E. \u00a7 9-707(c), which governs the contents of the employer\u2019s report, provides that it \u201cshall\u201d include whether the injury \u201carose out of and in the course of employment.\u201d The word \u201cshall\u201d is generally understood as mandatory. <em>See Wyatt v. Johnson, </em>103 Md.App. 250, 259-60, 653 A.2d 496 (1995) (stating that \u201cshall\u201d connotes a mandatory intent unless the context suggests otherwise). Therefore, if Chaney believed that, at the relevant time, Windsor\u2019s injury did not arise out of and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>in the course of Windsor\u2019s employment with Chaney, it should have said so.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Moreover, because COMAR 14.09.01.08 specifically allows an employer to join an alleged co-employer in a workers\u2019 compensation proceeding, if Chaney considered Genstar a dual or special employer, it should have sought to implead Genstar. And, prior to the award of benefits by the WCC, Chaney failed to file any issues with the WCC to contest the claim,' .as required by L.E. \u00a7 9-713. Yet, if the Commission had been timely alerted to an issue concerning the correct employer, it would have had an opportunity to undertake an investigation, as contemplated by L.E. \u00a7\u00a7 9-714 and 9-715.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In our view, Chaney\u2019s conduct contravened the important principles of judicial economy that the Act was designed to achieve, as recognized by the Court in <em>Temporary Staffing, Inc. </em>As a result of Chaney\u2019s course of conduct, \u201call relevant employers\u201d were not \u201cpart of a Commission proceeding that include[d] the determination of liability between them for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.... \u201d <em>Temporary Staffing, Inc., </em>362 Md. at 404, 765 A.2d 602. Consequently, and contrary to the intention of the Legislature, all issues in regard to compensation benefits could not be \u201cresolved in one proceed-ing____\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, appellant created \u201cthe necessity of multiple suits,\u201d <em>id,., </em>when, almost six years after the accident, it filed suit against Genstar, predicated on the contention that Genstar was Windsor\u2019s special or dual employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">As in <em>Temporary Staffing, Inc., </em>the issue of whether Gens-tar was a special or joint employer was quintessentially one for the Commission to decide. Yet, the WCC was never asked to resolve the issue within a reasonable time. Chaney has not referred us to any authority that sanctions its course of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Chaney\u2019s course of conduct cannot be attributed to an oversight or a lack of knowledge of the relevant facts. To the contrary, our review of Chaney\u2019s report of injury to the WCC, considered in light of the Act as a whole, leads inescapably to the conclusion that Chaney did not promptly ask the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>sion to determine whether Genstar was a special or joint employer, because Chaney anticipated recovery from Genstar through a third party tort action, pursuant to its right of subrogation. Chaney would not have had a right of subrogation if Genstar was found to be a special or joint employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The parties have not discussed the significance, if any, of the word \u201csubrogation\u201d on the employer\u2019s report to the Commission, but that term undergirds our analysis. As we indicated, Chaney inserted the word <em>\u201cSUBROGATION </em>\u201d in its report to the WCC, in the space immediately after it noted that the accident did not occur on Chaney\u2019s premises. In a workers\u2019 compensation case, the term \u201csubrogation\u201d has legal significance; in our view, Chaney\u2019s use of the term \u201csubrogation\u201d constituted an assertion by Chaney that it believed it had a claim for subrogation. In effect, Chaney represented to the WCC that Genstar was a third party tortfeasor, not a joint or special employer, because Chaney could not have had a claim for subrogation if Genstar was a special or joint employer. Conversely, Chaney could only have had a subrogation claim if the accident was the fault of a third party tortfeasor; a special or dual employer is not considered a third party tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">It becomes evident that Chaney\u2019s use of the term \u201csubrogation\u201d carried legal significance when we consider the statutory scheme. A subrogation claim arises under the Act when an employee suffers a work related injury because of the actions of a third party tortfeasor. Based on subrogation, an employer responsible for payment of workers\u2019 compensation payments is permitted to \u201csue and recover from a negligent third person\u201d for the employer\u2019s payment of compensation benefits to the employee. <em>Unsatisfied Claim &amp; Jud.

Valk Mfg. Co., </em>317 Md. 185, 190, 562 A.2d 1246 (1989).

The Act \u201ccreates a method for enforcing\u201d the subrogation rights of a self-insured employer or an insurer when an employee\u2019s injury is the result of a third party\u2019s action. <em>Saadeh, </em>150 Md.App. at 314, 819 A.2d 1158; <em>see Podgurski, </em>374 Md. at 140-41, 821 A.2d 400; <em>Erie, </em>330 Md. at 164, 623 A.2d 184. In particular, L.E. \u00a7 9-902(a) expressly authorizes a self-insured employer or an insurer to file suit against a third party who may be liable in tort for the worker\u2019s injury, for the purpose of recovering the compensation benefits paid to the employee pursuant to the Act. <em>Podgurski, </em>374 Md. at 140, 821 A.2d 400. Indeed, for a period of two months following the Commission\u2019s award of benefits to the employee, the employer/insurer \u201chas the exclusive right to bring such an action against the third party.\u201d <em>Id.; see Franch, </em>341 Md. at 358, 670 A.2d 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">As noted, Liberty Mutual was Chaney\u2019s Insurer. But, according to comments made by Windsor\u2019s attorney at the Commission hearing, \u201cChaney had a self-insurance deductible of $300,000. So the first $300,000 was being paid by Chaney out of pocket. Liberty Mutual then picks up from there.... \u201d If Windsor\u2019s attorney was correct, Chaney would have been entitled under L.E. \u00a7 9-902 to pursue a claim for damages against an alleged third party tortfeasor. Such a claim is grounded on the employer\u2019s subrogation interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Moreover, as we explained earlier, if an employer fails to pursue a third party tortfeasor within the two-month period of exclusivity, the Act permits the employee to sue the third party tortfeasor. But, even if an employee recovers damages from a third party tortfeasor, the employer/insurer is entitled \u201cto obtain reimbursement for its workers\u2019 compensation payments from the proceeds.\u201d <em>Franch, </em>341 Md. at 358, 670 A.2d 951; <em>see </em>L.E. \u00a7 9-902(e). This is because the employer/insurer \u201cretains <em>a subrogation interest </em>in the reimbursement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation funds it paid pursuant to the Act....\u201d <em>Podgurski, </em>374 Md. at 140, 821 A.2d 400 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><em>Podgurski </em>374 Md. 133, 821 A.2d 400, is instructive. Ms. Podgurski was injured while working at a hair salon located within a department store. <em>Id. </em>at 138, 821 A.2d 400. The salon was insured by OneBeacon Insurance Co., which paid workers\u2019 compensation benefits. <em>Id. </em>As a result of her suit against the department store, Ms. Podgurski recovered an amount that exceeded her workers\u2019 compensation benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 136, 821 A.2d 400. But, she challenged the insurer\u2019s claim that it was entitled to reimbursement from the tort award for the compensation benefits it had paid. <em>Id. </em>The Court held that the language of L.E. \u00a7 9-902(e)(2) controlled, and unambiguously required the employee to reimburse the employer or the insurer for the workers\u2019 compensation payments it had made. <em>Id. </em>at 149, 821 A.2d 400. The Court said, <em>id. </em>at 144, 821 A.2d 400:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">We hold that the plain language of \u00a7 9-902(e) is clear and unambiguous on its face; any argument that it is ambiguous is without merit. Once an employee <em>recovers damages </em>from a third party tort-feasor and deducts the proper costs and expenses, that employee <em>shall reimburse </em>the insurer or employer for the <em>compensation already paid or awarded </em>by the insurer as an award under the Act. The definitions of these italicized words from \u00a7 9-902 are patent. The Legislature provided no room or circumstance for instituting a limitation or exception permitting, once third party reimbursement is obtained, a reduction or total bar of the reimbursement amount.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The Court\u2019s analysis was rooted in the subrogation rights of the employer or insurer. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">This history and relative stability of the language granting subrogation rights to an employer under this act are supportive of our plain language analysis in the case at bar. First, as previously mentioned, the Legislature originally made the employee choose between exercising the right to sue the third party or the right to file a claim under the Act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>only to later amend the statute so that <em>the employer has the exclusive right to file the action against the third party tort-feasor for two months after compensation is awarded to the employee. </em>The employer was guaranteed recovery of its payment before the employee was able to recoup any funds above and beyond the workers\u2019 compensation award.[ ] <em>This illustrates a, legislative intent to ensure that a, neutral party, the employer, is not made to pay for damages caused by the actual at-fault party. The statute protects both the employee and, the employer by allowing the employee to collect compensation from the employer where the third, party cannot pay the amount, of damages covered by the Act, while allowing the employer to come out even where the third, party can pay that amount. </em>As <em>this Court has long held, the purpose of the statute is to protect both the employee and the employer by ensuring that a third party tort-feasor will not escape liability by having another pay its debt. See Johnson v. Miles, </em>188 Md. 455, 460, 53 A.2d 30, 32 (1947).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 147-48, 821 A.2d 400 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">As the Court observed, \u201cit was the Legislature\u2019s intent under this statute to ensure full reimbursement to the employer/insurer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 149, 821 A.2d 400. The Court recognized the \u201clong standing proposition that \u00a7 9-902 and its predecessors contemplate that the employer is entitled to a <em>full reimbursement </em>of the award <em>it pays under the Act when the employee receives damages in excess of that award from, a, third party tort-feasor.\u201d Id. </em>at 150, 821 A.2d 400. The Court said, <em>id,.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">As the relevant language of \u00a7 9-902(e) of the Labor and Employment Article of the Maryland Code, and, prior to its codification, that of Article 101 \u00a7 58, have been substantively unchanged for over 80 years, cases that have interpreted prior versions of this section of the code are instructive. While the specific issue in the case <em>sub judice </em>is one of first impression in this Court, our case law interpreting the nearly identical ancestral language provides additional support that the plain meaning of the language of \u00a7 9-902(e), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>and its predecessors, require reimbursement in full to the employer/insurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Clearly, then, Chaney\u2019s use of the term \u201csubrogation\u201d was not inadvertent; it constituted an assertion by Chaney that it believed it was entitled, as the compensation payer, to obtain reimbursement from a third party tortfeasor, by way of subrogation, for its compensation payments. Put another way, when Chaney used the word \u201csubrogation\u201d in its report to the WCC, it made a representation to the WCC that, as the compensation payer, it would be seeking to recover from a third party tortfeasor. This compels the conclusion that Chaney regarded Genstar as a third party tortfeasor, because Chaney would not have had any subrogation rights as to Genstar if Genstar was a special or dual employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Moreover, Chaney\u2019s course of conduct in failing to file any issues to contest the claim; in failing to request a hearing; and in failing to note an appeal from the award of benefits, lends support to our conclusion that Chaney regarded Genstar as a third party tortfeasor, rather than a special or joint employer. Chaney\u2019s conduct, viewed in its entirety, was entirely consistent with its representation to the WCC that it had a subrogation claim against a third party tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">This conclusion requires us to analyze the doctrine of \u201ces-toppel,\u201d which was the basis on which the Commission ruled that Chaney was the \u201ccorrect employer,\u201d and was barred from pursuing its special employer claim against Genstar. Although the Commission did not identify the particular form of estoppel on which it relied, we shall focus on judicial estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Chaney asserts, <em>inter alia, </em>that it \u201cis not judicially estopped from asserting that Genstar was a special employer and/or joint employer of Windsor [because] Chaney has not successfully pursued a position that Genstar was not Windsor\u2019s special employer at the time of the accident in any prior legal proceeding.\u201d In addition, Chaney claims that, even if it \u201cadvanced a position that it was Windsor\u2019s general employer, that position is not inconsistent with a position that Genstar was Windsor\u2019s special employer.\u201d We disagree with Chaney. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>As we see it, the WCC correctly found that Chaney\u2019s belated assertion of a special employer claim was barred under the doctrine of estoppel; its use of the term \u201cestoppel\u201d encompassed judicial estoppel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u201cMaryland has long recognized the doctrine of estoppel by admission, derived from the rule laid down by the English <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Court of Exchequer . .. that \u2018[a] man shall not be allowed to blow hot and cold, to claim at one time and deny at another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Eagan v. Calhoun, </em>347 Md. 72, 87-88, 698 A.2d 1097 (1997) (citation omitted). In <em>WinMark Ltd. Partnership v. Miles &amp; Stockbridge, </em>345 Md. 614, 620, 693 A.2d 824 (1997), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">\u201c \u2018If parties in court were permitted to assume inconsistent positions in the trial of their causes, the usefulness of courts of justice would in most cases be paralyzed; the coercive process of the law, available only between those who consented to its exercise, could be set at naught by all.... It may accordingly be laid down as a broad proposition that one who, without mistake induced by the opposite party, has taken a particular position deliberately in the course of litigation, must act consistently with it; one cannot play fast and loose.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">(Internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gordon v. Posner, </em>142 Md.App. 399, 790 A.2d 675, <em>cert. denied, </em>369 Md. 180, 798 A.2d 552 (2002), is illuminating. There, we explained that \u201c[\u00bfjudicial estoppel, also known as the \u2018doctrine against inconsistent positions, and \u2018estoppel by admission,\u2019 prevents \u2018a party who successfully pursued a position in a prior legal proceeding from asserting a contrary position in a later proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424, 790 A.2d 675 (quoting <em>Roane v. Washington Co. Hosp., </em>137 Md.App. 582, 592, 769 A.2d 263, <em>cert. denied, </em>364 Md. 463, 773 A.2d 514 (2001)). Elucidating the rationale that undergirds the doctrine of judicial estoppel, Judge Adkins wrote for this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">There are two important reasons for estoppel. First, the doctrine of judicial estoppel \u201crests upon the principle that a litigant should not be permitted to lead a court to find a fact one way and then contend in another judicial proceeding that the same fact should be found otherwise.\u201d . .. Judicial estoppel ensures \u201cthe \u2018integrity of the judicial process\u2019 by \u2018prohibiting parties from deliberately changing positions according to the exigencies of the moment[.]\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>Gordon, </em>142 Md.App. at 425, 790 A.2d 675 (alteration in original) (citing <em>New Hampshire v.

Moore, </em>157 Md-App. 40, 62, 849 A.2d 63 (2004), Judge Deborah Eyler said for this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">Three factors \u2018typically inform the decision whether to apply\u2019 the doctrine of judicial estoppel in a particular case: whether the party\u2019s later position is clearly inconsistent with its earlier position; whether the party succeeded in persuading the court in the earlier matter to accept its position, so that judicial acceptance of the contrary position in the later matter would create the perception that one of the courts had been misled; and whether the party seeking to assert the inconsistent position in the later matter would derive an unfair advantage, or would impose an unfair detriment on the other party, from being permitted to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Numerous courts in other jurisdictions have recognized the doctrine of judicial estoppel. <em>See, e.g., Talavera v. School Bd. of Palm Beach </em>County, 129 F.3d 1214, 1217 (11th Cir.1997) (recognizing that the doctrine of judicial estoppel \u201c \u2018is applied to the calculated assertion of divergent sworn positions. The doctrine is designed to prevent parties from making a mockery of justice by inconsistent pleadings.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>McKinnon v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Alabama, </em>935 F.2d 1187, 1192 (11th Cir.1991)); <em>Reynolds v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>861 F.2d 469, 472 (6th Cir.1988) (\u201cCourts have used a variety of metaphors to describe the doctrine, characterizing it as a rule against \u2018playing \u201cfast and loose with the courts,\u2019 \u201d ... \u2018blowing hot and cold as the occasion demands,\u2019... or \u2018hav[ing] [one\u2019s] cake and eat[ing] it too.\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Iowa Utilities Bd. v. FCC, </em>219 F.3d 744, 756 (8th Cir.2000) (\u201c Th[is] doctrine ... prohibits a party from taking inconsistent positions in the same or related litigation.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>see also Pegram v.

Zurich Ins. Co., </em>667 F.2d 1162, 1166 (4th Cir.1982); <em>see Lowery v. Stovall, </em>92 F.3d 219, 223 (4th Cir.1996). Indeed, the Supreme Court has cautioned that there is no \u201cexhaustive formula for determining the applicability of judicial estoppel.\u201d <em>New Hampshire v. Maine, </em>532 U.S. at 751, 121 S.Ct. 1808. To the contrary, various \u201cconsiderations may inform the doctrine\u2019s application in specific factual contexts.\u201d <em>Id.; see Vogel v. Touhey, </em>151 Md.App. 682, 706-709, 828 A.2d 268 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">We acknowledge that a party is not always foreclosed from asserting a position that is inconsistent with one previously adopted. Judicial estoppel is inapplicable unless the party \u201c \u2018 \u201chad, or was chargeable with, full knowledge of the facts and another will be prejudiced by his action.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Gordon, </em>142 Md.App. at 426, 790 A.2d 675 (citations omitted); <em>see Stone v. Stone, </em>230 Md. 248, 253, 186 A.2d 590 (1962); <em>United Book Press v. Maryland Composition Co., Inc., </em>141 Md.App. 460, 470, 786 A.2d 1 (2001); <em>Roane, </em>137 Md.App. at 592, 769 A.2d 263. In this case, however, there is no question that Chaney was chargeable with knowledge of the fact that Windsor had been \u201cloaned\u201d to Genstar and that the incident occurred at Genstar\u2019s premises, while Windsor was working for Genstar. Such knowledge was sufficient to alert Chaney to a special employer claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Moreover, as the Court in <em>Temporary Staffing, Inc. </em>underscored, it is the Commission\u2019s function to resolve issues of employer status in a workers\u2019 compensation case. Yet, Chaney never asked the WCC to determine whether Genstar was a special or joint employer until six years after the accident. Rather, Chaney immediately represented to the WCC that it had a subrogation claim. In the context of this case, the term \u201csubrogation\u201d was a shorthand reference for Chaney\u2019s position that Genstar was a third party tortfeasor, not a special or dual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>employer. Thus, Chaney presented itself to the Commission as Windsor\u2019s employer, and the Commission accepted Chaney\u2019s position. Accordingly, Chaney\u2019s belated attempt in 2001 to characterize Genstar as a special or joint employer represents the assertion of a legal position inconsistent with one previously advanced in a legal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">In our view, <em>Mackall v. Zayre, supra, </em>293 Md. at 226, 443 A.2d 98, does not compel a different conclusion. There, the Court of Appeals considered whether the principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel barred a company from challenging, in a tort case, its status as an employer of an injured worker, even though the Commission had previously determined that the injured worker was the employee of another company. <em>Id. </em>at 222, 443 A.2d 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Zayre Corporation operated a chain of department stores, and Alden Millinery leased space in one of Zayre\u2019s stores. Mackall, the injured employee, managed the Alden concession in one of Zayre\u2019s stores. <em>Id. </em>at 222-23, 443 A.2d 98. She was injured when she slipped on a liquid on the floor in the Zayre\u2019s store, outside the area leased by Alden. <em>Id. </em>at 223, 443 A.2d 98. Mackall filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation, naming \u201cAlden Millinery, c/o Zayre Hampton Mall\u201d as her employer. <em>Id. </em>At the workers\u2019 compensation hearing, Mackall testified that she was employed by Alden, not Zayre. <em>Id. </em>The Commission subsequently ordered Alden and its insurer to pay compensation benefits to Mackall. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Thereafter, Mackall filed a tort suit against Zayre, alleging that she was injured due to Zayre\u2019s negligence. Zayre claimed it was a co-employer, and thus was immune from suit under the predecessor version of the workers\u2019 compensation statute. <em>Id. </em>at 223-24, 443 A.2d 98. The issue was submitted to a jury, which determined that Mackall was the employee of both Alden and Zayre. <em>Id. </em>at 226, 443 A.2d 98. The Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">On appeal, Mackall argued that, because Zayre and Alden had the same insurer and were represented by the same law firm in the compensation and tort cases, Zayre was a party or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>in privity with a party to the workers\u2019 compensation proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 227, 443 A.2d 98. Relying on principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel, Mackall argued that Zayre was barred from contesting its status as an employer, because the Commission had already determined that Alden was the employer. <em>Id. </em>at 227, 443 A.2d 98. The Court disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">After reviewing the principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel, the Court said, <em>id. </em>at 228-29, 443 A.2d 98:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">The relevant issue actually litigated in the workmen\u2019s compensation proceeding was Alden\u2019s status as an employer and the fact determined there was that Alden was Mackall\u2019s employer. Zayre\u2019s status as Mackall\u2019s employer was not in issue and, therefore, was not determined in the workmen\u2019s compensation proceeding. The issue presented in the subsequent tort action was Zayre\u2019s status as Mackall\u2019s employer, and the fact to be determined there was whether Zayre, as well as Alden, was her employer. Accordingly, under the applicable principle of collateral estoppel, Zayre was not prevented, in the subsequent tort action, from litigating its status as Mackall\u2019s employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">As we see it, this case is factually distinguishable from <em>Zayre. </em>In filing suit against Genstar, Windsor did not attempt to foreclose a claim by Genstar that it was a dual employer, even though the WCC had issued an order determining that Chaney was Windsor\u2019s employer. Yet, that was what Mackall, the employee, had attempted to do, and it was that course of conduct that the Court rejected. Here, it is Chaney, the employer, who seeks to litigate whether Genstar was a special or joint employer, even though Chaney failed to join Genstar as a party in the compensation proceedings, where this issue should have been resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Because Chaney never contested the compensation claim, the Commission issued an award of July 18, 1995, in which it identified Chaney as the sole employer, and required Chaney and its Insurer to pay benefits to Windsor. The order was immediately appealable, yet no appeal was taken. Chaney\u2019s failure to file issues and its failure to note an appeal support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>our conclusion that Chaney asserted to the WCC the position that, based on its subrogation rights, Genstar was a third party tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Under all of the circumstances attendant here, Chaney\u2019s conduct contravened the principles embodied in the statutory scheme. Its belated filing of issues was tantamount to the assertion of a position contrary to an earlier position that it had taken with the Commission. Moreover, Chaney\u2019s belated assertion was detrimental to Genstar, given that Chase, the Genstar foreman at the time of the accident, has since died.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY AFFIRMED.

In a legal memorandum submitted by Chaney to the WCC, Chaney alleged that Windsor filed the suit \"without consulting Liberty [Mutual], presumably because Liberty had notified Windsor\u2019s counsel of an assertion of a lien on any third party recovery....\u201d We are unaware of such a contention by Liberty Mutual. And, in Genstar's brief to this Court, it asserted that Liberty Mutual sued Genstar as a third party tortfeasor, and pointed out that \"the same [law] firm that represented Liberty Mutual in the third-party tortfeasor suit also represented Chaney in the indemnification suit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b30-8\">. As we discuss, <em>infra, </em>if Genstar had been Windsor\u2019s employer at the time of the accident, Windsor would not have been entitled to pursue a third party tort claim against Genstar. <em>See </em>Maryland Code, Labor and Employment Article \u00a7 9-509 (stating that \"the liability of an employer under this title is exclusive\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b30-9\">. Chaney\u2019s civil suit against Genstar is not directly before us. We note, however, that, in the proceedings before the Commission, Chaney alleged that Genstar was Windsor\u2019s \"special employer\u201d or, in the alternative, that Genstar was \"a joint employer.\u201d In contrast, in the civil suit Chaney alleged only that Genstar was a special employer, not a dual employer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b40-6\">. An employee may also pursue a civil action against an employer if the employee's injury is the result of the deliberate intention of the employer. <em>See </em>L.E. \u00a7 9-509(d). This provision has no bearing on the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b61-6\">. In asserting tha1 judicial estoppel does not apply here, Chaney has not claimed that the doctrine is inapplicable because the matter originated in an administrative proceeding. Although we have not found a Maryland case that is pertinent, numerous jurisdictions have recognized that the doctrine of judicial estoppel applies to administrative proceedings. <em>See, e.g., King v. Herbert J. Thomas Memorial Hosp., </em>159 F.3d 192, 196 (4th Cir.1998) (stating that the doctrine of judicial estoppel has three elements, including: \u201cThe party to be estopped must be asserting a position that is factually incompatible with a position taken in a prior judicial <em>or administrative proceeding </em>....\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Simon v. Safelite Glass Corp., </em>128 F.3d 68, 72 (2nd Cir.1997) (\u201cNumerous decisions have approved the application of judicial estoppel where the prior statements were made in administrative or quasi-judicial proceedings.\u201d); <em>Portela-Gonzalez v. Sec'y. of the Navy, </em>109 F.3d 74, 78 (1st Cir.1997) (\"[A] party cannot take one position in an underlying administrative proceeding and then disclaim it in a subsequent suit arising out of the agency proceedings.\u201d); <em>Chaveriat v. Williams Pipe Line Co. </em>11 F.3d 1420, 1427 (7th Cir.1993)(\"[T]he doctrine [of judicial estoppel] has been applied, rightly in our view, to proceedings in which a party to an administrative proceeding obtains a favorable order that he seeks to repudiate in a subsequent judicial proceeding.\u201d); <em>Alabama v. Sholala, </em>124 F.Supp.2d 1250, 1266 (M.D.Ala.2000)(\"The doctrine of judicial estoppel applies even where the party made the prior inconsistent statements in an administrative forum.\u201d); <em>Kamont v. West, </em>258 F.Supp.2d 495, 499 (S.D.Miss.2003)(concluding that plaintiff was judicially estopped from pursuing her claims with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission because she failed to disclose such claims in a prior bankruptcy petition requiring her to reveal all known causes of action.); <em>Barack Ferrazzano Kirschbaum Perlman &amp; Nagelberg v. Loffredi, </em>342 Ill.App.3d 453, 277 Ill.Dec. 111, 795 N.E.2d 779, 786-88 (2003)(coucluding that, in state court proceeding, clients were judicially estopped from challenging reasonableness of claim of former attorneys for legal fees due and owing in connection with representation before the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., when clients previously asked NASD to award legal fees against the defendant in the NASD proceeding, and made no claim that the legal fees of the original lawyers were unnecessary or unreasonable); <em>In re Pich, </em>253 B.R. 562, 569 (Bankr.D.Idaho 2000) (\"Debtor [in bankruptcy] is not entitled to now stand on residency in order to claim a homestead [exception] having previously, by his application for rezoning, inherently and necessarily represented [to zoning board in classification proceeding] that no residence was contemplated.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
