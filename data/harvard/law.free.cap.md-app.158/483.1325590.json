The award of attorney\u2019s fees has been the subject of two petitions for judicial review by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, the latter of which is now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">In her first petition for judicial review, appellant contested the decision of the Montgomery County Public Accommodation Panel of the MCOHR (\u201cPanel\u201d) to award her $3,000.00 in attorney\u2019s fees. The circuit court reversed that decision and remanded with instructions for the Panel to apply the appropriate factors set forth in the county code for calculating a reasonable fee award. The Panel issued its second award of attorney\u2019s fees for $22,440.00, and appellant, still aggrieved, filed a second petition for judicial review. The court subsequently affirmed the Panel\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">Appellant has appealed from the court\u2019s order affirming that award of attorney\u2019s fees. She raises the following issue for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-10\">Whether the Montgomery County Circuit Court committed an error of law by affirming the Public Accommodations Panel\u2019s Order and Opinion Awarding Attorney\u2019s Fees, in which the Panel failed to apply the lodestar method in its calculation of attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Because we conclude that the Panel did not properly analyze the fee issue, we vacate the judgment of the circuit court affirming the Panel\u2019s decision and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Inasmuch as the underlying facts giving rise to appellant\u2019s discrimination claims against appellee are not the focus of this appeal, we shall not chronicle all of the details of those claims. We shall present only those facts necessary for context, and concentrate our attention upon the facts pertaining to appellant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">On December 23, 1993, appellant filed a marital status discrimination claim with the MCOHR. She averred that appellee\u2019s policies, which restricted access to and use of appel-lee\u2019s golf course, were discriminatory on the basis of marital status and resulted in disparate treatment of her because of sex.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant thereafter amended her claim to add a sex discrimination claim, asserting theories of disparate impact in the membership structure and hostile environment in appel-lee\u2019s indoor restaurant, known as the Grill Room.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">At about the same time, appellant, with others, filed a complaint with the Office of the Attorney General of Maryland, identifying the same claims and setting forth the same legal theories as those alleged in the MCOHR complaint. After the Attorney\u2019s General Office launched an investigation into appellant\u2019s claims, appellee modified numerous club policies to avoid potential prosecution for unlawful discriminatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>practices. No formal charges were ever brought against appellee by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">On January 6, 1997, following an investigation, MCOHR found reasonable grounds to believe that appellee was a place of public accommodation and had violated Montgomery County Code, \u00a7 27-8 (1987) by engaging in unlawful discriminatory practices on the basis of marital status and gender. MCOHR referred the matter to the Office of Zoning and Administrative Hearings for a public hearing. After five postponements, the parties appeared before a hearing examiner on May 17, 1999, for the first day of what became a ten-day public hearing in which 33 witnesses testified and 158 exhibits were submitted as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">On September 30, 1999, the hearing examiner issued a 141-page Report and Recommendation to the Public Accommodation Panel of the MCOHR. The report stated the hearing examiner\u2019s findings that appellee was a place of public accommodation; that appellee had engaged in sex discrimination (disparate treatment) against appellant during the golf course incident; and that appellee had engaged in gender-based discriminatory practices, creating a hostile environment. The hearing examiner did not find that appellee\u2019s practices had resulted in a disparate impact on women. The hearing examiner recommended the award to appellant of $1,000.00 in damages (the statutory limit), $120,481.00 in attorney\u2019s fees, and $4,282.31 in expenses. Appellant filed a brief seeking modification by the Panel of the hearing examiner\u2019s recommendation on the disparate impact claim. Appellee filed a response to appellant\u2019s request for modification, and separately requested that the Panel modify the hearing examiner\u2019s recommendations with respect to jurisdiction and the hostile environment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">On March 1, 2000, the Panel held a public hearing on the matter and allowed both parties to make oral arguments. Two months later, the Panel issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order adopting the hearing examiner\u2019s finding that appel-lee was a place of public accommodation. The Panel also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>adopted the hearing examiner\u2019s finding that there had been an act of sex discrimination against appellant, namely the incident on the golf course in the spring of 1993. <em>See supra, </em>note 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">The Panel, however, rejected the hearing examiner\u2019s finding that appellee had engaged in sex discrimination by creating a hostile environment, concluding that such theories are reserved for employment cases. The Panel observed that, even assuming appellant could maintain a hostile environment claim in a public accommodation case, her claim still would have failed, because the facts she alleged fell short of creating a hostile environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">In its order dated May 8, 2000, the Panel declared that appellee was a place of public accommodation and had treated appellant differently based on her sex. The Panel then granted the following equitable relief: \u201c[Appellee] is ordered to cease and desist from all activities and conduct that discriminate against women\u201d; \u201c[appellee] is ordered to establish a formal and written policy against discrimination against women in the use of any facilities, services and activities of the club\u201d; \u201c[appellee] is ordered to provide for a confidential and unbiased procedure for filing complaints of discrimination\u201d; and \u201c[appellee] is ordered to provide reasonable access for [MCOHR] staff to monitor compliance with this order.\u201d The Panel awarded appellant $750.00 in damages and $3,000.00 in attorney\u2019s fees, which was a significant reduction of the hearing examiner\u2019s recommended attorney\u2019s fee award of $120,481.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Both parties filed petitions for judicial review in the circuit court, and the parties presented oral argument on January 19, 2001. By order entered on August 10, 2001, the court affirmed the Panel\u2019s decision on all points except its award of attorney\u2019s fees. The court concluded that the Panel erred when it calculated attorney\u2019s fees by simply multiplying $750.00, the damages awarded, by four, to equal an award of $3,000.00. The court stated: \u201cThere exists no authority for the [Panel] to determine the amount of the attorney\u2019s fees award to be a multiple of the amount of the damage award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>given to [appellant].\u201d The court stated that the Panel failed to apply the factors set forth in Montgomery County Code, \u00a7 27-7(k)(l) (1987)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and failed to refute the hearing examiner\u2019s findings that supported his fee recommendation of $120,481.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The court cited a bankruptcy case, <em>Allright Mort. Co. v. Hill, </em>213 B.R. 943 (D.Md.1997). In that case, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland reversed an award of attorney\u2019s fees because the bankruptcy court had calculated fees based on a cost-benefit analysis, which was tantamount to determining attorney\u2019s fees based upon damages awarded to a plaintiff. Pointing to the rationale of that decision, the court in the instant case noted in a footnote to its remand opinion that the Panel\u2019s Chair had contemplated a cost-benefit analysis during oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The court reversed the Panel\u2019s decision and remanded the case with instructions for the Panel to consider the factors listed in \u00a7 27-7(k)(l) of the Montgomery County Code, as well as the degree of success in appellant\u2019s pursuit of her claims in calculating attorney\u2019s fees. The court added that appellant had prevailed on her claim that appellee was a place of public accommodation, which was a case of first impression in Maryland, and on her claim of sex discrimination, but appellant did not prevail on her claims of hostile environment and disparate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>impact. The court also noted that, because a prevailing plaintiff may recover fees for trial and appeal, the Panel should consider appellant\u2019s claim for fees up to the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Pursuant to the court\u2019s order, the Panel issued an order directing appellant to submit to the Panel an application for award of attorney\u2019s fees that applied to the instant case the factors in \u00a7 27-7(k)(l) of the Montgomery County Code. Appellant duly filed an application for attorney\u2019s fees that had accrued from May 3, 1993 to September 27, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Appellee filed an opposition, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellant\u2019s application was deficient because the time entries lacked specificity and bundled more than one activity per entry.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These deficiencies, appellee argued, precluded the Panel from identifying how much time counsel spent on her unsuccessful claims of disparate impact and hostile environment, and the complaint before the Office of the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The Panel thereafter issued an undated memorandum order, listing its preliminary findings with respect to the factors in \u00a7 27 \u2014 7(k)(l) of the Montgomery County Code, and stating that appellant was entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees for time spent litigating the jurisdictional question of whether appellee was a place of public accommodation. The Panel instructed appellant to submit \u201ca revised billing report indicating the estimated time spent only on the issue of determining [appellee] to be a place of public accommodation.\u201d Appellant subsequently filed a revised billing report, which included time entries for 757.17 hours of work spent litigating the public accommodation issue, amounting to $131,476.10. In the same petition, appellant identified an additional 436.17 hours ($71,-044.04) in fees accrued while litigating the attorney\u2019s fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Appellee filed an opposition, arguing that $131,476.10 was not a reasonable fee for litigating the jurisdictional issue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>because that figure amounted to 70 percent of the total time counsel spent litigating the entire case. Appellee further argued that appellant\u2019s time entries were still unbundled and unduly vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">On October 10, 2002, the Panel issued an Order and Opinion Awarding Attorney\u2019s Fees, in which the Panel addressed, preliminarily, issues of specificity and bundling of time entries. As for the specificity issue, the Panel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">The Panel has scrutinized the time records involved and read the briefs of both parties, but cannot, with any degree of reliability, determine what tasks were accomplished related to which of the causes of action in this matter. We do not believe that [appellant] and her counsel have met their burden of proof to demonstrate to this Panel what time was spent on the issue of jurisdiction of the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The Panel went on to state, with respect to bundling, that appellee demonstrated in its opposition how appellant\u2019s application was \u201creplete with examples of such bundled billings.\u201d The Panel added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">[I]t is not our responsibility to make subjective estimates as to how such entries should be allocated. Moreover, the Panel is comprised of volunteers and does not have access to staff who could spend large amounts of time to attempt to make such estimates, even if the Panel thought it wise to attempt to do so, which it does not. For those reasons, we will make the rate percentage cuts in the final award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AmC\">The Panel then addressed each of the factors in \u00a7 27-7(k)(l) of the Montgomery County Code. With respect to time and labor required, the Panel stated that clerical work and inefficient and redundant work had to be excluded from billable time.- The Panel determined that \u201cthe same task and research were performed by counsel multiple times.\u201d The Panel also considered what a reasonable client would pay, stating that it could not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">fathom how any person, dealing with the facts alleged, could have decided that it was worth $250,000 or so to litigate these issues. We believe that an attorney has a responsibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>ity to dissuade clients or potential clients from launching costly litigation, knowing that the other party will incur enormous defense costs, where the cost/benefit ratio of that litigation is low. In this case particularly, damages were capped under the statute. Rather, it is our decision on this issue that any reasonable client would not have been willing to spend more than $25,000 to pursue claims of the type made in this proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Addressing the novelty and complexity of the case, the Panel credited appellant for successfully litigating the jurisdictional issue, which was a case of first impression in Maryland. The Panel also pointed out that appellant had presented no evidence that counsel was precluded from other employment while litigating the instant case or that there were strict time limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Neither the Panel nor appellee contested the hourly rates used in calculating attorney\u2019s fees; the Panel therefore deemed the rates reasonable. The Panel decided to make no adjustment relating to the skill required to litigate the case, the customary fee for similar cases, or whether the fee was fixed or contingent.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Despite finding that lead counsel was experienced in this area of the law, the Panel declined to make an upward adjustment on that basis. With respect to awards in similar cases, the Panel found little evidence on that point, but nonetheless described appellant\u2019s request for fees as \u201cexcessive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">In addressing the factor of relative success of appellant\u2019s case, the Panel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">We found some of [appellant\u2019s] major theories and alleged causes of action brought in this case to be without merit and therefore declined to follow the recommendations of the Hearing Examiner on those issues of law. Moreover, in awarding the monetary damages that we did, this Panel was well aware of the fact that there was one (and only one) proven instance of \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d We felt compelled by the statute to award injunctive relief, regardless of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>we believed that there were systemic wrongs to be righted. As discussed above, only the argument and decision in favor of finding for the jurisdiction of the Commission was a major victory for [appellant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The Panel declined to make an upward adjustment on the relative success factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">The Panel concluded by stating that, based on its consideration of the factors set forth in \u00a7 27-7(k)(l) of the Montgomery County Code, appellant was entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $22,440.00, reflecting 132 hours of work at a rate of $170.00 per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">Appellant filed a petition for judicial review; appellee filed a response; and, seven months later, the parties appeared for a hearing on the matter. Ruling from the bench, the court affirmed the Panel\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees. Then, by order entered on June 30, 2003, the court specifically found that the Panel did not abuse its discretion or commit legal error in reaching its decision concerning appellant\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees. The court determined that the Panel properly applied the \u00a7 27 \u2014 7(k)(l) factors and that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the Panel\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">From that order, appellant filed the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">Appellate review of the Panel\u2019s decisions is governed by Montgomery County Code, \u00a7 2A-11 (1994, April 2002 Supp.), which provides: \u201cAny party to the [administrative] proceeding in the circuit court may appeal from such decision to the appellate courts of Maryland pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Maryland Rules of Procedure.\u201d Upon review of an administrative decision, we make our determination independent of the circuit court\u2019s ruling. <em>Mayer v. Montgomery County, </em>143 Md.App. 261, 270, 794 A.2d 704 (2002). We \u201cproceedf ] directly to the review of the administrative decision itself.\u201d <em>Department of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Shrieves, </em>100 Md.App. 283, 303, 641 A.2d 899 (1994). We are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>\u201c \u2018 \u201cunder no constraints in reversing an administrative decision which is premised solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d\u2019\u201d <em>Mayer, </em>143 Md.App. at 271, 794 A.2d 704 (citations omitted). Furthermore, a \u201c \u2018reviewing court \u201cmust substitute its judgment for that of the agency if ... [its] interpretation of the applicable legal principles is different from that of the agency.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">Appellant argues that the Panel committed legal error by failing to apply the so called lodestar analysis in calculating its award of attorney\u2019s fees, and applying, instead, a cost-benefit analysis. As we shall discuss, we agree with appellant that the Panel, although attempting to do so, did not properly apply the lodestar approach. For that reason, we vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings. Our decision makes it unnecessary to reach appellant\u2019s argument that the Panel wrongly relied on a cost-benefit analysis in calculating the fee award. We shall, however, comment briefly upon the argument at the close of our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">We begin our discussion with an explanation of the lodestar analysis. As explained by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart,, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983), \u201c[t]he most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. This calculation provides an objective basis on which to make an initial estimate of the value of a lawyer\u2019s services.\u201d In calculating the initial figure, known as the lodestar, reductions should be made for time that was not \u201c \u2018reasonably expended,\u2019 \u201d which includes hours that are \u201cexcessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434, 103 S.Ct. 1933. \u201cWhere the documentation of hours is inadequate, the [trial] court may reduce the award accordingly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433, 103 S.Ct. 1933. Once the lodestar is calculated, the inquiry continues by considering other factors that determine any upward or downward adjustments to the lodestar, based on the circumstances of the particular case, as measured by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>the 12 factors identified in <em>Hensley</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> Id. </em>at 434, 103 S.Ct. 1933.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u201cIf the court believes that a fee reduction in the lodestar is indicated, it must analyze the circumstance requiring the reduction and its relation to the fee, and it must make specific findings to support its action.\u201d <em>Prandini v. National Tea Co., </em>585 F.2d 47, 52 (3d Cir.1978). In doing so, the trial court \u201cshould be mindful of its obligation to produce an order on attorney[\u2019]s fees that allows for \u2018meaningful review' by articulating the decisions made and supplying principled reasons for those decisions.\u201d <em>American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia v. Barnes, </em>168 F.3d 423, 428 (11th Cir.1999) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">A court \u201cmay not reduce an award by a particular percentage or amount (albeit for justifiable reasons) in an arbitrary or indiscriminate fashion.\u201d <em>Prandini, </em>585 F.2d at 52; <em>accord Robinson v. City of Edmond, </em>160 F.3d 1275, 1281 (10th Cir.1998) (noting that \u201c \u2018[t]he record ought to assure us that the [trial] court did not \u201ceyeball\u201d the fee request and cut it down by an arbitrary percentage\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). Rather, the reduction in hours requires a \u201c \u2018concise but clear explanation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. Great Am. Rests., Inc., </em>969 F.2d 430, 439 (7th Cir.1992) (citation omitted). An \u201cexpression of general concerns accompanied by seemingly arbitrary cuts in billable hours is neither fair to litigants nor an appropriate basis for meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Hutchison v. Amateur Elec. Supply, Inc., </em>42 F.3d 1037, 1048 (7th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>In the case <em>sub judies, </em>the Panel stated in its decision that it could not, \u201cwith any degree of reliability, determine what tasks were accomplished related to which of the causes of action in this matter.\u201d For that reason, the Panel concluded, appellant failed to meet her burden to prove that the amount of time spent litigating the case, in relation to the tasks performed, was reasonable. The Panel explained that, because appellant\u2019s petition contained bundled time entries, it would <em>\u201cmake the rate percentage cats in the final award. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Following this statement, the Panel made findings of fact concerning each of the lodestar factors, and declined to make either upward or downward adjustments to the fee award. The Panel concluded that, based on its lodestar analysis, appellant should be awarded $22,440.00 in attorney\u2019s fees, which is the product of 132 hours multiplied by an hourly rate of $170.00 per hour.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Appellant\u2019s revised petition to the Panel, reflecting the time spent litigating the public accommodation issue, requested $131,476.10, plus $71,044.04 in fees that accrued while litigating the attorney\u2019s fees dispute, for a total of $202,520.14. That figure represented 1,193.34 hours at an average billing rate of approximately $170.00. Therefore, the Panel\u2019s award of $22,440.00 reflected an 89 percent reduction of the hours reported by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">As we review the Panel\u2019s decision, we observe preliminarily that there is no indication how, if at all, the Panel calculated the lodestar before considering the adjustment factors. Calculation of the lodestar, however, is the first step in the lodestar analysis. That fact alone leads us to conclude that the Panel committed legal error in calculating the fee award and that the case must be remanded for a determination of the lodestar.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Moreover, the record contains no explanation for the Panel\u2019s across-the-board reduction of appellant\u2019s fee award after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Panel applied the lodestar adjustments. In <em>Friolo v. Frankel, </em>373 Md. 501, 512, 819 A.2d 354 (2003), the Court of Appeals addressed an issue similar to the one before us, namely \u201cwhether, in determining the amount of the fee, the [trial] court was required, as a matter of law, to use the lodestar approach and failed to do so.\u201d In <em>Friolo, </em>the trial court had mentioned briefly only two of the lodestar adjustment factors before proceeding to award attorney\u2019s fees in an amount equal to 40 percent of the damages. <em>Id. </em>at 510-11, 819 A.2d 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The <em>Friolo </em>Court stated at the outset that failure to apply the lodestar approach results in an error of law. <em>Id. </em>at 512, 819 A.2d 354. The Court then examined the trial court\u2019s calculation of fees and declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">We cannot conclude from this record that the trial court used [the lodestar] approach; its remarks were far too ambiguous in that regard. Even if it intended to apply that approach, it gave no real indication of how and why it concluded that a fee equivalent to a 40% share of the recovery was appropriate \u2014 why the $57,000 claimed should be reduced to that amount.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 529, 819 A.2d 354. The Court therefore remanded the case for the trial court to calculate attorney\u2019s fees using the lodestar analysis, but declined to suggest the appropriate fee award. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Although the case <em>sub judice </em>is factually distinct from <em>Fnolo </em>in the sense that the Panel did not award fees in this case based on a percentage of the damages awarded to appellant, but instead made a flat rate percentage reduction in hours, the same legal principle applies in both cases: When a court or administrative agency is charged with calculating an award of attorney\u2019s fees using the lodestar approach, the court or agency must provide its rationale for making a percentage reduction in a request for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">We are unaware of any authority supporting an 89 percent reduction in hours in a case in which the party seeking attorney\u2019s fees prevailed on two of its four claims and one of those claims was a matter of first impression. Moreover, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>cases that do involve sizable reductions in the reported hours, the courts have explained the rationale underlying their downward adjustments. <em>See, e.g., Spegon v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, </em>175 F.3d 544, 552-53 (7th Cir.1999) (upholding the trial court\u2019s reduction of hours for an attorney who had failed to attempt to settle the matter before filing suit and another attorney whose work consisted solely of \u201csimple administrative tasks that easily could have been performed by a full-time secretary\u201d); <em>hi re \u201cAgent Orange\u201d Prod. Liab. Litig., </em>818 F.2d 226, 237 (2d Cir.1987) (affirming the trial court\u2019s decision to reduce by 50 percent the hours spent reading scientific literature, traveling, reviewing depositions, and to disallow a percentage of hours spent reading the mail and speaking on the telephone), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 1004, 108 S.Ct. 695, 98 L.Ed.2d 648 (1988); <em>Securities &amp; Exch. Comm\u2019n v. Goren, </em>272 F.Supp.2d 202, 209-12 (E.D.N.Y.2003) (approving a magistrate\u2019s reduction of hours by 30 percent as a result of excessive and unnecessary billings, insufficient detail in the fee applications, and uncorroborated activities, all of which were identified with specificity); <em>Rolland v. Cellucci, </em>151 F.Supp.2d 145, 157-58 (D.Mass.2001) (disallowing hours spent on post-judgment activities due to excessive time spent in multiple attorney conferences and performance of out-of-court tasks by attorneys that could have been completed by paralegals, such as making arrangements for experts and accompanying them on tours).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">The Panel seems to suggest in its decision that it was incapable of explaining its reductions as a result of appellant\u2019s \u201cunduly vague and excessive\u201d time entries. Yet, appellee, in its challenge to appellant\u2019s fee petition, was able to identify numerous billing entries in which, according to appellee, appellant had overestimated the hours spent litigating the jurisdictional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">For example, appellee challenged appellant\u2019s claim in its revised billing report that 10.1 hours were spent on the jurisdictional issue in the MCOHR\u2019s Determination on January 6, 1997. Appellee argued that, because only part of the Determination was focused on jurisdiction, it was improper to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>report that the full 10.1 hours were devoted to the jurisdictional question. Appellee also challenged, several other specific time entries in which appellant claimed to have spent time litigating the public accommodation issue during activities that involved a broader range of issues, <em>i.e., </em>researching the appeal process; participating in a teleconference with the judge\u2019s law clerk; drafting a letter; researching the status of the MCOHR order during the appeals process; reviewing cases on the standard of review; revising discovery; and conducting a teleconference with the client to discuss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Appellee also argued that appellant\u2019s billing report reflected an arbitrary reduction of the hours in certain time entries by 50 percent, when, in fact, the reductions should have been greater than 50 percent. Appellee noted, for instance, that appellant reduced the billed hours by 50 percent for the drafting and preparing of a Pre-Hearing Statement, to reflect time spent on the public accommodation question, when that document makes only brief mention of that issue. Appellee made the same argument of arbitrary time reductions with respect to several other time entries.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Given that appellee was able to discern from appellant\u2019s revised billing report the aforementioned alleged deficiencies, we cannot see how the Panel was unable to provide a clear and concise explanation of its rate percentage reduction. This is particularly so in light of the fact that appellee had drawn the Panel\u2019s attention to many of the potentially disallowed hours by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Because we are unable to discern from the record if and how the Panel calculated the lodestar figure, or why it made such a substantial reduction in the hours reported in appellant\u2019s revised billing statement, we vacate the award of attorney\u2019s fees and remand the case to the circuit court for further remand to the Panel. The Panel must first determine the lodestar amount and, if reductions are made, provide an explanation for the disallowed hours.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Our disposition of this appeal does not require us to reach the merits of appellant\u2019s argument that the Panel based its award of attorney\u2019s fees on a cost-benefit analysis. We nevertheless caution the Panel on remand against utilizing a cost-benefit analysis, or any method of calculation that makes the fee award proportional to the monetary judgment awarded. The Supreme Court stated in <em>City of Riverside v. Rivera, </em>477 U.S. 561, 577, 106 S.Ct. 2686, 91 L.Ed.2d 466 (1986), that \u201c[a] rule of proportionality would make it difficult, if not impossible, for individuals with meritorious civil rights claims but relatively small potential damages to obtain redress from the courts. This is totally inconsistent with Congress\u2019 purpose in enacting [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1988.\u201d <em>Accord Blaylock v. Johns Hopkins Fed. Credit Union, </em>152 Md.App. 338, 356, 831 A.2d 1120 (2003). Even assuming that the Panel did not engage in a cost-benefit analysis in considering the time and labor required to litigate the underlying case, the Panel came dangerously close to crossing that line.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As we have explained, the proper methodology for the instant case is the lodestar approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY VACATED.

Flaa: \u201cYou know women can't play on the golf course.\u201d He asked Ms. Biswell if she was a member. When she answered yes, he turned to Ms. Flaa and told her women don\u2019t belong on the course. He told her to pick up her ball and get oif the course immediately. She was not allowed to finish the hole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"pAHI\">The Panel adopted the hearing examiner\u2019s findings on this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\">. Montgomery County Code, \u00a7 27-7(k)(l) (1987) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">The complainant may be awarded reasonable attorney's fees. In determining the reasonableness of attorney's fees claimed by the complainant, the commission panel shall consider the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">a. Time and labor required;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-10\">b. The novelty and complexity of the case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-11\">c.

As we have mentioned, the Panel accepted, as reasonable, the hourly rate included in appellant's fee petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b522-7\">. Although we offer no opinion concerning the award of attorney's fees, we note that appellant may be entitled to reasonable post-judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>attorney\u2019s fees if it is determined that the provisions of the Montgomery County Code applicable in this case are remedial in nature. <em>Pak v.

In <em>Pak, </em>a case involving a landlord/tenant dispute governed by a remedial statute, the Court of Appeals held that the trial court erred in concluding that it could not award post-judgment attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Id. </em>The Court stated: <em>\"Admiral Mortgage, [Inc. v. Cooper, </em>357 Md. 533, 547-48, 745 A.2d 1026 (2000),] clearly implies that, in respect to remedial statutes, courts may allow post-judgment attorney's fees.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\">. Appellant cites the section in the Panel\u2019s opinion titled \"Time and Labor\" as support for its argument that the Panel applied a cost-benefit analysis. That section reads: \u201cWe believe that an attorney has a responsibility to dissuade clients or potential clients from launching costly litigation, knowing that the other party will incur enormous defense costs, where the cost/benefit ratio of that litigation is low.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
