RODOWSKY, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ap-\">(retired, specially assigned).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">The appellee, Constance Thomas, was a correctional officer employed by the appellant, Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (the Department). After Ms. Thomas had been absent from duty without notifying her supervisor why she was absent, the Department considered that she had resigned without notice. This is the second judicial review action involving this separation of Ms. Thomas from State service. Under the applicable personnel regulation, the appointing authority has a discretion to expunge the resignation. For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the agency\u2019s finding of resignation without notice. We shall remand in part, however, because the record fails to reveal that the Department exercised its discretion as to whether to expunge the resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">Ms. Thomas was employed in the Division of Pretrial Detention and Services (the Division). The regulation that is pertinent to this action is Maryland Regs. Code (COMAR) Title 17, \u201cDepartment of Budget and Management,\u201d Subtitle 04, \u201cPersonnel Services and Benefits,\u201d Chapter 4, \u201cSeparations, Reemployment, and Reinstatement,\u201d .03, \u201cResignations.\u201d It provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-10\">\u201cA. An employee may separate from employment by resigning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>\u201cD. An enaployee who is absent from duty without notifying the supervisor of the reasons for the absence and of the employee\u2019s intention to return to duty is absent without leave. After 5 working days from the first day of absence, the appointing authority shall advise the employee by certified and regular mail sent to the employee\u2019s last address of record that the employee is considered to have resigned without notice. A resignation without notice may be expunged by the appointing authority when extenuating circumstances exist, and the employee had good cause for not notifying the appointing authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">\u201cE. Resignations shall be reported to the Secretary. Resignations that are tendered without the proper notice or resignations without notice shall be entered in the employee\u2019s personnel record.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">COMAR 17.04.04.03D is hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The Department also has adopted Standards of Conduct, a copy of which Ms. Thomas acknowledged receiving. In relevant part, Standard of Conduct III, \u201cATTENDANCE REQUIREMENTS,\u201d Part A, \u201cEmployee Responsibilities,\u201d reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">\u201c2. In situations where an employee does not have leave approved and will not be reporting for duty as required, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>he/she shall contact his/her supervisor with a request for unscheduled leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">\u201c3. For absences that exceed one day, the employee shall call in daily until a date of return is established!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">At the evidentiary hearing of the administrative process Ms. Thomas\u2019s work attendance record was introduced through Gwendelyn Bullock, the acting personnel director for the Division. According to her personnel file, Ms. Thomas was injured at work on March 16, 2000, after which time she filed a claim with the Injured Workers Insurance Fund (IWIF). The Division first was notified of Ms. Thomas\u2019s IWIF claim on April 3, 2000, when she requested sick days. Ms. Bullock related that medical documentation \u201cshould be submitted to cover a time frame that would include either a return to work or the next appointment.\u201d She stated that a regulation of the Comptroller\u2019s office required medical documentation every pay period.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Ms. Thomas was absent from work on \u201csick accident\u201d leave from mid-March through mid-September 2000, assertedly due to the work-related accident. She returned to work on September 20, 2000, and worked fairly consistently, with the exception of nine unscheduled days off, until November 27. From November 27 through the date of her termination, with the exception of a single day of work on November 29, Ms. Thomas did not report to work. The time record reveals that she had exhausted all of her personal, annual, and sick leave, and compensatory time by January 2, 2001, after which time the notation \u201cFTR,\u201d signifying \u201cfailure to report,\u201d is listed on her time record. Ms. Thomas failed to report to work from January 2 through January 6, and from January 9 through January 12, the date of her termination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">During December 2000 Ms. Thomas caused two certificates from her physician, Donald J. Hayes, M.D., to be delivered to her supervisor through a co-worker, O\u2019Neil Dezonie. One certificate, dated December 5, 2000, read: \u201cExcuse absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>from 11/30/00 to 12/10/00U Return to work 12/11/00.\u201d The second certificate, dated December 20, 2000, read: \u201cExcuse absence from 12/11/00 to pending treatment and response.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">On January 12, 2001, LaMont Flanagan, the Commissioner of the Division, wrote to Ms. Thomas by certified and ordinary mail. He quoted the Rule and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">\u201cOur records indicate you have been absent without notification to your supervisor, in person or in writing, since 01/02/01. Therefore in accordance with the above stated regulation, we have terminated your employment as a correctional officer effective 01/12/01.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Ms. Thomas contacted her union representative, Andrew Jackson. The events that thereafter transpired are not presented with precision in the record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Documentary evidence reflects that on January 16, 2001, there was a discussion concerning Ms. Thomas\u2019s \u201cgrievance or discipline\u201d with the \u201cappointing authority.\u201d This information is recited in a preprinted, fill-in-the-blanks, \u201cappeal and grievance form\u201d that Mr. Jackson filed with the personnel division of the Department on January 26, 2001. In the blank headed, \u201cState the issues of fact and law that support the employee\u2019s appeal,\u201d Mr. Jackson inserted \u201cCOMAR 17.04.05.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">At a time that is not specified in the record, there was exhibited or delivered to the Department a certificate by Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Hayes, dated January 22, 2002, that stated that Ms. Thomas \u201ccontinues to be under my care.\u201d Of similar vague origin in the record is a letter from Dr. Hayes, dated January 23, 2001, addressed, \u201cTo Whom It May Concern,\u201d the text of which is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The record also contains a letter dated February 8, 2001, from the supervisor, Employee Relations Unit, Office of Personnel Services and Benefits, of the Maryland Department of Budget and Management (DBM). It was addressed to Mr. Jackson and acknowledged receipt of Ms. Thomas\u2019s grievance. By this letter the writer, per an agreement of all parties, remanded the case to Step I of the grievance appeal procedure in order to give the Division \u201can opportunity to further review this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The reference is to Maryland Code (1993, 1997 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 12-203 of the State Personnel and Pensions Article (SPP). Section 12-203 specifies that a grievance is initiated by filing in writing with the grievant\u2019s appointing authority (subsection (a)), who is to render a written decision within ten days after a conference with the grievant (subsection (d)). Step II of the grievance procedure is an appeal to the \u201chead of the grievant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>principal unit or designee,\u201d who also is obliged to issue a written decision. SPP \u00a7 12-204(a) and (c). The third step is review by the secretary of the DBM. SPP \u00a7 12-205(a). At that level, \u201c[i]f the grievance is not settled, the Secretary or designee shall refer the grievance to the Office of Administrative Hearings [OAH].\u201d SPP \u00a7 12 \u2014 205(b)(2)(ii). In any event, Ms. Thomas\u2019s grievance obviously was not resolved, and a contested case hearing was held before an administrative law judge (ALJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The ALJ looked to SPP \u00a7 12 \u2014 101(b)(1), which defines \u201cgrievance\u201d to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">\u201c[a] dispute between an employee and the employee\u2019s employer about the interpretation of and application to the employee of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">\u201c(i) a personnel policy or regulation adopted by the Secretary; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">\u201c(ii) any other policy or regulation over which management has control.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">The ALJ considered that \u201cthe action grieved\u201d was \u201cmanagement\u2019s issuance of the resignation without notice,\u201d and, applying the definition of \u201cgrievance,\u201d concluded that Ms. Thomas had not presented a grievable issue. The grievance was dismissed. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">Ms. Thomas sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. That court vacated the ALJ\u2019s order and remanded the matter to the OAH \u201c(1) for a full evidentiary hearing on all the issues raised, including and not limited to the COMAR Title 11 and Title 12 issues, and following the hearing (2) for a full decision on all issues raised.\u201d The Department did not appeal that judgment to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">On remand, the ALJ considered that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-12\">\u201c[t]he central question is whether [Ms. Thomas\u2019s] termination on January 12, 2001 was a disciplinary action and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>grievable pursuant to SPP \u00a7 11-101 or a resignation from employment, SPP \u00a7 12-101 and COMAR 17.04.01.04A(1) and (3), and not subject to the grievance procedures.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyE\">The ALJ made two significant fact-findings. He concluded \u201cthat the Grievant failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she provided information to her employer of her continued illness effective January 2, 2001.\u201d He also concluded that \u201cshe failed to present credible evidence to support her position,\u201d namely, \u201cthat her January 12, 2001 separation was a disciplinary action[.]\u201d The ALJ again held that Ms. Thomas had \u201cresigned without notice, and that management\u2019s issuance of the resignation without notice, is not a grievable issue.\u201d The ALJ\u2019s letter transmitting his opinion advises that his opinion was the final decision of the DBM.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">On Ms. Thomas\u2019s second petition for judicial review, the circuit court again vacated and remanded. It directed the OAH to hold a full evidentiary hearing on all issues, specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-8\">\u201c1. Whether the Respondent properly applied the provisions of [the Rule];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-9\">\u201c2. If the Respondent failed to properly apply [the Rule], whether the Petitioner\u2019s matter is grievable under [SPP] Title 12;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-10\">\u201c3. Whether Respondent discharged the Petitioner in violation of [SPP] \u00a7 11-106; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-11\">\u201c4. Whether Petitioner was denied her right to appeal her discharge in violation of [SPP] \u00a7 11-109.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">The Department appealed to this Court. At the threshold, there are two overarching aspects to this appeal. First, there was substantial evidence that the triggering events expressly set out in the Rule were present here for the Department\u2019s initial application of the Rule to Ms. Thomas. Second, both the ALJ\u2019s opinion, and the Department\u2019s brief, direct little or no attention to that provision in the Rule which states that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>resignation \u201cmay be expunged by the appointing authority when extenuating circumstances exist, and the employee had good cause for not notifying the appointing authority.\u201d Hereinafter, we shall refer to the quoted language as the \u201cSecond Look\u201d provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Based on the arguments of the parties in this Court, the issues fairly may be restated by us as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">I. Was the Second Look provision of the Rule invoked by Ms. Thomas in the administrative process?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">II. If so, was the administrative process governed by SPP Title 11, \u201cDisciplinary Actions, Layoffs, and Employment Terminations in State Personnel Management System,\u201d or by SPP Title 12, \u201cGrievance Procedures in State Personnel Management System\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">III. If governed by Title 12, is the complaint grievable? and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">IV. If grievable, did the Department address the Second Look provision?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">In reviewing the decisions of administrative agencies, such as that handed down by the ALJ in this case, our review is limited in scope. In such an appeal, \u201cthis Court\u2019s role is \u2018precisely the same as that of the circuit court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Stover v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>132 Md.App. 373, 380, 752 A.2d 686, 690 (2000).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-11\">\u201cA distinction is drawn in the scope of review depending upon whether the court is reviewing an administrative agency\u2019s findings of fact as opposed to purely legal conclusions. \u2018To the extent the issues on appeal turn on the correctness of an agency\u2019s findings of fact, such findings must be reviewed under the substantial evidence test.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-12\"><em>Beeman v. Department of Health, &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>107 Md.App. 122, 136, 666 A.2d 1314, 1320-21 (1995) (citation omitted). Under this test, our inquiry is focused on whether evidence exists in the record from which a reasonable person could draw the same conclusion as the ALJ. <em>Caucus Distrib., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number><em>Inc. v. Maryland Securities Comm\u2019r, </em>320 Md. 313, 324, 577 A.2d 783, 788 (1990). In applying this test, however, we \u201cd[o] not substitute [our] judgment, even on the question of the appropriate inference to be drawn from the evidence, for that of the agency.\u201d <em>Beeman, </em>107 Md.App. at 136-37, 666 A.2d at 1321. Rather, we afford deference to the factual findings of the agency, as long as they are supported by the record. <em>Christopher v. Montgomery County Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>381 Md. 188, 199, 849 A.2d 46, 52 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">In contrast, \u201c[determining whether an agency\u2019s \u2018conclusions of law\u2019 are correct is always, on judicial review, the court\u2019s prerogative, although we ordinarily respect the agency\u2019s expertise and give weight to its interpretation of a statute that it administers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 849 A.2d at 52. Further, an arbitrary and capricious standard applies to our review of an agency\u2019s discretionary functions, making such actions essentially unreviewable \u201c[a]s long as [the agency\u2019s] exercise of discretion does not violate regulations, statutes, common law principles, due process and other constitutional requirements[.]\u201d <em>Maryland State Police v. Zeigler, </em>330 Md. 540, 557, 625 A.2d 914, 922 (1993). It is with these principles in mind that we evaluate the questions presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">We hold that Ms. Thomas sufficiently invoked the \u201cSecond Look\u201d provision of the Rule. After receipt of the January 12, 2001 termination notice, Ms. Thomas obtained her labor union\u2019s intervention on her behalf. After some discussion with the \u201cappointing authority,\u201d Ms. Thomas, through Mr. Jackson, formally invoked the grievance procedure on January 26. Even though the filing cited COMAR 17.04.05, the personnel rules relating to disciplinary actions, the obvious purpose of the grievance was to obtain a reconsideration of Ms. Thomas\u2019s separation from service.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The Department, as appellant, points out that \u201cMs. Bullock testified that Ms. Thomas never attempted to provide any additional information, including medical documentation re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>garding her sick status, to the appointing authority!.]\u201d Ms. Bullock was not the appointing authority, and the record is far from clear that a copy of any materials submitted in support of the grievance would have been maintained in the file from which she was testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">On the other hand, there was hearsay evidence from Ms. Thomas that Mr. Jackson tendered one or more of the medical certificates from Dr. Hayes to a Lieutenant Jones \u201cin payroll, personnel over there in Central Booking,\u201d who is said to have refused to accept them.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">In any event, the ALJ made no factual findings concerning what transpired in the grievance process, consistent with his view that no grievable issue was presented. On remand, what Ms. Thomas produced, and when, should be fully explored.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">SPP Title 11 contains no definition of a \u201cdisciplinary action.\u201d Section 11-104 of that title, however, sets forth permitted disciplinary actions. Resignation without notice under the Rule is not among them.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On the other hand, SPP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>\u00a7 12-101(b)(l) defines \u201cgrievance,\u201d in essence, to be a dispute about the interpretation and application of a personnel policy or regulation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the instant matter, Ms. Thomas disputes the Department\u2019s interpretation and application of the \u201cSecond Look\u201d provision of the Rule. Thus, the matter proceeds under Title 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">As a consequence, SPP \u00a7 ll-106(a)(l) does not apply. That provision requires the appointing authority, before taking any \u201cdisciplinary action related to employee misconduct,\u201d to investigate the alleged misconduct. A potential deficiency in the administrative process in this matter, which the circuit court directed be clarified on remand, was the apparent absence of any investigation of the \u201cmisconduct\u201d giving rise to the \u201cdiscipline.\u201d The Rule, however, addresses in a different fashion the problem of getting the relevant facts. Generally conduct that gives rise to discipline will occur at or near the workplace or is of such a nature that it will bring public disrepute to State service. <em>See </em>COMAR 17.04.05.04 (listing actions for which an employee may be disciplined).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The employee who has failed to report for duty, without authorization, obviously is not present at the workplace to explain the absence. The policy underlying the Rule appears to be to encourage the absent employee to come forward with any justification for the absence without notice. The employee\u2019s cooperation seemingly is particularly required when the underlying problem may require access to the employee\u2019s medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">In view of our holding in this Part, the procedures under SPP Title 11 will not be a relevant consideration on remand. Rather, the burden on remand will be on Ms. Thomas to persuade the Department to exercise in her favor its discretion under the \u201cSecond Look\u201d provision of the Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">It follows from what we have said that Ms. Thomas\u2019s complaint is grievable. See Part II, <em>supra. </em>The ALJ, however, twice expressed the view that, because Ms. Thomas had resigned, she was no longer an employee in the State Personnel Management System and had no right to invoke the grievance procedure under SPP Title 12. We disagree. The \u201cSecond Look\u201d provision of the Rule is an integral part of the Rule that the employee, who is \u201cconsidered to have resigned,\u201d may invoke through the grievance procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Prior to the State Personnel Management System Reform Act of 1996, Chapter 347 of the Acts of 1996, and prior to the merger of the former Department of Personnel into the DBM by Chapter 349 of the Acts of 1996, the predecessor of the Rule was found in the regulations of the then Department of Personnel at COMAR 06.01.01.51B. That regulation required a pre-termination notice of status with the opportunity to respond within three working days following receipt of the notice.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The former regulation was superseded by the Rule, adopted as an emergency provision effective February 12, 1997. See 24:5 Md. R. 391. The Rule was permanently adopted effective September 8, 1997. See 24:18 Md. R. 1297. Clearly, due process considerations underlie the Rule\u2019s \u201cSecond Look\u201d provision. <em>See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985) (holding that member of Ohio Classified Civil Service had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>property right in continued employment of which he could not be deprived by the state without procedural due process). Thus, even if, as of January 12, 2001, Ms. Thomas was a former employee for other purposes, the constitutional right to Due Process requires that she be permitted to invoke the grievance procedure to assert her claims under the Second Look provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Despite the first remand by the circuit court for a full hearing, the Department, at that second hearing, did not address Ms. Thomas\u2019s evidence directed to the \u201cSecond Look\u201d provision of the Rule. The Department has yet to advise whether it exercised its power to expunge the resignation and, if so, by whom that power was exercised and why it was exercised adversely to Ms. Thomas. The circuit court acted appropriately in ordering a second remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">For guidance of the Department on remand, we address Ms. Thomas\u2019s argument that she had no intent to resign. An unexpressed intent to return to work at some future time does not produce an automatic expungement of the resignation. So to permit would frustrate the policy of getting the employee\u2019s attention and motivating disclosure. Under the Rule the intent relevant to the Second Look provision is the absent employee\u2019s expressed intent \u201cto return to duty.\u201d This ordinarily would be manifested by furnishing a return to work date, or an estimated return to work date, or some explanation as to why a return to work date cannot even be approximated when the Second Look provision is invoked. Based on this information, management can take appropriate steps in response.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">The Department determined that, under the facts, it was justified in considering that Ms. Thomas had resigned without notice. To the extent that the circuit court vacated that determination, we reverse the circuit court. Further, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>modify the issues directed by the circuit court to be considered by the OAH on remand. We direct that the issue to be decided by the OAH is whether, in its discretion, it should expunge Ms. Thomas\u2019s resignation because she has shown exceptional circumstances and good cause for not notifying the appointing authority of the reasons for her absence from duty and of her intention to return to duty. We affirm the circuit court\u2019s order that the matter be remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART.

If more than 2 weeks notice is required by an appointing authority, it must be approved by the Secretary. An appointing authority may not require more than 30 days notice of a resignation. If more than 2 weeks notice is required, the employee shall be informed of the longer notice requirement during the orientation required by State Personnel and Pensions Article, \u00a7 7-404, Annotated Code of Maryland. An employee who fails to provide notice as required shall have that fact entered in the employee's permanent employment record. The Office of Personnel Services and Benefits shall adopt guidelines governing employee resignations.\"</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b568-9\">. Ms. Thomas was not scheduled to work January 7 and 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b569-9\">. There appear to be at least lour reasons for this deficiency. One, the record on this appeal deals with the second action for judicial review involving Ms. Thomas's separation from service and does not include the specific paper trail that may have been included in the record of the first judicial review action. Two, the Department\u2019s witness, Ms. Bullock, testified only from attendance records and a personnel file, but she had no personal knowledge of the events. Three, Mr. Jackson did not testify at the agency hearing, apparently because he was out of town. Four, although Ms. Thomas testified, she had no personal knowledge of all of the contacts between the Department and the union, on her behalf. It appears that she was present at one meeting, at the \"State employment office,\u201d but the content of that meeting was not explored.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b569-10\">.

She is unable to concentrate, focus, or be alert for situations on the job. Her physical health has also deteriorated since the accidental inhalation in 1998. She continues to have loss of her voice, respiratory problems \u2014 difficulty breathing, wheezing, etc. \u2014 and headaches and insomnia have occurred since returning to work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-10\">\"Ms Thomas is being observed by me closely and has been referred for ENT consultation.
