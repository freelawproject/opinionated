The procedural issue presented is one of first impression in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">\n<em>The Parties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">The original plaintiffs were Stephon Collins, Sr., individually and as Personal Representative of Stephon Collins, Jr.; and Daniel and Patricia Juster, individually and as Personal Representatives of Samuel Juster. The defendants were Dr. Gui-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Fu and Chung Ling Li; Pittway Corp.; Michael Chapman; First Alert, Inc., Sunbeam Corp.; BRK Brands, Inc.; Honeywell International, Inc.; Keith and Catherine Chapman; The Ryland Group, Inc.; and Summit Electric Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">A later complaint was filed by Michael Chapman and Carolyn Hill, individually and as Parents and Legal Guardians of Kyle, Keith, and Brandon Chapman, against the same defendants and also David E. Dieffenbach, t/a Dedhieo Home Improvements, and his employee, Kevin T. Hightower.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Creating this appeal was the circuit court\u2019s consent on November 15, 2002, to the dismissal, without prejudice, of all claims between appellants Michael Chapman and Carolyn Hill, as Parents and Legal Guardians of Kyle, Keith, and Brandon Chapman, and appellees Dr. Gui-Fu Li and Chung Ling Li.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">By earlier orders, the circuit court had granted appel-lee/cross-appellant Ryland\u2019s motion to dismiss. Subsequently, the court granted Summit Electric\u2019s motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Motions for reconsideration were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Thereafter, appellants moved to certify the orders of dismissal as a final judgment under Rule 2 \u2014 602(b)(1), to permit an immediate appeal, effectively for the purpose of litigating Ryland\u2019s liability.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The manufacturer appellants joined the motion. The circuit court, properly in our view, denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>motion. Appellees Dieffenbach\u2019s and Hightower\u2019s Motions for Summary Judgment against appellants were granted. Appel-lee Ryland\u2019s Motion to Dismiss was also granted, along with appellee Summit Electric\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, Motion for Summary Judgment. Appellants\u2019 Motion for Reconsideration as to Ryland and Summit Electric was denied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Appellants raise four questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">I. Whether the court erred as a matter of law by granting appellee Ryland Group\u2019s Motion to Dismiss under Maryland Rule 2-322.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">II. Whether the court erred as a matter of law by granting Summit Electric Co.\u2019s Motion to Dismiss under Maryland Rule 2-322.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">III. Whether the Court, to the extent it considered the motions of Ryland and Summit under summary judgment standards, erred by not continuing the hearing on appellees\u2019 Ryland Group and Summit Electric Co.\u2019s motions until discovery was completed under the provisions of Maryland Rule 2 \u2014 501(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">IV. Whether the court erred as a matter of law by granting appellees Dieffenbach and Hightower\u2019s Motions for Summary Judgment, because the issue of causation, including whether or not an intervening act is \u201cforeseeable,\u201d is a question of fact for the jury to resolve.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Cross-appellant Ryland presented the following question, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-11\">Whether the circuit court erred in consenting to the dismissal without prejudice in order to obtain a final judgment, in the face of the court\u2019s earlier denial of certification under Maryland Rule 2-602(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>We answer \u201cyes\u201d to Ryland\u2019s question and hold that the circuit court abused its discretion pursuant to Md. Rule 2-506(b) by dismissing the several unadjudicated claims without prejudice. Having resolved this appeal on a jurisdictional basis, we need not reach the questions presented by appellants. We shall affirm the court\u2019s denial of certification under Maryland Rule 2-602(b), vacate the order permitting the voluntary dismissal without prejudice, and remand to the circuit court for appropriate further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">FACTUAL and PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Only a brief summary of the facts is required to place the issues in perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Twelve-year old Samuel Juster and 13-year old Stephon Collins, Jr., sons of appellants Juster and Collins, and 12-year old Kyle Chapman, the son of appellants Michael Chapman and Carolyn Hill, were overnight guests in the Chapman home on June 13, 1998. The Chapmans resided in a single family home at 23 Grantchester Place (\u201cthe residence\u201d) in Gaithers-burg, Maryland, which they had rented since 1991 from the owners of the property, Dr. and Mrs. Gui-Fu Li. The Chap-mans\u2019 sons\u2019 quarters consisted of two windowless enclosed rooms in the basement. The basement also included an additional room in which Mr. Chapman had his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">On the evening of June 13, 1998, thunderstorms caused an electrical power outage. At the time, the children were playing Monopoly in the basement rooms. Because of the lack of electricity, the room was illuminated by approximately six candles. After the boys went to bed, one candle was left lighted in the basement rec room. Sometime after 5:00 a.m. on June 14, 1998, that single candle caused a fire. Samuel Juster and Stephon Collins died as a result of the fire, and Kyle Chapman suffered severe burns resulting in the amputation of both of his legs.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Although the basement was equipped with a smoke detector, it did not sound because it was hardwired into the home\u2019s electrical system, and was not functioning due to the power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>outage. The smoke detector did not have a battery-powered backup, even though such equipment was readily available in the marketplace, both at the time of the fire and at the time the residence was constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">According to plaintiffs/appellants, the events that gave rise to their claims originated with the construction of the home. They allege negligence by Ryland and Summit for not having installed smoke detectors with alternate battery power, despite the availability of such devices when the home was built in 1989. Subsequent events, they allege, created liability on the part of other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">In early 1994, a water pipe burst in the residence, causing extensive damage in the basement. On February 2, 1994, Dieffenbach, trading as Dedhico Home Improvement, was retained by the Lis and Mr. Chapman to repair the water damage. Included in Dieffenbach\u2019s work was the rewiring and cleaning of twenty electrical outlets, which was actually performed by his employee, Hightower. Dieffenbach did not obtain the required permits from the City of Gaithersburg.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">As we have noted, appellants fault Ryland, the builder, and Summit, the electrical subcontractor, for failing to install dual-power smoke detectors (with a safety battery backup) when the home was built in 1989, and for failing to provide the homeowner with the users\u2019 manual for the AC-powered smoke detectors. The claims against Dieffenbach and Hightower were based upon their having renovated the basement without permits in 1994, failing to replace the AC-powered smoke detectors with dual-powered smoke detectors, and failing to warn the owners and occupants that the use of the enclosed rooms in the basement as sleeping areas was contrary to local code restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">Dieffenbach\u2019s and Hightower\u2019s motions for summary judgment were granted. Ryland\u2019s motion to dismiss was also granted, as was Summit\u2019s motion to dismiss. Appellants\u2019 motion for reconsideration of the Ryland and Summit rulings was denied, and this timely appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>STANDARD of REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The principles of appellate review require that, \u201cabsent a clear abuse of discretion, a chancellor\u2019s decision that is grounded in law and based upon facts that are not clearly erroneous will not be disturbed.\u201d <em>Bagley v. Bagley, </em>98 Md. App. 18, 31-32, 632 A.2d 229 (1993) (citing <em>Domingues v. Johnson, </em>323 Md. 486, 492 n. 2, 593 A.2d 1133 (1991) (citations omitted)), <em>cert. denied, </em>334 Md. 18, 637 A.2d 1191. (1994). A trial judge possesses the discretion to determine the proper disposition of the case only where \u201cthe findings are supported by evidence and therefore not clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Bagley, supra, </em>98 Md.App. at 32, 632 A.2d 229 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\n<em>I. Whether the circuit court erred in consenting to the dismissal without prejudice in order to obtain final judgment, in the face of the court\u2019s earlier denial of certi\u00f1cation under Maryland Rule 2-602(b).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Ryland argues that the circuit court abused its discretion under Md. Rule 2-506(b)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by permitting appellants to fabri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>cate a final judgment by dismissing their unadjudicated claims without prejudice in order to prosecute an immediate appeal. That, they posit, had the effect of enabling appellants to obtain this Court\u2019s advice as to Ryland\u2019s liability. Ryland further argues that, because the circuit court earlier declined to certify the judgments as final under Rule 2-602(b), the voluntary dismissal device was a transparent effort to circumvent the earlier ruling. They argue that appellants clearly intend to reassert their claims following a merits ruling by this Court, and point to the tolling agreement between all of the parties who had earlier dismissed with prejudice, and other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">Appellants counter that this argument is without merit because Ryland has no standing to object to the Rule 2-506(b) dismissals and no right to a cross appeal;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> appellants did not engage in any collusive or fraudulent behavior; the posture of the case changed significantly between the time of the trial court\u2019s original denial of the Rule 2-602(b) motion, thus creating a final appealable judgment; and finally, that appellee\u2019s citation of Federal case law is inapposite to the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Maryland Rule 2-602 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">(a) <em>Generally. </em>Except as provided in section (b) of this Rule, an order or other form of decision, however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all of the claims in an action (whether raised by original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim), or that adjudicates less than an entire claim, or that adjudicates the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties to the action:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">(1) is not a final judgment;.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">(2) does not terminate the action as to any of the claims or any of the parties; and.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>(3) is subject to revision at any time before the entry of a judgment that adjudicates all of the claims by and against all of the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">(b) <em>When allowed. </em>If the court expressly determines in a written order that there is no just reason for delay, it may direct in the order the entry of a final judgment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">(1) as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties; or.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">(2) pursuant to Rule 2-501(e)(3), for some but less than all of the amount requested in a claim seeking money relief only.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">The purpose of the rule is to prevent the expense and delay that result from piecemeal appeals. Judge Moylan, writing for this Court, detailed the importance of certifying an order as a final judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">Primary considerations are the strong policy against piecemeal [sic] appeals and the interests of judicial economy. Both of these factors weigh heavily against certification, and in assessing them, it is important to consider whether the same issues will have to be considered by the appellate court on successive appeals. Whether the determination of the remaining claims may render moot the need for the review being sought should also be considered, as should the question of whether entertaining the appeal upon the merits would require us to determine questions that are still before the trial court. The trial judge should then weigh the exigencies of the case against those factors and consider the possible harsh effects of delaying an appeal until the entire ease has been completed. The most obvious among these is a harsh economic effect, but there may be others depending on the circumstances of each case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-10\"><em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Angeletti, </em>71 Md.App. 210, 219, 524 A.2d 798 (1987) <em>(citing Canterbury Riding Condo. v. Chesapeake Investors, Inc., </em>66 Md.App. 635, 505 A.2d 858 (1986)). Md. Rule 2-602(b) is a \u201climited and tightly circumscribed exception\u201d to the final judgment rule. <em>Tharp v. Disabled Am. Veterans Dep\u2019t of Md., Inc., </em>121 Md.App. 548, 557, 710 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>378 (1998) (citations omitted). We have recently reiterated Maryland\u2019s appellate policy disfavoring piecemeal appeals. <em>See Murphy v. Steele Software Sys. Corp., </em>144 Md.App. 384, 798 A.2d 1149 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">\n<em>Federal Authority</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Ryland urges us to follow the federal cases of <em>Ryan v. Occidental Petroleum Corp., </em>577 F.2d 298 (5th Cir.1978), and its progeny; appellants urge us to follow a line of cases contrary to <em>Ryan, </em>and argue that we should not be persuaded by \u201cdiscredited, misleading and outdated case law.\u201d We therefore turn to <em>Ryan </em>and similar subsequent cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The federal counterpart, and the rule from which Maryland Rule 2-506 is derived, is fed. r. civ. p. 42. In <em>Milburn, v. Milburn, </em>142 Md.App. 518, 790 A.2d 744 (2002), we noted that interpretations of Federal Rule 42 can be used to glean the purpose of Md. Rule 2-506:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">Appellant urges us to look to case law interpreting the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Fed.R.Civ.P.) in our analysis of Rule 2-506 because, as noted in <em>[State of New Jersey ex rel. Lennon v. Strazzella, </em>331 Md. 270, 627 A.2d 1055 (1993)], this rule emanated from Fed.R.Civ.P. 41. <em>Lennon, </em>331 Md. at 279, 627 A.2d 1055. We agree that the interpretations of Fed.R.Civ.P. 41 provide us with insight into the purpose of the Maryland rule concerning voluntary dismissal. Federal R. Civ. P. 41(a) is clear; construing Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a), the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has stated that, \u201c[a]s the [r]ule\u2019s text makes plain, the universe of plaintiff-initiated, voluntary dismissals is broken into two categories.\u201d <em>Marex Titanic, Inc. v. Wrecked &amp; Abandoned, Vessel, 2 </em>F.3d 544, 546 (4th Cir.1993). One category involves the situations in which the plaintiff may dismiss of his or her own volition, without any limitations by the trial court. <em>Piedmont, Interstate Fair Ass\u2019n v. Bean, </em>209 F.2d 942, 945 (4th Cir.1954). The purpose behind this provision is to allow a person to withdraw his or her claim when no one will be prejudiced by such action. <em>Id. </em>Once the case has been prepared for trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>however, and one of the parties will be prejudiced by a dismissal, Rule 41(b) requires leave of court. Id. There is a third scenario: when the parties act in concert. As stated in Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(2), in this situation, no leave of court is required. We apply this reasoning to our analysis of Rule 2-506 below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">Like Fed.R.Civ.P. 41, Rule 2-506 is clear and unambiguous; voluntary dismissal may be obtained in three situations. A party may file a notice prior to the filing of an answer or motion for summary judgment by the adverse party or a stipulation signed by all parties; or he or she may obtain leave of court. The rule clearly mandates that there will be situations when a trial court will be required to exercise its discretion in granting a voluntary dismissal; however, there will also be situations when the parties, as opposed to the trial court, may, without leave of court, dismiss the cause of action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 532-83, 790 A.2d 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">\n<em>Ryan v. Occidental Petroleum Corp.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Ryan sought recovery against Occidental for actual and exemplary damages concerning his discharge from an Occidental subsidiary. <em>Ryan, supra, </em>577 F.2d at 300. The district court granted Occidental\u2019s motion to dismiss several paragraphs of the complaint for failure to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Id. </em>Ryan contested the ruling and asked for certification under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The district court granted Ryan\u2019s request, but then vacated the certification and substituted an order granting Ryan\u2019s motion for voluntary dismissal of the single substantive allegation remaining in his complaint. <em>Id. </em>The substitution occurred after the court heard argument on the certification as a final order issue. In its eventual dismissal, the court noted Ryan\u2019s dismissal was without prejudice to his right to file again in the same or any other court. <em>Id. </em>Ryan then appealed the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>court\u2019s two original orders dismissing and striking certain paragraphs and language in the complaint. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reiterated its jurisdictional requirement that a judgment be final in order to be reviewed, and stressed that appellate courts must exercise caution when departing from this requirement. <em>Ryan, supra, </em>577 F.2d at 301. The court stated, absent a certification under Rule 54(b) and entry of judgment, \u201cwe may not entertain appeals from partial dispositions or orders unless they fall within limited exceptions to the usual finality rule.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\"><em>Ryan\u2019s </em>Progeny</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The <em>Ryan </em>court found that Ryan\u2019s case did not fall under any of the enumerated exceptions<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and held that there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>final judgment as \u201cthe torso of [Ryan\u2019s] complaint \u2014 including the identification of the parties and the jurisdictional allegations\u201d remained before the district court. <em>Id. </em>The district court\u2019s denial of certification did not permit it to reach the same result (a \u201cfinal\u201d appealable decision) through the consent to a voluntary dismissal. <em>Id. </em>at 302-803; <em>see Cook v. Rocky Mountain Bank Note Co., </em>974 F.2d 147-48 (10th Cir.1992). The <em>Ryan </em>court found the facts to be analogous to other scenarios in which it found circumvention of the requirements of Rule 54(b), including a district court\u2019s attempt to dismiss a main claim after displacing a counterclaim to another pending lawsuit, and a situation in which the parties and the court attempt to reach an agreement for the purpose of rendering an order appealable. <em>Ryan, </em>supra, 577 F.2d at 302-303 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Since the <em>Ryan </em>decision in 1978, other circuits have considered the issue. In <em>Great Rivers Coop. of Southeastern Iowa v. Farmland Indus., Inc., </em>198 F.3d 685 (8th Cir.1999), a class action suit, the Eighth Circuit declined to follow <em>Ryan </em>\u201c[i]n this unique procedural posture.... \u201d The plaintiffs in that case appealed from the district court\u2019s decision granting partial summary judgment, rejecting their securities, unjust enrichment, and part of their breach of fiduciary duty claims. <em>Great Rivers, supra, </em>198 F.3d at 687. When the summary judgment orders were initially entered, the district court certified the order as final pursuant to Rule 54(b). The Court of Appeals rejected the district court\u2019s Rule 54(b) certification and dismissed the appeals for lack of final judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 688. The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Thus, there can be little doubt that basing this appeal on a disingenuous voluntary dismissal was contrary to the strong policy that parties must \u201craise all claims of error in a single appeal following final judgment on the merits.\u201d <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Risjord, </em>449 U.S. 368, 374, 101 S.Ct. 669, 66 L.Ed.2d 571 (1981). A plaintiff whose strongest claims have been dismissed in an interlocutory order may expedite appeal by dismissing its remaining claims <em>with prejudice. </em>But a dismissal without prejudice, coupled with the intent to refile the voluntarily dismissed claims after an appeal of the interlocutory order, is a clear evasion of the judicial and statutory limits on appellate jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 688 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">In declining to dismiss under <em>Ryan, </em>the court noted its concern \u201cthat these decisions ignore the well-established test for determining whether a district court judgment that seemingly ends the case is an appealable \u2018final decision\u2019 within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689. The court noted that in order for a judgment or decision to be final, there must be \u201c \u2018some clear and unequivocal manifestation by the trial court of its belief that the decision made, so far as [the court] is concerned, is the end of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>quoting <em>Goodwin v. United States, </em>67 F.3d 149, 151 (8th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Fiataruolo v. United States, </em>8 F.3d 930, 937 (2d Cir.1993)). The court found that the final judgment of the district court dismissing the class\u2019s complaint in its entirety, constituted a final decision. <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, under an abuse of discretion standard,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>In most cases ... a district court does abuse its discretion when it frustrates the limitations on federal appellate jurisdiction by entering a Rule 41(a)(2) order dismissing remaining claims without prejudice for the purpose of facilitating the immediate appeal of an earlier interlocutory order. Certainly in this case, after we dismissed the initial appeals of the district court\u2019s interlocutory summary judgment orders, granting the class\u2019s Rule 41(a)(2) motion was a clear abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 689-90.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In <em>Smith v. Lincoln Meadows Homeowners Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>267 Neb. 849, 678 N.W.2d 726 (2004), Smith, injured when a swing broke, brought a premises liability action against a homeowner\u2019s association. Smith sued the association for damages including various injuries, disability, lost wages, and \u201cmost pertinent\u201d that her fall triggered the onset of multiple sclerosis (MS). <em>Id. </em>at 728. The homeowner\u2019s association filed \u201ca pretrial motion for partial summary judgment on the allegation of MS, in conjunction with a motion in limine to exclude the plaintiffs expert testimony supporting that allegation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court found plaintiff\u2019s expert testimony to be inadmissible, granted the motion in limine, and entered partial summary judgment with respect to MS damages, as Smith was left without expert testimony to support that claim. <em>Id. </em>Smith then filed a motion to dismiss her cause of action, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>prejudice, and asked the court for a final order so that she could appeal the grant of partial summary judgment. The court granted the motion to dismiss and signed a prepared order stating: \u201c \u2018the Plaintiff shall have the right if she so elects to timely appeal this Court\u2019s now final ruling on the issue of multiple sclerosis[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Before reaching the merits of her appeal, the appellate court, raised the jurisdictional issue of whether Smith\u2019s voluntary dismissal without prejudice, under those circumstances, effectively created finality and conferred appellate jurisdiction. The court concluded that it did not, vacated the lower court\u2019s order of dismissal, and dismissed Smith\u2019s appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\"><em>Smith </em>is factually inapposite. However, Smith cited to the <em>Great Rivers </em>case and Eighth Circuit authority, both of which were addressed by the court, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">[W]e note that the Eighth Circuit\u2019s holding is a minority view; the general rule is that a plaintiff cannot appeal from the dismissal of some claims when the balance of his or her claims have been voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. <em>See, e.g., Construction Aggregates v. Forest Commodities Corp., </em>147 F.3d 1334 (11th Cir.1998); <em>Chappelle v. Beacon Communications Corp., </em>84 F.3d 652 (2d Cir.1996); <em>Concha v.

Those courts have reasoned that \u201cbecause a dismissal without prejudice does not preclude another action on the same claims, a plaintiff who is permitted to appeal following a voluntary dismissal without prejudice will effectively have secured an otherwise unavailable interlocutory appeal.\u201d <em>Chappelle, </em>84 F.3d at 654.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">The court in <em>Orion Fin. </em>Corp. <em>of S.D. v. </em>Am. <em>Foods Group, Inc., </em>201 F.3d 1047 (8th Cir.2000), also addressed <em>Great, Riv</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>ers. </em>The dispute in <em>Orion </em>arose from an agreement in which Orion agreed to assist American Foods in procuring financing in the form of grants and loans, in exchange for compensation. <em>Orion, supra, </em>201 F.3d at 1047. After terminating their relationship under the agreement, the parties disputed the amount owed to Orion. <em>Id. </em>Orion\u2019s suit sought damages, and American Foods filed a counterclaim alleging overpayment to Orion. Eventually, the district court entered a partial summary judgment awarding Orion damages and prejudgment interest. The parties entered into two stipulations in order to secure an immediate appeal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1048. Incorporating the prior partial summary judgment and the two stipulations, the district court entered judgment against American Foods. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">On appeal, the parties disputed the meaning of the stipulations, and the appellate court held that the parties were playing \u201cfast and loose\u201d with appellate resources, and were defeating the purpose of the final judgment rule in fed. r. civ. p. 54(b). <em>Id. </em>at 1048-49. The court rejected <em>Great Rivers </em>and chose to follow <em>Cheng v. Commissioner, Internal Revenue Serv. </em>878 F.2d 306 (9th Cir.1989):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">The parties in <em>Cheng </em>entered into a stipulation following entry of a partial summary judgment in order to obtain an appealable final order. The stipulation provided for entry of a final order but noted that Cheng \u201cis not conceding the remaining undecided issues and should a decision be entered in favor of [Cheng] on appeal and the case remanded ... [he] will, on remand, be permitted to present additional evidence and arguments.... \u201d <em>[Cheng, supra, </em>878 F.2d] at 308. The Ninth Circuit held that the order following the stipulation did not conclusively end the litigation on the merits because the stipulation allowed for the resurrection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>of stipulated claims depending upon the outcome of the initial appeal. Consequently, the court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. [FN3]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">FN3. The Ninth Circuit distinguished <em>Cheng </em>in the case of <em>Horn v. Berdon, Inc. Defined Benefit Pension Plan, </em>938 F.2d 125 (9th Cir.1991). In <em>Horn, </em>the parties stipulated to dismiss the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, without prejudice and the appellate court found jurisdiction. This is similar to our recent case, <em>[Great </em>Rivers/, in which this court refused to follow <em>Cheng. </em>In <em>Great Rivers, </em>this court held that a dismissal of certain claims without prejudice does not necessarily defeat the rule of finality as to the remaining claims. A close reading of <em>Cheng, </em>however, demonstrates that it is distinguishable from <em>Great Rivers </em>and <em>Horn. </em>In <em>Cheng, </em>the court observed: \u201c[a] plaintiff may voluntarily dismiss the remainder of his claim(s) after a partial summary judgment has been entered against him and then appeal the partial summary judgment.\u201d <em>Cheng, </em>878 F.2d at 311. However, the court noted that Cheng had not taken this path and had instead elected to retain his undecided claim and defenses in case of favorable outcome on appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">We feel the present case is most closely aligned with <em>Cheng.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">In the present case the parties wish to challenge on appeal issues that are still within the lawsuit and, if successful, challenge them again in further litigation. This approach defeats the very purpose of finality and Rule 54(b). Consequently, it is clear that the order is not final and that only a partial judgment has been rendered from the previous proceedings. Under the circumstances, the court has no alternative other than to dismiss the appeal as lacking finality in the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-8\"><em>Orion, supra, </em>201 F.3d at 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">There is No Universal Adoption or Rejection of the <em>Ryan Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">Upon review of the relevant case law, there appears to be no clear unanimous following of the <em>Ryan </em>rule among the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Federal circuits, contrary to appellants\u2019 argument that the rejection of <em>Ryan </em>is virtually universal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As in <em>Smith, supra, </em>the court in <em>Swope v. Columbian Chems. Co., </em>281 F.3d 185 (5th Cir.2002), discussed the treatment of <em>Ryan </em>by various circuits.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although the facts of <em>Swope </em>are not on point with the instant case, the Court\u2019s discussion of <em>Ryan </em>aids in our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-5\">It is a settled rule in the Fifth Circuit that appellate jurisdiction over a non-final order cannot be created by dismissing the remaining claims without prejudice. This rule originated in <em>Ryan v. Occidental Petroleum Corp., </em>in which a district court granted a defendant\u2019s motion and dismissed the majority of plaintiffs complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">The Ryan rule is employed by three of our sister circuits. [Footnote 20, citing <em>Cook v. Rocky Mountain Bank Note Co., supra; Chappelle v. Beacon Communications Corp., supra; </em>and <em>State Treasurer v. Barry, </em>168 F.3d 8 (11th Cir.1999).] But two circuits have adopted a rule directly contrary to that of <em>Ryan. </em>[Footnote 21, citing <em>Hicks v. NLO, Inc., </em>825 F.2d 118, 120 (6th Cir.1987); and <em>Chrysler Motors Corp. v. Thomas Auto Co., </em>939 F.2d 538, 540 (8th Cir.1991).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>In addition, three circuits have adopted a sort of middle way that requires them to evaluate cases on an individual basis. [Footnote 22, citing <em>Fassett v. Delta Kappa Epsilon, </em>807 F.2d 1150, 1155 (3d Cir.1986); <em>Horwitz v. Alloy Auto. Co., </em>957 F.2d 1431, 1435-36 (7th Cir.1992); <em>Dannenberg v. Software Toolworks, Inc., </em>16 F.3d 1073, 1075 (9th Cir.1994).] Perhaps because of these widely varying approaches, the merits of the Ryan rule were discussed extensively in the Eleventh Circuit opinion of <em>State Treasurer v. Barry. </em>There, a majority of the court defended the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s maintenance of the <em>Ryan </em>rule while Judge Cox, in a special concurrence, urged en banc reconsideration of the rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">Hence, the <em>Ryan </em>rule requiring Rule 54(b) certification to create finality will not prevent an appeal where one is warranted. This is especially so since the abrogation of Ryan\u2019s other rule that Rule 54(b) certification is only to be granted in the \u201cinfrequent harsh case.\u201d The fact that the denial of a Rule 54(b) certification is reviewable for abuse of discretion is additional insurance <footnotemark>[15]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">The Seventh and the Ninth Circuits have adopted an in-between rule that allows jurisdiction as long as the parties have not intended to manipulate the system. However, here we agree with Judge Cox and reject the \u201cpractice of combing the record for manipulative intent\u201d since it \u201cwaste[s] resources better spent on the merits of an appeal.\u201d <em>Ryan\u2019s </em>bright-line rule is therefore preferable as it fosters predictability and streamlines review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-7\"><em>Swope, supra, </em>281 F.3d at 192-194 (some footnotes omitted); <em>bul see Dannenberg v.

After partial summary judgment was entered for Price Stern, James moved to dismiss the remaining claims, and the district court granted a dismissal without prejudice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The court opined that, absent a stipulation stating that the party dismissing without prejudice intends to resurrect its dismissed claims in the event of a reversal, \u201cSuch a unilateral dismissal is therefore much less likely to reflect manipulation. The court\u2019s approval of the motion is usually sufficient to ensure that everything is kosher.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1066. In discuss<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>ing <em>Ryan\u2019s </em>varying levels of acceptance in different circuits, the court noted that it chose to follow the circuits that rejected <em>Ryan. Id. </em>at 1069-70; see <em>also </em>n. 12 <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Because of Maryland\u2019s strong policy against piecemeal appeals, we conclude that the rules of <em>Ryan </em>and its progeny are a more accurate reflection of the law of this State. For those reasons, we reject the <em>Great Rivers </em>and <em>James </em>approach. As the court in <em>Smith, supra, </em>reasoned, \u201cIf a \u2018voluntary dismissal exception\u2019 were to provide a mechanism for securing appellate review of any trial court order, the \u2018exception\u2019 would quickly subsume the rule, and we would be left without any meaningful way to regulate interlocutory appeals.\u201d <em>Smith, supra </em>678 N.W.2d at 732.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">The final judgment rule serves various important objectives: It emphasizes the deference that appellate courts owe to the trial judge as the individual initially called upon to decide the many questions of law and fact that occur in the course of a trial. Permitting piecemeal appeals would undermine the independence of the district judge, as well as the special role that individual plays in our judicial system. In addition, the rule is in accordance with the sensible policy of \u201cavoidfing] the obstruction to just claims that would come from permitting the harassment and cost of a succession of separate appeals from the various rulings to which a litigation may give rise, from its initiation to entry of judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7Z\"><em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v.

Should we have reached the merits of appellants\u2019 appeal, they would then be free to revive previously dismissed claims against certain parties, potentially armed with this court\u2019s ruling on causation with regard to certain appellees. The final judgment rule cannot be circumvented by voluntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>dismissal pursuant to Rule 2-506.

Although appellants do not raise this issue, we shall dispose of it <em>sua sponte </em>for purposes of completeness. Just as the court in <em>Ryan </em>found that the <em>Jeteo </em>exception did not apply to the plaintiff, we, too, find the facts before us distinguishable. <em>Jeteo </em>was a multi-party case in which two successive orders, although technically interlocutory, disposed entirely of the plaintiff's cause of action against three separate defendants, and the plaintiff appealed from the rulings in his action against one of the defendants, all of which were adverse. In <em>Ryan, </em>the plaintiff also appealed only from adverse rulings; however, Ryan did not face adverse rulings on his entire case, because the court found that a voluntary dismissal cannot be deemed an \"adverse ruling\u201d as it was without prejudice, and therefore could be revived. The sum of the adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>rulings against Ryan did not terminate the litigation, and therefore, the <em>Jetco </em>exception did not apply. <em>See Ryan, supra, </em>577 F.2d at 301-302.</p>\n<p id=\"AQx\">Appellants here received exactly what they sought, a voluntary dismissal of the claims against Michael Chapman and Carolyn Hill, as Parents and Legal Guardians of Kyle, Keith and Brandon Chapman, and Dr. Gui-Fu Li and Chung Ling Li.

Due to the parties\u2019 intention to dismiss all remaining claims without prejudice under Fed R.Civ.P. 41(a)(2) (as opposed to 41(a)(1)(h)), which requires the discretion of the trial court, the issue was not to be considered jurisdictional, rather a question of whether the trial court abused its discretion when it dismissed the remaining claims without prejudice for the purpose of allowing the class to appeal the interlocutory summary judgment orders of the court. <em>See Great Rivers, supra, </em>198 F.3d at 689-90.</p>\n<p id=\"anc-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>As plaintiffs here sought a voluntary dismissal under Maryland Rule 2-506(a), which was derived from Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(1), we <em>do not </em>employ the same logic as the <em>Great Rivers </em>court, but choose to review the case in terms of jurisdiction, and not abuse of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b288-8\">.
