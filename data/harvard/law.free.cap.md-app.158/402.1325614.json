A jury in the Circuit Court for Calvert County subsequently convicted Freeman of first degree premeditated murder, as well as first degree assault and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, Freeman was sentenced to life imprisonment, with all but forty-five years suspended, for the murder conviction, and to a concurrent term of twenty years for the firearm offense. The assault conviction was merged.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">On appeal, Freeman claims that \u201cthe circuit court err[ed] by failing to suppress the statements [she] made ... during custodial interrogation.\u201d From appellant\u2019s brief, we glean two arguments in support of her claim. First, appellant argues that the court erred in failing to suppress her statements because she had invoked her right to remain silent, and therefore her <em>Miranda </em>rights were violated. Second, she claims error based on a delay in her presentment to a commissioner. Rejecting both contentions, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">I. FACTUAL SUMMARY \u2014 SUPPRESSION MOTION<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">Appellant moved to suppress various statements that she gave to the police during her interrogation on the evening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>of March 30, 2000. What follows is a summary of the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing in November 2001.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Sergeant Albert Pat\u00f3n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Maryland State Police testified that he was the shift supervisor at the Prince Frederick Barrack on the evening of March 30, 2000. At about 8:00 p.m., appellant entered the barracks and announced: \u201cI just shot someone.\u201d He recalled that a short time earlier, the police \u201chad received a call for a shooting ... at 1255 Wilson Road. And ... that a female suspect had been involved in the shooting, that she had shot a black male subject, and that she had left the scene in a white Oldsmobile headed towards the Prince Frederick area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Pat\u00f3n claimed that \u201cbefore [he] could reply\u201d to appellant\u2019s announcement that she shot someone, \u201cshe said I have the gun, it\u2019s here in my purse.\u201d Pat\u00f3n continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">And as she is saying that she started to try to open the purse, and I told her just wait, I will get that from you, just as quickly as I could try to think of a way to approach her, you know, and maintain my safety. So I asked her to have a seat over by the door that comes into the barrack.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Pat\u00f3n then took appellant\u2019s purse and brought her into the \u201cTrooper\u2019s Room where we put persons that are under arrest.\u201d At that time, Pat\u00f3n asked appellant which hand she used to shoot the victim, because he wanted to secure that hand in order to perform a gunshot residue test. After appellant responded that she had used her \u201cleft\u201d hand, Pat\u00f3n handcuffed that hand to the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Thereafter, Pat\u00f3n advised appellant of her <em>\u201cMiranda </em>rights,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> reading \u201cword for word\u201d from a \u201ccard\u201d provided to him by the State Police. The card was admitted into evidence. Appellant indicated that she understood her rights. However, when Pat\u00f3n asked appellant if she would \u201cknowingly waive these rights,\u201d appellant \u201cdidn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Pat\u00f3n then \u201cretrieved the gun from [appellant\u2019s] purse ... to make sure it didn\u2019t have any ammunition in it.\u201d He \u201cexamined\u201d the weapon and noted \u201cthat all the shell casings that [he] could see were empty.\u201d Pat\u00f3n testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">So in order so [sic] that I didn\u2019t have to keep handling it, I asked her how many shots she fired, and she said 1 don\u2019t remember. And then I asked her, well, did you fire all the bullets that were in the gun, and she said I don\u2019t know, it happened so fast.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Thereafter, Paton \u201copened the chambers just to see if there was any live ammunition in there.\u201d After Pat\u00f3n determined that no live ammunition was in the gun, he \u201cleft everything the way it was, closed it back up, and secured the gun.\u201d Pat\u00f3n then asked appellant \u201cwhat happened tonight, and her reply was T don\u2019t want to talk about it right now.\u2019 \u201d Accordingly, Paton \u201cdidn\u2019t ask [Freeman] anything else.\u201d He \u201cgot [appellant] a cup of water and just kept an eye on her, that was it.\u201d Pat\u00f3n described appellant\u2019s demeanor as \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201ccalm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">On cross-examination, Pat\u00f3n testified that he sat at the front desk and greeted people who came in to the barracks. When appellant \u201cfirst waled in the door,\u201d before she an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>nounced what she had done, he had no reason to believe she had committed the shooting. Pat\u00f3n also explained that, after he handcuffed appellant to the bench, he only questioned her \u201cabout the ammunition so that [he] could make the gun safe. [He] wasn\u2019t ... investigating the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">The following colloquy on redirect is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOu\">[PROSECUTOR]: When Ms. Freeman walked in and told you she just shot someone, immediately in your mind what did you think based upon the information you had from dispatch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">[PATON]: That this was the woman that was at Wilson Road that had just shot this man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: And so based upon that information and the fact that she told you she had a gun, you placed her under arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">[PATON]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: When you were speaking with Ms. Freeman did you feel it was necessary to go over with her again the date, place, and nature of the event that she just turned herself in for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-9\">[PATON]: No, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-10\">[PROSECUTOR]: And when she asked \u2014 when she mentioned \u2014 when she said to you that she didn\u2019t want to talk about it right now, you scrupulously honored that request, did you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-11\">[PATON]: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">Corporal David Ruel was assigned to investigate the homicide. His \u201cfirst contact\u201d with appellant occurred in the Troopers\u2019 Room at \u201cabout 9:35, 9:45, somewhere in that area.\u201d At the time, Freeman was \u201cseated on the prison bench handcuffed to the bench.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">At the outset, Ruel asked Pat\u00f3n \u201cto step out\u201d of the room and \u201cbrief[] [him] on what had gone on up to that point----\u201d Pat\u00f3n advised him that appellant did not want to talk. Ruel asked Ms. Freeman \u201cif she wanted anything to eat or drink or if she needed anything, and she advised she wasn\u2019t hungry at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>the time, but she did need some medication\u201d for blood pressure. Ruel instructed Corporal Delmar Smith to retrieve the medication. While Smith was gone, appellant remained in the Troopers\u2019 Room, and Ruel \u201cwould periodically just peek in to make sure that everything was okay in there and just let [appellant] sit for a while.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Appellant\u2019s medication arrived at about 10:20 p.m. At that time, Ruel asked appellant, who was still in the Troopers\u2019 Room, \u201cif she needed the medication; she again said no.\u201d Ruel also \u201casked [appellant] if she wanted something to eat, and that time she said yes, she wanted something from McDonald\u2019s.\u201d So, Ruel \u201cgot her some food.\u201d When the food arrived at about 10:52 p.m., Ruel removed the handcuff so that appellant could eat. However, Ruel recalled that, \u201cprior to ... eating\u201d at about 10:55 p.m., he \u201cread\u201d appellant her <em>Miranda </em>rights from the form, and then they \u201csat down to eat, and ... just talked about her family, what her job was, what her aspirations were. . .. \u201d Ruel explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">I read the form in its entirety. Then after completing the last paragraph here, last sentence asking her if she is willing to talk, I have her sign the statement that [sic] where it said signature for her, and then I have her review it again just to make sure that she understands and place her initials by one, two, three, four, and five, each of her rights if she understands them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">According to Ruel, during his advisement appellant did not request a lawyer, nor did she have any questions. Moreover, her demeanor was \u201cvery calm and cooperative.\u201d Appellant, who was then forty-seven years old, had no difficulty understanding what Ruel said. Although Ruel did not ascertain appellant\u2019s educational level, he found her \u201cvery articulate\u201d, and he \u201cfigured she had at least graduated high school,\u201d because she \u201chad mentioned earlier in [their] conversation that she had planned on going to college.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Appellant agreed to waive her rights, initialed each question in the waiver form, and signed it. Ruel denied threatening appellant or promising her anything to induce her to do so. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Before appellant provided a statement, she told Ruel that she was diagnosed as \u201cbipolar.\u201d After Freeman ate, she made an oral statement to Ruel, which he recounted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\">After finishing her dinner Ms. Freeman went on to advise that earlier that evening she had spoken with Mr. Gross on the phone for a few minutes. During the phone conversation they never argued. She just asked him if she could stop by, and he replied yes. A little later that same evening she drove herself over to Gross\u2019s house. At approximately 1930 hours she pulled into and parked in the Gross\u2019s driveway and never got out of her car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">Gross then came out of the house and sat in the passenger side front seat. The two sat in the car talking for a while about the upcoming weekend. Freeman advised she was kind of upset because Gross wouldn\u2019t take her out to dinner or the movies this Saturday. She then confronted him about the past few weekends that he hadn\u2019t taken her out and how he went to that dinner thing without asking her if she wanted to go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">Gross then told her he couldn\u2019t take her out this Saturday because he had to change the oil in his car. Ms. Freeman then confronted him again, advising him that it wouldn\u2019t take him all day to change the oil in his car. He then advised her he also had to tune his car up, but he would try to start working on his car a little earlier. Freeman then advised knowing that a tune-up and an oil change weren\u2019t the same thing she got upset and pulled her gun out from under the driver\u2019s side seat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">She then got out of the car through the driver\u2019s side door and with the gun in her left hand she pointed it at Gross and shot him. Gross then climbed out of the front passenger side door and fell to the ground. Freeman then got back in the car as Gross laid on the ground and shot him two more times. She then put the gun on the front passenger seat, closed the passenger side door, and drove to the barracks. When she arrived at the barracks she put the gun in her purse, walked into the ... lobby, and told them what she had done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>I then asked Freeman where she got the gun and why she had it, or why she had it with her that night. She advised that she bought the gun from somewhere in Way-son\u2019s Corner a while ago, but she couldn\u2019t recall the exact date. Freeman further advised that she normally keeps the gun under her front seat of her car for protection when she drives at night. I asked Freeman if she knew it was against the law to keep the gun in her car unless she had a permit to carry it. She advised that she knew this and that she had been meaning to apply for a permit, but she hadn\u2019t had the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-4\">1 then asked Freeman to explain to me what caused this to happen so I could better understand why she did it. She advised me that it was hard for her to remember what happened because it all happened so fast, and she doesn\u2019t know why she did it. I then asked her if Gross had hit her or called her any kind of name that may have provoked her, and she advised, no, Kevin was a very nice \u2014 Kevin was very nice and never hit me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">1 then asked Freeman about the statement witness Charles Gross<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> advised he had heard. She advised that she doesn\u2019t remember saying that. I then confronted Freeman with the possibility that Gross was cheating on her, and again she advised, no, Kevin was very nice.... [TJhat\u2019s basically all she advised at that point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Upon completion of her oral statement, Ruel asked appellant if she would provide a written or taped statement. Freeman declined to do so and requested a lawyer. Therefore, Ruel \u201cended [his] questioning and re-secured [appellant] to the prisoner bench.\u201d Ruel denied that any questioning occurred after Freeman requested an attorney. According to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Ruel, \u201cthe whole conversation was about an hour, hour and ten minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Although appellant completed her oral statement at around midnight, she was not taken before a Commissioner until about eight o\u2019clock the next morning. During that time, however, appellant was not questioned. Ruel was questioned generally about the delay. The following colloquy is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: And did there come a time that the [appellant] was taken before a Commissioner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">[RUEL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: And when was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">[RUEL]: That was about eight o\u2019clock the next morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acc\">[PROSECUTOR]: Why was there a brief delay in there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7I\">[RUEL]: Basically for the completion of paperwork, the processing of the actual fingerprint, photograph, and also the Commissioner wasn\u2019t coming in until the following morning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Defense counsel asked Ruel: \u201cWhere is the Commissioner\u2019s Office in location to the barracks where the interview was conducted?\u201d Ruel responded that the Commissioner\u2019s Office is situated 200 to 300 yards behind the barrack. Although Ruel conceded that the Commissioner is \u201cbasically on call 24 hours a day,\u201d and \u201ccould have been available all hours of the night, I just had to call him out,\u201d he claimed that \u201cat the time the paperwork wasn\u2019t completed, so it would have been pointless to call the Commissioner out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">In argument, appellant\u2019s counsel addressed the matter of the advisement and waiver of rights, stating, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-11\">After her <em>Miranda </em>rights were read ... Sergeant Pat\u00f3n did not receive a response to question seven, which is do you waive these rights. At that point it\u2019s the defense\u2019s contention that she was clearly invoking her right to remain silent. She hadn\u2019t waived any of her rights. Yet Sergeant Pat\u00f3n continued to make inquisitions of her as to how many shots were fired, did you fire all the bullets, things of that nature, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>to which Ms. Freeman responded. I think those, although her rights had been read to her, she had not clearly and voluntarily, freely and voluntarily and knowingly waived her rights because there was no response to Sergeant Paton\u2019s last question on his card list that he had read to Ms. Freeman. So I think those clearly should be suppressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">At the end of her discussions with Sergeant Pat\u00f3n what she clearly indicated is that I do not want to talk about it right now. Yet knowing that, Trooper Ruel goes back two hours later, begins to re-Mirandize her and begins to question her. She has made no attempt at that point to re-initiate questioning. She has made no indication to the officers that she wants to talk about the case. They have gotten her food and other things, but she had made no initiation to give up her right to remain silent, which she had indicated twice by my analysis of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">First of all when she indicated that she did not knowingly waive her rights to Sergeant Pat\u00f3n she was invoking her right to remain silent. And clearly she said I don\u2019t want to talk about it right now, which means she is invoking her right to remain silent. Both those times she is making it clear to officers ... that she did not want to speak to them about this case at all. Yet Trooper Ruel went ahead and initiated contact and re-advised her of her rights, and at that point in time took what I believe to be an illegal statement from Ms. Freeman.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">With respect to the issue of delay in presentment, defense counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">[I]f you look at the fact that they violated her right to remain silent, you also have to look at the fact that they delayed in presenting her to a Commissioner. Trooper Ruel has told the Court that a Commissioner is on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-9\">Now, there is clear case law that says that delay for the purposes of obtaining a confession where followed by presentment to the police continuing interrogation must be excluded on the common law principles of voluntariness. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Courts have ruled that delay in presentment to the Commissioner doesn\u2019t necessarily exclude the statement per se, which was the rule at one point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">* 4: *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">[Djelay would be reasonable if it was brief, was necessitated by [sic] reasonable request such as unavoidable delays involving transporting, handling, booking, or non-availability of magistrates. We don\u2019t have any of that here.... [A]n unreasonable delay for the purposes of gathering additional evidence to justify arrest or motivated by ill-will or delay for delay sake cannot be allowed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-7\">4: 4i *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">In this situation in this county it\u2019s pretty clear if they had called for a magistrate at ten o\u2019clock when she had already invoked her right to silence, they could have taken her in front of the Commissioner. Waiting until 8:15 the next morning to take her in front of the Commissioner doesn\u2019t make any sense. And I think it\u2019s a delay just for the purpose of trying to get a statement from her first of all, or to gather additional evidence. Because if they get in front of a Commissioner without that statement, obviously think [sic] may have enough to hold her for probable cause purposes, but the statement makes it a much cleaner case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">The State responded that silence alone does not amount to the invocation of one\u2019s rights under <em>Miranda. </em>The State also claimed that the statement, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it right <em>now,\u201d </em>did not mean \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you <em>ever.\u201d </em>Moreover, the prosecutor argued that, \u201cin the context of custodial interrogation the police can re-initiate questioning regarding the same subject matter after an invocation of the right to silence if they first promptly stop questioning her after the invocation, which is what happened here.\u201d The prosecutor noted that the officers allowed some time to pass before re-initiating questioning and then re-advised appellant of her <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Characterizing as a \u201cblurt\u201d appellant\u2019s announcement when she walked into the barrack that she just shot someone, the court denied the motion to suppress that statement. However, the court suppressed appellant\u2019s statement that she used her \u201cleft hand\u201d to shoot, stating: \u201cI think the State has conceded that the answer to the question about which hand did you use to shoot the gun should be suppressed. The State has agreed with that and I agree with that also.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">As to appellant\u2019s silence when Pat\u00f3n initially asked her if she would waive her rights, the court said: \u201cI also agree that her mere failure to answer the second question ... her silence there was not an indication that she wanted a lawyer. It was just simply silence.\u201d The court did not comment on whether the silence amounted to an invocation of the right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">With regard to appellant\u2019s statement to Pat\u00f3n, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it right now,\u201d the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">That is not a statement saying I want to make no further statements, I want to see my lawyer, I don\u2019t want to say anything. That\u2019s totally different than that, and I don\u2019t think any further statements need to be initiated by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">Then we have Corporal Ruel speaking to her. He gave her her rights. Those have been shown as State\u2019s Exhibit 3. He testified that he read them to her. She signed the form. Then he had her initial everything. His testimony is clear that he thought that she was competent, that she was able to make statements. I don\u2019t think it was \u2014 when she said she needed her medication for high blood pressure, I don\u2019t think it was his burden to make further inquires when he found out there was other medication. Just because she is bipolar doesn\u2019t necessarily mean she is not capable of answering those questions at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">Looking at all the factors, she is a mature woman, she is age 47, yes, she has no prior criminal record, but she is also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>not a youngster that can be intimidated or forced into making statements. The court finds that she \u2014 that the State\u2019s questioning of her, those answers were totally voluntary. It was after she had completed the statement when she was asked if it could be tape recorded or written that she declined to make any further statement and invoked her right to have an attorney.-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">With regard to the delay in presentment, the court said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">I don\u2019t think the amount of time is unreasonable. Obviously the paperwork needs to be processed. There was an eight o\u2019clock, approximately eight o\u2019clock discussion with the desk sergeant. Then about an hour and a half later Corporal Ruel went in to talk to her, talked about her medicine. When the medicine came he went back in to speak to her. Then he offered her some food, got some food. She was unhandcuffed, allowed to eat dinner. It was during that period of time that these discussions were taking place and she made the statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">So under the totality of the circumstances here I don\u2019t find there is any reason to suppress the evidence. I think that the statements made were totally voluntarily and freely made after having been advised of her Constitutional rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">A. The Right to Remain Silent</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">At trial, Paton testified that he advised appellant of her rights, and she did not have any questions. In Paton\u2019s direct testimony, he did not refer to his inquiry to appellant about whether she was willing to waive her rights, or her silence in response to the inquiry.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, he stated that, after his advisement, he asked appellant, \u201cwhat happened tonight....\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Over defense objection, Pat\u00f3n testified as to appellant\u2019s reply: \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it right now.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">Appellant contends that the suppression court erred in finding that she did not invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege by remaining mute when Patou asked her if she was willing to waive her rights. Moreover, she insists that, because her silence was an invocation of her right to remain silent, \u201call questioning was required to cease.\u201d Consequently, Freeman asserts that her statement, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it right now,\u201d (which she designates as statement four), and her oral confession to Ruel (which she designates as statement five), were \u201cerroneously admitted at trial in violation of <em>Miranda,\u201d </em>because both were obtained after she invoked her right to silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">With regard to appellant\u2019s silence, the State maintains that appellant\u2019s \u201cmere failure to answer a waiver question\u201d did not constitute an invocation of the right to remain silent. Indeed, the State contends that it was apparent from the context that Freeman did not invoke her right to remain silent: she voluntarily \u201ccame to the police station to turn herself in and announced that she had shot someone, thereby plainly indicating to the police her willingness to accept responsibility for the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The State argues that, at best, appellant\u2019s silence was an ambiguous invocation. Therefore, it urges us to apply the rationale of <em>Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994). <em>Davis </em>requires an unambiguous invocation of the right to counsel, so that police officers do not have \u201cto make difficult judgment calls about whether the suspect in fact wants a lawyer....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461, 114 S.Ct. 2350.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The State also insists that appellant\u2019s silence in regard to the waiver inquiry cannot \u201cbe divorced from her subsequent statement that she did not want to talk about the shooting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>\u2018right now.\u2019 \u201d In effect, the State disputes appellant\u2019s characterization of statement four as a statement. It claims that statement four \u201cshould not even be considered a \u2018statement\u2019 for purposes of Miranda; rather, it is itself an assertion of the right to silence.\u201d That assertion, says the State, \u201csimply made clear that [appellant] did not waive her right to silence ...,\u201d and thus statement four \u201cshould not be deemed a \u2018statement\u2019 subject to suppression under <em>Miranda.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The State adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">Because Freeman\u2019s comment, which she designates as \u201cstatement 4,\u201d is fairly understood in conjunction with her earlier silence as an assertion of her Fifth Amendment right to silence, there is no need for this Court to address whether her mere silence, -without more, would constitute an invocation of the right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">With regard to the confession to Ruel, the State maintains that the police \u201cscrupulously honored\u201d the invocation expressed in statement four, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it right now.\u201d Therefore, the State contends that the court properly admitted appellant\u2019s confession to Ruel.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">For clarity in our discussion, we summarize, in chronological order, the various custodial statements and conduct identified by appellant, along with the court\u2019s rulings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\"><em>Statement No. 1: </em>\u201cI just shot someone.\u201d The court ruled that it constituted a \u201cblurt\u201d and was therefore admissible. It was introduced in evidence through the testimony of Pat\u00f3n. Appellant does not contest this ruling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\"><em>Statement No. 2: </em>Before appellant was advised of her rights, she was asked which hand she used to shoot the victim. She responded, \u201cleft.\u201d The State conceded that this statement violated <em>Miranda, </em>and the court ruled that the statement was inadmissible. Therefore, it is not in issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number><em>Conduct </em>Pat\u00f3n advised appellant of her rights, and then asked her whether she would waive her rights. Appellant remained silent. The court ruled that the silence was not an invocation of the right to counsel, and appellant contests the court\u2019s finding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\"><em>Statement(s) No. 3: </em>Pat\u00f3n asked appellant how many shots she fired, and she responded, \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d Pat\u00f3n then asked her, \u201cDid you fire all the bullets that were in the gun?\u201d Appellant replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know, it happened so fast.\u201d These statements were not introduced at trial, and thus are not in issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\"><em>Statement No. U: </em>Pat\u00f3n checked the gun and then asked, \u201cWhat happened tonight?\u201d Appellant responded, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it right now.\u201d The court ruled that this statement, made to Pat\u00f3n after appellant had been advised of her rights, was neither an invocation of the right to silence nor an invocation of the right to counsel. The court denied appellant\u2019s challenge to the statement, and the State introduced it at trial through the testimony of Sergeant Pat\u00f3n. Appellant challenges the admission of the statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\"><em>Statement No. 5: </em>A few hours after appellant said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it right now,\u201d Corporel Ruel re-advised appellant of her rights, and appellant gave an oral statement, recounting the events of March 30, 2000. The court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress this statement, and it was introduced at trial through the testimony of Corporal Ruel. Appellant disputes the court\u2019s ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Unlike the State, appellant focuses separately on her initial silence in response to Paton\u2019s waiver inquiry, claiming that, standing alone, it constituted an invocation of her <em>Miranda </em>rights. As the Supreme Court has observed, \u201c[sjilence in the wake of <em>[Miranda </em>] warnings may be nothing more than the arrestee\u2019s exercise of these <em>Miranda </em>rights. Thus, every post-arrest silence is insolubly ambiguous.... \u201d <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 617, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976); <em>see United States v. Hale, </em>422 U.S. 171, 177, 95 S.Ct. 2133, 45 L.Ed.2d 99 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>As we observed, the State relies on <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. 452, 114 S.Ct. 2350, to support its contention that appellant\u2019s silence was so ambiguous that the police were not required to regard it as an invocation of the right to remain silent. In the State\u2019s view, the <em>Davis </em>\u201crequirement\u201d for an unequivocal assertion of the right to counsel applies \u201cwith equal force to an invocation of the right to silence, where the need for a bright-line rule is equally compelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">In <em>Davis, </em>Naval Investigative Service agents questioned Davis about a murder. <em>Id. </em>at 454, 114 S.Ct. 2350. After the agents advised Davis of his rights under military law, Davis agreed to waive his rights. <em>Id. </em>at 454-55, 114 S.Ct. 2350. During the interrogation, Davis said, \u201c \u2018Maybe I should talk to a lawyer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455, 114 S.Ct. 2350. One of the agents sought to clarify whether Davis was \u201c \u2018asking for a lawyer or ... just making a comment about a lawyer....\u2019\u201d Davis responded that he was not requesting an attorney. <em>Id. </em>About an hour later, however, Davis said, \u201c T think I want a lawyer before I say anything else.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>At that point, the questioning ended. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Davis later moved to suppress his statements, claiming that the interrogators failed to honor his invocation of his right to counsel. The motion was denied, and Davis was convicted of murder. <em>Id. </em>On review, the Supreme Court sought to craft \u201ca bright line\u201d rule that could be \u201capplied by officers in the real world of investigation and interrogation without unduly hampering the gathering of information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461, 114 S.Ct. 2350. Insisting that the invocation of the right to counsel must be articulated with clarity, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXi\">Invocation of the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel \u201crequires, at a minimum, some statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney.\u201d But if a suspect makes a reference to an attorney that is ambiguous or equivocal in that a reasonable officer in light of the circumstances would have understood only that the suspect <em>might </em>be invoking the right to counsel, our precedents do not require the cessation of questioning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Rather, <em>the suspect, must unambiguously request counsel.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">As we have observed, \u201ca statement either is such an assertion of the right to counsel or it is not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 459, 114 S.Ct. 2350 (citations omitted)(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Although the Supreme Court \u201cdeclined to adopt a rule requiring officers to ask clarifying questions\u201d when faced with an ambiguous assertion, it suggested that \u201cit will often be good practice for the interviewing officers to clarify whether or not [the suspect] actually wants an attorney....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461, 114 S.Ct. 2350. The Supreme Court reasoned: \u201cClarifying questions help protect the rights of the suspect by insuring that he gets an attorney if he wants one, and will minimize the chance of a confession being suppressed due to subsequent judicial second-guessing as to the meaning of the suspect\u2019s statement----\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Freeman concedes that some jurisdictions \u201cdo not recognize silence as an invocation\u201d of the right to remain silent, because of its ambiguity. In those jurisdictions, says appellant, \u201cone\u2019s silence must be prefaced with an unequivocal statement that he or she is invoking his or her right to remain silent.\u201d However, she maintains that \u201c[t]his line of reasoning\u201d derives erroneously from the view \u201cthat the standard set forth for invoking one\u2019s right to counsel,\u201d articulated in <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. 452, 114 S.Ct. 2350, \u201cis equally applicable to the invocation of silence.\u201d According to appellant, \u201c[t]he United States Supreme Court ... has yet to determine whether the <em>Davis </em>invocation of counsel standard is in anyway [sic] appropriate to the invocation of silence.\u201d Moreover, she points out that \u201c[a]t least six jurisdictions have ruled that a Daws-like standard is inappropriate to invocations of silence.\u201d With one exception, we are not persuaded to adopt Freeman\u2019s position based on the six foreign cases cited by her to support her claim that a Davis-like standard is inappropriate to invocations of silence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Nevertheless, we agree with appellant that the <em>Davis </em>rationale does not apply to the analysis of appellant\u2019s silence, but for reasons not advanced by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Neither party has discussed whether the rationale of <em>Davis </em>applies to an ambiguous invocation made <em>prior </em>to a waiver of rights. In our view, in determining whether to apply the rationale of <em>Davis, </em>it is significant that appellant\u2019s alleged invocation of her right to silence occurred <em>prior </em>to a waiver of rights, and before interrogation ensued; unlike in <em>Davis, </em>it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>was not an ambiguous invocation that occurred <em>during </em>an interrogation and <em>after </em>a waiver of rights. While there may well be sound reason to apply the logic of <em>Davis </em>to the matter of an ambiguous invocation of the right to silence that follows a valid waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights, that logic does not extend to an ambiguous invocation that occurs prior to the initial waiver of rights. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\"><em>Davis </em>involved an ambiguous invocation of the right to counsel that occurred <em>during </em>interrogation, and <em>after </em>the defendant had already waived his rights; the validity of Davis\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>waiver was not in issue. It was in that context, where the suspect had already waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and later arguably sought to change his mind, that the Supreme Court ruled that a defendant must clearly articulate his request for counsel in order to invoke that light. Significantly, the Supreme Court said, 512 U.S. at 461, 114 S.Ct. 2350: \u201cWe therefore hold that, <em>after </em>a knowing and voluntary waiver of the <em>Miranda </em>rights, law enforcement officers may continue questioning until and unless the suspect clearly requests an attorney.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The issues of \u201c[ijnvoeation and waiver are entirely distinct inquiries, and the two must not be blurred.... \u201d <em>Smith v. Illinois, </em>469 U.S. 91, 98, 105 S.Ct. 490, 83 L.Ed.2d 488 (1984) (per curiam). When a suspect \u201cindicates in any manner\u201d that he or she \u201cwishes to remain silent,\u201d <em>Miranda </em>requires that \u201cthe interrogation must cease.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 473-74, 86 S.Ct. 1602. Moreover, there is no prescribed form or set way in which to waive <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See North Carolina v. Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 373, 99 S.Ct. 1755, 60 L.Ed.2d 286 (1979) (\u201cThe question is not one of form, but rather whether the defendant in fact knowingly and voluntarily waived the rights delineated in the <em>Miranda </em>case.\u201d). If the State seeks to rely on a waiver of rights, however, it carries \u201ca heavy burden\u201d to show \u201cthat the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination .. .. \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 475, 86 S.Ct. 1602. As the Supreme Court said in <em>Butler, </em>441 U.S. at 373, 99 S.Ct. 1755:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>That does not mean that the defendant\u2019s silence, coupled with an understanding of his rights and a course of conduct indicating waiver, may never support a conclusion that a defendant has waived his rights. The courts must presume that a defendant did not waive his rights; the prosecution\u2019s burden is great; but in at least some cases waiver can be clearly inferred from the actions and words of the person interrogated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Numerous jurisdictions, both federal and state, have applied the rationale of <em>Davis </em>to an ambiguous invocation of the right to silence, and have concluded that, as with an ambiguous invocation of the right to counsel, an equivocal invocation of the right to silence need not be honored by the police. Most of these cases, however, involve a defendant\u2019s ineffective attempt to invoke his or her constitutional rights <em>after </em>the defendant had previously waived <em>Miranda </em>rights. In this case, it is noteworthy that appellant\u2019s silence preceded a waiver of rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In <em>Coleman v. Singletary, </em>30 F.3d 1420 (11th Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>514 U.S. 1086, 115 S.Ct. 1801, 131 L.Ed.2d 727 (1995), for example, the Eleventh Circuit determined that the defendant\u2019s alleged invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege \u201cwas insufficiently clear.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1423. Relying on <em>Davis, </em>it then concluded \u201cthat the same rule should apply to a suspect\u2019s ambiguous or equivocal references to the right to cut off questioning as to the right to counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1424. It reasoned that the concern that supported creation of a \u201cbright line rule\u201d in <em>Davis </em>with respect to the right to counsel \u201capplies with equal force to the invocation of the right to remain silent____\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, it held \u201cthat the Daws rule applies to invocations of the right to remain silent .... \u201d and said: \u201cIf the statement is ambiguous or equivocal ... the police have no duty to clarify the suspect\u2019s intent, and they may proceed with the interrogation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Significantly, the defendant\u2019s vague invocation occurred during interrogation, and <em>after </em>he had agreed to waive his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Similarly, in <em>State v. Williams, </em>535 N.W.2d 277 (Minn.1995), the suspect was interrogated <em>after </em>he had agreed to waive his rights. Then, during the interrogation, he asserted: \u201cI don\u2019t have to take any more of your bullshit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281. Based on his behavior, the defendant claimed he had invoked his right to remain silent, and complained that the police did not scrupulously honor his invocation because they resumed questioning five minutes later. <em>Id. </em>at 282-83. The Supreme Court of Minnesota refused to find an unambiguous invocation of the right to silence based on the \u201csuspect\u2019s hostile behavior, standing alone.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283. Rather, it concluded that the suspect\u2019s \u201clanguage\u201d must \u201csufficiently articulate the desire to remain silent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It said: \u201c[Nothing short of an unambiguous or unequivocal invocation of the right to remain silent will be sufficient to implicate <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>protections.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 285. The Court reasoned: \u201cTo hold otherwise would encourage judicial second-guessing of police officers as to the meaning of a suspect\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283. Moreover, relying on <em>Davis, </em>the court concluded that if clarifying questions are not required when the right to counsel is ambiguously invoked, \u201cit follows by even greater logic that the Constitution does not require such a clarifying approach when an accused ambiguously or equivocally attempts to invoke his right to remain silent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><em>See also Florida v. Owen,, </em>696 So.2d 715, 717-18 (Fla.1997) (agreeing \u201cthat <em>Davis </em>applies as much to requests to terminate interrogation as it does to requests for counsel\u201d; reasoning that because \u201crequests for counsel have been accorded greater judicial deference than requests to terminate interrogation,\u201d the rationale of <em>Davis </em>\u201capplies when a defendant makes an equivocal assertion of any right under <em>Miranda </em>\u201d; and holding that police are not required to clarify an ambiguous invocation of the right to silence), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1002, 118 S.Ct. 574, 139 L.Ed.2d 413 (1997); <em>People v.

Leyva, </em>951 P.2d 738 (Utah 1997), which distinguishes between an ambiguous response to an initial <em>Miranda </em>advisement and an equivocal post-waiver invocation. The Supreme Court of Utah declined to apply <em>Davis </em>to an ambiguous pre-waiver response, concluding that <em>Davis </em>was limited to a post-waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>ambiguous invocation of rights. <em>Id. </em>at 745. According to the Utah court, that scenario is an \u201centirely separate\u201d issue from an ambiguous pre-waiver invocation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">Noting that <em>Davis </em>did not \u201caddress\u201d or \u201cextend to prewaiver scenarios ....\u201d, the Utah court said that <em>\u201cDavis </em>made clear that its holding applied only to a suspect\u2019s attempt to <em>reinvoke </em>his <em>Miranda </em>rights <em>\u2018after </em>a knowing and voluntary waiver\u2019 of the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Davis, </em>512 U.S. at 461, 114 S.Ct. 2350). Therefore, the Utah court concluded that an officer faced with an ambiguous response to an initial advisement of <em>Miranda </em>rights, i.e., at the pre-waiver stage, is limited to posing questions designed to clarify the suspect\u2019s ambiguous response. <em>Id. Accord State v. Tuttle, </em>650 N.W.2d 20, 28 (S.D.2002) (adopting <em>Leyva, </em>and concluding that \u201c[t]he <em>Davis </em>holding obviously applies to instances where suspects attempt to invoke <em>Miranda </em>rights after a knowing and voluntary waiver of those rights. <em>Davis, </em>in sum, applies to an equivocal postwaiver invocation of rights.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">We agree with the Utah court that a careful reading of <em>Davis </em>reveals that the Supreme Court\u2019s bright line rule, requiring an unequivocal assertion of the right to counsel, pertains to a situation in which the defendant had previously waived his right and then, during the interrogation, arguably sought to exercise his rights. Based on the foregoing, we decline to apply the rationale of <em>Davis </em>to our analysis of appellant\u2019s silence, because the silence occurred in a prewaiver context.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Next, we consider whether the court erred in failing to recognize appellant\u2019s silence as an invocation. In support of appellant\u2019s claim that her silence constituted a separate invocation, from which \u201cno legal penalty can flow,\u201d she relies on <em>Younie v. State, </em>272 Md. 233, 322 A.2d 211 (1974), and <em>Crosby v.

During a custodial interrogation, he waived his right to remain silent, in that he agreed to answer \u201csome\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>questions about the crimes, but refused to answer all of them. <em>Id. </em>at 236-38, 322 A.2d 211. Nevertheless, he signed the bottom of each page of the interrogating officer\u2019s handwritten statement of the interview. <em>Id. </em>at 235, 322 A.2d 211. At trial, over objection, the court admitted the officer\u2019s handwritten record of the interview, in which Younie answered fifteen out of twenty-three questions. <em>Id. </em>at 236-38, 322 A.2d 211. During closing argument, the State was allowed to refer to Younie\u2019s refusals to respond to all of the questions. <em>Id. </em>at 238, 322 A.2d 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">On appeal, Younie complained that \u201chis silence was a permissible exercise of his [constitutional] privilege\u201d, and therefore the court should not have admitted in evidence the record of his refusals to answer. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals agreed. It held that evidence that the defendant remained silent \u201ccreat[ed] the highly prejudicial inference that his failure to respond was motivated by guilt....\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the Court\u2019s view, the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the refusals to answer was that Younie elected to exercise his constitutional right to remain silent, but a jury might improperly regard his silence as a tacit admission. <em>Id. </em>at 244, 322 A.2d 211. The Court said: \u201c[T]he Constitution ... expressly permits [a suspect] to remain mute and not have this made known to [the jury].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">Silence in the context of a custodial inquisition is presumed to be an exercise of the privilege against self-incrimination from which no legal penalty can flow, and the State has the heavy burden of demonstrating <em>by clear and convincing evidence that a failure to respond was not an invocation of this right.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-7\"><em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Of significance here, the Court also noted, <em>id. </em>at 238 n. 1, 322 A.2d 211:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">Arguably, when Younie indicated he would answer only \u201csome\u201d of the questions, or when he \u201crefused to answer\u201d others or when he said he did not want to talk about the armed robbery homicide, the interrogation should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>terminated according to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 473-474, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). In a similar situation, the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Law v. State, </em>21 Md.App. 13, 318 A.2d 859 (1974) ruled that the continuing custodial interrogation of the appellant there should have ceased when he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk anymore\u201d and \u201cI am not going to say any more until I am treated [for my injuries].\u201d <em>However, as this point is not urged, here, we shall not, pass upon it.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"><em>Younie </em>underscores the inadmissibility of a defendant\u2019s silence. In this case, the State did not introduce evidence of appellant\u2019s silence. But, <em>Younie </em>also suggests that the State must establish by clear and convincing evidence that the failure to respond was <em>not </em>an invocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Crosby, </em>366 Md. 518, 784 A.2d 1102, is misplaced. There, the defendant \u201cwas <em>not </em>silent in responding to a particular question.... \u201d Instead, he refused to put into writing that which he had already said. <em>Id. </em>at 529, 784 A.2d 1102. The Court considered whether that refusal amounted to an invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination and, if so, whether the testimony concerning such invocation was improperly permitted at trial, and thus \u201cimpinged\u201d the defendant\u2019s \u201cconstitutional right to remain silent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 529-30, 784 A.2d 1102. The Court of Appeals said, <em>id. </em>at 529, 784 A.2d 1102:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">The protections bestowed upon citizens by the privilege against self-incrimination do not disappear once the accused initially waives his or her rights. An accused may invoke his or her rights at any time during questioning, or simply refuse to answer any question asked, and this silence cannot be used against him or her. <em>See Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 617, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 2244, 49 L.Ed.2d 91, 97 (1976)(stating that \u201c[s]ilence in the wake of <em>[Miranda </em>] warnings may be nothing more than the arrestee\u2019s exercise of these <em>Miranda </em>rights\u201d); <em>Younie v. State, </em>272 Md. at 244-45, 322 A.2d at 217 (1974)(stating that \u201c[s]ilence in the context of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>custodial inquisition is presumed to be an exercise of the privilege against self-incrimination from which no legal penalty can flow ...\u201d and \u201cwe must assume that the petitioner\u2019s failure to answer was an invocation of his fifth amendment privilege\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The <em>Crosby </em>Court concluded that the defendant did not exercise his right to remain silent by refusing to provide a written statement after he gave an oral statement. Rather, he simply declined \u201c \u2018to reduce to writing his existing statement and waiver of rights....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530, 784 A.2d 1102 (citation omitted). While recognizing that \u201cthe right to remain silent \u2018has always been liberally construed in order to give fullest effect to this immunity ....\u2019\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 527 n. 8, 784 A.2d 1102 (citations omitted), the Court declined \u201cto extend <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>application to an illogical extreme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530, 784 A.2d 1102. <em>See also State v. Purvey, </em>129 Md.App. 1, 18-19, 740 A.2d 54 (1999) (noting that defendant who declined to reduce his oral statement to writing \u201cdid not choose to remain silent; he only refused to reduce to writing his existing statement and waiver of rights\u201d; the Court \u201crefuse[d] to extend under <em>Miranda </em>... a refusal to write out one\u2019s statement into a full-fledged assertion of one\u2019s right to silence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\"><em>Grier v. State, </em>351 Md. 241, 718 A.2d 211 (1998), is also pertinent. There, the Court said: \u201cEvidence of post-arrest silence, after <em>Miranda </em>warnings are given, is inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258, 718 A.2d 211 (citing <em>Doyle, </em>426 U.S. at 619, 96 S.Ct. 2240). The Court reasoned that usually \u201c \u2018silence is so ambiguous that it is of little probative force.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grier, </em>351 Md. at 252, 718 A.2d 211. The <em>Grier </em>Court added: \u201cWhen a defendant is silent following <em>Miranda </em>warnings, he may be acting merely upon his right to remain silent\u201d, and \u201ca defendant\u2019s silence at that point carries little or no probative value, and a significant potential for prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258, 718 A.2d 211 (citing <em>Hale, </em>422 U.S. at 180, 95 S.Ct. 2133).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Similarly, in <em>Dupree v. State, </em>352 Md. 314, 722 A.2d 52 (1998), the Court reversed a murder conviction because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>police officer testified, over defense objection, that the defendant, having been advised of his rights, did not provide a statement to the police. <em>Id. </em>at 316, 722 A.2d 52. The Court held that evidence of the advisement \u201clacked the threshold relevancy necessary for admissibility,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 324, 722 A.2d 52, and \u201cwas immaterial to any issue in the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332, 722 A.2d 52. Further, the Court ruled that because the defendant \u201cgave no statement to the police\u201d the jury did not need to know of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings \u201cto complete its appointed task.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Most recently, in <em>Kosh v. State, </em>382 Md. 218, 854 A.2d 1259 (2004), the Court of Appeals underscored that \u201c[pjost-arrest silence is inadmissible as substantive evidence of a criminal defendant\u2019s guilt, regardless of whether that silence precedes the recitation to the defendant of <em>Miranda </em>advisements.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 220, 854 A.2d 1259; <em>see also </em>at 232, 854 A.2d 1259 (observing that the privilege against self-incrimination is a \u201cmainstay of the American criminal justice system,\u201d and the right does not distinguish between <em>pre-Miranda </em>and <em>post-Miranda </em>silence .... \u201d). <em>See also Miller v. State, </em>231 Md. 215, 218, 189 A.2d 635 (1963) (suspect in custody has the right to remain silent and \u201c \u2018mere silence should afford no inference whatever of acquiescence\u2019 \u201d to accusations) (citation omitted); <em>Garner v. State, </em>142 Md.App. 94, 108, 788 A.2d 219 (stating that \u201cprosecutor should not have been permitted to ask appellant a question that ... insinuated that he chose to remain silent after he turned himself into the police\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>369 Md. 181, 798 A.2d 553 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The tenor of the foregoing cases leads us to conclude that the court below erred in failing to construe appellant\u2019s pre-waiver silence as an invocation of her right to remain silent. Although the police could have sought to clarify whether appellant intended her silence as an invocation of her rights, with questions limited to the effort to clarify, Pat\u00f3n should not have ignored the silence by asking appellant \u201cwhat happened.\u201d It follows that Freeman\u2019s response to that inquiry, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it right now,\u201d was erroneously admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Nevertheless, we are satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that, in the context of this case, any error was harmless. <em>See Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665 (1976); <em>see also Borchardt v. State, </em>367 Md. 91, 131, 786 A.2d 631 (2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1104, 122 S.Ct. 2309, 152 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2002); <em>Hudson v. State, </em>152 Md.App. 488, 508-09, 832 A.2d 834, <em>cert. denied, </em>378 Md. 618, 837 A.2d 928 (2003). We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">First, the statement, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it right now,\u201d taken alone or in context, cannot be regarded as a tacit admission of guilt. The undisputed evidence showed that appellant came to the police station of her own accord and immediately announced that she had shot someone. In that light, her subsequent statement (statement four) is \u201cfairly innocuous.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>152 Md.App. at 509, 832 A.2d 834. Indeed, the State certainly did not strengthen its case with the admission of statement four. Therefore, we are amply satisfied that \u201cthere is no reasonable possibility\u201d that the admission of [statement four] contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict. <em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Moreover, statement four was itself an invocation by Freeman of her right to remain silent. Yet, it does not necessarily follow that the court erred in admitting appellant\u2019s subsequent confession to Ruel. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\"><em>Michigan v. Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 96 S.Ct. 321, 46 L.Ed.2d 313 (1975), teaches that, even if a defendant invokes the right to silence, the police are not necessarily forever barred from attempting to question the suspect. Appellant concedes as much. Under certain circumstances, the \u201cpolice may reinitiate discussion with a suspect who has invoked his or her right to remain silent if a significant period of time has elapsed and if the police have re-advised the suspect of his or her rights.\u201d <em>Raras v. State, </em>140 Md.App. 132, 154, 780 A.2d 322 (discussing Mosley), <em>cert. denied, </em>367 Md. 90, 785 A.2d 1292 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Mosley was arrested in connection with certain robberies. After he was advised of his rights, Mosley invoked his right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>remain silent, and the detective \u201cpromptly ceased the interrogation.\u201d <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 97, 96 S.Ct. 321. About two hours later, Mosley was again advised of his <em>Miranda </em>warnings by another detective who questioned Mosley about an unrelated murder. <em>Id. </em>at 97-98, 96 S.Ct. 321. Mosley did not ask to consult with a lawyer, nor did he \u201cindicate that he did not want to discuss the homicide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98, 96 S.Ct. 321. During the interrogation, which lasted approximately fifteen minutes, Mosley implicated himself in the homicide, and he was subsequently charged with first degree murder. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">In his suppression motion, Mosley claimed that, under <em>Miranda, </em>\u201cit was constitutionally impermissible\u201d for the police to question him about the murder because he had previously asserted that \u201che did not want to answer any questions about the robberies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98-99, 96 S.Ct. 321. The trial court denied the motion, and the statement was introduced at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 99, 96 S.Ct. 321. On appeal, the Supreme Court noted, <em>id. </em>at 104-05, 96 S.Ct. 321:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">A review of the circumstances leading to Mosley\u2019s confession reveals that his \u201cright to cut off questioning\u201d was fully respected in this case. Before his initial interrogation, Mosley was carefully advised that he was under no obligation to answer any questions and could remain silent if he wished. He orally acknowledged that he understood the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and then signed a printed notification-of-rights form. When Mosley stated that he did not want to discuss the robberies, Detective Cowie immediately ceased the interrogation and did not try either to resume the questioning or in any way to persuade Mosley to reconsider his position. After an interval of more than two hours, Mosley was questioned by another police officer at another location about an unrelated holdup murder. He was given full and complete <em>Miranda </em>warnings at the outset of the second interrogation. He was thus reminded again that he could remain silent and could consult with a lawyer, and was carefully given a full and fair opportunity to exercise these options. The subsequent questioning did not undercut Mosley\u2019s previous decision not to answer Detective Cowie\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>inquiries. Detective Hill did not resume the interrogation about the White Tower Restaurant robbery or inquire about the Blue Goose Bar robbery, but instead focused exclusively on the Leroy Williams homicide, a crime different in nature and in time and place of occurrence from the robberies for which Mosley had been arrested and interrogated by Detective Cowie. Although it is not clear from the record how much Detective Hill knew about the earlier interrogation, his questioning of Mosley about an unrelated homicide was quite consistent with a reasonable interpretation of Mosley\u2019s earlier refusal to answer any questions about the robberies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Recognizing that, under certain circumstances, the police may re-initiate an attempt to interrogate a suspect despite a prior invocation of the right to silence, the <em>Mosley </em>Court said, <em>id. </em>at 105-06, 96 S.Ct. 321:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">This is not a case ... where the police failed to honor a decision of a person in custody to cut off questioning, either by refusing to discontinue the interrogation upon request or by persisting in repeated efforts to wear down his resistance and make him change his mind. In contrast to such practices, the police here immediately ceased the interrogation, resumed questioning only after the passage of a significant period of time and the provision of a fresh set of warnings, and restricted the second interrogation to a crime that had not been a subject of the earlier interrogation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Nevertheless, the Supreme Court underscored that the admissibility of an accused\u2019s statement, made after the invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege, depends in part on whether the police \u201cscrupulously honored\u201d the accused\u2019s right to remain silent. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">A reasonable and faithful interpretation of the <em>Miranda </em>opinion must rest on the intention of the Court in that case to adopt \u201cfully effective means ... to notify the person of his right of silence and to assure that the exercise of the right will be scrupulously honored....\u201d <em>[Miranda,] </em>384 U.S., at 479, [; 86 S.Ct. at 1630]. The critical safeguard identified in the passage at issue is a person\u2019s \u201cright to cut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>off questioning.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 474 [86 S.Ct. at 1627]. Through the exercise of his option to terminate questioning he can control the time at which questioning occurs, the subjects discussed, and the duration of the interrogation. The requirement that law enforcement authorities must respect a person\u2019s exercise of that option counteracts the coercive pressures of the custodial setting. We therefore conclude that the admissibility of statements obtained after the person in custody has decided to remain silent depends under <em>Miranda, </em>on whether his \u201cright to cut off questioning\u201d was \u201cscrupulously honored.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-5\"><em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 103-04, 96 S.Ct. 321 (footnote omitted). <em>Compare Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 484-85, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378 (1981) (holding \u201cthat when an accused has invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation, a valid waiver of that right cannot be established by showing only that he responded to further police-initiated custodial interrogation even if he has been advised of his rights.... [A]n accused, ... having expressed his desire to deal with the police only through counsel, is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Appellant maintains that <em>Mosley </em>is inapplicable here, because \u201cthe police did not \u2018scrupulously honor\u2019 appellant\u2019s invocation of her right to remain silent.\u201d She complains that Pat\u00f3n \u201ccontinued to question appellant even though she refused to waive her <em>Miranda </em>rights by remaining silent.\u201d Freeman asserts that the police may reinitiate questioning only if: \u201c(1) the police wait a significant period of time (per <em>Mosley, </em>at least two hours); (2) provide the suspect with a fresh set of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and obtain a second <em>Miranda </em>waiver; (3) restrict the second interrogation to crimes not discussed prior to the original invocation; and, (4) conduct the interrogation in a different location with different interrogating officers.\u201d Appellant adds: \u201c[A]lthough the interrogation was conducted by a different officer, approximately two hours <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>later, and upon warning appellant a second time of her <em>Miranda </em>rights \u2014 the interrogation was conducted in the same location and concerned the same subject matter.\u201d Further, she contends: \u201cEven if Sgt. Patton had scrupulously honored appellant\u2019s invocation of silence, Corporal Ruel did not comply with the holding of <em>Mosley </em>by conducting the interrogation in the same location and about the same subject matter.\u201d We disagree with appellant\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\"><em>Latimer v. State, </em>49 Md.App. 586, 433 A.2d 1234 (1981), establishes that, even if appellant\u2019s silence was an invocation, further questioning was not forever barred. After Latimer was arrested, the police advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>Id. </em>at 587, 433 A.2d 1234. Because Latimer declined to waive his rights, the police did not question him. <em>Id. </em>However, when the police later sought a -writing sample from Latimer, he was again advised of his rights on this occasion, he agreed to waive his rights and then gave a statement. <em>Id. </em>at 588, 433 A.2d 1234. Relying on <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>supra, 451 U.S. 477, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378, Latimer argued that his statement was inadmissible because he had initially availed himself of the right to remain silent, and he did not make an overture to police. <em>Id. </em>This Court opined that <em>Edwards </em>was \u201cconcerned specifically with a valid waiver of the right to counsel and does not encompass the specific request to remain silent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court said, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">[I]n the situation where the defendant has chosen to remain silent without more, he has not necessarily indicated a belief that he is unable to speak for himself and is in need of an attorney. Instead, he has chosen to remain silent for the present; that choice should not, in our opinion, destroy <em>all </em>lines of communication nor make a prelude by the defendant absolutely necessary before further questioning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Guided by <em>Michigan v. Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96, 96 S.Ct. 321, 46 L.Ed.2d 313, we noted that: \u201cthere was an interval of more than two hours\u201d before Latimer was questioned \u201cby another police officer at another location.\u201d <em>Latimer, </em>49 Md.App. at 589, 433 A.2d 1234. We said: \u201cAlthough the questioning that resulted apparently included the same subject matter as was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>attempted at the first interrogation, the initial purpose of the second inquiry was for the extraction of handwriting exemplars.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we recognized that <em>Miranda </em>\u201cdoes not create a <em>per se </em>proscription of all further interrogation\u201d after the suspect has invoked his right to silence. <em>Id. </em>at 590, 433 A.2d 1234.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The Court cited numerous cases for the proposition that, upon an invocation of the right to remain silent, police must cease their interrogation in order to \u201cnotify the defendant that all he needs to do to foreclose or halt questioning is to give a negative response when asked if he will submit thereto.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 591, 433 A.2d 1234. The Court explained, <em>id:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">In order to communicate this message it is imperative that the interrogation stop for some period of time. By this stoppage the defendant is made aware that he need answer no further questions either then or later unless he so desires. It seems then that the action that is condemned in <em>Miranda </em>is police refusal to take a defendant\u2019s \u201cno\u201d for an answer, that is, situations wherein the police continue to question and thereby harass and coerce the defendant so as to overcome his asseveration of his constitutional right to remain silent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The Court found no <em>Miranda, </em>violation, however. It reasoned: \u201c[W]e do not believe that the defendant\u2019s choice to remain silent for the present should destroy all lines of communication. Such a situation could lead only to a stalemate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\"><em>Manno v. State, </em>96 Md.App. 22, 623 A.2d 677, <em>cert. denied </em>332 Md. 454, 632 A.2d 151 (1993), also provides guidance. Upon arrest for murder, Manno \u201cwas advised of his rights but insisted that he \u2018did not want to talk about it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id </em>at 26, 623 A.2d 677. Later, at the police station, Manno agreed to make a statement. <em>Id </em>After Manno described his activity on the evening of the shooting, \u201cappellant remained silent until asked why he shot [the victim]\u201d, at which time he explained that he had gone to see his psychiatrist the morning after the shooting but never actually went inside. <em>Id,. </em>Manno complained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>his psychiatrist \u201cconsidered his mental condition to be a joke\u201d, and then \u201cdeclined to answer any more questions without the presence of an attorney.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The Court noted that in <em>Latimer </em>it had determined \u201cthat <em>Mosley </em>did not create a <em>per se </em>proscription of all further interrogation once the person being interrogated has invoked the desire to remain silent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 41, 623 A.2d 677. Moreover, it recognized that the <em>Mosley </em>Court \u201cdid not require that questioning cease and only resume when counsel is present once a person has expressed a desire to remain silent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 42, 623 A.2d 677. The <em>Manno </em>Court said, <em>id. </em>at 42-43, 623 A.2d 677:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">There was clearly evidence before the Circuit Court for Baltimore County that appellant did not indicate he wanted an attorney \u201cuntil after the interview.\u201d Under the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Mosley </em>and <em>Edwards </em>and our decision in <em>Latimer, </em>by no stretch can appellant\u2019s statement that \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it\u201d be interposed as a requirement that counsel be present before there could be any further interrogation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Here, Pat\u00f3n testified that, after appellant was non-responsive to his waiver inquiry, he secured her gun. Then, he asked appellant, \u201cwhat happened tonight, and her reply was I don\u2019t want to talk about it right now.\u201d At that point, Pat\u00f3n claimed he \u201cdidn\u2019t ask [appellant] anything else.\u201d Thus, appellant\u2019s assertion was \u201cscrupulously honored\u201d for almost three hours, until a different investigator, Ruel, sought to question appellant after again advising her of her <em>Miranda, </em>rights. At that time, Freeman agreed to waive her rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">In sum, appellant\u2019s statement, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it <em>right now,\u201d </em>did not \u201cdestroy <em>all </em>lines of communication nor make a prelude by the defendant absolutely necessary----\u201d <em>Latimer, </em>49 Md.App. at 588, 433 A.2d 1234. Consistent with <em>Mosley, </em>a reasonable period of time elapsed between appellant\u2019s invocation of her right to silence (Statement 4), and the interrogation conducted by Ruel. Although the locale and the topic were the same, the interrogator was different.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>It was not until Ruel asked appellant if she would write out her statement, or allow it to be recorded, that appellant invoked her right to counsel. By then, she had already given an oral statement. There is no contention that, once appellant invoked her right to counsel, that right was violated. Accordingly, the court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress on the basis of a <em>Miranda </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">B. Prompt Presentment</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Claiming a violation of the prompt presentment rule, appellant contends that the court erred in denying her suppression motion. As noted, appellant was arrested at around 8:00 p.m. on March 30, 2000, and was presented to the Commissioner about twelve hours later, at about 8 a.m. on March 31, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Appellant points out that, immediately after her arrest, when she indicated that she did not want to talk, Pat\u00f3n ceased his questioning. However, the interrogation resumed about three hours later. Freeman asserts: \u201cThere was no explanation ... for the delay [in presentment] between 8:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m., other than for the sole purpose of Corporal Ruel\u2019s interrogation.\u201d After Ruel\u2019s interview, an eight hour delay ensued, but appellant did not provide a statement during that period of time. Appellant states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">Such unnecessary delay, designed for the sole purpose of interrogation, is a critical factor in the voluntariness determination. There was no reason why appellant should not have been brought in front of a District Court Commissioner shortly after her arrest at 8:00 p.m.....The additional eight-hour delay between the time the second interrogation concluded and the time appellant was brought before the District Court Commissioner was explained as a delay for administrative purposes and the convenience of the Commissioner. Neither of these reasons, however, adequately explain the necessity for an eight-hour delay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">Relying on <em>Williams v. State, </em>375 Md. 404, 825 A.2d 1078 (2003); <em>Facon v. State, </em>375 Md. 435, 825 A.2d 1096 (2003); and <em>Hiligh v. State, </em>375 Md. 456, 825 A.2d 1108 (2003), all filed on the same date, appellant insists that \u201cfrjeversal in the instant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>case is mandated because the circuit court failed to apply the \u2018very heavy weight\u2019 standard to this factor during the suppression hearing when considering the admissibility of Statement No. 5,\u201d in which appellant admitted killing her boyfriend.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">At oral argument, appellant primarily focused on the three-hour period between her arrest at 8 p.m. and the beginning of her interrogation at 11 p.m. Appellant asserted that the police had \u201cenough\u201d to charge her by 11:00 p.m., and that the delay was \u201cfor the sole purpose\u201d of interrogating her. Moreover, she argued that there was no evidence to justify the State\u2019s three-hour delay, given that Ruel\u2019s explanation pertained only to the delay from midnight to 8:00 a.m.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And, because the trilogy constitutes a \u201cwatershed change\u201d in the law, appellant maintained that the court below did not apply the requisite \u201cheavy weight\u201d standard to the delay. According to appellant, any delay, however brief, is subject to the heavy weight standard if it was for the sole purpose of interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">In the question presented in her brief, appellant challenges only the denial of her motion to suppress. However, in the argument section of her brief, appellant also complains that \u201cthe trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury to apply \u2018very heavy weight\u2019 to this factor when considering the volun-tariness of the appellant\u2019s statements to Corporal Ruel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The State contends that, to the extent appellant\u2019s presentment argument \u201cturns on ... instruction to the jury regarding a \u2018very heavy weight\u2019 standard,\u201d it is not preserved because appellant did not except to the court\u2019s instructions on that ground. The State also argues that \u201c[t]he brief delay here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>was necessary to obtain Freeman\u2019s medication and food, and then to determine what, if any, charges should be brought against her. Freeman\u2019s announcement that she had just shot someone, even when taken with a report of a shooting, is not sufficient for charging.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">With respect to the jury instructions, appellant asked the court to propound Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction 3:18, concerning the factors pertinent to the issue of voluntariness of a statement. The court instructed largely in accordance with the pattern instruction. However, it omitted factor 8 of the pattern instruction, pertaining to \u201cwhether the defendant was taken before a district court commissioner without unnecessary delay following arrest and, if not, whether that affected the voluntariness of the statement.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel did not except to the omission, however. Rather, she objected only to the court\u2019s inclusion of language involving a defendant\u2019s mental deficiency, which was included pursuant to the State\u2019s request. And, in her closing argument, defense counsel challenged the voluntariness of appellant\u2019s statements, but she did not argue that Freeman\u2019s statements were involuntary because of a delay in presentment. Therefore, assuming that appellant has attempted in her brief to raise a challenge to the jury instruction, we agree with the State that it is not preserved. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 4-325(e); <em>Reynolds v. State </em>327 Md. 494, 502, 610 A.2d 782 (1992), <em>cert. </em>denied, 506 U.S. 1054, 113 S.Ct. 981, 122 L.Ed.2d 134 (1993) (cautioning defense counsel to \u201cbe precise when they craft [suppression] motions---- It is an attorney\u2019s obligation to present with clarity all issues that must be resolved by a trial judge----\u201d); <em>Southern v. State, </em>140 Md.App. 495, 505, 780 A.2d 1228 (2001) (noting that \u201cfailure to raise a suppression issue before the hearing court amounts to a waiver\u201d; \u201cmotion to suppress must be presented with particularity in order to preserve an objection.\u201d), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>371 Md. 93, 807 A.2d 13 (2002); <em>Russell v.

Therefore, we shall address appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>lant\u2019s prompt presentment contention solely in the context of the suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">We begin our analysis with a review of Maryland Rule 4-212(1). It states, in part: \u201cWhen a defendant is arrested without a warrant, the defendant shall be taken before a judicial officer of the District Court without unnecessary delay and in no event later than 24 hours after arrest.\u201d The rule \u201creduces the l'isk that a confession will be coerced during a custodial interrogation conducted before the accused is advised of his rights by a district court commissioner.\u201d <em>Faulkner v. State, </em>156 Md.App. 615, 651, 847 A.2d 1216 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Maryland Code (2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-912 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d), is also pertinent. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">\u00a7 10-912. Failure to take defendant before judicial officer after arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">(a) <em>Confession not rendered inadmissible. </em>\u2014 A confession may not be excluded from evidence solely because the defendant was not taken before a judicial officer after arrest within any time period specified by Title 4 of the Maryland Rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">(b) <em>Effect of failure to comply strictly with Title f of the Maryland Rules. </em>\u2014 Failure to strictly comply with the provisions of Title 4 of the Maryland Rules pertaining to taking a defendant before a judicial officer after arrest is only one factor, among others, to be considered by the court in deciding the voluntariness and admissibility of a confession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">On June 18, 2003, the Court of Appeals decided three cases involving delay in presentment as a factor in the analysis of the voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s confession: <em>Williams, </em>375 Md. 404, 825 A.2d 1078; <em>Facon, </em>375 Md. 435, 825 A.2d 1096; and <em>Hiligh, </em>375 Md. 456, 825 A.2d 1108. Although the case <em>sub judice </em>was tried before those cases were decided, the holdings in those cases \u201cappl[y] to cases tried before the decisions were rendered.\u201d <em>Odum v. State, </em>156 Md.App. 184, 194, 846 A.2d 445 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>\u201c[T]he purpose of prompt presentment is to provide a defendant with a full panoply of safeguards.\u201d <em>Facon, </em>375 Md. at 447, 825 A.2d 1096. \u201cPresentment ... serves four vital functions.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>375 Md. at 418, 825 A.2d 1078. These include, <em>id.,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\">the determination of whether sufficient probable cause exists for continued detention; determination of eligibility for pre-trial release; informing the accused of the charges against him, his right to counsel, and, if indigent, his right to appointed counsel; and, if the charge is beyond the jurisdiction of the District Court, his right to a preliminary hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">To be sure, \u201c[m]any factors can bear on the voluntariness of a confession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429, 825 A.2d 1078. The <em>Williams </em>Court addressed \u201cthe deliberate and unnecessary violation of an accused\u2019s right to prompt presentment\u201d as one of the factors \u201cthat may not be coercive as a matter of law but that need to be given special weight whenever they exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430, 825 A.2d 1078. <em>See Hof v. State, </em>337 Md. 581, 596-97, 655 A.2d 370 (1995)(noting that delay in presentment is one of the factors relevant to voluntariness). The <em>Williams </em>Court reasoned that prompt presentment is \u201ca right designed to provide the defendant with a clear explanation of more basic Constitutional and statutory rights\u201d, 375 Md. at 430, 825 A.2d 1078, and a violation of that right \u201cmust be given special weight in determining voluntariness----\u201d <em>Id. </em>This is because \u201cwhen the right it is designed to protect is transgressed, there may be no practical way of calculating the actual effect of the transgression.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\"><em>Williams </em>involved a delay in presentment of 47 hours. The defendant was arrested at 4:10 a.m. on July 30, 2000, as a robbery suspect. Following his arrest, Williams was treated at a hospital for injuries. He was interviewed upon his return to the station, beginning at 9:25 a.m. By 12:42 p.m., Williams had confessed to two robberies. During the questioning, the police discovered that Williams was also named in three homicide warrants; a homicide detective began questioning Williams at 1:23 p.m. on July 30, 2000. Williams was finally presented to the Commissioner at 3:07 a.m. on August 1, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>The Court recognized that, within about four hours after his interrogation began (i.e., more than eight hours after his arrest), the police \u201chad all of the basic information they needed to present [Williams] to a Commissioner\u201d on the two robbery charges. <em>Id. </em>at 423, 825 A.2d 1078. It observed, <em>id. </em>at 424, 825 A.2d 1078:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">There were no apparent administrative functions to be performed that required further questioning, and, to the extent there were any, it does not appear that the ensuing questioning was for that purpose. The homicides had been committed on July 21-nine days earlier. Petitioner had already been charged in at least one of them. There was no concern about possible harm to other people or property, and it does not appear that the police were focusing on the identity or location of other persons. Petitioner was not questioned about an accomplice until sometime after 10:21 a.m. on July 31, some 21 hours after the homicide interrogations began.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">In the Court\u2019s view, \u201c[t]he sole, unadulterated purpose of the subsequent interrogation was to obtain incriminating statements[.]\u201d Id. It held that such a purpose was \u201cnot a proper basis upon which to delay presentment.\u201d Id. at 424, 825 A.2d 1078. With regard to the effect on voluntariness of a delay that has as its sole purpose an interrogation seeking incriminating statements, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">[I]f the police ... deliberately delay presentment in order to conduct a custodial interrogation, any resulting confession must be regarded as laden with suspicion. <em>The violation of the Rule in such a circumstance will have to be given very heavy weight, by both the suppression court and by the trier of fact, in determining the overall voluntariness of the confession. </em>Obviously, the longer any unlawful delay, the greater is the weight that must be given to the prospect of coercion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 433, 825 A.2d 1078 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Articulating a \u201cheavy weight standard,\u201d the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>We shall conclude that, while the statute makes a delay in presentment only one factor in determining voluntariness and admissibility, not all factors that may weigh on volun-tariness are necessarily equal in import, and that, when the delay is not only violative of the Rule but deliberate and designed for the sole purpose of soliciting a confession, it must be given <em>very heavy weight. </em>There is no indication that, with respect to the statements regarding the three murders, the trial court gave the continued delay such weight. When we do so, it becomes clear that those latter statements were involuntary and therefore inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjU\"><em>Id. </em>at 416, 825 A.2d 1078 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Accordingly, the Court concluded that the robbery confessions were both voluntary and admissible, but that the statements as to the murders were neither voluntary nor admissible. It said, <em>id. </em>at 434, 825 A.2d 1078:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">We hold that any deliberate and unnecessary delay in presenting an accused before a District Court Commissioner, in violation of Rule 4-212(e) or (f) must be given very heavy weight in determining whether a resulting confession is voluntary, because that violation creates its own aura of suspicion. The violation does not, of itself, make the confession involuntary or inadmissible. It remains a factor to be considered, along with any others that may be relevant, but it must be given very heavy weight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Nevertheless, <em>Williams </em>recognized that some delay is reasonable, if not inevitable. As to the interrogation for the robberies, the Court pointed out that Williams \u201cwas not effectively available for questioning\u201d until after he was treated at the hospital. <em>Id. </em>at 423, 825 A.2d 1078. Moreover, the Court said that, upon William\u2019s return to the station, \u201c[i]t was entirely appropriate at that point for the police to engage in preliminary questioning\u201d for the purpose of obtaining \u201csome basic information about their suspect and even about his involvement in the two robberies, so that he could be properly identified and charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Noting that questioning began within ten minutes and \u201cpromptly produced oral confessions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>the two robberies\u201d, <em>id., </em>the Court also said that \u201c[i]t was not then inappropriate for the police to seek a written statement, to confirm the oral admissions, which they also did promptly.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">In <em>Hiligh, </em>375 Md. 456, 825 A.2d 1108, the Court granted post-conviction relief based on ineffective assistance of trial counsel. At trial, the defense attorney failed to challenge a delay of almost 24 hours in presentment, which called into question the voluntariness of Hiligh\u2019s robbery confession. Referring to its decision in <em>Williams, </em>the <em>Hiligh </em>Court reiterated that, \u201cwhen a delay in presentment was not only unnecessary but deliberate and for the sole purpose of extracting incriminating statements, it must be given special weight by a suppression court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 472, 825 A.2d 1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The Court noted that the defendant was taken to the police station at 10:58 p.m. on March 20, 1995, and \u201c[a]t 10:30 p.m., 23 hours and 32 minutes after he was first brought to the station, petitioner was taken before a District Court Commissioner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461-62, 825 A.2d 1108. Yet, \u201cthe police had all of the information and had completed all of the administrative paperwork necessary to present [Hiligh] to a District Court Commissioner by 3:30 a.m. on March 21, at the latest,. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473, 825 A.2d 1108. Therefore, the Court determined that \u201c[a]ll delay after that point, as a matter of both law and fact, was unnecessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It reasoned that, had the defense attorney asked, the suppression court would have been required \u201cto give that delay very heavy weight and examine whether the State had shouldered its heavy burden of proving that the confession was not induced by that coercion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474, 825 A.2d 1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Further, the <em>Hiligh </em>Court stated, <em>id. </em>at 474-75, 825 A.2d 1108 (footnote omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">On this record ... there is, indeed, a substantial possibility that the court, in ruling on the suppression motion, would have found the confession involuntary and ruled it inadmissible. Even if the judge had allowed the confession into evidence, he would, under <em>Williams, </em>have been required, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>request, to instruct the jury on the heavy weight to be accorded any deliberate and unnecessary delay. Furthermore, had counsel argued that point to the jury, there is the same substantial possibility that the jury would have found the confession involuntary and, in accordance with the judge\u2019s other instructions, disregarded it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\"><em>Facon, </em>375 Md. 435, 825 A.2d 1096, is the remaining case in the trilogy. In that case, measured from the time when the accused was brought from Washington, D.C. to Maryland, there was a twelve hour delay in his presentment to a Commissioner. The Court found that \u201c[t]he delay was solely for the purpose of interrogation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 453, 825 A.2d 1096, and therefore the defendant was entitled to have the suppression court \u201caccord such violation very heavy weight in considering whether [defendant\u2019s] confession was voluntary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454, 825 A.2d 1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Relying on its decision in <em>Williams, </em>the <em>Facon </em>Court determined that the prompt presentment rule had been violated, even though presentment occurred within 24 hours of the defendant\u2019s arrival in Maryland. <em>Facon, </em>375 Md. at 453, 825 A.2d 1096. As the motion court had considered only the time that the defendant spent with the interrogating officer, rather than the total time spent in custody in Maryland, the Court reversed the judgment of conviction and remanded for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 454, 825 A.2d 1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Several recent decisions of this Court have addressed the trilogy discussed above. We turn to explore these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">In <em>Perez v. State, </em>155 Md.App. 1, 841 A.2d 372 (2004), Perez was convicted of two counts of felony murder and related charges. On appeal, he claimed, <em>inter </em>alia, that his statements to the police should have been suppressed because of a delay of 48 hours in his presentment to a Commissioner. <em>Id. </em>at 15, 841 A.2d 372. This Court, sitting <em>en banc, id. </em>at 19, 841 A.2d 372, vacated Perez\u2019s convictions and remanded for further proceedings, to allow the trial court to ascertain the proper standard in regard to its voluntariness determination. <em>Id. </em>at 31, 841 A.2d 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Perez signed several <em>Miranda </em>waivers during the period in issue. And, on two occasions, he executed a prompt presentment waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10, 841 A.2d 372. The detectives asked Perez a series of questions and he responded, in part, that he \u201cvoluntarily agreed to remain at the station for additional questioning....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10, 841 A.2d 372. Following an evidentiary hearing, the circuit court denied Perez\u2019s motion to suppress his statements. <em>Id. </em>at 13, 841 A.2d 372. On appeal, we noted that the suppression court did not make any factual findings required for meaningful appellate review. <em>Id. </em>at 26, 841 A.2d 372. Furthermore, because neither <em>Williams, Hiligh, </em>nor <em>Facon </em>had been decided at the time of the suppression hearing, <em>id. at </em>27, 841 A.2d 372, we were of the view that a new suppression hearing was required, so that the suppression court, as part of its totality of the circumstances analysis with respect to voluntariness, could determine whether the heavy weight standard applied \u201cas a matter of law as well as fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28, 841 A.2d 372. Accordingly, the <em>Perez </em>Court concluded, <em>id. </em>at 31, 841 A.2d 372:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\">[A] delay in presentment, even of the type that meets the heavy weight standard, cannot be the sole reason for finding involuntariness. Additionally, it is worth repeating that the ultimate issue is voluntariness. Voluntariness is determined by the totality of the circumstances and compliance with the presentment rule is one factor. Since <em>Williams, </em>if it is determined that one of the factors is deliberate noncompliance with the prompt presentment requirement for the sole purpose of obtaining a confession, that factor is to be given very heavy weight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-6\"><em>Odum, </em>156 Md.App. 184, 846 A.2d 445, followed <em>Perez. </em>There, the defendant was convicted of kidnapping. <em>Id. </em>at 188, 846 A.2d 445. On appeal, he challenged, <em>inter alia, </em>the trial court\u2019s refusal to suppress his statements to police as involuntary, <em>id. </em>at 191, 846 A.2d 445, because of a delay of about thirty hours in his presentment to the Commissioner. <em>Id. </em>at 203, 846 A.2d 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">At 11:00 a.m. on June 26, 2001, Odum was arrested and taken to the police station, where \u201c[a] Commissioner is avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>able ... twenty-four hours a day.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 195, 846 A.2d 445. \u201cOdum was placed in an interview room at 11:30 a.m.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He was given food, beverages, and cigarettes, and was permitted to use the bathroom. <em>Id. </em>Odum was left alone in the room until 5:40 p.m., when a corporal entered and took several photos of him. <em>Id. </em>At 6:52 p.m. Odum was advised of and waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>Id. </em>Then, he was left alone in the interview room from 9:10 p.m. on June 26, 2001, until 1:00 a.m. on June 27, 2001. <em>Id. </em>at 196, 846 A.2d 445. At that time, a homicide detective entered the room. <em>Id. </em>Odum signed a second waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights at about 2:00 a.m. <em>Id. </em>Between 2:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m., Odum completed a written statement. <em>Id. </em>At 1:56 p.m., Odum \u201cwas taken to a holding cell near the Commissioner\u2019s hearing room.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>At 3:00 p.m. on June 27, while in the holding cell, Odum was served with a statement of charges. <em>Id. </em>He was then taken before the Commissioner at 6:12 p.m. <em>Id. </em>at 197, 846 A.2d 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">This Court observed: \u201cIn rejecting [Odum\u2019s] motion to suppress, the circuit court\u2019s ruling from the bench does not reflect consideration of whether any special weight should be given to any part of the delay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193-94, 846 A.2d 445 (footnote omitted). Accordingly, we held: \u201c|\u2019B]ecause of the absence of specific factual findings necessary to determine the weight to be afforded the delay in presenting Odum before a Commissioner in the voluntariness analysis, we vacate and remand for a new suppression hearing and a new trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188, 846 A.2d 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Writing for this Court, Judge Rodowsky elucidated several \u201cgeneral concepts\u201d from the trilogy. He wrote, <em>id. </em>at 202-03, 846 A.2d 445:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">First, because the concern is with delay in presentment that affects the voluntariness of a statement given during custodial interrogation, a delay that can have no effect on the voluntariness of a statement is immaterial to suppression ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">Second, some delays are necessary. These present no violation of Rule 4-212(e) or (f) and do not weigh in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>degree against voluntariness in the suppression court\u2019s evaluation process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">Third, there may be delays which are unnecessary, and thereby violative of Rule 4-212(e) and (f), but which are not for the sole purpose of custodial interrogation. These delays must be weighed against voluntariness, but they do not require \u201cvery heavy\u201d weight against voluntariness in that evaluation. Our analysis in the instant matter calls these delays \u201cClass I.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">Fourth, there are unnecessary delays, violative of Rule 4-212(e) and (f), which are deliberately for the sole purpose of custodial interrogation. Our analysis refers to this type of unnecessary delay as \u201cClass II.\u201d A suppression court is required to weigh a Class II delay \u201cvery heavily\u201d against voluntariness in its evaluation of a resulting statement\u2019s admissibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">Fifth, although subjecting the arrestee to actual interrogation is the best evidence that that part of a delay in presentment is for the sole purpose of custodial interrogation, a delay, depending on the facts, may be for the sole purpose of custodial interrogation, although unaccompanied by actual interrogation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-8\"><em>Faulkner v. State, supra, </em>156 Md.App. 615, 847 A.2d 1216, is also useful. There, we considered the defendant\u2019s complaint with respect to a delay in presentment of seven and a half hours, when the questioning concluded three and a half hours after the initial <em>Miranda </em>advisement. <em>Id. </em>at 650, 653, 847 A.2d 1216. Writing for this Court, Judge Adkins said: \u201c[W]e do not read [the trilogy] as a blanket instruction to grant new trials whenever the police interview a suspect before presentment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652, 847 A.2d 1216. <em>Faulkner </em>made clear \u201cthat some reasonable and necessary delay\u201d may occur because of \u201cpolice questioning designed to determine whether to charge the suspect, and for what crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Faulkner </em>Court also recognized that a delay in presentment may be necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>\u201cin order to question the suspect ... [when] the police have received information suggesting that there may have been a self defense justification for the shooting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653, 847 A.2d 1216.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">The Court concluded that \u201cthe detectives were entitled to question Faulkner about his involvement in the crime for which he had been arrested, in an effort to determine whether he had information bearing on their decision to charge him.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 654, 847 A.2d 1216. Moreover, we pointed out that \u201cmuch of the total time between arrest and presentment was consumed by legitimate investigative and administrative tasks\u201d that have been \u201cexplicitly approved as \u2018necessary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Williams, </em>375 Md. at 423, 825 A.2d 1078; <em>Hof, </em>337 Md. at 596-97, 655 A.2d 370). We stated, <em>id. </em>at 654, 655 A.2d 370:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">The interval between Faulkner\u2019s arrest and his presentment reflected reasonable and necessary delay for further investigation (via the search of Faulkner\u2019s home and questioning him) regarding his involvement and degree of culpability, before charging papers were drawn up, as well as reasonable and necessary delay for administrative procedures <em>(i.e., </em>\u201cprocessing\u201d and preparing the charging papers). We hold that the delay in presentment concerns addressed in <em>Williams </em>do not warrant a new trial in Faulkner\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\"><em>Perez, Odum, </em>and <em>Faulkner </em>recognize that the trilogy does not stand for the proposition that all delay is prohibited. To the contrary, \u201csome delays are necessary\u201d, and \u201c[t]hese present no violation of Rule 4-212 ... and do not weigh in any degree against voluntariness.... \u201d <em>Odum, </em>156 Md.App. at 202, 846 A.2d 445. Indeed, acknowledging that some delay is unavoidable, the <em>Williams </em>Court illustrated that point with the following examples:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">\u201c(1) to carry out reasonable routine administrative procedures such as recording, fingerprinting and photographing; (2) to determine whether a charging document should be issued accusing the arrestee of a crime; (3) to verify the commission of the crimes specified in the charging docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>ment; (4) to obtain information likely to be a significant aid in averting harm to persons or loss to property of substantial value; (5) to obtain relevant nontestimonial information likely to be significant in discovering the identity or location of other persons who may be associated with the arrestee in the commission of the offense for which he was apprehended, or in preventing the loss, alteration or destruction of evidence relating to such crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">375 Md. at 420, 825 A.2d 1078 (quoting <em>Johnson v. State, </em>282 Md. 314, 329, 384 A.2d 709 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">As appellant seems to concede, the period between the end of the interrogation at midnight and her presentation before the Commissioner at 8:00 a.m. is not relevant, even if the delay was unnecessary or deliberate, because appellant did not make any statements during this time period. Even if a delay is unnecessary and violative of Rule 4-212, it does not receive \u201cvery heavy weight\u201d in the analysis of voluntariness, unless the delay was \u201cdeliberately for the sole purpose of custodial interrogation.\u201d <em>Odium, </em>156 Md.App. at 203, 846 A.2d 445. And, as <em>Odum </em>underscores, a deliberate delay is irrelevant with regard to voluntariness if the statement in issue was made before the period of delay. <em>Id. </em>at 202, 208, 846 A.2d 445. Therefore, appellant is left to focus on the three-hour delay, from the time of her arrest at about 8:00 p.m. until Ruel\u2019s interrogation began at about 11:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">When appellant entered the barracks at about 8:00 p.m., she announced that she had just shot someone and that she had the gun in her purse. Appellant\u2019s admission that she shot someone was not enough, by itself, to warrant bringing charges against appellant. Pat\u00f3n did not know who appellant had shot; the status of the victim; whether appellant was telling the truth; whether she was under the influence of any substance; whether appellant suffered from a psychiatric condition; or whether she had acted in self-defense. Clearly, it was incumbent on the police to conduct at least a preliminary investigation, process appellant, and complete essential paperwork and other administrative duties. Moreover, during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>initial three hour period, the police learned that appellant needed her blood pressure medication, and went to her home to retrieve it. The police also obtained food for appellant from a fast food restaurant. Significantly, there was no evidence presented at the hearing suggestive of a deliberate delay in presentment for the sole purpose of obtaining a statement from appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">At about 10:55 p,m., some three hours after Freeman\u2019s arrest, Ruel advised appellant of her <em>Miranda </em>rights and then questioned her about the incident. Although the interrogation concluded at around midnight, appellant was not brought to the Commissioner until 8:00 a.m. the next day. Explaining the reasons for that delay, Ruel stated: \u201cBasically for the completion of paperwork, the processing of the actual fingerprint, photograph, and also the Commissioner wasn\u2019t coming in until the following morning.\u201d However, contrary to appellant\u2019s suggestion, Ruel did not indicate that his explanation pertained only to the period from midnight to 8:00 a.m. Thus, the record does not support appellant\u2019s claim that there was no explanation for the three-hour delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">In any event, if the police had not completed the paperwork and processing of appellant until after midnight, as appellant suggests, that argument does not help appellant. If the police were not finished with their administrative duties by midnight, then they obviously were not finished with them during the three hour period in issue, from 8:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Accordingly, we discern no error in the court\u2019s finding that, \u201cunder the totality of the circumstances,\u201d there was no reason to suppress the evidence based on a delay in presentment. Although the court did not use the words \u201cheavy weight\u201d in its analysis (because the trilogy had not yet been decided), it would have no reason to do so, because there was no evidence that the delay was deliberately occasioned for the sole purpose of seeking to interrogate appellant. <em>Odum,, </em>156 Md.App. at 202-03, 846 A.2d 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CALVERT COUNTY AFFIRMED.

In a footnote in its brief, the State points out that, \u201capart from her suppression claim,\u201d appellant does not contest \u201cthe circumstances of the <em>Miranda </em>advisement.\u201d Nor does she argue that \u201cher assertion of her right should not have been placed before the jury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b442-10\">. The State has not cited any case that supports its contention that we should analyze the silence and statement four together, as if they were one response.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b445-9\">. Appellant cites <em>United States v. Montana, </em>958 F.2d 516 (2nd Cir.1992), but it was decided prior to <em>Davis. </em>She also cites <em>State v. Chew, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>150 N.J. 30, 695 A.2d 1301 (1997), which involved an ambiguous invocation of the right to counsel, not the right to silence. The Supreme Court of New Jersey acknowledged that, \"in some circumstances,\u201d New Jersey law \"affords greater protection of the right against self-incrimination than does federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1316. Therefore, it considered \"it prudent to continue to apply\u201d its \"precedent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1318.</p>\n<p id=\"Atu\">Similarly, in <em>State v.

Nor does the decision of the West Virginia court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Farley, </em>192 W.Va. 247, 452 S.E.2d 50 (1994), support appellant's position. The West Virginia court said, <em>id. </em>at 59 (citations omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac8\">We believe that under <em>Davis </em>insubstantial and trivial doubt, reasonably caused by the defendant's ambiguous statements as to whether he wants the interrogation to end, should be resolved in favor of the police and that under these circumstances further interrogation by the police does not offend the West Virginia Constitution..., [W]e hold that to assert the <em>Miranda </em>right to terminate police interrogation, the words or conduct must be explicitly clear that the suspect wishes to terminate all questioning and not merely a desire not to comment on or answer a particular question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"amx-dedup-0\">We also regard <em>State v. Strayhand, </em>184 Ariz. 571, 911 P.2d 577 (App.Div.1995), as factually inapposite. There, the court found that the police ignored the defendant's repeated invocation of his right to silence during interrogation. It then assumed, <em>arguendo, </em>that the invocation was ambiguous, and declined to apply <em>Davis. Id. </em>at 592. The court concluded that, under Arizona law, any interrogation had to \" 'be for the sole purpose\u2019 \u201d of clarification of the defendant\u2019s ambiguous assertion. <em>Id. </em>(Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"Aq-\">Finally, appellant cites <em>State v.

I also have no quarrel with any of the specific statements made with respect to the alleged violation of the prompt presentment rule and the impact that such a violation might, under currently prevailing law, have on traditional common law voluntariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">I write separately only to express my chagrin at what I believe to be a totally unnecessary \u201cspinning of wheels\u201d by both appellate courts over the course of the last fourteen months over an issue that seems to me to be meaningless. Both courts seem to be obsessed (one proactively and the other responsively) with whether a suppression hearing judge, in weighing the totality of factors that go into the ultimate determination of voluntariness, has given sufficiently \u201cheavy weight\u201d to a violation of the prompt presentment rule, if such should be found to have occurred (that finding, of course, being subject to the clearly erroneous standard of appellate review). I am dumbfounded as to why an appellate court should care what weight a suppression hearing judge gave to any factor, because the appellate court is enjoined to weigh the factors for itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">I begin with the analysis of Judge Harrell for the Court of Appeals in <em>Winder v. State, </em>362 Md. 275, 765 A.2d 97 (2001), an opinion that has deservedly become the primer for the standards and the procedures for handling challenges to the voluntariness of confessions in Maryland. As to the proper standard of appellate review of a trial judge\u2019s determination that a confession was voluntary, the Court of Appeals, through Judge Harrell, stated unequivocally:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-9\">The trial court\u2019s determination regarding whether a confession was made voluntarily is a mixed question of law and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>fact. As such, <em>we undertake a de novo review of the trial \u25a0judge\u2019s ultimate determination on the issue of voluntariness.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">362 Md. at 310-11, 765 A.2d 97 (emphasis supplied). See also <em>Gilliam v. State, </em>320 Md. 637, 647, 579 A.2d 744 (1990); <em>Lodowski v. State, </em>307 Md. 233, 255-56, 513 A.2d 299 (1986); <em>Perez v.

State, </em>152 Md.App. 548, 579-80, 832 A.2d 869 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">On the ultimate issue of voluntariness, the appellate court, taking as a given those iirst-level findings of fact that are not clearly erroneous and, in resolving ambiguities, taking that version of the evidence most favorable to the prevailing party, writes on a clean slate with respect to its <em>de novo </em>weighing. On that issue, it is not marking the paper of the suppression hearing judge, but is making its own independent decision on the basis of the factors that have been factually established.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Even if the suppression hearing judge weighed the factors with impeccable correctness, he is not home free. The independent <em>de novo </em>determination of the appellate court might still go in the opposite direction. Even if the suppression hearing judge, on the other hand, weighed the factors with flagrant disregard of <em>Williams-Hiligh-Facou, </em>a reversal or a remand does not necessarily follow. The independent <em>de novo </em>determination of the appellate court, presumably adhering faithfully to <em>Williams-Hiligh-Facon, </em>might nonetheless make the same determination. Whatever the suppression hearing judge does in the weighing process, rightly or wrongly, will not therefore be dispositive of the final outcome, if the appellate court is truly going to make its own independent <em>de novo </em>determination. The suppression hearing judge, right or wrong, has been by-passed. If that be true, it makes no difference whether, in some other world without <em>de novo </em>review, he might have been right or wrong. The appellate <em>de novo </em>determination has superseded his decision and thereby made his weighing of the factors irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">In this case, of course, there was no violation of the prompt presentment rule and there was no occasion for anyone to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>it any weight, great or small. I find it mind-boggling, nonetheless, that whenever the names <em>Williams-Hiligh-Facon </em>are even whispered, bench and bar lock into the mind set of the Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s New Clothes.\u201d Everyone stands at curbside, cheering lustily as the <em>Williams-Hiligh-Facon </em>troika prances imperially down the street, and no one dares to speak the self-evident truth, \u201cThe Emperor has no clothes.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
