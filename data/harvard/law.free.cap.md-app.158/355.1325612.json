Derek T. Harvey, appellant, was obligated to pay child support for his four children, as a result of 1986 and 1989 consent paternity decrees that included support awards, and other child support enforcement efforts undertaken by the Baltimore City Office of Child Support Enforcement (BCOCSE) and the Maryland Child Support Enforcement Administration (Administration), appel-lees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Harvey accrued the child support arrearage<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> while his children were in the care of their respective mothers.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Harvey reunited with his children in 1996, and secured a court order transferring custody of them, with an effective date of October 1, 1996. Because child support enforcement actions brought by BCOCSE included arrears that accrued before 1996, Harvey filed a Motion to Set Aside Child Support (Motion) in 2002, naming the BCOCSE and the Administration as third-party defendants. After a hearing on the Motion and opposition by appellees, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order denying the Motion. Harvey filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">He presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">I. Did the trial court err in concluding it does not have discretion to set aside Harvey\u2019s child support arrear-age, pursuant to Md.Code (1974, 1999 RepLVol., 2003 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Cum.Supp.), section 5-1038(b) of the Family Law Article (FL)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-4\">II. Did the trial court err in failing to apply the best interest of the child standard in determining whether Harvey\u2019s child support arrearage should be set aside pursuant to FL section 5-1038(b)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">III. Did the \u201cAdministration\u201d and BCOCSE fail to properly exercise their discretion to forgive State-owed child support arrearage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">IV. Did the Administration fail to properly develop criteria, procedures and regulations to carry out its authority to forgive Harvey\u2019s State-owed child support arrearages pursuant to FL section 10-112?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Answering no to the first three questions, and declining to reach the fourth, we affirm the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Harvey\u2019s three younger children-Dereka, Robin, and Derek, Jr.-came to live with Harvey in the fall of 1996, when their mother was no longer able to care for them. Later that same year, Harvey\u2019s eldest daughter, Keawoni, came to live with him because her mother died. Eventually, Harvey also provided a home for Kelly Williams, Keawoni\u2019s half sister, due to the death of her mother and the inability of her grandparents to care for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">Shortly after they arrived, Harvey notified BCOCSE in person that his children were now in his custody. Harvey asked the agency to stop collecting child support and to forgive the arrearage.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">Despite additional appearances at the BCOCSE office, at which Harvey allegedly requested modification of the child support order and the arrearage account, and received assurances \u201con several occasions that the situation would be resolved,\u201d BCOCSE continued to charge Harvey for current support and to demand payment of the mounting arrears. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>BCOCSE reported the arrearage to credit reporting agencies and intercepted Harvey\u2019s tax refunds.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">In the spring of 2001, Harvey, with the help of counsel from the Legal Aid Bureau, was able to have the current support obligations diverted to pay down the arrearage. Harvey\u2019s subsequent requests to BCOCSE to forgive the arrearage were unsuccessful. Harvey then turned to the Administration itself for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">In a June 2, 2001 letter, Harvey\u2019s counsel advised the Administration that Harvey\u2019s arrearage totaled approximately $32,000 in the two cases, with all but $1,600 owed to the State. Counsel asserted that $57 was being taken from Harvey\u2019s weekly wages under an earnings withholding order (EWO), and that this money would be better spent to support the five children who were living with Harvey.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Administration Executive Director Teresa Kaiser responded by letter dated July 6, 2001. She advised that the Administration would consider Harvey\u2019s request to abate the state-owed arrears upon receipt of additional information and court orders establishing Harvey\u2019s custody, including the length each child had resided in the Harvey household. Harvey supplied the requested information and obtained a November 20 custody order for his four children, retroactive to October 1, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The Administration then audited Harvey\u2019s account. It adjusted the account as a result of the custody order to reflect only the $5,421.26 in arrearage that existed before October 1, 1996, the date on which Harvey assumed custody. After reviewing the case, Kaiser was persuaded by Harvey\u2019s argument that his duties as custodial parent warranted \u201carrearage abatement ... so that he could focus on supporting his family.\u201d In a March 6, 2002 memorandum, she proposed to Dwayne Brown, BCOCSE Project Director, that the following actions be taken in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">1. Collect $1.00 per year on the arrears of $5,421.26;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-9\">2. Suspend the interception of State and Federal Income Taxes and other enforcement measures except for the Maryland Lottery until:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>(a) all the children are emancipated;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">(b) the non-custodial parent begins to pay child support; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">(c) the arrears are paid completely by interceptions received through the Maryland Lottery Office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">3. Enter a narrative into the Case Action Logs stating why enforcement in this case was suspended; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">4. Refund State and Federal Taxes that were intercepted. Kaiser asked Brown to \u201ccontact me to confirm these arrangements or to discuss other satisfactory arrangements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">B.COCSE, however, rejected the Administration proposal. Brown explained what happened:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-10\">Once this memorandum was done, ... my supervisor, Mr. Drummond discussed this at one. of our bi-weekly meetings, basically stating that we didn\u2019t agree with this proposal because ... our computer systems are not set up to read anything like this, which means that if you have $5,000.00 on the system, we don\u2019t really have much of a way to monitor these cases to make sure his taxes are intercepted or not you know turned into the credit agency. We have a lot of automated systems that are in place[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">The Administration took no further action.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">Harvey remarried in 2002, adding his wife and her son to his household. He earns $10.96 per hour as a landscaper for the City of Baltimore. He reports that he has not been able to buy a house because he cannot obtain financing as a result of the continued reporting of the arrearage to credit agencies. In addition, he asserts that \u201c[t]he continued child support collection is harming [his] ability to pay and save for college expenses.\u201d He has one daughter in college and the rest \u201chope to go\u201d someday. Harvey moved to set aside the arrearage on May 18, 2002, arguing that Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2003 Cum.Supp.), section 5-1038(b) of the Family Law Code (FL) gives the court discretionary authority to modify or set aside child support arrears when doing so is in the best interest of the children or when special circumstances exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The Trial Court Did Not Err In Declining To Abate Or Modify Harvey\u2019s Support Payments Retroactively To A Date Prior To Harvey\u2019s Motion To Set Aside Child Support</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The Court Had No Discretion To Retroactively Extinguish The Order</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Harvey argues that trial court \u201cerred in concluding it did not have discretion to set aside Harvey\u2019s child support orders pursuant to FL section 5-1038(b).\u201d This section, part of the Paternity Proceedings Subtitle, is titled \u201cFinality of orders; alteration\u201d and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-9\">Except for a declaration of paternity, the court may modify or set aside any order or part of an order under this subtitle as the court considers just and proper in light of the circumstances and in the best interests of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">The Administration and BCOCSE respond that the circuit court was correct in holding that it did not have authority to modify a child support order relating to a period before the filing of the motion to modify, because it is explicitly prohibited from doing so by FL section 12-104. This section, which applies to all child support actions, including paternity cases, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-11\">(a) <em>Prerequisites. </em>\u2014 The court may modify a child support award subsequent to the filing of a motion for modification and upon a showing of a material change of circumstance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-12\">(b) <em>Retroactivity of modification. </em>\u2014 The court may not retroactively modify a child support award prior to the date of the filing of the motion for modification. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">We hold that the trial court did not err, because we agree with appellees that FL section 12-104, limiting the time when a court can modify a support order, prohibited retroactive modification to an effective date preceding Harvey\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>We reach this conclusion by applying traditional rules of statutory construction, including consideration of legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Judge Hollander recently summarized these rules:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">The seminal tenet of statutory construction compels us to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent.... The statutory text is our starting point. Generally, we give the words of the statute their \u201cordinary and common meaning within the context in which they are used.\u201d ... To achieve that objective, we must incorporate \u201cthe overall purpose of the statute into its interpretation.\u201d When the statutory language is \u201cclear on its face and in its context, then we do not ordinarily need to turn to the Legislative history.\u201d In contrast, when the statute is ambiguous, we ordinarily consider the language \u201cin light of the ... objectives and purpose of the enactment.\u201d In this regard, \u201cwe may ... consider the particular problem or problems the legislature was addressing and the objectives it sought to attain.\u201d To the extent \u201creasonably possible,\u201d we read a statute so \u201cthat no word, phrase, clause, or sentence is rendered surplusage or meaningless.\u201d Moreover, when the statute is part of a general statutory scheme or system, \u201c \u2018all sections must be read together ... to discern the true intent of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d ... In our effort to effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intent, we may consider \u201c \u2018the consequences resulting from one meaning rather than another, and adopt that construction which avoids an illogical or unreasonable result, or one which is inconsistent with common sense.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-8\"><em>Mayor of Baltimore City v. Johnson, </em>156 Md.App. 569, 592-93, 847 A.2d 1190 (2004) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">We are also mindful of two principles especially applicable to interpretation of two seemingly competing or conflicting statutes. \u201cThe first is that when construing two statutes that involve the same subject matter, a harmonious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>interpretation of the statutes is \u2018strongly favor[ed].\u2019 \u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Serv. v. Beard, </em>142 Md.App. 283, 302, 790 A.2d 57, <em>cert. denied,, </em>369 Md. 180, 798 A.2d 552 (2002)(quoting <em>Maryland State, Police v. Warwick Supply &amp; Equip. Co., </em>330 Md. 474, 483-84, 624 A.2d 1238 (1993)). \u201cThe second is that where two enactments \u2014 one general, the other specific \u2014 appear to cover the same subject, the specific enactment applies.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Modification v. Set Aside</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">We are faced here with two competing, if not conflicting, statutory provisions that seemingly address the same issue. FL section 5-1038(b) authorizes the court in a paternity case to \u201cmodify or set aside any order as the court considers just and proper\u201d (emphasis added), and FL section 12-104(b) prohibits a court from \u201cretroactively modifying] a child support award prior to the date of the filing of the motion for modification.\u201d We are called upon to decide whether the prohibition against retroactive modification contained in FL section 12-104(b) is intended to limit the broad power to \u201cmodify or set-aside\u201d granted in FL section 5-1038(b). More specifically, we must decide whether the prohibition against \u201cmodifyfing]\u201d in section 12-104(b) prevents a court from granting a parent\u2019s request to eliminate a child support arrearage that accrued before the parent moved to modify the child support award. If we conclude it does, then sections 5-1038(b) and 12-104(b) conflict, and we must decide how to reconcile the two sections. Beginning our analysis by examining the plain language of the statutes, we turn to the definition of \u201cmodify.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1020 (7th ed.1999) does not include the word \u201cmodify,\u201d but defines \u201cmodification\u201d as \u201c1. A change to something; an alteration, &lt;a contract modification &gt;. 2. A qualification or limitation of something &lt;a modification of drinking habits&gt;.\u201d Applying this definition, it appears that the section 12-104 prohibition against retroactive modification also would prohibit a court from extinguishing those portions of the award that related to periods prior to the motion for modification, because to do so would be a limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>tion on the original award. Thus, section 12-104 would conflict with the general power given in section 5 \u2014 1038(b) to \u201cmodify or set aside\u201d and we would need to decide how to reconcile the two statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Harvey disagrees with this interpretation. He invites us to recognize a substantive distinction between \u201cmodify[ing]\u201d a child support order retroactively and \u201csetting aside\u201d such an order retroactively. He argues that he is asking the court to \u201cset aside\u201d and not to \u201cmodify,\u201d because he seeks to avoid all of his child support arrearage. In his view, \u201cmodifying]\u201d does not include \u201csetting aside,\u201d so that \u201c[t]he prohibition of retroactive modifications to child support orders in FL \u00a7 12-104 does not prohibit a court from setting aside the orders in their entirety pursuant to FL \u00a7 5 \u2014 1038(b).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Harvey also relies on <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>which defines \u201cset aside\u201d as \u201c[a] judgment, decree, award, or any proceedings to cancel, annul, or revoke them at the instance of a party unjustly or irregularly affected by them.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1537 (4th ed.1968).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He also offers the definition of \u201cmodification\u201d from that earlier edition of <em>Black\u2019s, </em>as \u201ca change; an alteration which introduces new elements into the details ... but leaves the general purpose and effect of the subject-matter intact....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1155 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Although Harvey does not cite it, there is superficial support for his position in <em>Moore v. Jacobsen, </em>373 Md. 185, 191, 817 A.2d 212 (2003), in which the Court of Appeals recently held that an agreement not to \u201cmodify\u201d alimony would not preclude termination of alimony upon remarriage because \u201cmodification\u201d does not equate to \u201ctermination.\u201d But the Court of Appeals based its reasoning in <em>Moore </em>in large part on FL section 11-108, which requires that alimony terminate on the recipient\u2019s remarriage, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Court considered the traditional public policy favoring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>termination of alimony upon remarriage, and found significant that, \u201c[i]n contrast to modification, which requires court action, termination [under section 11-108] occurs by operation of law and thus does not require court action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191, 817 A.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">In the case of child support orders, however, court action clearly is required. Thus, Harvey had to obtain judicial relief from the effects of his previously adjudicated child support orders. There is no automatic termination, even if, as in this case, physical custody of the children switches over to the parent obligor. Moreover, unlike alimony upon remarriage, there is no historical policy in Maryland favoring termination of child support arrears. On balance, we do not view <em>Moore </em>as an instruction that a judicial order eliminating all unpaid child support is a \u201ctermination\u201d or that it cannot be a \u201cmodification\u201d within the meaning of section 12-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">In order for Harvey\u2019s \u201cmodification v. set aside\u201d distinction to achieve the result he seeks, the judicial action that Harvey requests must be classified as a \u201cset aside,\u201d and not a \u201cmodification,\u201d and the two must be mutually exclusive. Harvey, however, does not even satisfy his proffered definition of \u201cset aside\u201d as a judicial proceeding to \u201ccancel, annul, or revoke [a judgment, order, etc] at the instance of a party unjustly or irregularly affected by [it].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is not unjust or irregular that Harvey be required to pay child support for periods that his children were living with their mothers and being supported by the State through welfare payments.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Indeed, Harvey is not even asserting that it is. Harvey does not challenge the paternity order or otherwise attack the validity of the original order awarding child support. His claim, rather, only relates to a portion of the original child support award, the payment of which affects his current family\u2019s well-being. We perceive his claim to be one for modification, in that, although the child support award was appropriate when entered, and still has a valid legal and factual basis, a portion of the award should not be enforced because his family circumstances have changed, and payment would impose a hardship for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Turning from the statutory language to the statutory scheme, we must also consider the logical consequences resulting from Harvey\u2019s construction of the statute. <em>See Johnson, </em>156 Md.App. at 593, 847 A.2d 1190. Harvey\u2019s interpretation would require us to hold the legislature intended that a court could wipe out 100% of an arrearage retroactively, because that is a \u201cset aside,\u201d but that court could not reduce the arrearage by 99%, because that would be a \u201cmodification.\u201d This result is untenable. We reject Harvey\u2019s contention that the legality of retroactive changes to child support orders is based on the difference in the amount of the change. Rather, we think the distinction, if any, between a \u201cmodification\u201d and a \u201cset aside,\u201d as used in section 12-104, would rest on the reason for the change. <em>See, e.g., Jessica G. v. Hector M., </em>337 Md. 388, 401, 653 A.2d 922, <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 829, 116 S.Ct. 99, 133 L.Ed.2d 53 (1995)(prior unappealed order \u201cdismissing the paternity action with prejudice is clearly the type of order envisioned by FL \u00a7 5-1038(b), and it may be set aside if a court finds such action \u2018just and proper in light of the circumstances and in the best interests of the child\u2019 \u201d). If the child support order was invalid in the first place, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>there would be reason for it to be \u201cset aside\u201d in its entirety.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If it was originally valid, but circumstances have changed, then only that part of the original award affected by the new circumstances would be changed, and it is a modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Our conclusion that the prohibition against retroactively \u201cmodifying],\u201d as used in FL section 12-104, is intended to cover elimination of an arrearage, is also supported by legislative history, and a previous decision of this Court. In <em>Reuter v. Reuter, </em>102 Md.App. 212, 240, 649 A.2d 24 (1994), we recognized that FL section 12-104(b) was enacted \u201cto bring Maryland into compliance with\u201d Federal law governing welfare funding. Legislative history reflects the same. <em>See Hearing on S.B. 691 befare Senate Judicial Proceedings Comm., </em>1988 Gen. Assembly (Md.1988)(statement of Senator Ida G. Ruben, S.B. 691 sponsor). The pertinent Federal law mandates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">In order to [receive certain Federal funding] ..., each State must have in effect laws requiring the use of .... [procedures which require that any payment or installment of support under any child support order ... is .. not subject to retroactive modification by such State or by any other State; except that such procedures may permit modification with respect to any period during which there is pending a petition for modification, but only from the date that notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>of such petition has been given ... to the obligee or (where the obligee is the petitioner) to the obligor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a)(9)(2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Ann C. Helton, then Executive Director of the Administration, testified before the Maryland Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee that Maryland was notified on December 8, 1997, that the Director of the Federal Office of Child Support Enforcement intended to disapprove Maryland\u2019s State Plan for Child Support because of \u201cfailure to enact legislation prohibiting retroactive modification of child support orders.\u201d <em>See Hearing on S.B. 691 before Senate Judicial Proceedings Comm., </em>1988 Gen. Assembly (Md.1988)(statement of Ann C. Helton). This failure would \u201cresult in a total withdrawal of Federal funding for the program ($23.1 m[illion]) and a possible penalty against [Maryland\u2019s] AFDC program of from 1% to 5% of its share of Federal funds ($1.2 to 6 million]).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Helton also testified that \u201c[t]he intent of Congress [in enacting section 666(a)(9) ] was specifically aimed at the practice of some courts to reduce or forgive arrearages.\u201d <em>Id. See also Ruben Statement, supra </em>(when dealing with support arrears before proposal of S.B. 691, Maryland courts \u201cusually wipe[d] out the previous debt and allow[ed] the payor to start anew with child [s]upport payments\u201d). Helton further explained that \u201c[c]ollection of those overdue amounts means not only that the children, often living on a marginal income in single parent households, will benefit, but that the burden on the taxpayer is reduced through offset in expenditures for AFDC.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">After examining the statute in light of this legislative scheme and history, we conclude that the legislature, in using the term \u201cmodify\u201d in FL section 12-104 simply followed the language of the Federal statute, intending to prohibit, <em>inter alia, </em>the courts from wiping out an arrearage accrued during periods before the filing of a motion for modification. Thus, we reject the interpretation advanced by Harvey \u2014 that the legislature intended that the FL section 12-104 prohibition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>does not apply when a court is asked to wipe out an arrearage retroactively. Although we recognize that, when construing two statutes that involve the same subject matter, \u201ca harmonious interpretation\u201d of the statutes is \u201cstrongly favor[ed],\u201d <em>Md. State Police, </em>330 Md. at 483-84, 624 A.2d 1238, we conclude there is a conflict here because FL section 5-1038(b) seemingly permits a court to retroactively extinguish an arrearage, whereas FL section 12-104 prohibits that.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">FL Section 12-104 Controls</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Having decided that the prohibition against retroactive modification in FL section 12-104 precludes a judicial order that FL section 5-1038(b) otherwise allows, we still must decide which one is applicable to our case. We do so by returning to the principles of legislative construction regarding competing statutes, one general and one specific. Section 5-1038(b) is more general in that it addresses the court\u2019s broad authority, in paternity cases, to issue orders that \u201cmodify or set aside any order or part of an order under [the paternity proceedings] subtitle,\u201d except a declaration of paternity. This, of course, would include a child support order, as well as other orders.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In contrast, FL section 12-104(b), is the more specific provision because it addresses when those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>orders can be made in cases involving child support. \u201c[W]here there is a specific enactment and a general enactment which, in its most comprehensive sense, would include what is embraced in the former, the particular enactment must be operative, and the general enactment must be taken to affect only such cases within its general language as are not within the provisions of the particular enactment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Natural Res. v. France, </em>277 Md. 432, 461, 357 A.2d 78 (1976)(quoting <em>Criminal Injuries Comp. Bd. v. Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 495, 331 A.2d 55 (1975))(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">But we do not rely solely on the <em>\u201cspecific v. general </em>\u201d distinction to interpret these statutes. In addition to section 12-104(b) being the more specific enactment, it is also the later enactment. FL section 12-104 was enacted in 1988, at a time when FL section 5 \u2014 1038(b) had long been in existence. <em>See </em>1988 Laws, ch. 338; <em>Adams v. Mallory, </em>308 Md. 453, 462, 520 A.2d 371 (1987)(examining section 5-1038(b)); 1984 Md. Laws, ch. 296 \u00a7 2 (recodification).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">When attempting to harmonize two statutes that address the same subject, we presume that when the legislature enacted the later of the two statutes, it was aware of the one enacted earlier. \u201cEven though two statutes may require conflicting results with regard to their common subject, they are not rendered thereby necessarily irreconcilable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axqk\"><em>Gallaudet Univ. v. Nat\u2019l Soc\u2019y of the Daughters of the Am. Revolution, </em>117 Md.App. 171, 200-01, 699 A.2d 531 (1997)(quoting <em>Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>332 Md. 124, 133, 630 A.2d 713 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">In this instance, the General Assembly was aware of section 5-1038(b) when it enacted section 12-104. The problem targeted by section 12-104 was identified as the courts\u2019 too frequent exercise of discretion to \u201cwipe[ ] out the previous debt[.]\u201d <em>See Ruben Statement, supra. </em>That troublesome judicial discretion is the product of section 5-1038(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Thus, the legislative history shows that the 1988 General Assembly enacted FL section 12-104 in order to deliberately circumscribe the broad judicial discretion afforded under FL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>section 5-1038(b), in a successful effort to preserve Federal funding for Maryland welfare programs. We hold that the circuit court properly construed FL section 12-104 as a limitation on the earlier enacted and more generally applicable FL section 5-1038(b), preventing courts from modifying or setting aside any child support arrearage that accrued before an obligor parent petitions for modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">FL Section 10-118 Does Not Override Traditional Statutory Construction Principles In Interpreting Sections 12-104 and 5-1038(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">FL section 10-118 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">Subject to any federal law or program, the Administration and local support enforcement offices shall promote and serve the best interests of the child in carrying out their child support responsibilities under this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Without specifically saying so, Harvey seems to be arguing that the best interest of the child principle, as embodied in section 10-118, must override any interpretation of FL sections 5-1038(b) and 12-104 under traditional principles of statutory construction. He advances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-9\">The legislative history [of FL sections 10-118 and 5-1002] reflects that the law was formed on the bedrock principle in Maryland that the best interest of the children is the controlling factor in matters affecting the children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">He also relies on various Maryland decisions recognizing the importance of the best interest of the child standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-11\">The enforcement of the child support orders and resulting state-owed arrearages is taking money from the household of the children the order was meant to support, harming Mr. Harvey\u2019s ability to support his children, harming his credit history and ability to obtain needed financing, and harming his ability to save money in order to put his children through college.... In fact, the best interests of the child is such a fundamental guiding principle in Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>land, that it is given even greater importance than a parent\u2019s constitutionally protected fundamental liberty interest in the parent-child relationship. <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 11137, </em>106 Md.App. 308, 316, 664 A.2d 443 (1995).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Harvey\u2019s contentions may be answered most simply by reference to the language directing the Administration to apply the best interest of child standard, but to do so \u201c[subject to any federal law or program[.]\u201d As we have previously explained, the Federal welfare funding statute requires that there be no retroactive modification of child support orders, and section 12-104 complies with that directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Moreover, we do not agree with Harvey that this interpretation is consistent with the principles underlying the best interest standard. Although a child\u2019s best interest will override a parent\u2019s fundamental right in the context of decisions regarding custody and adoption, here we are not evaluating the many and weighty factors that enter into a decision regarding with whom a child will live, and who makes decisions on behalf of that child. We are simply deciding whether a child\u2019s father should be able to avoid repaying a judicially established debt that he owes to the State. <em>See infra </em>section II. In this context, the best interest of the child does not override the statutory mandate of FL section 12-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">For these reasons, the circuit court was correct in concluding it did not have discretion to set aside Harvey\u2019s child support arrears pursuant to FL section 5-1038(b). Nor, as we explain below, did it err in declining to apply the statutory best interest of the child standard established in FL section 10-118.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">The Administration Was Not Obligated To Apply The Best Interest Of The Child Standard In Exercising Its Discretion Under FL Section 10-112</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">Harvey again invokes the best interest of the child standard, this time arguing that it. governs the Administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>tion\u2019s exercise of discretion under FL section 10-112(a) in determining whether to settle with him by accepting a lesser sum than the adjudicated amount of his arrearage. This section reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">If the Administration considers it to be in the best interest of this State, in a case in which an assignment has been made under Article 88A, section 50(b)(2) of the Code, the Administration may accept in full settlement of an arrear-age in child support payments an amount that is less than the total arrearage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Harvey claims that the exercise of discretion under FL section 10-112 must be guided by the mandate of FL section 10-118, requiring the Administration and local support enforcement agencies to \u201cpromote and serve the best interests of the child in carrying out their child support responsibilities under this subtitle.\u201d We disagree with Harvey, and hold that the best interest of the child standard does not govern the exercise of discretion under FL section 10-112.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">We again start our analysis with the plain language of the statute. <em>See Thrasher v. Homecomings Fin. Network, Inc., </em>154 Md.App. 77, 82, 838 A.2d 392 (2003), <em>cert. </em>denied, 380 Md. 619, 846 A.2d 402 (2004). FL section 10-112 specifically says that the Administration may settle \u201c[i]f the Administration considers it to be in the best interest of this State,\u201d and notably omits any mention of the best interest of the child. If the legislature meant that the child\u2019s interest was the governing factor, or even a required <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> consideration, it likely would have said so. <em>See, e.g., In re Anthony R., </em>362 Md. 51, 62, 763 A.2d 136 (2000)(citing absence of explicit language as grounds for statutory interpretation); <em>Sec\u2019y of Public Safety v. Hutchinson, </em>359 Md. 320, 329, 753 A.2d 1024 (2000)(same). When the legislature intends to mandate competing factors an agen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>cy must take into account in determining the interest of the State, it knows how to do so. <em>See, e.g., </em>Md.Code (1982, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2003 Cum Supp.), \u00a7 16-202(c)(l) of the Environment Article (in deciding whether to issue a license to dredge or fill on State wetlands, Board of Public Works \u201cshall decide if issuance of the license is in the best interest of the State, taking into account the varying ecological, economic, developmental, recreational, and aesthetic values each application presents\u201d)(emphasis added).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The plain language of FL section 10-112 strongly suggests that we should reject Harvey\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">In further considering Harvey\u2019s argument, we are mindful that FL section 10-112 only applies when one parent has assigned his or her rights to recover child support payments from the other parent as a condition of receiving welfare payments under Md.Code (1957, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Art. 88A \u00a7 50(b)(2).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, the Administration and local support en-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>forcenient offices are collecting money that will be returned to the state coffers. They are not collecting support from one parent that will go to the other parent to benefit a child. For this reason, we conclude that, in exercising its discretion under section 10-112, the Administration and local support enforcement offices are not \u201ccarrying out a child support responsibility] under [the] subtitle,\u201d as described in FL section 10-118. Rather, section 10-112 simply gives the Administration the authority to settle a claim to payment that it has acquired by assignment from a parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">As the Administration argues, section 10-112 \u201cmerely grants authority to [the Administration], that ... would otherwise rest with the Comptroller, to settle litigation involving child support arrears assigned to the State if the agency concludes that it is in the State\u2019s interest to accept a lump sum payment.\u201d <em>Cf. </em>Md.Code (1985, 1999 Repl.VoL), \u00a7 6-219 of the State Finance &amp; Procurement Article (SFP)(Comptroller may \u201csettle a claim so as to best serve the interests of the State\u201d). The language and existence of FL section 10-118, in our view, only reinforces the plain language interpretation of FL section 10-112. The legislature, knowing that section 10-118 required the Administration and any local enforcement office to act in the best interest of the child with respect to many of its functions, explicitly directed that, with respect to this function, the Administration must consider the best interests of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">We are not persuaded otherwise by Harvey\u2019s arguments. We recognize that \u201cthe plain meaning rule is \u2018elastic, rather than cast in stone[,]\u2019 and if \u2018persuasive evidence exists outside the plain text of the statute [pertaining to the meaning of a provision] we do not turn a blind eye to it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Corby v. McCarthy, </em>154 Md.App. 446, 449, 840 A.2d 188 (2003)(quoting <em>Adamson v. Corr. Med. Serv., </em>359 Md. 238, 251, 753 A.2d 501 (2000)). Resisting the plain language approach, Harvey invokes the common law doctrine that \u201cthe best interest of the child standard governs child support matters.\u201d We do not question the vitality of this doctrine, but find it is inapplicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>to the Administration\u2019s exercise of discretion under section 10-112.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The doctrine has ordinarily been applied when the issue in the case involves determining how much child support a parent should pay to the other parent for the benefit of a child, not in instances when the State is collecting money owed to it from a parent. This was true in <em>Witt v. Ristaino, </em>118 Md.App. 155, 158, 169, 701 A.2d 1227 (1997), and <em>O\u2019Connor v. O\u2019Connor, </em>22 Md.App. 519, 522, 323 A.2d 632 (1974), both cases cited by Harvey, involving determinations of whether a father should be required to pay child support in an amount sufficient to cover costs of private school. Harvey cites no case, however, holding or suggesting that the best interest of the child is the appropriate standard when the State is collecting a debt from a parent owing to the State.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">We are not persuaded that the \u201cchild\u2019s best interest\u201d standard should be invoked solely because the State stands in the shoes of a custodial parent claiming child support (by virtue of an assignment from the children\u2019s mother). Although the best interest standard governed at the time the child support order was originally established, the case now stands in a different posture. If Harvey had an argument that the support amount was too high at a time when he was not the custodial parent, he could have advanced it then. He also had a full opportunity to seek modification of the original order, and he was limited only by the prohibition of FL section 12-104 against modification of support accrued before he filed the petition to modify. But his opportunity to challenge the award on a child\u2019s best interest standard passed him by when the order making the award became final, and was not appealed. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number><em>Reuter v. Reuter, </em>102 Md.App. 212, 241, 649 A.2d 24 (1994)(\u201cThe Maryland rule allowing modification only upon a showing of changed circumstances is consistent with broader principles of <em>res judicata </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Nor are we persuaded by Harvey\u2019s argument that the best interest standard must control simply because his children might now be adversely affected if he is required to pay his debt to the State. Although we are sympathetic to the family\u2019s financial needs, and concur with the circuit court\u2019s commendation of Harvey for his ambition to make a better life for his children, we will not direct the Administration to compromise its claim on this ground. Legislation imposing-taxes, user fees, and even criminal fines might be argued, in some instances, to be against the \u201cbest interest\u201d of the children in the family obligated to pay. We cannot extinguish such obligations simply because children might be financially affected by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The Administration Did Not Fail To Properly Exercise Its Discretion Under FL Section 10-112</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Harvey next seeks to invoke this Court\u2019s assistance in forcing the Administration to exercise its discretion under FL section 10-112. He argues that the Administration failed \u201cto act on his request to forgive state-owed arrears[.]\u201d He contends that \u201c[t]he trial court erred as a matter of law in refusing to review the agency\u2019s exercise of discretion.\u201d In his view, \u201c[tjhe discretion provided to [the Administration] under FL [section] 10-112 is subject to judicial review, regardless of whether review is provided for by statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">Limited Judicial Review</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">There is no provision for judicial review of decisions by the Administration under FL section 10-112. Nor is Harvey entitled to judicial review of the Administration\u2019s decision as a \u201ccontested case\u201d under Maryland\u2019s Administrative Procedure Act. <em>See </em>Md.Code, (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2003 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 10-201 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Government Article (SG)(the APA)(defining \u201ccontested case\u201d in \u00a7 10-202(d) as \u201ca proceeding before an agency to determine <em>[inter alia </em>] a right, duty, statutory entitlement, or privilege of a person that is required by statute or constitution to be determined only after an opportunity for an agency hearing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Courts will review administrative actions, however, even if the action is non-adjudicatory and the APA does not apply. In <em>Hurl v. Bd. of Educ. of Howard County, </em>107 Md.App. 286, 804, 667 A.2d 970 (1995), for example, we reviewed a superintendent\u2019s decision to transfer a teacher to another school \u201cas the needs of the schools require,\u201d pursuant to Md.Code (1978, 2004 Repl.Vol.), section 6-201(b)(2)(ii) of the Education Article. In that context, we explained that, even in the absence of statutory authorization for judicial review, \u201cthe circuit court nonetheless retains the power to review agency decisions to prevent illegal, unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious administrative action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">But Harvey\u2019s complaint does not qualify for that kind of relief because it is about a failure or refusal to take administrative action. Harvey asks us to remedy the Administration\u2019s failure or refusal to invoke FL section 10-112, by taking an action to \u201caccept in full settlement of an arrearage in child support payments an amount that is less than the total arrearage.\u201d Although an agency\u2019s refusal or failure to make a decision may justify mandamus relief in some instances, <em>see Kerpelman v. Disability Review Bd., </em>155 Md.App. 513, 528, 843 A.2d 877 (2004)(awarding mandamus relief for failing to determine whether claimant had qualifying disability), we do not see how mandamus could be applied to this case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The Court of Appeals has explained that the writ of mandamus \u201c \u2018is a summary remedy for the want of a specific one, where there would otherwise be a failure of justice. It is based upon reasons of justice and public policy, to preserve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>peace, order and good government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Philip Morris, Inc. v. Angeletti, </em>358 Md. 689, 707-08, 752 A.2d 200 (2000) (citations omitted). We see no failure of justice, lack of order, or lack of good government in this instance because we do not think that the legislature, in enacting section 10-112, intended that the Administration be required to actively consider, in every case in which it is collecting a child support arrearage pursuant to an assignment under Article 88A, section 50(b)(2), whether compromise and settlement is appropriate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">[Mjandamus, as generally used, is to compel inferior tribunals, public officials or administrative agencies to perform their function, or perform some particular duty imposed upon them which in its nature is imperative and to the performance of which duty the party applying for the writ has a clear legal right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-6\"><em>Criminal Injuries Compensation Bd. v. Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 514, 331 A.2d 55 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">FL section 10-112 did not create a clear right in persons such as Harvey, who are obligated to pay arrears accrued under adjudicated child support orders. Harvey\u2019s right to challenge the legitimacy of claims by the children\u2019s mother existed earlier, when Harvey was sued to establish support; he had an opportunity to defend through a full judicial hearing and appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Nor was section 10-112, in our view, intended to impose a duty upon the Administration to compromise, or to consider compromise, in every case. The authority under this section, rather, could be invoked when the Commission, in its discretion, elected to do so. The broad nature of the discretion intended by the legislature is revealed in its omission of any criteria to be considered, other than the general \u201cbest interest of the State\u201d criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">No Illegality Or Unreasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">Even if we were to consider the Administration\u2019s action in proceeding with the usual enforcement mechanisms for collection of a child support arrearage as a decision or action that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>must be reviewed, our \u201c \u2018inquiry is (almost always) limited to finding whether there was illegality or unreasonableness in the ... action \u2014 when that inquiry is finished, judicial scrutiny ends[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources v. Linchester Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., </em>274 Md. 211, 226, 334 A.2d 514 (1975) (citation omitted). For the reasons discussed below, we find no illegality or unreasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Harvey argues that the BCOCSE refusal to forgive his arrearage was illegal, in part, because BCOCSE \u201cadmitted it was placing its own interests in maintaining its collection rate before the interests of the children when it refused to take the actions suggested by [the Administration] to effectively suspend enforcement.\u201d A representative of BCOCSE acknowledged that \u201cone of the reasons\u201d it rejected the Administrations\u2019s proposal \u201cis that it would potentially harm the numbers that show the local enforcement offices\u2019s collection rate[.]\u201d She also explained BCOCSE\u2019s other reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-6\">We\u2019d rather go one way or the other.... Either collect the money at a reasonable rate ... or [abate the arrears].... [0]nce this memorandum [from the Administration recommending $1.00 per year] was done, ... my supervisor ... discussed this at one of our bi-weekly meetings, basically stating that we didn\u2019t agree with this proposal because (1) our computer systems are not set up to read anything like this, which means that if you have $5,000.00 on the system, we don\u2019t really have much of a way to monitor these cases to make sure his taxes are intercepted or not turned into the credit agency. We have a lot of automated systems that are in place \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">We examine the legitimacy of these reasons in light of the statutory language of section 10-112, and inspect how the statute relates to other laws. <em>See Thrasher, </em>154 Md.App. at 82, 838 A.2d 392. We begin with a review of the Administration\u2019s role in collecting a child support arrearage owed to the State, as well as the relationship between the Administration and BCOCSE.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>The Administration is a sub-department within the Department of Human Resources. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 10-106. BCOCSE is a private agency that has contracted with the Administration to carry out the Administration\u2019s responsibilities in collecting child support. The Administration\u2019s authority to delegate some of its duties to a private agency is statutorily defined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC5\">[TJhere is a Child Support Enforcement Privatization Pilot Program within the Department [of Human Resources] ... [which will] operate in Baltimore City . . . The purpose of the Pilot Program is to authorize the Secretary of the Department to enter into contracts with private companies to privatize all aspects of child support enforcement functions of the Department, ... collecting support payments!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq2\">FL \u00a7 10-119.1(a)-(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">The legislative history of the current privatization pilot in Baltimore City suggests that the legislature, in enacting FL section 10-119.1, expected to increase revenues for the State. <em>See Appropriations Committee Floor Report,, </em>1995 Gen. Assembly, H.B. 1177 (Md.1995)(\u201cWith the majority of cases in the City also on AFDC, uncollected support orders result in additional AFDC costs for the [S]tate.... [B]y contracting this service out, enforcement functions can be run in a more efficient manner\u201d). The legislature also enacted FL section 10-119.2, which directs the Secretary of Human Resources to \u201cestablish child support demonstration sites in all jurisdictions that are not privatized jurisdictions, for the purpose of competing against a privatized jurisdiction as established in \u00a7 10-119.1[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">The legislature\u2019s focus on efficiency and success in collecting child support monies owed to the State is not new. In 1978, the General Assembly transferred responsibility for support collections to the Department of Human Resources. <em>See </em>1978 Md. Laws, ch. 885. In proposing this change, the Department stated: \u201cThe Department ... has the incentive to manage the Domestic Collections program well. Collections efforts on behalf of welfare clients can substantially cut the payout of welfare funds.\u201d <em>House Committee on Appropriations Hear</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>ing on H.B. 607, </em>1978 Gen.

In 1980, the General Assembly authorized interception of State tax refunds to parents who owe child support, initially only for support payments due to persons receiving AFDC. <em>See </em>1980 Md. Laws, ch. 569. In 1985, the General Assembly permitted earnings withholding orders against parents who are more than 30 days in arrears on child support, and the fiscal note for that legislation reflected an \u201cestimated $462,292 in AFDC offset funds ... in FY 86.\u201d <em>See Fiscal Note on H.B. 678, </em>1985 Gen. Assembly (Md.1985); 1985 Md. Laws, ch. 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Further, as the Administration argues, \u201cthe Court of Appeals has consistently recognized that [one] prime object of Maryland\u2019s paternity statutes has been to protect the public from the burden of government support for a child.\u201d <em>See Commonwealth of Va. ex rel. Halsey v. Autry, </em>293 Md. 53, 61, 441 A.2d 1056 (1982)(one purpose of Paternity Act is to shift burden of support from the taxpayers to parents of children born out of wedlock); <em>Mayor of Rockville v. Randolph, </em>267 Md. 56, 61, 296 A.2d 574 (1972)(main purpose of this law is to shift \u201c \u2018some of the burdens of financial support of illegitimates from the taxpayer to the father\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). <em>See also Pickett v. Brown, </em>462 U.S. 1, 10, 103 S.Ct. 2199, 2205, 76 L.Ed.2d 372 (1983)(State interest in paternity cases \u201cstems not only from a desire to see that \u2018justice is done,\u2019 but also from a desire to reduce the number of individuals forced to enter the welfare rolls\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Keeping in mind this history of legislative efforts to identify more effective means to collect child support payments as a way to increase revenues to the State, we examine the history of the agency\u2019s response to Harvey\u2019s requests that his debt be reduced or extinguished, and the reasons why they were not granted. As stated in the letter from Ms. Kaiser, the Administration recommended to BCOCSE that it suspend enforcement measures against Harvey \u201cexcept for the Maryland Lottery,\u201d collecting only $1.00 per year from Harvey, until all of his children were emancipated. In a meeting after BCOCSE received the Administration\u2019s recommendation, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>ever, BCOCSE stated its rejection of that proposal. Thereafter, the Administration took no steps under section 10-112 to settle or compromise its adjudicated claim against Harvey. Thus, the Administration, acquiescing in its local agency\u2019s objections, elected not to invoke section 10-112.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">In enacting the pilot program to privatize the Administration\u2019s \u201cchild support enforcement functions,\u201d the legislature evidently sought to take advantage of efficiencies achievable in private enterprise as compared to government operations. In delegating such responsibility, it was obviously necessary to give the private company financial incentives to perform the work. The record in this case suggests that one of BCOCSE\u2019s financial incentives was measured by its \u201ccollection rate\u201d with respect to child support arrears. Harvey complains that BCOCSE, in deciding whether to compromise the State\u2019s claim against Harvey, was motivated by the impact of such compromise on its own \u201ccollection rate,\u201d and that such motivation makes its action illegal or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">We are persuaded that this motivation is a legitimate one in this context, because financial incentives for performance and achievement are an integral part of private enterprise. The legislature, in enacting FL section 10-119.1, undoubtedly understood that when a private company undertakes to collect monies owed to the State, its success in doing so may benefit both the company and the State. Although this financial incentive may work to the detriment of a debtor like Harvey, as well as his children, it also may work to the benefit of the State\u2019s citizens as a whole. The financial health of the State affects almost every citizen, including children, whether he or she benefits from an increase in services offered, a decrease in taxes paid, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Through the use of pilot programs, the legislature has decided to investigate whether private companies can better serve the State in this arena than a traditional State agency. A predictable and necessary consequence of this decision is that the financial incentives offered to the company will motivate its behavior. In the context of exercising discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>whether to settle a claim under section 10-112, we think a financial incentive in favor of collection reflects neither illegality or lack of reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The other reason given by BCOCSE for rejecting the Administration\u2019s proposal was that its computers are not capable of tracking an account that shows money owed from an individual, without automatically taking enforcement steps, such as intercepting the individual\u2019s tax refunds. Although it is understandably frustrating to an individual like Harvey to have his financial well-being dictated by the limitations of an high volume, automated system, we cannot say that this reason is arbitrary. The Administration and BCOCSE, like many other government offices and private businesses, have decided that computer operated databases are the most efficient and effective manner in which to accomplish their tasks. The advantages of an automatic computerized system must be offset against the disadvantages, including the disadvantage of losing individualized treatment. In the context of this case, we cannot say that it is unreasonable for the Administration to conclude that some sacrifices must be made to achieve the benefits of a computerized system.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Many states have statutes authorizing officials to compromise claims of the state or debts owed to the state. Federal law contains similar authority. We have found no case, however, holding that a person owing an adjudicated debt to a state has the right to compel the state to compromise that debt. We see no reason to do so in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Harvey Failed To Properly Submit A Petition For The Adoption Of A Regulation</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Harvey\u2019s final complaint is that the Administration has failed \u201cto properly formulate criteria or regulations to govern the procedures in exercising agency discretion under FL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>[section] 10-112.\u201d The Administration responds that the circuit court lacked authority to enter a declaratory judgment or an injunction requiring a State agency to issue regulations because Harvey did not proceed under SG section 10-123(a), which allows \u201c[a]n interested person [to] submit ... a petition for the adoption of a regulation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">We agree with the Administration, finding decisions under the Federal APA and similar state statutes persuasive. <em>See, e.g., South Hills Health Sys. v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 1084, 1095 (3d Cir.1988)(\u201ca threshold requirement of seeking judicial review of an agency\u2019s refusal to undertake rulemaking is the filing of a rulemaking petition with the relevant agency\u201d); <em>Kappelmann v.

This is what distinguishes the present case from a case cited by Harvey, <em>Dep\u2019t of Revenue v. C.M.J., </em>432 Mass. 69, 731 N.E.2d 501 (2000). There, the father had always lived with the children and provided support for them.

It is a child support order that effectively reduces support for the children who ostensibly were to benefit from it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apq\"><em>Id. </em>at 503.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b391-7\">. In <em>Walter v. Gunter, </em>367 Md. 386, 394, 788 A.2d 609 (2002), the Court of Appeals held that FL section 5-1038(b) does not apply when the underlying paternity order is invalidated, because the court\u2019s jurisdiction under section 5-1038(b) depends on the existence of a valid paternity order. <em>Walter </em>differs from this case because it involved a successful challenge to the paternity order itself, rather than a challenge to the child support order, as we have here. By its terms, FL section 12-104 prohibits only retroactive changes to \"a child support award\" and does not limit a trial court's authority to retroactively vacate an invalid paternity declaration, for the reasons set forth in <em>Walter. See id. </em>at 390-94, 788 A.2d 609. The analysis in <em>Walter, </em>however, leaves open the question of whether, under FL section 5-1038(b), a court could retroactively \"set aside\u201d a child support order, when the underlying paternity order is valid, and still comply with FL section 12-104.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b393-7\">. We are not persuaded by Harvey's argument that FL section 5-1038(b) implies that the legislature intended to carve out an exception to FL section 12-104 for paternity cases generally. This is inconsistent with the legislative intention to preclude reductions in child support arrearages, whether in paternity cases or otherwise. FL section 5-1002(b)states that the legislative purpose of the paternity subtitle is, in part, \"to promote the general welfare and best interests of children born out of wedlock by securing for them, as nearly as practicable, the same rights to support [and] care ... as children born in wedlockf.]\u201d If we held that a child support arrearage pertaining to a child born out of wedlock could be retroactively extinguished, but an arrearage to all other children could not, we would undermine this fundamental purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b393-8\">.
