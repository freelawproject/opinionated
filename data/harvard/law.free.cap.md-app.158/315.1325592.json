Salvagno, Michael Fitzgerald, and the Altizer-Salvagno Center for Surgery at Robinwood appeal from an order of the Circuit Court for Washington County nullifying and vacating a decision of the Health Claims Arbitration Office (the \u201cHCAO\u201d). Appellants ask two questions, which we have slightly reworded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">I. Did the circuit court err by denying appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">II. Did the circuit court err by vacating the order of the HCAO?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">For the reasons below, we shall remand the case to the circuit court with instructions to remand the claim to the IICAO for arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Overview of the Health Care Malpractice Claims Act</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">The Health Care Malpractice Claims Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), embodied in Md.Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-01 through 3-2A-09 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d), was enacted in 1976 in response to the malpractice insurance crisis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Carrion v. Linzey, </em>342 Md. 266, 274-75, 675 A.2d 527 (1996). The primary feature of the Act was to \u201c \u2018require the submission of certain [medical malpractice] claims to an arbitration panel for initial ascertainment of liability and damages before resort [could] be had to a court of law for final determination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276, 675 A.2d 527 (quoting <em>Attorney Gen. v. Johnson, </em>282 Md. 274, 277, 385 A.2d 57 (1978)). The purpose of the Act was to \u201cscreen malpractice claims, ferret out meritless ones, and, in theory, ... lower the cost of malpractice insurance and the overall costs of health care.\u201d <em>Adler v. Hyman, </em>334 Md. 568, 575, 640 A.2d 1100 (1994). In short, medical malpractice claims are to be submitted to \u201cmandatory arbitration as a pre-condition to any court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>action.\u201d <em>Watts v. King, </em>143 Md.App. 293, 306, 794 A.2d 723 (2002).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u201cAll claims, suits and actions\u201d in which damages of more than $5,000 are sought against a health care provider for medical injury allegedly suffered by a claimant are subject to the Act. C.J. \u00a7 3-2A-02(a)(l). Claims filed with the Director of the HCAO are referred to a panel of three arbitrators. <em>See </em>C.J. \u00a7 3-2A-03. In any action for damages filed under the Act,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">the health care provider is not liable for the payment of damages unless it is established that the care given by the health care provider is not in accordance with the standards of practice among members of the same health care profession with similar training and experience situated in the same or similar communities at the time of the alleged act giving rise to the cause of action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">C.J. \u00a7 3-2A-02(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Except when the issue is solely the lack of informed consent, a claimant must file with the Director a certificate of a qualified expert \u201cattesting to departure from standards of care\u201d and that the departure was \u201cthe proximate cause of the alleged injury.\u201d C.J. \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(l)(i). Failure to file such a certificate \u201cshall\u201d result in dismissal of the claim without prejudice. <em>Id. </em>To dispute liability, a defendant must file a certificate \u201cattesting to compliance with standards of care,\u201d or that the departure was not the proximate cause of the alleged injury, within one hundred twenty days from the date the claimant \u201cserved the certificate of a qualified expert ... on the defendant.\u201d C.J. \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(2). Ordinarily, the claimant\u2019s certificate must be filed within ninety days from the date of the claim, but an extension of time to file a certificate of a qualified expert \u201cshall be granted for good cause shown.\u201d C.J. \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(l)(i) and (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>The arbitration panel determines whether the health care provider is liable and, if so, \u201cconsider[s], itemizelsl, assess[es], and apportion[s]\u201d the appropriate damages, and incorporates into the award an assessment of costs, including the arbitrators\u2019 fees. C.J. \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-05(e) and (f)(1). If no party rejects the award, it becomes \u201cfinal and binding,\u201d is filed in the appropriate circuit court, and constitutes a final judgment when confirmed by that court. C.J. \u00a7 3-2A-05(i). Any party, however, can reject the award \u201cfor any reason\u201d by filing a \u201cnotice of rejection\u201d with the Director of the HCAO and the arbitration panel and, also, an \u201caction to nullify\u201d the award in an appropriate circuit court within thirty days \u201cafter the award is served on the rejecting party.\u201d C.J. \u00a7 3-2A-06(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">A party may elect to have the case tried by a jury. C.J. \u00a7 3-2A-06(b)(2). Prior to the trial, the circuit court may modify, correct, or vacate an award. C.J. \u00a7 3-2A-06(c). If the circuit court finds, for example, that the \u201carbitrators exceeded their powers,\u201d it \u201cshall vacate the award, and trial of the case shall proceed as if there had been no award.\u201d C.J. \u00a7\u00a7 3-224(b)(3) and 3-2A-06(c). If not vacated, the award is admissible as evidence at trial. C.J. \u00a7 3-2A-06(d). It is presumed to be correct and the \u201cburden is on the party rejecting it to prove that it is not correct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The complaint alleges that Dr. Ralph Salvagno, while performing surgery on William Frew\u2019s right ankle on March 26, 1997, improperly applied a tourniquet. The result was an \u201cinjury to the right calf and lost sensation to the right foot.\u201d In March 2000, William and his wife, Debra, (\u201cclaimants\u201d), filed a two-count statement of claim with the HCAO, alleging negligence (\u201cCount I\u201d) and loss of consortium (\u201cCount II\u201d). On April 11, 2000, the claimants requested an extension of time for filing a certificate of a qualified expert (the \u201ccertificate\u201d), which the Director granted, extending the time to September 17, 2000. On August 29, 2000, the claimants requested \u201can additional ninety (90) days within which to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>secure\u201d the certificate. The Director granted an extension to November 1, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">On October 31, 2000, the claimants filed an amended statement of claim, adding a count for lack of informed consent (\u201cCount III\u201d). They also requested another extension of time to file the certificate, averring:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">1. Claimants have had this case reviewed by an expert.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">2. Claimants\u2019 initially retained experts indicated that claimants\u2019 claim [had] merit, but claimants\u2019 specialist who has reviewed the case commented on the case in such a manner that claimants\u2019 counsel was directed to file the Amended Complaint alleging lack of informed consent, a change in theory of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">3. Under such a theory, claimants would not need a certificate .... However, claimants did not wish to foreclose any theory of recovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">4. Consequently, claimants will need additional time to secure an expert opinion to provide a second look at claimants\u2019 Count One [negligence] cause of action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">5. Claimants have been proceeding with due diligence in their quest to move this case along.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">Wherefore ..., claimants request an additional extension of time within which to file an expert\u2019s certificate as to Count One.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">The Director extended the time to January 10, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">On December 7, 2000, appellants filed a motion to dismiss Count III, which the Director denied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellants filed another motion to dismiss on May 7, 2001, requesting that Counts I and II be dismissed because the claimants had \u201cfailed to file [the] certificate ... on or before January 10, 2001.\u201d On June 6, 2001, the Director dismissed Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">The chairperson of the arbitration panel (the \u201cchairperson\u201d) issued the following scheduling order on December 3, 2001:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>February 1, 2002 Claimants to name expert witnesses</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aea-dedup-1\">March 15, 2002 Appellants to name expert witnesses</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ahm-dedup-0\">April 15, 2002 Claimants to name rebuttal witnesses</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANH\">June 21, 2002 Discovery cut-off</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbB\">June 24, 2002 Pretrial telephone conference</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOO\">July 22-24, 2002 Arbitration hearing</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-17\">On February 11, 2002, appellants filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss or, in the Alterative, Motion for Summary Judgment.\u201d Relying on <em>Sard v. Hardy, </em>281 Md. 432, 379 A.2d 1014 (1977), appellants argued that Counts II and III should be \u201cdismissed or judgment entered\u201d because the claimants had not designated an expert witness and could not \u201cmake a prima facie case of lack of informed consent (nor the derivative claim of loss of consortium) without an expert witness.\u201d The claimants responded that, because appellants had not provided \u201cthorough!] and complete!]\u201d answers to interrogatories, they had not \u201csecured information necessary to ascertain whether an expert [was] needed.\u201d The claimants averred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-18\">4. The information elicited or sought to be elicited from the answers to interrogatories is relevant for the purposes of determining whether [claimants] needed an expert or whether the [appellants\u2019] admissions would be sufficient to provide the evidence needed to go forward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-19\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-20\">6. While cases have indicated expert testimony is needed, there is no indication that the experts need to be established at the cut-off of [claimants\u2019] designation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-21\">7. [Appellants\u2019] admissions are sufficient and can be sufficient enough to establish the standard of care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-22\">8. Until it is known to [claimants] that [claimants] will not be able to establish through [appellants\u2019] admissions or through the course of discovery from other sources in this case as to the standard of care and the breach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>thereof, then [claimants] would [not] need to address the issue of [claimants\u2019] experts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The claimants again requested that the \u201cdesignation period for supplying expert designation be extended thirty days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A3\">Following a hearing on appellants\u2019 motion, the chairperson filed an order dismissing without prejudice Counts II and III, finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">1. The claimants have been granted three extensions of time by the HCAO Director, and in essence, a fourth extension of time by the [chairperson\u2019s] Scheduling Order requiring that an expert witness be designated on or before February 1, 2002. This claim was filed in March 2000, and claimants have had over two (2) years in which to name an expert witness. To date, no certificate has been filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">3. In view of <em>Sard, </em>without an expert witness, the claimants cannot make a prima facie case for lack of informed consent. I find no merit in the claimants\u2019 argument that ... Dr. Salvagno should in essence be the claimants\u2019 expert witness. The cases cited in claimants\u2019 Memorandum ... would appear to indicate that an adverse party may be called as a witness and interrogated on cross-examination both as to facts and as to expert opinion \u2014 in addition to \u2014 and not instead of\u2014 their own expert witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">On June 13, 2002, the claimants filed in the circuit court a petition to nullify the award, arguing that, because it was permissible to rely on appellants\u2019 \u201cadmissions as to the particulars of informed consent in order to satisfy the expert requirement of <em>Sard,\u201d </em>the chairperson exceeded her authority by dismissing Counts II and III. At the same time, the claimants filed a two-count complaint, seeking damages for lack of informed consent and loss of consortium. In response to the petition to nullify, appellants denied that the chairperson had exceeded her authority. Appellants also filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>motion to dismiss the complaint, arguing that because the claimants had not filed a certificate, they had failed to arbitrate, which is a \u201cpre-condition to any court action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">Following a hearing, the circuit court granted the claimants\u2019 petition to nullify, vacated the chairperson\u2019s order of dismissal, and denied appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint, stating: <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">(a) After the dismissal of [Count I], [the claimants\u2019] ... cause of action became one in which the sole issue was lack of informed consent, (the claim for loss of consortium being derivative of the lack of informed consent claim and in the nature of damages only). Under ... [C.J.] \u00a7 3-2A-04(b), the [claimants] were therefore not required to file a certificate of qualified expert on the matter of lack of informed consent. The [chairperson\u2019s] dismissal of ... [Counts II and III] exceeded her scope of authority in light of the language of ... [C.J.] \u00a7 3-2A-04(b);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">(b) Maryland law on informed consent, as set out in <em>Sard v. Hardy, </em>281 Md. 432, 379 A.2d 1014 (1977), does not impose a necessary requirement upon the [claimants] to present expert testimony in order to meet their burden of proof as to the materiality of the risk from [claimant] William Frew\u2019s perspective. <em>Sard </em>at 447, 379 A.2d 1014[sic] makes clear that Maryland has adopted a general or lay standard of reasonableness set by law and independent of medical custom, which standard imposes no requirement of expert testimony to establish scope or breach of a physi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>dan\u2019s duty to disdose. However, at <em>Sard </em>448[sic], such expert testimony would be required to establish the nature of the risks inherent in a particular treatment, the probabilities of therapeutic success, the frequency of the occurrence of particular risks, the nature of available alternatives to treatment and whether or not disclosure would be detrimental to a patient. In light of <em>Sard, </em>the [chairperson\u2019s] dismissal of [Counts II and III] with no opportunity to present the case, was premature;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">(c) <em>State use of Miles v. Brainin, </em>224 Md. 156, 167 A.2d 117 (1961), permits the [claimants] to elicit expert testimony from a defendant called as an adverse witness. <em>Brainin </em>does not, however, go so far as to permit the [claimants] to name a defendant as their sole expert witness and then to rely upon that defendant\u2019s testimony alone to prove every aspect of their lack of informed consent claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AWZ\">I. Motion to Dismiss</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Relying on <em>Watts v. King, </em>143 Md.App. 293, 794 A.2d 723 (2002), and <em>Bailey v. Woel, </em>302 Md. 38, 485 A.2d 265 (1984), appellants argue that the circuit court \u201cexceeded its jurisdiction\u201d by denying the motion to dismiss the complaint. Because a medical malpractice claim must be submitted to mandatory arbitration before the HCAO as a \u201ccondition precedent\u201d to the filing of any court action, appellants contend that the claimants \u201cfailed\u201d to arbitrate the claim by not designating an independent expert. Therefore, they may not file the complaint in the circuit court. Appellees concede that \u201cexpert testimony is needed\u201d to prove the claim for lack of informed consent, but, citing <em>State use and Benefit of Miles v. Brainin, </em>224 Md. 156, 167 A.2d 117 (1961), they argue that, instead of designating their own expert, they could rely on Dr. Salvagno\u2019s testimony to establish the \u201cmaterial risks of the procedure, ... the alternatives, and ... the percentages of success <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>for each approach.\u201d Therefore, they did not fail to arbitrate their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Under the doctrine of informed consent, \u201ca physician, treating a mentally competent adult under non-emergency circumstances, cannot properly undertake to perform surgery or administer other therapy without the prior consent of his patient.\u201d <em>Sard, </em>281 Md. at 439, 379 A.2d 1014. Consent is \u201cinformed\u201d if it is given after a physician has fairly and reasonably explained the proposed treatment or procedure. <em>Id,. </em>It is the physician\u2019s duty</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">to explain the procedure to the patient and to warn him of any material risks or dangers inherent in or collateral to the therapy, so as to enable the patient to make an intelligent and informed choice about whether or not to undergo such treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">This duty to disclose is said to require a physician to reveal to his patient the nature of the ailment, the nature of the proposed treatment, the probability of success of the contemplated therapy and its alternatives, and the risk of unfortunate consequences associated with such treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axv\"><em>Id. </em>at 439-40, 379 A.2d 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">In Maryland, the scope of a physician\u2019s duty to inform is \u201cmeasured by the materiality of the information to the decision of the patient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444, 379 A.2d 1014. Whether a physician has fulfilled that duty is determined by a \u201cgeneral standard of reasonable conduct,\u201d focusing on the information that a patient needs to make an intelligent decision. <em>Id. </em>at 442, 444, 379 A.2d 1014. Expert medical testimony is not required to establish the \u201cscope\u201d or the \u201cbreach of the physician\u2019s duty,\u201d but it is required to establish the \u201cnature of the risks inherent in a particular treatment, the probabilities of therapeutic success, the frequency of the occurrence of particular risks, the nature of available alternatives to treatment and whether or not disclosure would be detrimental to a patient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447-48, 379 A.2d 1014.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>The two cases on which appellants rely do not address the issue presented in this case. In <em>Bailey, </em>302 Md. 38, 485 A.2d 265, the claimants filed a claim with the HCAO and conducted discovery. At the arbitration hearing, claimants\u2019 counsel, without explanation, did not present any testimony. After the panel dismissed the claim, the claimants filed a petition to nullify the award in the circuit court, which was dismissed for failure to arbitrate. The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal, holding that \u201ca plaintiff who presents no evidence before a medical malpractice arbitration panel has not satisfied the condition precedent of submitting his claim to arbitration prior to instituting court action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 45, 485 A.2d 265. In this case, claimants stood ready to present the evidence that they had, but were denied the opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\"><em>Watts, </em>143 Md.App. 293, 794 A.2d 723, involved a dental malpractice claim in which the claimant filed an expert\u2019s certificate that did not comply with C.J. \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(l)(i). Specifically, the certificate did not attest to a departure from the standard of care by the dentist that had proximately caused the injuries.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The HCAO dismissed the claim, in part, because the certificate did not contain the required attestation. On appeal, we analogized the claimant\u2019s \u201cfailure to file a certificate that meets the statutory requirements to the cases in which no certificate was filed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309, 794 A.2d 723. Because filing the required certificate was \u201can indispensable step in the arbitration process,\u201d we held that the claim had not been arbitrated before the HCAO and, therefore, could not be considered by the circuit court. <em>Id. </em>at 310, 794 A.2d 723. Here, the surviving claims, after dismissal of the negligence count, were based solely on lack of informed consent. No certificate was required. C.J. \u00a7 3-2A-04(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The lack of informed consent claim and derivative loss of consortium claim were dismissed based upon the chairperson\u2019s determination that claimants could not rely solely on Dr. Salvagno for expert testimony. Thus, the issue presented by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>appellants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss was whether the claimants\u2019 failure to designate their own expert witness constituted a failure to arbitrate. In other words, were the claimants entitled to proceed with arbitration relying on the expert testimony of Dr. Salvagno, an adverse party, to establish their claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\"><em>Miles, </em>224 Md. 156, 167 A.2d 117, involved a medical malpractice action filed prior to enactment of the Act. The decedent\u2019s family instituted a wrongful death action, alleging that the defendant physician had failed to diagnose the decedent\u2019s diabetes. The plaintiffs, relying on Md.Code (1957), Art. 35, \u00a7 9, \u201cintended to rely only on [the physician\u2019s] testimony [and not their own expert witness] to furnish the requisite evidence\u201d of negligence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 162, 167 A.2d 117. When the physician was called as an adverse witness during the plaintiffs\u2019 case-in-chief, the circuit court limited the scope of the examination to factual questions, and did not allow any questions that elicited \u201cthe expert knowledge of the [physician] as to the issues in [the case].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160, 167 A.2d 117. The circuit court\u2019s ruling was \u201cthat \u00a7 9 [did] not allow an examining party to elicit any <em>expert </em>testimony from an adverse witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). Because the plaintiffs were not permitted to summon another medical expert to establish the \u201cfact that the symptoms displayed by the [decedent] were those of a diabetic,\u201d they were unable to prove the malpractice claim and the circuit court directed a verdict in favor of the physician.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 162, 167 A.2d 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>In deciding whether expert testimony could be elicited from an adverse party, the Court of Appeals recognized that there was a \u201cdearth of authority elsewhere and there is none directly on point in Maryland. Moreover, there [were] divergent opinions on the question in malpractice cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160, 167 A.2d 117. The Court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">In some jurisdictions, when a defendant doctor is called by the plaintiff as an adverse witness for cross-examination, he may be used as a medical expert. In other jurisdictions, the plaintiff is limited to eliciting facts and the doctor may not be required to give an expert opinion. In 4 Jones, Evidence, \u00a7 927, the author states positively that the adverse party may not be subjected to an examination as an expert witness, citing <em>Hunder v. Rindlaub, </em>61 N.D. 389, 237 N.W. 915 (1931), a case characterized in 3 Wigmore Evidence (3rd ed.), \u00a7 916, as being \u2018unsound.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">A careful examination of the cases in other jurisdictions, and the several statutes construed by the courts in deciding them, leads us to the conclusion that the ruling of the lower court was erroneous. The defendant cites cases from at least four jurisdictions holding \u2014 under the particular \u2018adverse witness\u2019 statutes there involved \u2014 that an adverse party may be examined as if he were under cross-examination, but may not be requested to express an opinion based on his expert knowledge. However, the local statutes under consideration in the cases referred to were, without exception, much narrower in scope than the statute (\u00a7 9 of Art. 35) in this State, and we decline to follow the reasons adduced for the conclusions reached in these decisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">#</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">The obvious purpose of \u2018adverse witness\u2019 statutes is to permit the production in each case of all pertinent and relevant evidence that is available from the parties to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>action. Furthermore, it seems plain that the statute in this State is broad enough to encompass whatever expert knowledge the party called as an adverse witness may possess ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><em>Id. </em>160-61, 167 A.2d 117. The Court of Appeals concluded that the physician could have been questioned as to his expertise in regard to the issues in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The Act also does not prohibit reliance on the medical provider against whom the claim is made for expert testimony in an informed consent claim. It does, however, state that, for purposes of the certificate of merit requirement, a party \u201cmay not serve as a party\u2019s expert\u201d and a certificate \u201cmay not be signed by: ... [a] party; ... [a]n employee or partner of a party; or ... [a]n employee or stockholder of any professional corporation of which the party is a stockholder.\u201d C.J. \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(7)(i) and (ii). As indicated, no expert certification is required for lack of informed consent claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">We are persuaded that the claimants in this case were entitled to arbitrate the lack of informed consent claim without naming an independent expert witness. Like the plaintiffs in <em>Miles, </em>who \u201cintended to rely on\u201d the expert testimony of an adverse party to establish their claim, <em>Miles, </em>224 Md. at 162, 167 A.2d 117, they could rely on the testimony of Dr. Salvagno to prove those aspects of the claims that required expert testimony. Although it may not be prudent to rely on an adverse party for necessary expert testimony, we do not believe that it is prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Moreover, there is no indication in this case that the claimants failed to make a good faith effort to arbitrate their lack of informed consent claims or that, by their failure to designate an independent expert, they sought to avoid the arbitration requirement imposed by the Act. <em>See Manzano v. Southern Md. Hosp., </em>347 Md. 17, 698 A.2d 531 (1997) (failure to comply with scheduling order because of an uncooperative expert witness); <em>Karl v. Davis, </em>100 Md.App. 42, 639 A.2d 214 (1994) (counsel\u2019s \u201cmisplaced reliance\u201d on expert\u2019s deposition not rendered to a reasonable degree of medical probability did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>demonstrate a lack of good faith in \u201cappellant\u2019s approach to the mandated arbitration process\u201d). Failure to name an expert witness under the circumstances of this case would not constitute a failure to arbitrate, and, therefore, the circuit court did not err by denying appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">II. Vacating the HCAO Order</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">In its \u201cMemorandum Opinion and Rulings on Motions,\u201d the circuit court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">The HCAO director properly dismissed [the claimants\u2019] claim of negligence on June 6, 2001, for failure to file a certificate of qualified expert in accordance with [Cts] ... \u00a7 3-2A-04(b). The HCAO director dismissed [the claimants\u2019] remaining claims for lack of informed consent and loss of consortium on April 18, 2002 for the same reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">The circuit court concluded that, \u201c[i]n light of <em>Sard, </em>the [chairperson\u2019s] dismissal of [claimant\u2019s] lack of informed consent and loss of consortium claims, with no opportunity to present the case, was premature.\u201d It granted the claimants\u2019 petition to nullify the award and vacated the chairperson\u2019s order dismissing the informed consent and loss of consortium claims \u201cin accordance with [C.J.] ... \u00a7\u00a7 3-224(b)(3) and 3-2A-06(c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">C.J. \u00a7 3-2A-06(c) provides for the vacation of an award if \u201cthe court finds that a condition stated in \u00a7 3-224(b)(l), (2), (3), or (4) exists.... \u201d That section reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">(b) <em>Grounds. </em>\u2014 The court shall vacate an award if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-11\">(1) An award was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-12\">(2) There was evident partiality by an arbitrator appointed as a neutral, corruption in any arbitrator, or misconduct prejudicing the rights of any party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-13\">(3) The arbitrators exceeded their powers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-14\">(4) The arbitrators refused to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause being shown for the postponement, refused to hear evidence material to the controversy, or otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>so conducted the hearing, contrary to the provisions of \u00a7 3-213, as to prejudice substantially the rights of a party....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">In vacating the order of the HCAO, the circuit court found that the chairperson \u201cexceeded her scope of authority in light of the language of [C.J.] \u00a7 3-2A-04(b).\u201d Appellants contend that the circuit court erred because the chairperson did not exceed her authority and dismissal was not \u201ca completely irrational result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">To be sure, a circuit court\u2019s role in vacating an award of the HCAO is \u201cseverely limited.\u201d <em>Southern Maryland Hosp. Ctr. v. Edward M. Crough, Inc., </em>48 Md.App. 401, 407, 427 A.2d 1051 (1981) (citing <em>Ludwig Honold Mfg. Co. v. Fletcher, </em>405 F.2d 1123, 1127 (3d Cir.1969)). Under the Act, the \u201cGeneral Assembly has restrictively defined the grounds under which and the condition upon which a court may vacate an award and has expressly proscribed any possibility of substitution of a reviewing court\u2019s judgment for that of the arbitrator.\u201d <em>Nick-George Ltd. Partnership v. Ames-Ennis, Inc., </em>279 Md. 385, 389, 368 A.2d 1001 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">We agree that the circuit court\u2019s order vacating the chairperson\u2019s dismissal of the lack of informed consent claim and derivative loss of consortium claim was appropriate, but, because the arbitration did not go forward, there was no award to be nullified or vacated under C.J. \u00a7 3-2A-06(c). We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">As we previously discussed, appellants filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, Motion lor Summary Judgment.\u201d Rather than grant summary judgment, which presumably would have resulted in a liability finding in favor of appellants, the chairperson dismissed the lack of informed consent claim and the derivative loss of consortium claim without prejudice. Although the Court of Appeals, in <em>McClurkin v. Maldonado, </em>304 Md. 225, 231, 498 A.2d 626 (1985), said that a dismissal based on a failure to produce timely information in discovery is an \u201caward,\u201d the Court recognized in <em>Su v. Weaver, </em>313 Md. 370, 381, 545 A.2d 692 (1988), that \u201cthe award which is introduced into evidence at trial will reflect for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>party the arbitration panel found on each liability issue generated by the evidence.\u201d This is consistent with the Court\u2019s earlier observation in <em>Wyndham v. Haines, </em>305 Md. 269, 274, 503 A.2d 719 (1986), that the Act \u201crequires the panel to first determine the issue of liability\u201d and that the \u201cproper performance of this function obviously requires the presentation and evaluation of evidence.\u201d In <em>Crawford v. Leahy, </em>326 Md. 160, 166, 604 A.2d 73 (1992), the Court, in considering whether an \u201caward\u201d is divisible between liability and damages for the purpose of rejecting an award, said that \u201cthe arbitration award on the merits is clearly comprised of two essential and related determinations: liability and damages.... These combined determinations on the merits constitute the \u2018award\u2019 of an arbitration panel as defined by the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The arbitration process was designed to screen medical malpractice claims before they reach the courts. To permit access to the court without an award on the issue of liability, in the absence of statutory non-compliance or a party\u2019s failure to arbitrate in good faith, would frustrate the purpose of the statutory presumption of correctness of the award, which \u201cpromotes final resolution of the claim in one stage (arbitration) rather than two (arbitration and trial).\u201d <em>Su, </em>313 Md. at 381, 545 A.2d 692 <em>(citing Attorney Gen. v. Johnson, </em>282 Md. 274, 292 n. 17, 385 A.2d 57 (1978)). Without \u201ca thorough presentation of the case at the arbitration,\u201d <em>Id., </em>the ultimate issue, the health care providers\u2019s liability, and if liability, damages, has not been arbitrated. Thus, there is no award to be presumed correct. As Chief Judge Gilbert, writing for this Court in <em>Osheroff v. Chestnut Lodge, Inc., </em>62 Md.App. 519, 528, 490 A.2d, 720 (1985), stated: \u201cThe reason for arbitration is to arrive at a decision, not a non-decision.\u201d The dismissal of a case prior to the liability determination is, in effect, a non-decision because there is no award to vacate pursuant to C.J. \u00a7 3-2A-06(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Having determined that the chairperson should not have dismissed the case, and that there is no award under C.J. \u00a7 3-2A-05, we are confronted again with the question first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>asked in <em>Alfred Munzer, M.D., P.A., v. Ramsey, </em>63 Md.App. 350, 359, 492 A.2d 946 (1985): \u201cWhere Do We Go From Here?\u201d Does the case proceed in the circuit court without an award that is presumed correct, or should the case return to the HCAO for a liability determination based on the evidence presented?</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Although the question was not directly addressed, we find guidance in the case of <em>Manzano, </em>347 Md. 17, 698 A.2d 531. In <em>Manzano, </em>the chair of the arbitration panel dismissed the case for the failure to provide dates for the designated expert\u2019s deposition, in accordance with the scheduling order. As in this case, the claimant filed a notice of rejection of the arbitration award with the HCAO and an action to nullify the arbitration award in the circuit court, which was opposed by the health care provider. The circuit court found that the chairperson did not abuse his discretion and that the delay in providing the deposition date \u201cconstitutes a failure to arbitrate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22, 698 A.2d 531. We affirmed that decision, but the Court of Appeals reversed. Although a chairperson could properly sanction a party for a discovery violation, the imposition of the \u201cextreme sanction of dismissal\u201d was, under the circumstances, an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 29, 698 A.2d 531. The Court remanded the case to the circuit court \u201cwith instructions to remand the claim to arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20, 698 A.2d 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In the order dismissing the case, the chairperson refers to a \u201cfourth extension of time\u201d (three by the HCAO Director and one attributable to the scheduling order) in designating an expert witness. The chairperson also says that, \u201c[ t]o date, no certificate of merit has been filed.\u201d Of course, no certificate was required, and to require one would be contrary to the Act. The order also states that, \u201cwithout an expert witness, the Claimant cannot make a prima facie case for lack of informed consent.\u201d Again, the statute does not require the presentation of a prima facie case before the arbitration panel in order to gain access to the circuit court and the failure to present a prima facie case before the arbitration panel ordinarily does not constitute a failure to arbitrate. <em>See Wyndham, </em>305 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>269, 503 A.2d 719. The dismissal prior to arbitration could not, as a matter of law, be based on either the failure to file a certificate or a requirement that the claimants be able to present a prima facie case at arbitration. Dismissal could be based on the failure to comply with the scheduling order so long as the sanction did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">In this case, it is difficult to understand how the failure to designate an independent expert, when one was not required, would prejudice the physician or represent bad faith in regard to the arbitration process on the part of the claimants. To the contrary, in light of the chairperson\u2019s position on the need for an independent expert, it might have been to the physician\u2019s advantage to proceed with the arbitration and secure a favorable award. That award would not ordinarily be nullified or vacated based on a mistake of law. <em>See Hott v. Mazzocco, </em>916 F.Supp. 510 (D.Md.1996). On the other hand, if the claimants, relying on the physician\u2019s testimony to establish their claim, had failed in their roll of the dice, any prejudice to the physician could be avoided by precluding them from calling another expert. To apply the ultimate sanction under those circumstances was an abuse of discretion and the circuit court did not err by vacating the order dismissing the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
