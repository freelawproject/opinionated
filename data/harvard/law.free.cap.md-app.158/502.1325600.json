The issues before us are 1) what antecedent events trigger the obligation on the Fund to act; 2) what is the precise moment when that obligation on the Fund accrues; and 3) what enforcement mechanisms, if any, are possessed by the Commission if the Fund is unduly slow in acting.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">The Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">The appellee, Gerald E. Danner, was working as a carpenter when, on February 16, 2001, he was severely injured on a job at 300 Cathedral Street in Baltimore City. He was taken to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Unit, where he underwent surgery for a deep laceration to his left arm. As a result of the injury, he has lost the substantial use of his left arm and hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">On April 18, 2001, Danner filed a claim with the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. At the time of the accident, Danner was employed by Timothy Stivers, an employer who did not maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Accordingly, Danner was presented by the Commission with an Order for Information, requiring him to fill out a Claimant\u2019s Questionnaire and to send a copy of his answers both 1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>to the Commission and 2) to the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, the appellant in this case. Danner did so as of June 11, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">On June 6, 2002, a hearing on Danner\u2019s claim was held before the Commission. At that hearing, the Fund participated. The Fund had received legal notice of the hearing on March 19, 2002, and was actually listed as the \u201cInsurer\u201d for the otherwise uninsured Timothy Stivers. The Fund was represented by an Assistant Attorney General, who cross-examined Danner on behalf of the Fund. On June 14, the Commission issued an Award of Compensation to Danner. In the opinion announcing that award, the Commission made the following pertinent findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">A. <em>Stivers was mi uninsured employer;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">B. <em>Claimant sustained mi accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment by Stivers </em>on February 16, 2001;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">C. Claimant\u2019s disability is a result of the aforesaid accidental injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">D. As a result of the accidental injury, Claimant was temporarily totally disabled from February 16, 2001 to the present and continuing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">E. Claimant\u2019s average weekly wage was $600.00;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-10\">F. Claimant be paid temporary total disability benefits at the rate of $400.00 a week, beginning February 16, 2001 and continuing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-11\">G. The Employer pay causally related medical expenses in accordance with the Medical Fee Guide of the Commission; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-12\">H. The Commission reserves the jurisdiction to hold further hearings on permanent disability upon request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-14\">On the very day the award was issued, June 14, Danner 1) notified Stivers of the award, 2) sent Stivers a copy of the award, and 3) demanded payment under the award. When more than thirty days went by with neither payment nor any response forthcoming from Stivers, Danner made a request to the Fund to pay him in accordance with the June 14 award by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the Commission. The first request for payment by the Fund was made by a letter dated July 17, 2002. Follow-up letters of request were sent on August 23 and September 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Although present and participating at the June 6, 2002, hearing before the Commission, the Fund never appealed the June 14, 2002, award of compensation to Danner. The Fund never filed any issues with the Commission with regard to the award of temporary total disability benefits to Danner. The entitlement of Danner to receive the payment of benefits from someone was undisputed. The Fund, nonetheless, refused to make any payment to Danner.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The Penalty under \u00a7 9-728</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Aggrieved at the non-payment, Danner brought his plight to the attention of the Commission, which conducted a hearing on November 26, 2002. The Commission posed the issue before it as, \u201cIs the claimant entitled to sanctions for the Uninsured Employer Fund\u2019s failure to pay compensation?\u201d Applying Maryland Code, Labor and Employment Article, \u00a7 9-728, to the Fund, the Commission imposed sanctions in its order of December 11, 2002.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\"><em>The Commission finds </em>on the issue presented that the answer is \u201cYES\u201d; and finds <em>that the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund </em>shall pay unto Frederick W. Miller, Esquire, counsel for the claimant, a counsel fee in the amount of $500.00; and <em>shall pay unto the claimant a 40% penalty on all moneys due the claimant </em>beginning February 16, 2001 and ending November 12, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">It is, therefore, this 11th day of December, 2002, by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission ORDERED that <em>the Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund is hereby assessed penalties </em>as hereinabove set forth; and further ORDERED that the above-entitled claim be reset only upon request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">The Appeal to the Circuit Court</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">The Fund appealed that order to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. After unrecorded argument, the court granted Danner\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>cross-motion for summary judgment by the Fund. In its rulings, the Circuit Court did two things. It directed the Fund to pay to Danner the benefits that he had been awarded by the Commission. It also affirmed the Commission\u2019s imposition of penalties on the Fund for its dilatoriness in making payments to Danner. This appeal is from both of those rulings by the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">The Issues on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The Fund has expressly raised two contentions, both based, however, on a single underlying rationale.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">1. The court erred when it ordered appellant to pay compensation benefits previously awarded when the Commission award had not ordered appellant to pay benefits and when <em>appellant\u2019s unique statutory authority exempts it from a, duty to pay while an issue is still awaiting resolution by the Commission, or while an appeal is pending.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">2. The court erred when it affirmed the Commission\u2019s imposition of penalty and attorney\u2019s fees on appellant for failure to pay compensation benefits previously awarded because <em>the Fund is exempt from any obligation to pay benefits pending appeal as long as an issue is still pending before the Commission or while an award is pending on appeal in the circuit court.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">One of the two rationales offered by the Fund for the first contention and the only rationale offered by the Fund for the second contention is that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-10\">THE FUND IS EXEMPT FROM ANY OBLIGATION TO PAY BENEFITS PENDING APPEAL AS LONG AS AN ISSUE IS STILL PENDING BEFORE THE COMMISSION OR WHILE AN AWARD IS PENDING ON APPEAL IN THE CIRCUIT COURT.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">The Basis of the Fund\u2019s Obligation To Pay Compensation Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">We consider first the Fund\u2019s contention that it should not have been ordered to pay benefits because it had not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>named in the Commission\u2019s award of June 14, 2002, as the party required to make payments. Of course, it had not. The party named as required to make payments was Timothy Stivers. The Commission had expressly found that Stivers was Danner\u2019s employer at the time of the accident and further found that Stivers was an uninsured employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">The obligation of the Fund to assume responsibility for paying the benefits arose not from the Commission award <em>per se </em>but from \u00a7 9-1002, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">\u00a7 9-1002. Payment from Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">(a) <em>In general.- </em>\u2014 An award is payable out of the Fund in accordance with this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">(b) <em>Default. </em>\u2014 Unless an application for review has been timely filed under subsection (g) of this section or a notice of appeal timely served, <em>an employer is in default on a claim </em>by a covered employee ... <em>if the employer fails to:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">(3) <em>pay compensation in accordance with an award within 30 days after the date of the award.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">(e) <em>Application for payment from Fund. </em>\u2014 If <em>the employer does not pay the award </em>and does not notify the Commission of its objection to the award in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, <em>the covered employee ... may apply to the Director for payment from the Fund.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">(f) <em>Payment or application for review. On receipt of an application for payment, the Fund may:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-11\">(1) <em>pay the award; or</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-12\">(2) <em>apply for review under subsection (g) of this section. </em>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">In this case, it is undisputed that Stivers, who had been found to have been Danner\u2019s uninsured employer, 1) did not apply for a review or rehearing by the Commission pursuant to subsection (g), 2) did not file an appeal from the Commission\u2019s decision, and 3) did not pay the award within thirty days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>after the date of the award. The uninsured employer was, therefore, <em>ipso facto </em>in default.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">It is also unquestioned that Danner, in the wake of that default, properly and timely applied to the Fund for payment. It is further undisputed that the Fund 1) had not applied to the Commission for review under subsection (g) of any of the findings pertinent to the award of benefits to Danner and 2) did not pay the award. The fact that the Fund had not been named in the Commission\u2019s decision of June 14, 2002, is immaterial. Its obligation to pay the benefits was predicated on \u00a7 9-1002(f) and on events (the default by Stivers) that happened after the award had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">When Does the Fund\u2019s Obligation Accrue?</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The Fund\u2019s primary argument as to why it was not obligated to pay the benefits to Danner as of July of 2002 is that one of the issues that had originally been before the Commission at the June 6, 2002, hearing had not yet been finally resolved. In its opinion of June 14, 2002, to be sure, the Commission had listed six issues that were before it. It resolved all five of the issues pertinent to whether Danner was entitled to an award of benefits. It decided nothing with respect to the sixth issue, which was</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">6. Is NWJ Management Company, Inc. a statutory employer?</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">The \u201cunresolved\u201d issue was whether the NWJ Management Company, apparently as the principal contractor for the job at 300 Cathedral Street where Danner\u2019s accident occurred, was the statutory employer of Danner within the contemplation of \u00a7 9-508 and was, thereby, liable, in whole or in part, for the payment of benefits to Danner. At the hearing on June 6, 2002, the Fund was not prepared to go forward on that issue. It requested the Commission to reserve its judgment on that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">Although the Commission\u2019s decision on June 14 that Stivers was Danner\u2019s employer and was responsible for the payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>of benefits to Danner would appear to have resolved the issue, a further hearing was nonetheless scheduled for September 11, 2002. On September 13, the Commission, as a result of that hearing, issued the following order:</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Hearing was held in the above claim at Baltimore, Maryland on September 11, 2002 on the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">1. Is NWJ Management Company, Inc. a statutory employer in this claim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">2. Attorneys fee/costs</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">3. Penalties</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">The Commission finds on the first issue that the answer is \u201cNO\u201d; and finds on the remaining issues that the claim for attorneys fee and penalties is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">In a totally separate case, Case No. 03-C-02-11282, the Fund has appealed that order to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">The Fund\u2019s reliance on that yet unresolved appeal of a collateral issue as a justification for delaying the payment of benefits to Danner is without merit. The determination that Danner was entitled to an award for temporary total disability was a final order within the contemplation of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law without reference to the ancillary question of whether the NWJ Management Company was a statutory employer under \u00a7 9-508. As Chief Judge Gilbert pointed out for this Court in <em>Great American Insurance Co. v. Havenner, </em>33 Md.App. 326, 332, 364 A.2d 95 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-11\">We think the term \u201cfinal order\u201d or \u201cfinal action,\u201d within the ambit of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, means an order or award made by the Commission in the matter then before it, determining the issues of law and of fact necessary for a resolution of the problem presented in that particular proceeding <em>and </em>which grants or denies some benefit under the Act. <em>Flying \u201cA\u201d Service Station v. Jordan, </em>[17 Md.App. 477, 302 A.2d 650 (1973)]; Walterscheid, <em>\u201cFinal Judgment Rule\u201d in Workmen\u2019s Compensation Cases, </em>8 Natural Resources Journal 522, 528 (1968). <em>Thus, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number><em>the award of temporary total disability is a \u201cfinal order\u201d a,nd appealable.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The Fund tortures the language of \u00a7 9-1002(b), as it argues 1) that it does not assume the obligation to make payment until the employer (Stivers) is actually in default and 2) that the employer cannot be \u201cin default\u201d while an issue remains not yet finally resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">An Appeal Does Not Stay The Obligation to Pay Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">It is clear, however, that once it has been determined that an employee is entitled to benefits, the purpose of Title 9 generally, Workers\u2019 Compensation, and of Subtitle 10, the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, is to provide timely relief to the injured employee even pending the determination of ultimate responsibility for the payment of the benefits among 1) the employer, 2) the insurer, 3) the uninsured employer, 4) the statutory employer, or 5) the Fund. Such litigation could drag on for months, if not years, but the injured employee is in immediate need of daily sustenance. In <em>Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund v. Lutter, </em>342 Md. 334, 345, 676 A.2d 51 (1996), the Court of Appeals made the legislative focus clear.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">It is obvious that <em>the legislature\u2019s purpose </em>in creating the Fund <em>was to protect injured, workers </em>whose employers failed, either willfully or negligently, to carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance for them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">In <em>Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund v. Hoy, </em>23 Md.App. 1, 6, 325 A.2d 446 (1974), Chief Judge Orth described the purpose of the Fund as one of providing quick relief to the injured employee.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-11\"><em>We find the legislative direction to be unequivocal. </em>It clearly provides that the Commission, .. upon rendering a decision with respect to any claim for compensation against an uninsured employer ... shall ...\u201d impose the designated assessments. <em>The imposition, of the, assessments is not predicated, upon a,ny contingency but is mandatory </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number><em>when the Commission renders a decision with respect to any claim for compensation against an uninsured employer.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">This Court pointed out that the primary concern of the law is with the rights of the claimant and that the purpose of the Fund is to expedite the satisfaction of those rights.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">The provisions designate what awards are payable from the Fund and the procedure for payment. <em>They concern the rights of the claimant and the obligation of the Fund; they do not go to the rights or obligations of employers. ... </em>Patently, <em>the purpose of the Fund is to provide for the payment of awards against an uninsured defaulting employer.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">23 Md.App. at 7, 325 A.2d 446 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">In furtherance of that policy of providing quick relief for the injured employee, \u00a7 9-741 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">An appeal is not a stay of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-10\">(1) an order of the Commission requiring payment of compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">In <em>Bayshore Industries v. Ziats, </em>229 Md. 69, 77, 181 A.2d 652 (1962), Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e explained that the legislative purpose in not permitting a stay is \u201cthat of affording day to day support to injured employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">In <em>Petillo v. Stein, </em>184 Md. 644, 649, 42 A.2d 675 (1945), the Court of Appeals stressed that the legislative purpose in forbidding a stay of the payment of benefits is to insure the speedy and uninterrupted payment of benefits.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-13\">Such authority in the Legislature could not be denied consistently with <em>the principle upon which the general validity of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act had been adjudicated. \u201cIts design was to insure speedy, as well as certain, relief in proper cases within the scope of its application. That humanitarian policy would be seriously hampered if the weekly payments of compensation awarded by the commission could be suspended because of an appeal. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>In providing that an appeal should not be a stay, the statute was simply adopting <em>a 'necessary expedient to accomplish one of the important purposes for which it was enacted. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">If the employer, Stivers himself, could not have stayed the payment of benefits even by appealing the intrinsic merits of the award, <em>a fortiori, </em>the Fund may not stay the payment by appealing the more ancillary question of whether an alleged statutory employer (NWJ) should step into the shoes of the uninsured employer (Stivers) before the Fund itself is called upon to fill the breach. The uninsured employer (declared by the Commission to be Stivers) was obligated to pay benefits within 30 days of the award\u2019s being made, even if an appeal was pending or would in the future become pending. If that uninsured employer defaulted, as he did, the Fund was obligated to assume the payments forthwith. If an appeal by a direct obligor will not stay the payment of compensation, neither will an appeal by a derivative obligor.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">To the extent to which an appeal by the Fund as to the statutory employer status of the NWJ Management Company might be successful, moreover, the Fund will be fully protected by its entitlement to be fully reimbursed by NWJ for any payments to Danner which the Fund had advanced. Section 9-1003 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 If <em>the Fund makes payment to a covered employee </em>or the dependents of a covered employee as directed by the Commission, <em>the Fund is subrogated, to the rights of the covered employee </em>or dependents against the uninsured employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">(b) <em>Civil action; criminal prosecution. </em>\u2014 The <em>Fund may:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-9\">(1) <em>institute a civil action to recover the money paid under the award;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-10\">(3) refer the matter to the appropriate authority for prosecution under \u00a7 9-1108 of this title; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>(3) do both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Section 9-1004(a) further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 If <em>the Fund pays compensation to a covered employee </em>or the dependents of a covered employee, <em>the Fund is subrogated to the rights of the uninsured employer under this title.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">The bottom line is that employers, insurers, and the Fund are all better able to bear the cost of the law\u2019s delay than are injured workers, and it is this animating spirit that pervades the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law. The gift of one\u2019s daily bread need not abide a final judgment in <em>Jarndyce v. Jarndyce. </em>We affirm the decision of the Circuit Court that the Fund was obligated to pay the benefits owing to Danner and, indeed, had been so obligated since July of 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">Assessing a Penalty Against the Fund</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">When this case went back to the Commission on November 26, 2002, for a hearing on whether Danner was entitled to sanctions against the Fund for its failure to pay him the compensation awarded the preceding June 14, the Commission ordered the Fund to \u201cpay unto the claimant a 40% penalty on all moneys due the claimant beginning February 16, 2001 and ending November 12, 2002.\u201d The Commission applied against the Fund the penalty provision spelled out in \u00a7 9-728(b).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APD\"><em>If the Commission finds that an employer or its insurer has failed, </em>without good cause, <em>to begin paying an award </em>within 30 days after the later of the date that the award is issued or the date that payment of the award is due, <em>the Commission shall assess against the employer or its insurer a fine </em>not exceeding 40% of the amount of the payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"agl-dedup-0\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">On this contention, we agree with the Fund, but not for the primary reason argued by the Fund, that this penalty should not have been assessed against it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Fund argued against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>the penalty on the merits of its non-payment of benefits. It claimed that it was \u201cexempt from any obligation to pay benefits pending appeal as long as an issue is still pending before the Commission or while an award is pending on appeal in the circuit court.\u201d It asserted the pendency of its appeal on the statutory insurer issue was the \u201cgood cause\u201d that excused it from any penalty for non-payment. We have already fully analyzed and rejected that argument in disposing of the Fund\u2019s first contention. As soon as it was clear that Stivers had let 30 days go by without paying benefits, the Fund should promptly have assumed that responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">We hold, however, that the penalty provisions of \u00a7 9-728 do not apply to the Fund. Title 9, Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, generally, as well as Subtitle 7, including \u00a7 9-728, specifically, are exclusively statutory phenomena. Their content and their coverage are whatever the Legislature has clearly stated them to be. They do not have the growth potential of common law principles. That the Fund failed to do what it should have done does not, <em>ipso facto </em>confer on the Commission the authority to impose penalties on the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The parties expressly vulnerable to a possible fine or penalty pursuant to \u00a7 9-728 are 1) \u201can employer\u201d and 2) \u201cits insurer.\u201d The Fund is neither of them. Section 9-728 does not at any place refer to the Fund. The \u201cFund\u201d is defined by \u00a7 9 \u2014 1001(d):</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\u201cFund\u201d means the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The Fund is its own distinct and clearly labeled entity. It is not a sub-specimen of \u201cinsurer\u201d; nor is it even a part of Subtitle 4, dealing with \u201cInsurance Coverage.\u201d The Fund was created by and its contours have been fully fleshed out by Subtitle 10, dealing not with insurers but with \u201cUninsured Employers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">It further goes without saying that the Fund is not an \u201cemployer,\u201d insured or uninsured. Section 9-201 refers to employers generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">This title applies to the following employers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>(1) each person who has at least 1 covered employee; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\">(2) each governmental unit or quasi-public corporation that has at least 1 covered employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">An uninsured employer is defined by \u00a7 9-1001(e):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">\u201cUninsured employer\u201d means an employer who fails to secure payment of compensation to the covered employees of the employer in accordance with \u00a7 9-402 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">It is Subtitle 4 that deals with insurance coverage and \u00a7 9-401(b) defines precisely what an \u201cinsurer\u201d is within the contemplation of Workers\u2019 Compensation Law and the Fund clearly does not fit within that definition.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">\u201cAuthorized insurer\u201d means a stock corporation or mutual association that is authorized under the Insurance Article to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance in the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Self-evidently, moreover, the Fund could not, at the risk of punishable failure, be subject to the same time restraints that apply to \u201can employer or its insurer,\u201d for the obvious reason that the Fund\u2019s obligation, under \u00a7 9-1002(e), to assume the compensation obligation does not \u201ckick into gear\u201d until the antecedent failure of the \u201cemployer or its insurer\u201d to pay benefits is already a <em>fait accompli, </em>followed, at some unspecified later time, by the employee\u2019s application to the Fund for payment. Clearly the time limits established by \u00a7 9-728 were not intended to apply to the Fund and cannot logically apply to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">Whatever the equitable merit of the penalty assessment against the Fund may have been in some abstract or higher sense is immaterial. There is simply no statutory authority (whether there should be is a legislative and not a judicial concern) for the Commission to assess a \u00a7 9-728 penalty against the Fund. The Commission, a creature of statute, can do only those things the Legislature has specifically authorized it to do. It is not a knight-errant with inherent power to right every Worker\u2019s Compensation wrong. There are dragons that may go unslain.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>The Assessment of an Attorney\u2019s Fee</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">In its order of December 11, 2002, taking the Fund to task for its failure to pay the benefits, the Commission also ordered the Fund to pay to Danner\u2019s attorney <em>\u201ca </em>counsel fee in the amount of $500.00\u201d The Fund also appeals that part of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">That assessment was pursuant to \u00a7 9-734, \u201cFrivolous proceedings,\u201d which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">If the Commission finds that a person has brought a proceeding under this title without any reasonable ground, the Commission shall assess against the person the whole cost of the proceeding, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOB\">The applicability of \u00a7 9-734 to the Fund is far more problematic than was the clear non-applicability of \u00a7 9-728. For starters, the word \u201cperson,\u201d undefined in the statute, is far more generic and widely embracing than are such terms as \u201cemployer\u201d and \u201cinsurer.\u201d It would seem, at least at surface glance, that the Fund would be covered by the provisions of \u00a7 9-734. Although the Fund, to be sure, was not the \u201cperson [bringing] the proceeding\u201d (it was brought by the claimant, Danner), <em>Stevens v. Rite-Aid Corporation, </em>102 Md.App. 636, 643, 651 A.2d 397 (1994), <em>aff'd, </em>340 Md. 555, 667 A.2d 642 (1995), makes it clear that the assessment of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 9-734 is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">a sanction or penalty for filing frivolous proceedings <em>or willfully disregarding rulings by the Commission.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">(Emphasis supplied). Thus, the responding party to a Commission order, just as surely as the moving party, may be guilty of the unreasonable behavior that gives rise to a \u201cfrivolous proceeding\u201d within the contemplation of Rule 9-734. The rule applies to the pitcher and the catcher alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">In its <em>Stevens v. Rite-Aid </em>opinion, 340 Md. at 561-63, 667 A.2d 642, the Court of Appeals pointed out that both present \u00a7 9-734 and present \u00a7 9-731 were, in 1991, taken, without any substantive change, from the predecessor Art. 101, \u00a7 57. In fleshing out \u00a7 9-734\u2019s meaning of \u201cperson,\u201d the predecessor provision, as well as the present \u00a7 9-731, makes undifferenti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>ated reference to \u201cany party in interest.\u201d At a proceeding before the Commission, the Fund indisputably may be a party in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">It is unnecessary, however, to resolve the issue of the applicability of \u00a7 9-734 to the Fund because we hold that the Fund\u2019s recalcitrance did not, in any event, give rise to a frivolous or unreasonable proceeding within the contemplation of Rule 9-734. The Fund\u2019s position that it was not required to pay Danner\u2019s benefits until all issues arising out of Danner\u2019s claim had been ultimately resolved was, as we have held, without ultimate merit. It was not, however, so implausible or preposterous a position as to make the hearing of November 26, 2002, frivolous or unreasonable. It was wrong, but it was neither unconscionable nor ridiculous. It was, at least, an arguable position to take. We have found no reported Maryland decision that had ever dealt with this precise situation, so it cannot be said to have been well settled. It was a legal wrinkle that was worthy of being ironed out, as it now has been. Frivolousness, in contrast to Caesar\u2019s ambition, should be made of less \u201csterner stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMING OBLIGATION OF UNINSURED EMPLOYERS\u2019 FUND TO PAY COMPENSATION BENEFITS TO CLAIMANT AFFIRMED; JUDGMENT AFFIRMING IMPOSITION OF PENALTIES AND ASSESSMENT OF ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES REVERSED; COSTS TO BE DIVIDED EQUALLY BETWEEN APPELLANT AND APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-13\">. The fund does belatedly raise, for the first time in its reply brief, the rationale we rely upon for finding in its favor on the penalty issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
