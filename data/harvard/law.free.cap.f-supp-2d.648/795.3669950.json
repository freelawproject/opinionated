STANLEY, United States Magistrate Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b833-22\">Pending before the court is Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for an order permitting <em>ex parte </em>contact with former Actavis employees (docket # 153). The Actavis defendants have responded in opposition (# 156), and Plaintiffs have filed a reply (# 158). <em>Positions of the parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-23\">Plaintiffs contend that the court should apply the West Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct with respect to counsel\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>contact with the former employees of the Actavis defendants. (# 153, at 1.) They assert that in multidistrict litigation, the transferee court applies the law of the circuit in which it is sitting when ruling on discovery disputes. <em>Id., </em>at 4. Plaintiffs argue that the West Virginia Rules permit <em>ex parte </em>contact with former employees of an adverse corporate party. <em>Id., </em>at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-24\">The Actavis defendants respond that Plaintiffs\u2019 motion does not comport with either New Jersey or West Virginia law. (# 156, at 2.) They urge the court to adopt reasonable restrictions and protections for <em>ex parte </em>interviews of their former employees, including identification and notice of each former employee to be contacted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>and advance notice in writing to each former employee with specified information included. <em>Id., </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 reply notes that the Aetavis defendants\u2019 brief contains no discussion on the choice of law issue in MDL cases. (# 158, at 2.) They contend that the Actavis defendants\u2019 proposed restrictions and protections are meritless and lack a basis in law. <em>Id., </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">\n<em>Applicable Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">The court begins with the controlling statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407(a), which provides, in pertinent part, that transfers of cases to a multidistrict litigation court \u201cwill promote the just and efficient conduct of such actions.\u201d It appears to be well-settled that with respect to discovery disputes and other pretrial issues, section 1407 \u201crequires the application of the law of the transferee circuit where the motions are being considered.\u201d <em>In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) Products, </em>241 F.R.D. 185, 193 (S.D.N.Y.2007); <em>In re Automotive Refinishing Paint, </em>229 F.R.D. 482, 486 (E.D.Pa.2005) (\u201cWe are satisfied that the goals of \u00a7 1407(b) are best served by applying the transferee court\u2019s interpretations of federal law, rather than being bound by the precedents of the subpoena-issuing court.\u201d). As pointed out in <em>United States ex rel. Pogue v. Diabetes Treatment Ctrs. of Am., Inc., </em>No. 99-3298, 2004 WL 2009413, at *4 (D.D.C. May 17, 2004), \u201c[discovery disputes that arise in an MDL action are appealed to the circuit in which the action originated.\u201d Thus \u201cit is sensible for reasons of \u2018uniformity and intracircuit consistency\u2019 to apply the law of the forum where the MDL action is being adjudicated.\u201d <em>In re Automotive Refinishing Paint, </em>229 F.R.D. at 486 (quoting <em>Pogue, id.) </em>Accordingly, the undersigned will apply the law of the Fourth Circuit, as stated by decisions by that court, the district courts within the Fourth Circuit, and particularly this district and its Local Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">The issue of whether opposing counsel may have <em>ex parte </em>contact with the former employees of a party which is represented by attorneys is based upon concerns arising from the attorney-client relationship. The undersigned has located only one Fourth Circuit case which addresses the issue of the scope of the attorney-client privilege with respect to former employees, <em>In re Allen, </em>106 F.3d 582 (4th Cir.1997). In that case, the Fourth Circuit held that \u201cthe analysis applied by the Supreme Court in <em>Upjohn [Co. v. United States, </em>449 U.S. 383, 101 S.Ct. 677, 66 L.Ed.2d 584 (1981) ] to determine which employees fall within the scope of the privilege applies equally to former employees.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 606. In <em>Upjohn, </em>the Supreme Court extended the attorney-client privilege to corporate employees who provided information not available from upper-echelon management, which concerned matters within the scope of the employees\u2019 corporate duties. The information was needed \u201cto supply a basis for legal advice concerning compliance with ... laws, ..., [certain] regulations, ... and potential litigation in each of these areas.\u201d <em>Upjohn, </em>449 U.S. at 394, 101 S.Ct. 677. The employees were \u201csufficiently aware that they were being questioned in order that the corporation could obtain legal advice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In footnote 3, the Court declined to address the issue of former employees. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">\n<em>West Virginia</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">In the Southern District of West Virginia, our Local Rules provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqJ\">LR Civ P 83.7. Codes of Professional Conduct</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-10\">In all appearances, actions and proceedings within the jurisdiction of this court, attorneys shall conduct themselves in accordance with the Rules of Professional Conduct and the Standards of Professional Conduct promulgated and adopted by the Supreme Court of Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>peals of West Virginia, and the Model Rules of Professional Conduct published by the American Bar Association.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The Rules of Professional Conduct promulgated by the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia include Rules 4.2 and 4.3, which are relevant to the issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-6\">Rule 4.2. Communication with person represented by counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-7\">In representing a client, a lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of the representation with a party the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized by law to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-8\">COMMENT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-9\">In the case of an organization, this Rule prohibits communications by a lawyer for one party concerning the matter in representation with persons having a managerial responsibility on behalf of the organization, and with any other person whose act or omission in connection with that matter may be imputed to the organization for purposes of civil or criminal liability or whose statement may constitute an admission on the part of the organization. If an agent or employee of the organization is represented in the matter by his or her own counsel, the consent by that counsel to a communication will be sufficient for purposes of this Rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-10\">Rule 4.3. Dealing with unrepresented person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-11\">In dealing on behalf of a client with a person who is not represented by counsel, a lawyer shall not state or imply that the lawyer is disinterested. When the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the unrepresented person misunderstands the lawyer\u2019s role in the matter, the lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to correct the misunderstanding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">The Model Rules of Professional Conduct published by the American Bar Association are virtually identical to the West Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct. The ABA\u2019s Rule 4.2 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-13\">Rule 4.2. Communication with person represented by counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-14\">In representing a client, a lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of the representation with a <em>person </em>the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized to do so by law <em>or a court order. </em>[Emphasis indicates differences in wording.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-15\">The \u201cComment\u201d section of ABA Rule 4.2 reads somewhat differently from the West Virginia version:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-16\">In the case of a represented organization, this Rule prohibits communications with a constituent of the organization who supervises, directs or regularly consults with the organization\u2019s lawyer concerning the matter or has authority to obligate the organization with respect to the matter or whose act or omission in connection with the matter may be imputed to the organization for purposes of civil or criminal liability. Consent of the organization\u2019s lawyer is not required for communication with a former constituent. If a constituent of the organization is represented in the matter by his or her own counsel, the consent by that counsel to a communication will be sufficient for purposes of this Rule. Compare Rule 3.4(f). In communicating with a current or former constituent of an organization, a lawyer must not use methods of obtaining evidence that violate the legal rights of the organization. See Rule 4.4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-17\">The ABA\u2019s Rule 4.3 has an additional sentence not found in the West Virginia Rule.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>Rule 4.3 Dealing With Unrepresented Person</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-4\">In dealing on behalf of a client with a person who is not represented by counsel, a lawyer shall not state or imply that the lawyer is disinterested. When the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the unrepresented person misunderstands the lawyer\u2019s role in the matter, the lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to correct the misunderstanding. <em>The lawyer shall not give legal advice to an unrepresented person, other than the advice to secure counsel, if the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the interests of such person are or have a reasonable possibility of being in conflict with the interest of the client. </em>[Emphasis indicates additional sentence.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The parties are well aware of <em>Cole v. Appalachian Power Co., </em>903 F.Supp. 975, 979 (S.D.W.Va.1995), in which the undersigned held that <em>ex parte </em>interviews of five classes of an organization\u2019s <em>current </em>employees would be inappropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-6\">1. Officials of the organization with managerial responsibility;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-7\">2. Other persons whose act or omission in connection with the matter may be imputed to the organization for purposes of civil or criminal liability (those who have the legal power to bind the organization in the matter);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-8\">3. Those who are responsible for implementing the advice of the organization\u2019s lawyers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-9\">4. Any members of the organization whose own interests are directly at stake in a representation ...; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-10\">5. An agent or servant whose statement concerns a matter within the scope of the agency or employment which statement was made during the existence of the relationship and which is offered against the organization as an admission. However, <em>ex parte </em>interviews of employees who are \u201cmere witnesses\u201d to an event for which the organization is used (i.e., holders of factual information), are permitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">\n<em>Other Sources</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">In <em>Bryant v. Yorktowne Cabinetry, Inc., </em>538 F.Supp.2d 948, 953 (W.D.Va.2008), Magistrate Judge Urbanski considered ABA Model Rule 4.2 and the Virginia Rules of Professional Conduct and held that \u201calthough the Rules allow communication with former corporate employees, including those with managerial responsibilities, opposing counsel must tread very carefully to avoid discussing information which \u2018may reasonably be foreseen as stemming from attorney/client communications,\u2019 or to \u2018use methods of obtaining evidence that violate the legal rights of such a person\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-14\">In <em>Sharpe v. Leonard Stulman Enters. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>12 F.Supp.2d 502, 504 (D.Md.1998), District Judge Legg pointed out that \u201call of [the pertinent Maryland federal cases] agree that the Rule does not prohibit <em>ex parte </em>communication with former employees who do not possess confidential or privileged information, and whose statements or actions cannot be imputed to their former employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b836-15\">The court has also consulted the <em>Restatement Sd of the Law Governing Lawyers, </em>\u00a7 100 (2000), which includes the following comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-16\"><em>g. A former employee or agent. </em>Contact with a former employee or agent ordinarily is permitted, even if the person had formerly been within a category of those with whom contact is prohibited. Denial of access to such a person would impede an adversary\u2019s search for relevant facts without facilitating the employer\u2019s relationship with its counsel. A former employee or agent of a party may in some circumstances be within</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag0g\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>the anti-contact rule of \u00a7 99 or within the prohibited class of persons described in \u00a7 102, Comment d. For example a former employee who, as the lawyer knows, continues regularly to consult about the matter with the lawyer for the ex-employer is within Subsection (2)(a); thus no such employee may be contacted except as permitted under \u00a7 99.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-5\">* '!' *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-6\"><em>i. Limitations on otherwise permissible contact with an employee or agent. </em>A lawyer may not seek confidential information during the course of an otherwise permissible communication.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">\n<em>Ruling</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">It is apparent that the law within the Fourth Circuit and as set forth in relevant treatises is essentially consistent and permits counsel to conduct, under certain limited circumstances, <em>ex parte </em>interviews of an opposing party\u2019s former employees. Our Local Rules provide that attorneys should follow the West Virginia Rules and the ABA Model Rules. Given the participation of attorneys from throughout the United States, and the slight variation between the West Virginia Rules and the ABA Model Rules, the court has concluded that the attorneys in this MDL should follow the ABA Model Rules and comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">The Actavis defendants request that the court require Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys to give advance notice of their intention to contact former employees, and to send such employees a form letter approved by the court. (# 156, at 4-7.) The Actavis defendants cite the <em>Cole </em>case and <em>McCallum v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>149 F.R.D. 104 (M.D.N.C.1993), for the proposition that special warnings and notice are required. <em>Id. </em>Both <em>Cole </em>and <em>McCollum </em>address contacts with <em>current </em>employees, not <em>former </em>employees, a distinction with a decided difference. The court has found no case which requires such contact and notice with respect to former employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">It is hereby ORDERED that Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion (# 153) is granted to the extent that <em>ex parte </em>contact with former employees of the Actavis defendants is permitted by the ABA Model Rules and comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">The Clerk is directed to file this Order in 2:08-md-1968 which shall apply to each member Digitek\u00ae-related case previously transferred to, removed to, or filed in this district, which includes counsel in all member cases up to and including civil action number 2:09-cv-00837. In cases subsequently filed in this district, a copy of the most recent pretrial order will be provided by the Clerk to counsel appearing in each new action at the time of filing of the complaint. In cases subsequently removed or transferred to this court, a copy of the most recent pretrial order will be provided by the Clerk to counsel appearing in each new action upon removal or transfer. It shall be the responsibility of the parties to review and abide by all pretrial orders previously entered by the court.
