It is brought pursuant to a mandate contained in an act of the Massachusetts Legislature. 1970 Laws, ,c. 174. Massachusetts seeks to obtain an \u2022 adjudication of the constitutionality of the United States\u2019 participation in the Indochina war. It requests that the United States\u2019 participation be declared \u201cunconstitutional in that it was not initially authorized or subsequently ratified by Congressional declaration\u201d; it asks that the Secretary of Defense be enjoined \"froiD carrying out, issuing or causing to be issued any further orders which would increase the present level of United States troops in Indochina\u201d; and it asks that, if appropriate congressional action is not forthcoming within 90 days of this Court\u2019s decree, the Secretary of Defense be enjoined \u201cfrom carrying out, issuing, or causing to be issued any further orders directing any inhabitant of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to Indochina for the purpose of participating in combat or supporting combat troops in the Vietnam war.\u201d Today this Court denies leave to file the complaint. I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>The threshold issues for granting leave to file a complaint in this case are standing and justiciability. I believe that Massachusetts has standing and the controversy is justiciable. At the very least, however, it is apparent that the issues are not so clearly foreclosed as to justify a summary denial of leave, to file.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">STANDING</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">In <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Mellon, </em>262 U. S. 447 (hereafter Mellon), the Court held that a State lacked standing to challenge, as <em>parens patriae, </em>a federal grant-in-aid program\u2019 under which the Federal Government was allegedly usurping powers reserved to the States. It was said in <em>Mellon:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-8\">\u201c[T]he citizens of Massachusetts are also citizens of the United States. It cannot be conceded that a State, as <em>parens patriae, </em>.may institute judicial proceedings to protect citizens of the United States from the operation of the statutes thereof. While the State, under some circumstances, may sue in that capacity for the protection of its citizens <em>(Missouri </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>180 U. S. 208, 241), it is no part of its duty or power to enforce their rights in respect of their relations with the Federal Government. In that field it is the United States, and not the State, which represents them as <em>parens patriae, </em>when such representation becomes' appropriate; and to the former, and not to the latter, they must look for such protective measures as flow from that status.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 485-486.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">The \u25a0 Solicitor General argues that <em>Mellon </em>stands, as a bar to this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">Yet the ruling of the Court in that case is not dis-positive of this one. The opinion states: \u201cWe need not go so far as to say that a State may never intervene by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>suit to protect its citizens against any form of enforcement of unconstitutional acts of Congress; but we are clear that the right to do so does not arise here.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 485. Thus the case did not announce a <em>per se </em>rule to bar all suits against the Federal Government as <em>parens patriae, </em>and a closer look at the bases of the opinion is necessary to determine the limits on its applicability.-</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\"><em>Mellon </em>relates to an Act of Congress signed by the Executive, a distinction noted in other original actions. In <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania R. Co., </em>324 U. S. 439, we stated, \u201c[t]his is not a suit like those in <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Mellon, </em>and <em>Florida </em>v. <em>Mellon, supra, </em>[273 U. S. 12] where a State sought to protect her citizens from the operation of federal statutes,\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 446-447.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Massachusetts attacks, no federal statute. In fact, the basis of Massachusetts\u2019 complaint is the \u00bfbsence of. congressional action.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">It is said that the Federal Government \u201crepresents\u201d the citizens. Here the complaint is that only one representative of the people, the Executive, has acted and the other representatives of the. citizens have not acted, although, it is argued, the Constitution provides that they must act before an overseas \u201cwar\u201d can be conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">There was a companion case to <em>Mellon </em>in which the Court held that a taxpayer lacked standing to challenge the same \u25a0 federal spending statute. <em>Frothingham </em>v. <em>Mellon, </em>262 U. S. 447 (hereafter <em>Frothingham). </em>Two years ago we reconsidered <em>Frothingham </em>and found at least part of the ruling could- not stand the test of time. Concurring in the result, I stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-8\"><em>\u201cFrothingham, </em>decided in 1923, was in the heyday of substantive due .process, when courts were sitting in judgment on th\u00e9 wisdom or reasonableness of legislation. The claim in <em>Frothingham </em>was that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>federal regulatory Act dealing with maternity deprived the plaintiff of property without due process of law. When the Court used substantive due process to determine the wisdom or reasonableness, of legislation, it was indeed transforming itself into the Council of Revision which, was rejected by the Constitutional Convention. It was' that judicial attitude, not the theory of standing to sue rejected in <em>Frothingham, </em>that involved \u2018important hazards for the continued effectiveness of the federal judiciary/ to borrow a phrase from my Brother Hablan. A contrary result in <em>Frothingham </em>in that setting might well have accentuated an ominous trend to judicial supremacy.\u201d' <em>Flast </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>392 U. S. 83, 107.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">In <em>Flast </em>we held that a taxpayer had standing to challenge a federal spending program, if he showed that Congress breached a specific limitation on its taxing and spending power. ' As Mr. Justice Stewart stated in his concurring opinion, \u201c[t]he present case is thus readily distinguishable from <em>Frothingham </em>v. <em>Mellon, </em>262 U. S. 447, where the taxpayer did not rely on an explicit constitutional prohibition but instead questioned the scope of the powers delegated to the national legislature by Article I of the Constitution.\u201d 392 U. S., at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The erosion of <em>Frothingham </em>does not, of course, necessarily mean that the authority of <em>Mellon </em>has been affected. But if the current debate over <em>Frothingham </em>\u201csuggests that \u25a0 we should undertake a fresh examination of the limitations upon standing to sue,\u201d 392 U. S., at 94/ then surely the erosion of <em>Frothingham </em>suggests it is time to re-examine its companion case.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\"><em>Mellon, </em>too, has been eroded by time. In the spring \u2022of .1963 the Governor of Alabama moved for leave to file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>a complaint to prevent the President from using troops in Birmingham during civil rights marches there. Under the Solicitor General's reading of <em>Mellon </em>Alabama would have lacked standing to challenge such .an exercise of presidential authority. The Court denied Alabama relief, not because of <em>Mellon, </em>but because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-5\">\u201cIn essence the papers show ho more, than that the President has made ready to exercise the authority conferred upon him by 10 U. S. C. \u00a7 333 by alerting and stationing military personnel in the Birmingham area. Such purely preparatory measures and their alleged adverse general effects upon the plaintiffs afford no basis for the granting of any relief.\u201d <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>United States, </em>373 U. S. 545.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">In <em>South Carolina </em>v. <em>Katzenbach, </em>383 U. S. 301, <em>Melton, </em>was further weakened. In that case we denied-standi^ g to South Carolina to assert, claims under the Bill oi Attainder Cla\u00fase of Art. I and. the principle of separation of powers which were reg\u00e1rded \u201conly as protections for individual persons and private groups, those who are peculiarly vulnerable to nonjudicial determinations of guilt.\u201d 383 U. S., at 324. Yet we went on to allow South Carolina to challenge the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as beyond congressional power under the -Fifteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">The main interest of South Carolina was in the continuing operation of its election laws. Massachusetts\u2019 claim to standing in this case is certainly as strong as South Carolina\u2019s was in the <em>Katzenbach </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">Massachusetts complains,, as <em>-parens patriae, </em>that its citizens are drafted and sent to fight in an unconstitutional overseas war. Their lives are in jeopardy. Their liberty is impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-9\">Furthermore, the basis on which <em>Flast </em>distinguished <em>Frothingham </em>'is also present \u25a0 here. The allegation in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>both <em>Mellon </em>and <em>Frothingham </em>was that Congress had exceeded the general powers delegated to it by Art. I, \u00a7 8, and invaded the reserved powers of the States under the Tenth Amendment. The claim was not specific; but, as <em>Flast </em>held, if a taxpayer can allege spending violates a <em>specific constitutional limitation, </em>then he has standing. Here Massachusetts points to a specific provision of the Constitution. Congress by Art. I, \u00a7 8, has the power \u201cTo declare War.\u201d Does not that make this case comparable to <em>Flast?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">It has been settled, at least since 1901, that \u201cif the-health and comfort of the inhabitants of a State are threatened, the State is the proper party to represent and defend them,\u201d <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>180 U. S. 208, 241, in an original action in this Court. And see <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>Tennessee Copper Co., </em>206 U. S. 230, 237-238; <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>West Virginia, </em>262 U. S. 553, 591-592; <em>North Dakota </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>263 U. S. 365, 372-376; <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania R. Co., </em>324 U. S. 439, 450-451. Those cases involved injury to inhabitants of one State by water or air pollution of another State, by interference with navigation, by economic losses caused by an out-of-state agency, and the like. The harm to citizens of Massachusetts suffered by being drafted for a war are certainly of no less a magnitude. Massachusetts would clearly seem to have standing as <em>parens patriae </em>to represent, as alleged in its complaint, its male citizens being drafted for overseas combat in Indochina.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">JUSTICIABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">A question that is \u201cpolitical\u201d is opposed to one that is \u201cjusticiable.\u201d In reviewing the dimensions of the \u201cpolitical\u201d question we said in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>369 U. S. 186, 217:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-8\">\u201cProminent on the surface of any case held to involve a- political question is found a textually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the'impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or the impossibility of a court\u2019s undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; \u00f3r an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">1. <em>A textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department. </em>At issue here is the phrase in Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 11: \u201cTo declare War.\u201d Congress definitely has that power. The Solicitor General argues that only Congress can determine whether it has declared war. He states, \u201c \u2018To declare War\u2019 includes a power to determine, free of judicial interference, the form which its authorization of hostilities will take.\u201d This may be correct. But, as we stated. in <em>Powell </em>v. <em>McCormack, </em>395 U. S. 486, the question of a textually demonstrable commitment and \u201cwhat is the <em>scope </em>of such commitment are questions [this Court] must resolve for the first time in this case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 521. (emphasis added). It may well be that it is for Congress, and Congress alone, to determine the form of its authorization, but if that is the case we should make that determination only after full briefs on the merits and oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">. 2. <em>A lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving the issue. </em>The standards that ar\u00e9 applicable are hot elusive. The case is not one where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>the Executive is repelling a sudden attack.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The present Indochina \u201cwar\u201d has gone on for six years. The question is whether the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was a declaration of war or whether other Acts of Congress were its equivalent.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">3. <em>The. impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a hind clearly for nonjudicial discretion. </em>In <em>Ex parte Milligan, </em>4 Wall. 2, 139 (concurring opinion), it was stated that \u201cneither can the President, in war more than in peace, intrude upon the proper authority of Congress . ...\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The issue in this case is not whether we ought to fight a war in Indochina, but whether the Executive can authorize it without congressional authorization. This is not a case where we would have to determine the wisdom of any policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">4. <em>The impossibility of a court\u2019s undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of respect due coordinate branches of government. </em>The Solicitor General argues that it would show disrespect of the Executive to go behind his statements and determine his au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>thority to act in these circumstances. Both <em>Powell </em>and the <em>Steel Seizure Case (Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>343 U. S. 579), however, demonstrate that the duty of this Court is to interpret the Constitution, and in the latter case we did go behind an executive order to determine his authority. As. Mr. Justice Frankfurter stated in the <em>Steel Seizure Case:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_jC\">\u201cTo .deny inquiry into the President\u2019s po.wer in a case like this, because of the damage to the public interest to be feared from upsetting its exercise ' by him, would in effect always preclude inquiry into challenged power, which presumably only avowed great public interest brings into action. And so, with the utmost unwillingness, with every desire to avoid judicial inquiry into the powers and duties of the other two branches of the government, I cannot escape consideration of the legality of Execu^ tive Order No. 10340.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-6\">\u201cMarshall\u2019s admonition that \u2018it is <em>a constitution </em>we are expounding\u2019 <em>[McCulloch </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>4 Wheat. 316, 407] is especially relevant when , the Court is required to give legal sanctions to an underlying principle of the Constitution \u2014 that of separation of powers.\u201d 343 U. S., at 596-597 (concurring opinion).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">It is far more important to be respectful to the Constitution than to a coordinate branch of government.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">5. <em>An unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made. </em>This test is essentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>a reference to a commitment of a problem and its solution to a coordinate branch of government<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 a matter not involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>6. <em>The potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments of government on one question. </em>Once again this relates back to whether the problem and its solution are committed to a given branch of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">We have never ruled, I believe, that when the Federal Government takes a person by the neck and submits him to punishment, imprisonment, taxation, or to some ordeal, the complaining person may not be heard in court. The rationale in cases such as the present is that government cannot take life, liberty, or property of the individual and escape adjudication by the courts of the legality of its action.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">That is the heart of this case. It does not concern the wisdom of fighting in Southeast Asia. Likewise no question of whether the conflict is either just or necessary is present. We are asked instead \u25a0 whether the Executive' has power, absent a congressional declaration of war, to commit Massachusetts citizens to armed' hostilities on foreign soil. Another way of putting the question is whether under our Constitution presidential wars are permissible. Should that question be answered in the negative we would then have to determine whether Congress has declared war. That question which Massachusetts presents is in my view justiciable.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>It is said that \u201cthe notion has persisted, despite the results in <em>Baker v. Carr </em>and <em>Powell v. McCormack, </em>[395 U. S. 486] ... that there is a means for the Court to avoid deciding any case or issue upon the basis of a broad, highly general, and almost entirely discretionary principle of nondecision.\u201d Tigar, Judicial Power, The \u201cPolitical Question Doctrine,\u201d and Foreign Relations, 17 \u00fc. C. L. A. L. Rev. 1135, 1163 (1970), Yet no such discretionary principle, if germane to our problem, is applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">\u201cThe war power of the United States, like its other powers. ... is subject to applicable constitutional limitations.\u201d <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Kentucky Distilleries &amp; Warehouse Co., </em>251 U. S. 146, 156. No less than the war power: \u2014 the greatest leveler of them all \u2014 is th\u00e9 power of the\"Commander in Chief subject to constitutional limitations. That was the crux of the <em>Steel Seizure Case. </em>Concurring in the judgment in that case, Mr. Justice Clark stated: \u201cI conclude that where Congress hasTaid down specific procedures to deal with the type of .crisis confronting the- President, he must follow those procedures in meeting the crisis .... I cannot sustain the seizure in question because . . . Congress had [sic] prescribed methods to be followed, by the President . . . .\u201d 343 U. S., at 662. If the President must follow procedures prescribed by Congress, it follows <em>a fortiori </em>that he must follow procedures prescribed by the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">This Court has previously faced issues of presidential war making. The legality of Lincoln\u2019s blockade, was considered in the <em>Prize Cases, </em>2 Black 635, and although the Court narrowly split in supporting the President\u2019s position, the split was on the merits, not on whether the claim was justiciable. And even though that war was the Civil War and not one involving an overseas expedition, the. decision was 5 to 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>In the <em>Steel Seizure Case </em>members of this Court wrote seven opinions and each reached the merits of the Executive\u2019s seizure. In that c\u00e1se, as here, the issue related to the President\u2019s powers as Commander in Chief and the fact that all nine Justices decided the case on the merits and construed the powers of a coordinate branch at a time of extreme emergency should be instructive. In that case we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-5\">\u201cIt is clear that if the President had authority to issue the order he did, it must be found in some provision of the Constitution. And it is not claimed that express constitutional language grants this power to the President. The contention is that presidential power should be implied from the aggregate of his powers under the Constitution. Par-' ticular reliance is placed on provisions in Article II which say that \u2018The executive Power shall be vested in a President . . that \u2018he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed\u2019; and that he \u2018shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-6\">\u201cThe order cannot properly be sustained as an exercise of the President\u2019s military power as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. The Gov-, ernment attempts to do so by citing a number of cases upholding broad powers in military commanders engaged in day-to-day fighting in a theater of war. Such cases need not concern us here. Even . though \u2018theater of war\u2019 be an expanding concept, we cannot with faithfulness to our constitutional system hold that the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces has the ultimate power as such to . take possession of private property in order to keep labor disputes from stopping production. This is a job for the Nation\u2019s lawmakers, not for its military authorities.\u201d 343 U. S., at 587.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>If we determine that the Indochina conflict is unconstitutional because it lacks a congressional declaration of war, the Chief Executive is free to seek one, as was President Truman free to seek congressional approval after ' our <em>Steel Seizure </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab7\">There is, of course, a difference between this case \u00e1nd the <em>Prize Cases </em>and the <em>Steel Seizure Case. </em>In those cases a private party was asserting a wrong to him: his <em>property </em>was being taken and he demanded a determina- . tion of the legality of the taking. Here the <em>lives </em>and <em>liberties </em>of Massachusetts citizens are in jeopardy. Certainly the Constitution gives no greater protection to <em>property </em>than to <em>life </em>and <em>liberty. </em>It might be argued that the authority in the <em>Steel Seizure Case </em>was not textually apparent in the Constitution, while the power of the Commander in Chief to commit troops is obvious and therefore a different determination on justiciability is needed. .The <em>Prize Cases, </em>however, involved Lincoln\u2019s exercise of power in ordering a blockade by virtue of his powers as the Commander in Chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Since private parties \u2014 represented by Massachusetts as <em>parens patriae </em>\u2014 are involved in this case, the teaching of the <em>Prize Cases </em>and the <em>Steel Seizure Case </em>is that their claims are justiciable.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">The Solicitor General urges that no effective remedy can be formulated. He correctly points out enforcing or supervising injunctive relief would involve immense complexities and difficulties. But there is- no requirement that we. issue an injunction. Massachusetts seeks declaratory relief as well as injunctive relief. In <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Carr </em>we stated that we must detemine whether \u201cthe duty asserted can be judicially identified and its breach judicially determined, and whether protection for the right asserted can be judicially molded.\u201d 369 U. S., at 198. The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 2201, provides that \u201cany court of the United States .,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>may declare the rights . . . of any interested party . . . whether or not further relief is or could be sought.\u201d It may well be that even declaratory relief would be inappropriate respecting many of the numerous issues involved if the Court held that the war were unconstitutional. I restrict this opinion to the question of the propriety of a declaratory judgment that no Massachusetts man can be taken against his will and made to serve in the war. <em>Powell </em>involved just one man while this case involves large numbers of men. But that goes only to the mechanical task of making any remedy granted available to all members of a large class.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Today we deny a hearing to a State which attempts to determine whether it is constitutional to require its citizens to fight in a foreign war absent a congressional declaration of war. . Three years ago we refused to hear a case involving draftees who sought to prevent their shipment overseas. <em>Mora </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>128 U. S. App. D. C. 297, 387 F. 2d 862, cert. denied, 389 U. S. 934 (1967). The question of an. unconstitutional war is neither academic nor \u201cpolitical.\u201d This case has raised the question in an adversary setting. It should be settled here and now.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">I would set the motion for leave to file down, for argument and decide the merits only after full argument.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-7\"> An early draft of the Constitution vested in Congress the power to \u201cmake\u201d war rather than the power to \u201cdeclare\u201d war. The change from \u201cmake\u201d to \u201cdeclare\u201d was intended to authorize the President the power to repel sudden attacks and to manage, as Com\u00ed\u00fcander in Chief, any war declared by Congress. The change was not intended to give the President power to initiate hostilities and commit troops in war at his own will. The Framers were afraid' of unlimited executive power and \u201cresolved to so frame the \u2018 Constitution that no one man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us.\u201d A.

That State had been unaffected by the constitutional changes during the Revolutionary War and when Connecticut acquired a new constitution in 1818, Rhode Island was the only State which retained its original colonial charter as fundamental-law. The charter government was malapportioned and required ownership of $134 of real property for voting purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">From the early 1820\u2019s on there was - agitation for a new constitution in Rhode Island. Finally one constitution put to the \u201cvoters\u201d was passed. A \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d convention on November 18, 1841, put forth a new constitution with a Bill of Rights, better apportionment, and white manhood suffrage. Under the voting' requirements established by that constitution, all white adult males were allowed to vote for or against the \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d constitution. A majority of the voters ratified the constitution. Following the ratification, elections were held. Rhode Island then had two governments, one under the \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d constitution, the other under the original charter. The \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d government had a quick legislative session and did not attempt to change either the judiciary or the administrative ofiicers of the State. On June 26, 1842, the charter governor finally proclaimed martial law to establish his authority. <em>Luther </em>v. <em>Borden </em>arose out of Borden\u2019s attempt pursuant .to instructions. to arrest Luther. Luther brought action in the federal courts for trespass and Borden defended his actions as taken under martial law, lawfully proclaimed. Judge Story refused to give Luther\u2019s requested jury instructions, that the \u2022 \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d constitution was in full for,ce in June. 1842 because \u201ca majority of the free white male citizens of Rhode Island, of twenty-one years and upwards, had a right to reassume the powers of government and establish a written constitution; and that, having so exercised such right, the pre-existing charter government became null and void.\u201d The case then went to the Supreme Court and, faced with the question of which of the two governments was the lawful one, the Court held that determination was a political question, not for judicial determination \u2014 that the political question was for Rhode Island <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>to resolve or for Congress under Art. IV, \u00a7 4, of the Constitution, 7 How., at 38-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Dorr, who had been the governor under the \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d constitution, was tried and convicted of treason against the State in early 1844. In January he was offered a legislative pardon if he would take an oath affirming support for. the government in power. He refused since he believed the \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d constitution was still binding. In June 1845, he was unconditionally pardoned under a new governor. Finally, in February 1854, the legislature reversed and annulled Dorr\u2019s conviction. For a history of the Dorr Rebellion, see A.
