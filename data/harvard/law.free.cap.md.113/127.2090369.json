The other alternative remainder is then destroyed, and the testator\u2019s heirs at law cannot take, although X.\u2019s child dies before the end of the life estate; since the remainder to the heirs was limited to take effect only in the event of the death of X. without issue.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b154-6\">A remainder limited to take effect after a life estate is not made a contingent remainder by the fact that it may never take effect in possession on account of the possibility of the remainderman\u2019s dying before the life tenant.

The will, which was executed the 31st of March, 1896, disposes of a large estate to his wife, brother and sister, nieces and nephews, grandnieces and grandnephews, and certain nieces of his wife. Among the numerous devises and bequests is \"the following provision for his nephew, Joseph Zane, of Baltimore City, and said nephew\u2019s daughter and her children:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>\u201cI give, devise and bequeath te John Grace Suman, of Baltimore, Md., my real estate corner of Baltimore and \u25a0Carey streets, in said Baltimore, containing about fifteen hundred square feet of land, and the buildings thereon, and the sum of twenty thousand dollars, in <em>trust </em>nevertheless for the uses and purposes following, to wit: The annual income of said real estate and of said twenty thousand dollars shall be paid by said trustee quarterly to my nephew, Joseph Zane, of said Baltimore, for the full term of his natural life, and after his decease, the remainder of said real estate and said twenty thousand dollars shall go to Sarah Clarinda Zane, daughter of said Joseph Zane (my grandniece) during the term of her natural life, and to her children in fee simple, if she leaves issue; but if she dies without issue, at her decease said real estate and said twenty thousand shall- go to my heirs at law, discharged of all trusts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">. The residuary clause of the will is as follows: \u201cAll the nest and residue of my estate, real, personal and mixed, of which I shall die seized, and possessed or to which I shall be entitled at my decease, I give, devise and bequeath to my .heirs at law and their heirs by right of representation, in :fee simple,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In March, 1899, the testator executed a codicil, in which he confirms his said will, \u201cso far as this codicil is consistent \u25a0therewith,\u201d and after a nnumber of devises and bequests therein, disposes of the entire remainder of his estate as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">\u201cAll the rest and residue of my estate, real, personal and mixed, wheresoever it may be found and of whatsoever it may consist, I desire it to be divided into three equal parts, and disposed of as follows: .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">\u201cTo my nephew, Joseph Zane, one part subject to the same trusteeship and conditions as stated in my will of March 31, 1896.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-9\">\u201cTo my niece, Ellen Amelia Zane Clairage, one part. To my niece, Georgianna Kelley, one paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>John Grace Suman declined' to accept the trust created by the above provisions of the will and codicil, and William J. O\u2019Brien, Jr., of Baltimore City, was by the Probate Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, appointed trustee in his place, and the entire trust estate created by said provisions of the will and codicil, consisting, as now invested, of Baltimore City ground rents and mortgages on property in Maryland, and amounting to about sixty-five thousand dollars, was in possession of said substituted trustee at the time of the filing of the bill in this ease, and until he was, by an order of the Court below in this case, appointed receiver to take and hold the same until the further order of said Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Sarah Clarinda Zane, the daughter of Joseph Zane of Baltimore City, referred to in the above paragraph of the testator\u2019s will, who survived the testator, married Pinckney T. Payne, had one child, Pinckney T. Payne, Jr., and died on the 15th day of July, 1905, leaving her said child, an infant, \u2022and her husband surviving. Pinkney T. Payne, Jr., the infant, also died in the lifetime of Joseph Zane, of Baltimore, leaving surviving him his said father, Pinkney T. Payne. Joseph Zane, of Baltimore, is now dead, and after his death the trustee of one of the heirs at law of the testator filed the bill in this case against the testator\u2019s other heirs at law, William J. O\u2019Brien, as trustee-and as executor of a deceased heir at law, and Pinkney T. Payne, alleging, among others, the facts we have stated; claiming the property devised and bequeathed to Joseph Zane by the will and codicil, and asking for a construction of said will and codicil; the appointment of a receiver to take charge of the property, and for a partition of the same among those entitled thereto. Piukuev T. Payne demurred to the bill, and the three appeals in the record in this case are by different defendants from the decree of the Court below sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The contention of the appellants, in respect to the property mentioned in the above paragraph of the will, is that Pinckney T. Payne, Jr., the infant child of Sarah Clarinda <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Payne, having died before the expiration of the equitable life estate of Joseph Zane, of Baltimore, the estate he would have taken had he survived his grandfather, passed by the terms of the will to the heirs at law of the testator; and in respect to property devised and bequeathed to Joseph Zane, of Baltimore, by the codicil, that the testator did not intend that, after the death of Joseph Zane, it should go to said nephew\u2019s daughter and her children, according to the provisions of the will relative to the property therein given to said nephew.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">It is insisted that Pinckney T. Payne, Jr., did not, at the time of his death, have a vested' interest in the property, but in this we think the appellants are clearly wrong. The will gave alternative contingent remainders; first to the children of Sarah Olarinda Zane, if she left any, and if she died without leaving issue, then to the testator\u2019s heirs at law. During the life of his mother the interest of Pinckney T. Payne, Jr., was contingent, depending for its vesting upon his surviving her, and the remainder in favor of the testator\u2019s heirs at law was contingent upon Sarah Clarinda Payne\u2019s dying without issue. Upon the death of Mrs. Payne leaving a child, the only contingency upon which the remainder in favor of her children depended by the terms of the will had happened, and her child took a vested remainder, thereby destroying all possibility of a future interest in the heirs at law of the testator, whose remainder was limited to take effect only upon the death of Mrs. Payne without issue. It is said in 24 <em>Am. </em>&amp; <em>Eng. Ency. of </em>Law, (2nd ed.) 417, that, \u201cThe rule that a remainder cannot be limited after a fee simple does not forbid the limitation of two or more remainders in fee simple as substitutes or alternatives the one for the other, that is, on such contingencies that only one of the remainders can possibly vest. Such limitations are variously called contingencies with a double aspect, or gifts on a double contingency, or gifts or devises on two alternative contingencies. Each of such fees is a remainder in regard to the particular estate, but none is a remainder in regard to any other of them.\u201d The same rule is stated in 2 <em>Washburn on Real Property, </em>(6th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>eel.), sec. 1515, as follows: \u201cNotwithstanding a remainder limited after a remainder in fee would be void, yet two remainders may be so limited, though each a fee, as to be good, provided this is so done that only one is^to take effect, the one being a substitute for, and not subsequent to, the other. The consequence is, that, if the first takes effect and becomes vested, the other at once becomes void. Such limitation is said to be of a <em>fee with a double aspect.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">In the case of <em>Demill </em>v. Reid, 71 Md. 175, the testator devised certain property to his son, Henry J. Willett, in trust for his grandson, John Willett Belt, for life, \u201cand from and immediately after the decease\u201d of said grandson to the children of said Belt to be \u201cdivided between them as tenants in common.\u201d His will further provided: \u201cBut in case the said John Willett Belt should depart this life, without leaving a child or descendant thereof living at the time of his death, or in case he should have a child, children or descendants of the same living at the time of his death, and such child, children, descendant and descendants should all subsequently depart this life under lawful age, and without issue living at the time of his, her or their decease, then in trust that the said principal estate and property shall go to and become the property of the children of my said son Henry J. Willett,\u201d etc. Judge Miixeb, in disposing of that case said: \u201cAs to the character of the estates thus created, we have no difficulty. It is a clearly established general rule in the construction of wills that a limitation which may operate as a remainder shall not be construed as an executory devise. Here then is first a life estate given to the grandson, Belt, and upon his death alternative contingent remainders in fee are limited, first, to the child or children of Belt, if he leaves any which shall attain lawful age, or die before that time leaving issue, and failing this then to the children of testator\u2019s son Henry. If Belt had left a child who attained the age of twenty-one, or died before that time leaving issue, the fee would have vested in such child or issue, and such vesting would forever have excluded any possible future interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>in the children of Henry J. Belt. Their interest took effect only upon the failure of the preceding contingency. There are, therefore, here two contingent fees not limited to take effect the one.upon or after the other, hut'the one to take effect to the entire exclusion of the other, and the falling out of the contingencies is to decide which of the two is to take effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\"><em>Demill </em>v. <em>Reid </em>is so conclusive as to the character of the estates with which we are dealing in this cas\u00e9, and has been so frequently cited and relied on in this State, that it is not necessary to dp more than refer to some of the cases. <em>Larmour </em>v. <em>Rich., </em>71 Md. 369; <em>In re Banks\u2019 Will, </em>87 Md. 425; <em>Nowland </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>88 Md. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">It is claimed, however, that these cases do not apply because of the outstanding life estate of Joseph Zane-of Baltimore, and that the remainder in favor of the child and of Mrs. Payne could not become vested until after the death of the first life tenant. But that view is not warranted by any reasonable construction of the will. By its terms it was to be determined at the <em>death </em>of <em>Mrs. Payne </em>which of the alter-\u2019 native remainders was to take effect. If she left issue they were to take to the exclusion of the heirs at law of the testator. No <em>other time </em>was appointed, and the remainder to her children was not dependent upon <em>any other </em>contingency. It could not, of course, vest in possession until after the death of Joseph Zane of Baltimore, but the <em>right </em>of Pinckney T. Payne, Jr., to the possession of the estate after the death of the life tenant, became a <em>certain </em>and vested <em>Hght </em>upon the death of his mother. The fact that his possession of the property had to await the determination of the preceding life estate did not make the remainder a contingent remainder. It is said in 24 <em>Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, </em>(2nd ed.) 389, that, \u201cThe true criterion of a vested remainder is the existence in an ascertained person of a present fixed right of future enjoyment of the estate limited in remainder, which right will take effect in possession immediately on the determination of the precedent estate, irre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>spective of any collateral event, provided the estate in remainder does not determine before the precedent estate.\u201d In <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Handy, </em>78 Md. 108, Judge Bryan, after stating the test by which a vested remainder may be known, given in 1 <em>Preston on Estates, </em>70, adopts the following statement of the rule by the Chancellor in <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>25 Wend. 144: \u201cEor where a remainder is so limited as to take effect in possession, if ever, immediately iipon the determination of a particular estate, which estate is to determine by an event which must unavoidable happen by the efflux of time, the remainder is vested in interest as soon as the remainder-man'is <em>in esse </em>and ascertained; provided nothing but his own death before the determination of the particular estate will prevent such remainder from vesting in possession.\u201d In <em>Fearns on Contingent Remainders, </em>star page 216 (.Butler\u2019s ed.), the author says: \u201cIt is not the uncertainty of ever taking effect in possession that makes a remainder contingent; for to that, every remainder for life or in tail is or must he liable; as the remainderman may die, or die without issue before the tenant for life. The present capacity of taking effect in possession, if the possession were to become vacant, and not the certainty that the possession will become vacant before the estate limited in remainder determines, universally distinguishes a vested remainder from one that is contingent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Applying the rule as stated to the remainder of Pinckney T. Payne, Jr., if the preceding life estate.had determined any time after his mother\u2019s death and before his death, he would have come into possession of the estate, and his remainder after his mother\u2019s death was, therefore, a vested remainder, and being in fee, upon his death before the expiration of the life estate of Joseph Zane, it passed, so far as it is real estate, to his heirs at law, and to the extent that it is personal property, to his personal representative, subject to said life estate. Cox v. <em>Handy; In re Roger\u2019s Estate, </em>97 Md. 674; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>102 Md. 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>In respect to the one-third of the residue of the estate devised and bequeathed by the codicil to Joseph Zane \u201csubject to the same trusteeship and conditions as stated in my will of March 31, 1896,\u201d it is claimed by the appellants that these words do not mean that Joseph Zane\u2019s daughter and her children were to have the property after his death according to the terms of the devise and bequest to them in the will, but we think they are also wrong in this contention. By his will the testator gave all the rest and residue of his estate to his heirs at law. This provision of his will was, as was said in <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>104 Md. 30, changed by his codicil, in Avhich, after making a number of additional bequests, he directed all the rest and residue of his estate, of every kind, to be divided into three equal parts, and one of these parts he gave to his said nepheAV, Joseph Zane, as stated, and the other two parts he gave to his two nieces, one part to each. He thereby intended to dispose of his entire estate, and to give the whole residue thereof, after the devises and bequests preAdously made, to these two nieces and his said nepheAv; yet if the contention of the appellants be sound the testator did not dispose of the remainder of the third given to his nepheAv after the expiration of his life estate, and to that extent he died intestate, for it must be conceded that his said nephew took only an equitable life estate in the third devised and bequeathed to him. There is nothing in the will to justify the suggestion that the testator only intended to dispose of a life estate in the third gWen to this nephew. On the contrary, the whole tenor of his will and codicil clearly indicates his intention to dispose of his entire estate, and to give to his nephew\u2019s daughter and her children, if she left any, the share he was to enjoy for his life only. What, under the circumstances do the word's \u201csubject to the same trusteeship and conditions stated in my will of March 31, 1896,\u201d naturally suggest? Can we infer that the testator, when disposing of his <em>entire </em>estate, meant to limit the d\u00e9vise and bequest to a life estate ? There is nothing in either the will or codicil indicating a desire on the part of the testator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>to withhold from his nephew\u2019s daughter and her children the share intended for him. The only reasonable conclusion, in the absence of some provision in the will or codicil indicating a contrary intention, is that the testator, in disposing of the residue of his estate, and desiring his nephew to have one-third of it, had in mind the provisions of his will relative to the previous gift to him, and that he intended all of those provisions to apply also to his share of the rest and residue of his estate. In <em>Lavender </em>v. <em>Rosenheim, </em>110 Md. <em>154. </em>Judge Pearce quotes the following statement of Judge Alvey, in <em>Dulany </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>72 Md. 75: \u201cIt is very clear, from all the provisions of the will, that the testator intended to dispose of all of his estate, and that he did not contemplate the possibility of a state of intestacy as to any part of his estate, <em>with respect to any event </em>or from any interval of time. * * * As said by Lord Alvanley, M. R.., in <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Booth, 4 </em>Vesey, 407, \u2018Every intendment is to be made against holding a man to die intestate, who sits down to dispose of the residue of his property.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The appellants rely mainly on the case of <em>Buchanan </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>64 Md. 306. In that case Governor Lloyd by his will, after making provision for his widow, disposed of his estate to his sons and daughters and his daughters\u2019 children. The shares of his daughters were left in trust. He devised and bequeathed to his three sons, Edward, James M. and Daniel Lloyd, in trust for his daughter, Elizabeth Tayloe Winder, for life, with remainder to her children, a farm and $5,000.00. Similar provisions were made for his other daughters, and after various bequests of personal property, the testator, by a residuary clause of his will, bequeathed all the residue of his personal estate to his three sons, to be equally divided between them. By a codicil, the testator, after ratifying his will, except so far as altered by the codicil, bequeathed to his two sons, Edward and James M. Lloyd, \u201cin special trust, agreeably with the provisions of my said will, the sum of $5,000.00 (in addition to the $5,000.00 devised in my said will) ;\u2014for the use and benefit of my said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>daughter, Elizabeth Tayloe Winder.\u201d After Mrs. Winder\u2019s death her children claimed the $5,000.00 bequeathed to her by the codicil. Judge Alvey interpreted the words \u201cin special trust, agreeably with the provisions of my said will\u201d to mean \u201cupon the same trust as that specified in the will, namely, to hold for the life of Mrs. Winder and no longer,\u201d and then says, \u201cand the question is whether, upon the will and codicil together, there is such manifest intention, by implication or otherwise, that the property bequeathed by the codicil for the life of Mrs. Winder, should go to her children at her death, as in the preceding devise by the will, and thus withdraw the property from the operation of the residuary clause of the will? Of course, it is very clear that if there be no such limitation over in favor of the children, the property passed under the residuary clause; for it is too obvious to admit of serious question that Mrs. Winder did not take more than an equitable life estate in the property given her by this particular clause of the codicil. It is certainly a well settled principle that the will and codicil are to be construed together as one instrument, and are to be reconciled as far as practicable. But what is plainly given by the will is not to be revoked or withdrawn by doubtful or ambiguous expressions employed' in the codicil. Here the effect is by construction, and in total absence of plain words expressive of any such intention, to give an effect and operation to a clause in the codicil whereby the residuary clause of the will must be curtailed of the subject matter of its operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">It is apparent that there is a marked difference in the words employed in the two wills. Following the construction adopted by Judge Alvey, if the testator in this case had said, subject to the same trusteeship as stated in my will of March 31, 1896, it would have been interpreted to mean that the property was to be held in trust for the life of Joseph Zane. But that is not what the testator said. The gift to his nephew was not subject to the same trusteeship as stated in the will, l}ut subject to the same trusteeship and conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>as stated in the will. If subject to the same trusteeship as stated in the will would have meant that his nephew was only to have an equitable life estate, what significance is to be given to the additional qualification that it was to be subject also to the same <em>conditions </em>as stated in the will? It can only mean that the devise and bequest was to be subj ect to all the terms and provisions contained in the will relating to the property there given to his nephew. Morever, in the case referred to the effect of the claim of Mrs. Winder\u2019s children would have been to withdraw the $5,000.00 from the operation of the residuary clause of the will, by which the testator bequeathed the residue of his personal estate to his sons, and it was that feature of the case that largely controlled the Court in reaching its conclusion. Here the effect of the contention of the <em>appellants </em>would be, not only to withdraw the fee in the third' given to Joseph Zane from the operation of the residuary clause of the codicil, but to also defeat the obvious purpose of the testator to dispose of his entire estate. So if we adopt the reasoning of the Court in <em>Buchanan </em>v. Lloyd, it furnishes ample authority for withholding our assent to the claim of the appellants in this case, and in the later case of <em>Buchanan </em>v. Lloyd, 88 Md. 642, the Court, in construing a somewhat similar clause in the codicil to said will in favor of another daughter of the testator, held that the name of the legatee in the codicil was used in a representative sense and meant the legatee and her chi] dren.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">After carefully considering all the provisions of the will and codicil in this case, we can reach no other conclusion than that Pinckney T. Payne, Jr., the infant child of Sarah Clarinda Payne, took, at his mother\u2019s death, a vested remainder in the property devised and bequeathed by the will and codicil in trust for Joseph Zane, of Baltimore City, for life, etc., and that the heirs at law of the testator have no interest in this property. The decree of the Court below, sustaining the demurrer of the appellee and dismissing the bill; must, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs, in each appeal.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
