At the same time the appellant Charles E. Carroll, who sues by his father and next friend, Walter L. Carroll, was a caddy at the golf course. On the day mentioned the appellant and a companion named Herbert Gallagher were in the woods j ust off the sixth tee, hunting for lost golf balls, when, without any apparent reason and to their surprise, they were called to' by Ward, who had a shotgun in his hands, and on account of his threatening attitude the boys ran. When they had gotten off the club property, on Taylor Avenue, Ward fired a shot, neither of the boys being hit. The} then ran into the woods, where they remained about a. half hour, when they came out on the road, saw Ward, and \u201cstarted to run back into the woods,\u201d when Ward shot at them again, this time hitting both hoys, the appellant getting \u2022one shot in the right arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The appellant testified that he and his companion were off the club property when both shots were fired, Ward, when he fired the second time, standing by his car on Taylor Avenue. Ward, who was the only one who testified =as to the nature of his employment, said his duties were \u201cto see that the greens are kept up, fertilized, watered and so forth,\u201d and that included the care of fairways and tees. He said his duties at the club did not require him to' carry a gun, but that he did need it on the farm adjoining the club property. It appears that he lived on a farm adjacent <em>to </em>the club but in no way connected with it, and that he carried the gun because he \u201chad three hundred dollars worth of hogs killed on the farm three weeks before the accident.\u201d He does not attempt to give any explanation of the shooting of the boys because of any connection they had with the loss of his hogs. His excuse for shooting was, \u201cby the action of the hoys I did take the gun and shoot over them to- scare them off.\u201d He said he had shot the gun for the purpose \u2022of helping to clear the hoys away from the course. There is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>no evidence that his duties at the club required him to carry a gun; in fact he said they did not, and the only reason given was the fact that his hogs had been killed. He did not get near enough to the boys to recognize them, though the appellant had been a caddy at the club for more than a year. Waa*d was convicted of an assault on the boys in the Circuit Coux*t for Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">At the conclusion of the plaixxtiff\u2019s case, the defendant offex\u2019ed a prayer for a directed verdict axxd, the same having-been granted, verdict and judgment were entered accordingly; and from the judgment for the appellee this appeal was taken, an exception having been reserved by the appellant to the granting of the prayer. It is this actioxx of the court which makes necessary a review of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The question in all such cases as this is whether the agent or employee was at the time of the wrong complained of acting within the scope of his employment or agency. The-rule, as laid down by this court ixx <em>Cate v. Shaum, </em>51 Md. 299, 308, is \u201cthat the master is responsible for the wrongful acts of his servant, evexx though they be wilful or reckless, if the act done by the servant be within the scope of his employment and in furtherance of his master\u2019s business.\u201d See <em>Evans v. Davidson, </em>53 Md. 245, 249; <em>Barabasz v. Kabat, </em>86 Md. 23, 33; <em>Holler v. Ross, </em>68 N. J. L. 324, 59 L. R. A. 943; <em>Evers v. Krouse, 70 </em>N. J. L. 653, 66 L. R. A. 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The appellant, in support of his contention that the assault made by Ward in this case was within the scope of his-employment as greenskeeper for the appellee, and should have been submitted to the jury, relies upon the decisions of this court in <em>Consolidated Ry. Co. v. Pierce, </em>89 Md. 495, 503; <em>Deck v. Balto. &amp; O. R. Co., </em>100 Md. 168, 182; <em>Balto. &amp; O. R. Co. v. Strube, </em>111 Md. 119, 127; <em>Evans v. Davidson, </em>53 Md. 245; <em>Wilson Amusement Co. v. Spangler, </em>143 Md. 98, 104; <em>Jones v. Sherwood Distilling CVo., </em>150 Md. 24, 38; <em>Goldman Stores v. Bugg, </em>156 Md. 36; ixx all of which it is ixx effect stated that the questions of agency and scope of\" employment are generally questioxxs for the jury. Thex*e are-cases, however, in this state and elsewhere, in which, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>the evidence, the courts have held it to be a matter of law. It cannot be assumed that, merely because an employee commits a tort while in the employ of his master, the act complained of was within the scope of the servant\u2019s employment. The burden is on the plaintiff to prove the fact. <em>Tolchester Imp. Co. v. Steinmeier, </em>72 Md. 313, 316; <em>Phila., W. &amp; B. R. Co. v. Stumpo, </em>112 Md. 571, 578; <em>Obertoni v. Boston &amp; M. R. R., </em>186 Mass. 481, 67 L. R. A. 422; <em>Holler v. Ross, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">While usually, in cases of this sort, the circumstances are such as to make it debatable as to whether the servant\u2019s acts were committed in the course of his employment, it is not always so, and the court may be called upon to decide as a matter of law whether there is any legally sufficient evidence of the fact relied on to sustain a recovery. The test as laid down by this court in <em>Consolidated Ry. Co. v. Pierce, </em>89 Md. 495, 504, adopting the rule stated in <em>Ritchie v. Waller, </em>63 Conn. 155, 27 L. R. A. 161, was, \u201cWhen the servant\u2019s deviation from the strict course of his employment or duty is slight and not unusual, the court may determine as a matter of law that he is still executing the master\u2019s business, and if the deviation is very marked and unusual it may determine the contrary.\u201d \u201cWhere only one legal inference may be drawn from the facts the court- should decide it, but where differing legal inferences may reasonably be drawn it is a question for the jury.\u201d <em>Mechem on Agency </em>(2nd Ed.), sec. 1982; 18 <em>R. C. L. </em>795.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The question presented to us is, Was there legally sufficient, evidence that the greenskeeper, Ward, when he pursued and shot the appellant, was acting within the scope of his employment and was he then engaged in the furtherance of his master\u2019s business; or did he step* aside from and abandon that business in the pursuit of his own wilful and wanton impulse ? There is no proof in the record that his: occupation at the golf club required him to carry a shotgun, or that his employer knew of it, or that policing the golf course was among his duties, or that chasing caddies, who had as good a right on the grounds as he, was expected or required of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>him; nor is there any evidence that the caddies were under his control or supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">It is in the record that his excuse for having a gun was the loss of the hogs which he had on an adjoining farm; that his farm had no connection with the club, and whatever there was on or connected with the farm was his and not the club\u2019s business. \u201cWhere there is not merely deviation, but a total departure from the course of the master\u2019s business, so that the servant may be said to be on a \u2018frolic of his own,\u2019 the master.is no longer answerable for the servant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Pollock on Torts, </em>76; <em>Joel v. Morison, </em>6 Car. &amp; P. 501, 172 Eng. Reprint, 1838; <em>Tolchester Beach Imp. Co. v. Steinmeier, </em>72 Md. 313, 316; <em>Phila. W. &amp; B. R. Co. v. Stumpo, </em>112 Md. 571, 578; <em>Central Ry. Co. v. Peacock, </em>69 Md. 257, 262. There is no evidence in this ease that as greenskeeper Ward had charge of the appellee\u2019s property, or had any authority to drive trespassers or others from the property, and, even if he had been \u201cput in charge of the property\u201d that fact \u201cwould not justify him in .shooting any one who interferes with it and the master will not be liable where the servant shoots simply to' give vent to- his own personal malice or resentment; and certainly not in any case in which the shooting had no connection with or relation to the act which the servant was authorized to perform.\u201d <em>M&amp;chem on Agency </em>(2nd Ed.), sec. 1979, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The cases in which the employer has been held liable have generally been those of police officers, watchmen, and railroad trainmen. In such cases the torts of the servant are usually so related to his employment or occupation as to leave to the jury the determination of the fact of the relation of the servant\u2019s torts to the scope of his employment and to the furtherance of the master\u2019s business. In the instant case, in our opinion the record fails to show anything except the exhibition of the personal malice, wantonness, and bad temper of the servant, and that, inexcusable as it was, it bore no relation to the scope of his employment or to the appellee\u2019s business, and the appellee\u2019s prayer was, therefore, properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>The record shows that in the course of the trial the appellant reserved live exceptions to rulings of the trial court on questions of evidence. In the brief and at the argument the only question discussed was the exception to the granting of the appellee\u2019s demurrer prayer. The record is headed, \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Bill of Exceptions,\u201d singular, not plural, and none of them are numbered. By Acts 1937, ch. 224, amending Code, 1924, art. 5, sec. 12, it is provided that \u201cthe bill or bills of exceptions shall be headed at the beginning Plaintiff\u2019s (or Defendant\u2019s as the case may be) Bill (or Bilis) of Exceptions and beneath that, if there should be mor-i than one exception, should appear the subheading \u201cException 1,\u201d etc. As the appellant has presented but one exception, that to the ruling on the appellee\u2019s prayer, we assume that this constituted his \u201cBill of Exceptions!,\u201d though we find no reversible error in any of the rulings on the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs to the appellee.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
