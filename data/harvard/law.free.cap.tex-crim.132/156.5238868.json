We are unable to bring ourselves to believe that we could so hold. It is clear that if one be charged with a sale without permit, as under Sec. 4, Art. 1 of the Act, this fact should be so averred; and it also seems clear that if one be charged with selling without a package permit, and such be the averment in the complaint, he could not be convicted upon proof that he sold without a medicinal permit, and vice versa. The proposition seems almost self-evident. The principle is the same as announced and discussed in Todd v. State, 89 Texas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Crim. Rep., 99. It appears clear from the averments in- the several counts of the complaint that it was the purpose of the pleader to charge an offense committed in a dry area, hence our former opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
