The law (art. 691, P. C., 1925) authorizing the issuance of a search warrant to search for illegal possession or illegal sale of liquor was expressly repealed by the Liquor Control Act, Acts 1935, 44th Leg., 2nd C. S., p. 1795, Sec. 49. No legal authority existed at the time of the commission of the offense for the issuance of a search warrant to search appellant\u2019s residence. Therefore the testimony showing what the officers found as a result of the search was inadmissible as evidence against her. See art. 727a, C. C. P. (Acts 1925, 39th Leg., Ch. 49, Sec. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">It is therefore ordered that the judgment of the trial court be and the same is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-15\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b539-16\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
