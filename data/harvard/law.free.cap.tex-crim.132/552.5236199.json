When the witness went to the cash register to put in the money the appellant presented a pistol and said: \u201cLet me have it; it is a stick-up; don\u2019t give me any trouble.\u201d Hardy then took eighteen dollars and some cents out of the cash register and gave it to the appellant. The witness said he offered no resistance because the appellant had a pistol and he was afraid of losing his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-14\">Kelly, a police officer, testified that he arrested the appellant at 3:25 o\u2019clock in the morning on a certain street in the city of Houston; that at the time of his arrest the appellant had a loaded pistol on his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-15\">Appellant appeared without an attorney on the trial of his case. He testified and denied the commission of the offense with which he is charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-16\">Accompanying the record is a motion for a writ of certiorari based upon the ground that.the judgment of the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>contains the statement that \u201cthe defendant Tommie Thomas appeared in person and by counsel,\u201d, when as a matter of fact the appellant had no counsel to represent him. The record fails to show that any demand was made by appellant for the appointment of counsel or that the court refused to appoint an attorney to represent the appellant. Upon the record before us, no error is presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
