Davidson, </em>State\u2019s Attorney, of Austin, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b635-20\">HAWKINS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ATcM\">\u2014 Conviction is for murder, punishment being assessed at five years in the penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-21\">Appellant and one Lazaro Reyna were indicted jointly for the murder of one Simon Nieto. Appellant was alone upon trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-22\">A detailed statement of the facts is not thought necessary. The State\u2019s evidence shows an unjustified killing of deceased by appellant with a knife, in which difficulty Lazaro Reyna <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>participated with appellant. The latter fled to Mexico and a witness testified that <em>in </em>a conversation there appellant said to witness \u201cI know I stabbed Simon and killed him with a knife: I know I stabbed the s\u2014 of a b:\u2014 with the intention of cutting his guts, and I think I did, and that is the reason I ran away.\u201d On the other hand, appellant and his witnesses raised the issue of self-defense and defense of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\">Bill of exception number six is so incomplete it presents nothing tangible for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Bill of exception number seven complains of admitting in evidence through deceased\u2019s mother a statement made to her by deceased immediately after he was stabbed. The statement was objected to as not being res gestae, and as not being supported by a proper predicate to be admissible as a dying declaration. The court qualifies the bill setting out the circumstances under which the statement was made by deceased, and certifies that appellant\u2019s counsel withdrew the objection and conceded that the statement was admissible as a dying declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Bill number eight complains of remarks by State\u2019s counsel. We discover nothing in the argument which, if improper, could not be corrected by the trial court instructing the jury not to consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Bills numbers one and two bring forward complaint because the court instructed the jury that if appellant \u201ceither alone or acting together with Lazaro Reyna\u201d killed deceased, etc., and because in another place in the instructions the court gave a general definition of \u2018principals\u2019 without making application thereof. We observe that nowhere in the charge does the court make appellant\u2019s guilt to depend on any act of Reyna\u2019s, but requires the jury to predicate a finding of appellant\u2019s guilt on his own act. The court also gave a requested charge telling the jury if they found that Reyna killed deceased they should acquit appellant. Under the circumstances we fail to see how harm could have come to appellant by reason of the things complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Bill number three brings forward complaint because the court instructed the jury that if appellant was acting in his own defense, or in defense of others against the unlawful assaults of deceased he should be acquitted. The objection seems to be that the charge blended appellant\u2019s right to defend himself with his right to defend others, it being contended in the objection that such defenses should have been submitted separately. Appellant\u2019s rights in either event appear to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>adequately guarded and because they are presented in one paragraph instead of separately presents no just ground of complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">A special charge which would have directed a verdict of not guilty was properly refused. Complaint of such action is found in bill of exception number four.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Bill number five complains of the refusal of a special charge instructing the jury of appellant\u2019s rights to act in defense of others. The court declined to give same because the subject was embraced in the main charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Finding no reversible errors the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
