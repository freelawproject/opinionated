At the time of the fatal accident Billie Williams was in the driver\u2019s seat doing the driving, while the appellant was on the same seat beside the driver; that after having struck the child they drove approximately a block before they stopped, but at no time did they, or either of them, return to the scene of the accident and offer aid or assistance to the injured child. We fail to find any evidence in the record which tended to show that appellant was aiding, assisting, or advising Billie Williams in the operation and control of the automobile. Appellant did not testify or offer any testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">Appellant urged quite a number of objections to the court\u2019s charge. We do not deem it necessary to discuss each of them separately. In paragraph five of the charge the court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">\u201cIf you believe from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant, O. A. Robinson, on or about the time alleged in the indictment, in the County of Angelina and State of Texas, did unlawfully strike Mollie May Goodson with a motor vehicle, or was in control of such motor vehicle at the time it so struck Mollie May Goodson, if you find that it did so, and that he failed to stop and render to the said Mollie May Goodson all necessary assistance, you will find the defendant guilty as charged in the indictment,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-13\">Appellant objected to the above instruction on the ground that it was an erroneous application of the law to the facts, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>this, that the uncontroverted testimony shows that appellant was not driving the car at the time the child was struck. The charge of the court should be confined and limited to the facts proven. If, however, there were facts and circumstances from which it might be reasonably inferred that appellant was in control of the motor vehicle at the time, then the court by an appropriate instruction should have limited the jury\u2019s consideration to said issue. See Conn v. State, 11 Texas Crim. Rep., 390; Sanders v. State, 38 Texas Crim. Rep., 343; Maloney v. State, 57 Texas Crim. Rep., 435; Tittle v. State, 35 Texas Crim. Rep., 96; Scogin v. State, 273 S. W., 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The sufficiency of the testimony to sustain the conviction also presents a very serious question.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">For the error in the charge of the court discussed above, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">\n<em>Reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
