Said seller gave to appellant what he called a sales slip which contained the statement that a tax of five cents for each bottle of whisky had been paid. Appellant said he put the slip in his pocket, but subsequent search for same failed to discover it.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-16\">There were no stamps or other evidence on the bottles showing that the tax had been paid on the liquor. Appellant had been convicted of illegal liquor selling in 1931; had pleaded guilty to two cases at a time when he was charged in thirteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>cases. He seems also to have admitted other prosecutions for violation of the same law.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\">The statute seems plain. The facts are almost without dispute. None of the contentions brought forward in the twenty-four bills of exceptions have merit. When a statute is as plain as the one under consideration, there seems no need to invoke rules of construction. Nor is the guilt of appellant in this case made by statute in any way dependent on the question of intent. If one be in such haste to possess whisky as that he is unwilling to wait for the Liquor Control Board to furnish the usual and regular form of stamps, the law seems written so as that any valid evidence, showing that the tax has been paid, may be affixed to the container, and be sufficient. The words used in the statute, viz: \u201caffixed\u201d and \u201cvalid\u201d are words of ordinary use and well understood, and mean but to fasten or attach physically that which is legally sufficient for the purpose stated. Nothing was attached to or put upon the containers here involved showing any attempted compliance with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
