The appellant\u2019s testimony suggests that it was an accident; also that his physical condition at the time was due to the fact that he was nervous and excited. However, the State\u2019s testimony is to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>effect that he was drunk at the time.

We have examined the charge of the court and find nothing to lead us to believe there is any substance in the contention. The testimony showed appellant to be drunk. The trial court told the jury in the charge that if they believed beyond a reasonable doubt that this appellant, at the time in question, was intoxicated, or under the influence of intoxicating liquor, and while so intoxicated he drove a motor vehicle upon a public highway in \u2022 Jefferson County, they should find him guilty. The court instructed the jury that by the term \u201cintoxicated\u201d is meant that one has taken into his system a sufficient quantity of intoxicating liquor to deprive him of his normal, physical or mental faculties. Nothing in this could inure to the injury of appellant. Nor can we agree that the evidence is not sufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
