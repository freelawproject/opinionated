C., 1925, it is provided among other, things, that no person between the ages of nine and thirteen years shall be convicted of any offense \u201cunless it shall appear by proof that he had discretion sufficient to understand the nature and illegality of the act constituting the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">It seems to be a well-settled rule of law that where the accused is under the age of thirteen years, the State must show to the satisfaction of the court or jury that he understood the nature and illegality of the particular act constituting the crime charged. See Tex. Jur., Vol. 12, p. 272, sec. 44; also cases collated under Note 3, Art. 30, Vernon\u2019s Ann. P. C., 1925, Vol. 1. In the present instance, there is no adequate proof upon the part of the State showing that appellant understood the nature of his alleged act or the illegality thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The State introduced no eye-witnesses to the killing. There is evidence from the sheriff to the effect that the appellant said that \u201che was playing with the gun and it went off.\u201d There is also evidence to the effect that the gun was in such condition as likely to cause an accidental discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">The State\u2019s Attorney before this court concedes that the evidence adduced is insufficient to support the conviction, and in this view we are constrained to concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
