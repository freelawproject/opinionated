Our examination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>of the record fails to reveal any evidence to the effect that a local option election was ever held in Wise County,. or the result of such election, or that the result was declared and the declaration published. The decisions of this court are unanimous to the effect that in a conviction for violation of the local option law the proof must show that local option was in force in the county mentioned in the indictment. See Cunningham v. State, 102 S. W. (2d) 413; Stewart v. State, 102 S. W. (2d) 416; Humphreys v. State, 99 S. W. (2d) 600; Green v. State, 101 S. W.
