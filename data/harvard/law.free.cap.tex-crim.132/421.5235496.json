Touching his purpose in seeking deceased on the occasion of the homicide, appellant testified, in part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">\u201cShe was slow in speaking on anything. No, sir, that didn\u2019t make me mad. When I told her I wanted to talk to her about speaking so slow, I just meant for her to liven up. She didn\u2019t act right. No sir, I didn\u2019t like it. No, sir, I wasn\u2019t mad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">According to a witness for the State, deceased told her in the presence of appellant that appellant had threatened to do her bodily harm.
