It is no longer an open question in this State that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>executive warrant may not issue alone upon a charge by information in the demanding State. See Ex parte Stone, 87 S. W. (2d) 267; Ex parte Shillings, 63 S. W. (2d) 853; Ex parte Yawman, 18 S. W. (2d) 647; Ex parte Chittenden, 61 S. W. (2d) 1008. It -will be noted, however, that the executive warrant in the instant case shows that the charge was not only by the \u201cpreliminary information\u201d but that it was also by \u201cother papers.\u201d There was offered in evidence an affidavit that the relator was charged by affidavit in the demanding State with a felony. This affidavit is shown to have been made by the alleged injured party before a magistrate in the State of Oklahoma.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">It is insisted by the respondent that the evidence of this affidavit relates to the term \u201cother papers\u201d as referred to in the warrant. The question for determination, therefore, is whether the warrant upon its face must show that it was issued upon an indictment or affidavit, or whether the proof may be resorted to for the purpose of showing that the warrant was in fact based upon the affidavit or indictment. In the Chittenden case, supra, this court, in passing upon such a question, said:</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u201cReturning to the first vital question; i. e., must the rendition warrant, upon its face, show facts that warranted its issuance under the federal statutes? * * * We are compelled to answer this question in the affirmative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The rule appears to be definitely settled, therefore, that the warrant itself must be sufficient upon its face. In the light of this rule, it is concluded that the extradition warrant was not sufficient and that the relator should have been discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the relator ordered discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">\n<em>Reversed and relator ordered discharged.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
