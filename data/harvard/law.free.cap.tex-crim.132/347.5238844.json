There appears in the supplemental transcript an affidavit filed in the trial court setting up the inability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>appellant to pay for a statement of facts, and requesting that the court order one prepared for him. There is nothing to show that said affidavit was called to the attention of the trial judge. It follows that a reversal' of the judgment on the ground that appellant has been deprived of a statement of facts would not be warranted. Fuller v. State, 264 S. W., 953; Beddingfield v.
