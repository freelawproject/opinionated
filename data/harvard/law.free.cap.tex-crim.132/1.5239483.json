In this view we are constrained to concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-15\">' It is well settled that an information charging the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquor in a dry area must allege that an election was held under an order of the commissioners\u2019 court for the purpose of determining whether the sale should be prohibited; that the commissioners\u2019 court canvassed the election returns and declared the result, and that the result was published as required by law in force at the time of the election. See Kelly v. State, 98 S. W. (2d) 998; Scott v. State, 99 S. W. (2d) 920; Malchoff v. State, 99 S. W. (2d) 917; Shaffer v. State, 99 S. W.
