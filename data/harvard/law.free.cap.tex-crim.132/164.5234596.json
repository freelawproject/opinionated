Appellant\u2019s testimony raised the issue of self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Over appellant\u2019s proper objection, the State elicited from him the fact that he had been arrested in 1980 for fighting. In the charge the court instructed the jury that the testimony relative to appellant\u2019s arrest for fighting had been admitted for the purpose of assisting the jury, if it did, in passing, upon the credibility of appellant as a witness. The jury were further advised that they would consider said testimony for no other purpose. Appellant excepted to the giving of the charge, and pointed out in the exception that said testimony should be withdrawn from the consideration of the jury. The matter presents reversible error. Said testimony was inadmissible to impeach appellant inasmuch as it referred to a misdemeanor not involving moral turpitude. Williams v. State, 91 S. W.
