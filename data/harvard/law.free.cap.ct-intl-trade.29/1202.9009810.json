Reg. 62766 (Nov. 6, 2003). The deadline for applying for benefits was January 20, 2004. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-5\">A letter dated January 25, 2005 and enclosures, addressed to this Court (and also addressed \u201cUSDA\u201d in its first line), indicated the following. The plaintiff, Mandy L. Burton, worked on the family-operated fishing boat \u201cCricket\u201d out of Cordova, Alaska and was paid a percentage of the catch. When she sought to apply for TAA benefits for the year 2002 through the local office administering the program on behalf of USDA, she was informed by \u201cTAA assistants\u201d that she could not file for TAA benefits because she was required to provide a Schedule C (profit or loss from business) to IRS Form 1040 with her filing. She was unable to provide a Schedule C, allegedly, because her wages had been reported via Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) Form W-2 (wage and tax statement), not via IRS Form 1099-MISC (miscellaneous income).</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">This \u201cUnited States Court of International Trade . . . ha[s] jurisdiction to affirm the action of the . . . Secretary of Agriculture ... or to set such action aside, in whole or in part.\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2395(c). Ms. Burton\u2019s submission was deemed a summons and complaint pursuant to USCIT R. 3(a)(3) sufficient to initiate this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">On April 4, 2005, prior to filing an answer, the defendant United States interposed a motion to dismiss the complaint, with prejudice, due to a lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to USCIT R. 12(b)(1) or alternatively pursuant to USCIT R. 12(b)(5) due to a failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The motion reasons that 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2395 only permits judicial review of a \u201cdetermination\u201d of the Secretary of Agriculture and that Ms. Burton\u2019s complaint does not allege such a determination but rather \u201cconcedes\u201d that she failed to \u201cfile for the 2002 TAA assistance\u201d and therefore demonstrates failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Def\u2019s Br. at 4-7. Based on that \u201cconcession,\u201d the government\u2019s motion alternatively argues that the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to find TAA eligibility because 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401e(a)(l) requires that an \u201cadversely affected agricultural commodity producer covered by a certification\u201d must file for TAA benefits within 90 days of issuance of the Secretary of Agriculture\u2019s certification of eligibility, which is \u201cthe effective date on which the Administrator announces in the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>Register or by Department news release a certification of eligibility to apply for adjustment assistance.\u201d Def.\u2019s Br. at 7-8 (quoting 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 1580.102).</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s response to the government\u2019s motion was due by May 4, 2005. To alert the plaintiff, on May 19, 2005 the Court issued an order to show cause why the matter should not be dismissed for failure to prosecute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">Since the outset, the plaintiff might have availed herself of the proffered assistance of the clerk\u2019s office to obtain legal representation <em>in forma pauperis </em>(concerning which, it should be noted, the clerk\u2019s office expended considerable time and effort for her benefit since receipt of her January 25, 2005 letter), however she has failed, to date, to respond properly. The Court therefore considers it appropriate to dismiss her case, but without prejudice, for failure to prosecute pursuant to USCIT R. 41(b)(3). The government\u2019s motion to dismiss is therefore moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-6\">SO ORDERED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
