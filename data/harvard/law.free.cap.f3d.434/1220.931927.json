On appeal, the petitioners argue that substantial evidence did not support the BIA\u2019s determination that the FARC did not function countrywide in Colombia. In support of this argument, the petitioners rely on the 2000 State Department Country Report on Colombia, which states that: (1) the Colombian government faces serious challenges to its control over the national territory; (2) the major guerrilla groups in Colombia, the FARC and National Liberation Army (\u201cELN\u201d), of which the FARC is the largest, consisted of an estimated 11,000 to 17,000 full-time combatants; (3) the guerrilla groups exercised a \u201csignificant degree of territorial influence and initiated armed action in nearly 1,000 of the country\u2019s 1,085 municipalities during the year\u201d; and (4) the FARC regularly attacked civilians in virtually every region of Colombia. The petitioners point out that we are aware of the widespread presence of the FARC in Colombia, since, in <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 n. 7 (11th Cir.2005), we found that the evidence in the 1999 and 2000 Country Reports did not support a finding that relocation to an area where the ELN was nonexistent or minimal was viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-11\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision in this case, as it did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s findings below. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review the determination by the BIA that an alien is statutorily ineligible for asylum or withholding of removal under the \u201csubstantial evidence test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1283. We \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1283-84 (quoting <em>Lorisme v. INS, </em>129 F.3d 1441, 1444-45 (11th Cir.1997)). We may not reweigh the evidence and may not reverse the BIA\u2019s findings of fact unless the record compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Farquharson v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-12\">The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1264-13\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ..., and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling, to avail himself or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">INA \u00a7 101 (a) (42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause such future persecution. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b). \u201cA showing of past persecution creates a presumption of a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 subject to rebuttal by the [Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u2018INS\u2019)].\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). \u201c[T]he INS can overcome the presumption of future persecution by showing that [the applicant] could avoid future threats by relocating within the country, assuming that it is reasonable under all the circumstances to do so.\u201d <em>Antipova v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 1259, 1265 (11th Cir.2004) (withholding of removal); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1)(i)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-7\">The BIA has construed the INA and its regulations to require that an asylum applicant show that he faces a threat of future persecution country-wide. <em>Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 235 (BIA 1985). We have upheld the imposition of a \u201ccountry-wide\u201d requirement, and have noted that \u201cit is not unreasonable to require a refugee who has an internal resettlement alternative in his own country to ... establish that such an option is unavailable.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1327 (11th Cir.2001). Since 2001, the immigration regulations have codified the country-wide requirement, and have instructed the IJ to consider whether \u201cunder all the circumstances it would be reasonable to expect the applicant [to relocate].\u201d 8 CFR \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(ii); <em>see also </em>8 CFR \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The regulations identify several considerations relevant to the \u201creasonableness\u201d determination, including</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-10\">whether the applicant would face other serious harm in the place of suggested relocation; any ongoing civil strife within the country, administrative, economic or judicial infrastructure; geographical limitations; and social and cultural constraints, such as age, gender, health, and social and familial ties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1265-11\">8 CFR \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3). <em>See, e.g., Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232 n. 7 (considering, inter alia, the large numbers of internally displaced people \u2014 and the resulting lack of access to health care, education, or employment \u2014 in concluding that relocation within Colombia was not reasonable). <em>See also Da Silva v. Ashcroft, </em>394 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2005) (\u201cThe touchstone is whether, under all the circumstances of a particular case, internal relocation is a reasonable solution.\u201d); <em>Mohamed v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 999, 1006 (8th Cir.2005) (\u201cRelocation must not only be possible, it must also be reasonable.\u201d); <em>Gambashidze v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 187, 192 (3d Cir.2004) (\u201cThus the regulation envisions a two-part inquiry: whether relocation would be successful and whether it would be reasonable.\u201d); <em>Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 194 (5th Cir.2004) (reversing and remanding to BIA for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>the requisite determination of whether relocation was \u201creasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">In the instant case, as the government concedes, the BIA presumed past persecution and therefore the burden was on the government to show that internal relocation was reasonable. <em>See </em>BIA\u2019s Order at 1-2; Respondent\u2019s Brief at 19; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1)(ii). The only evidence submitted by the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS,\u201d formerly the INS) to satisfy its burden was (1) the 1997 Department of State Asylum Profile, and (2) the 1999 and 2000 Department of State Country Reports. <em>See </em>INS Notices of Filing Documents, A.R. at 99 &amp; 421. This evidence alone is insufficient to meet the government\u2019s burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">On the contrary, the record in this case compels the conclusion that the FARC operates country-wide in Colombia, and that relocation was therefore not a viable option for the petitioners to escape persecution. On this point, <em>Sepulveda </em>is instructive. In that case, we ultimately held that the petitioner had failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution, but we explicitly addressed the petitioner\u2019s claim that substantial evidence did not support the IJ\u2019s finding that she could internally locate to an area within Colombia where the ELN presence was nonexistent or minimal, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1266-6\">[T]he evidence does not support such a finding. The 1999 and 2000 Country Reports, on which the IJ ostensibly relied, make clear that the guerillas exercise influence throughout Colombia, and that small and large municipalities are already overwhelmed by the huge populations of displaced persons, who are consequently without access to health care, education, or employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AD3\"><em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-9\">Looking at the same country reports at issue in <em>Sepulveda </em>(i.e., 1999 and 2000 Department of State Country Reports on Colombia) we again conclude, as we did in that case, that these do- not support a finding that the guerillas did not exercise influence throughout Colombia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to the 2000 Country Report, the guerillas \u201cexercised a significant degree of territorial influence and initiated armed action in nearly 1,000 out of the 1,085 municipalities [approximately 92%] during the year, which was approximately the same level as in 1999.\u201d <em>See </em>A.R. at 100; <em>see also </em>A.R. at 423 (1999 Report). The 2000 Report states that the two major guerilla groups, of which the FARC is the largest, consist of an estimated 11,000 to 17,000 full-time combatants organized into more than 100 semi-autonomous groups. It says that \u201cFARC and the ELN regularly attacked civilian populations, committed massacres and summary executions and killed medical and religious personnel.\u201d A.R. at 102. The 2000 report indicates that the FARC continued its practice of using gas canisters and mortars to destroy small towns, and the guerillas held more than 1,000 kidnapped civilians and 500 kidnapped soldiers and police. <em>Id. </em>The report documents that \u201c[i]n many places, guerillas collected \u2018war taxes,\u2019 forced members of the citizenry into their ranks, forced small farmers to grow illicit crops, and regulated travel, commerce and other activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In fact, according to the report, the FARC announced \u201cLaw 002\u201d in March of 2000, which \u201cdemanded that anyone with assets of $1 million pay taxes to the FARC or risk kidnapping.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In sum, the 2000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>Country Report illustrates the killing, kidnapping and other atrocities committed by the FARC against the civilian population in virtually every region in Colombia, which it states caused an estimated 1 million displaced citizens from 1996 to 2000. <em>See </em>A.R. at 101, 108-12, 118-21.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">The only other evidence submitted by the government to satisfy its burden of showing that relocation would be a successful way for the petitioners to avoid persecution is the 1997 Department of State Asylum Profile. The 1997 profile opines that \u201cthose fleeing guerilla or po-liee/military harassment or threats in con-flietive zones usually are able to find peaceful residence elsewhere in the country.\u201d A.R. at 142. The profile states that relocation is available because the guerrilla movement was \u201cfragmented\u201d and only operated in \u201cspecific areas of the country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 142-43. It reports that, in 1997, the guerillas exercised influence in only about half of the country\u2019s municipalities. <em>Id. </em>at 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-6\">While the 1997 Asylum Profile\u2019s assessment would appear to support the government\u2019s claim, it is contradicted by the more recent 1999 and 2000 Country Reports. The 2000 Country Report documents the guerillas\u2019 territorial influence in the year 2000 at 92% of the countries\u2019 municipalities \u2014 a dramatic increase of more than 40% since 1997. The Country Reports no longer speak of the guerillas as \u201cfragmented\u201d and limited in operations to only specific areas of the country. Rather, they attest to an intensification of the conflict and a territorial expansion in guerrilla violence throughout the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-9\">The remainder of the record evidence\u2014 presented by the petitioners \u2014 further compels the conclusion that the FARC operated country-wide. The petitioners submitted documentary evidence from the U.S. Department of State, Amnesty International and reputable news agencies that attests to the widespread nature of FARC atrocities committed throughout the entire country. This evidence showed that: (1) the activities of guerrilla groups in Colombia, with membership in the tens of thousands, of which the FARC is the largest, best trained and best equipped, were \u201cwidespread,\u201d at least in rural areas; (2) the FARC has 15,000 to 17,000 combatants and controlled an estimated 40% of the countryside; (3) the FARC \u201cregularly\u201d attacked civilian populations, laid landmines, kidnapped civilians, and destroyed small towns; (4) at least 300,000 people were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>displaced to urban areas in 1999 due to guerrilla violence; and (4) in 2000, the FARC had the power and influence to pass a law demanding war taxes from Colombian citizens. <em>See </em>A.R. at 580-81, 590, 594, 600, 615, 631, 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">Finally, Arboleda\u2019s past experience supports the conclusion that relocation would not successfully shield him of persecution by the FARC. Arboleda testified that he relocated from his farm in Armero Guaya-bal (in the department of Tolima) to the capital city, Bogota, after he was detained by the FARC while driving in his car in Amero Guayabal. Despite his relocation, the FARC continued to threaten him and his family at both his Bogota home and office, with frequent notes and telephone calls detailing the family\u2019s activities and threatening them with death. At the same time, the FARC continued to persecute Arboleda at his farm, by burning down his farm house and killing several of his cattle. <em>See A. R. </em>at 375-81. In fact, according to Arboleda\u2019s testimony, even after the family left Colombia for the United States, the FARC continued to go after him by placing bombs in two of his Bogota restaurants and by sending a sympathy card (i.e., an implicit death threat) to his home in Bogota.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">Given our consideration of the evidence, we are compelled to find that the INS failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the petitioners could relocate within Colombia out of the FARC\u2019s reach. <em>See 8 </em>CFR \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1)(ii) (burden of proof). Moreover, even if the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the FARC did not function countrywide had been supported by substantial evidence, the BIA erred in failing to consider whether relocation for the Arboledas was \u201creasonable.\u201d The BIA found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1268-6\">[t]he documentary evidence submitted by [the DHS] reflects that the [FARC] does not function countrywide, and therefore, it is reasonable for the respondents to internally relocate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1268-10\">A.R. at 3. This analysis is incomplete. As stated earlier in our opinion, the agency regulations require that the factfinder consider the following factors in its reasonableness determination, including</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7q\">whether the applicant would face other serious harm in the place of suggested relocation; any ongoing civil strife within the country, administrative, economic or judicial infrastructure; geographical limitations; and social and cultural constraints, such as age, gender, health, and social and familial ties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1268-11\">8 CFR \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3). Thus, in <em>Sepulve-da </em>we considered not only the fact that the guerillas exercised influence throughout the country, but also that the numbers of internally displaced people due to the civil war and the violence and the resulting scarcity of health care, education, and employment would make it unreasonable for the petitioners to relocate. <em>See id., </em>401 F.3d at 1232 n. 7. The BIA in this case, however, did not mention any of the other factors it should have considered in making its determination. This is reversible error. <em>See Hagi-Salad v. Ashcroft, </em>359 F.3d 1044, 1045 (8th Cir.2004) (remanding to the BIA for a reasonableness determination based on factors in 8 CFR \u00a7 208.13(b)(3)); <em>Knezevic v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1206, 1214-15 (9th Cir.2004) (same). <em>See also Gambashidze v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d at 192 (\u201cThus the regulation envisions a two-part inquiry: whether relocation would be successful, and whether it would be reasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-12\">Accordingly, we conclude that the BIA\u2019s finding that the DHS met its burden in establishing that the petitioners could reasonably relocate within Colombia to escape persecution was not supported by substantial evidence in the record. The evidence in the record compels a finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>FARC operates country-wide in Colombia, and the BIA failed to independently consider whether it was possible for the Ar-boledas to find a safe haven through internal relocation. Because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s removal order on this ground alone, we vacate the BIA\u2019s order and remand this case back to the BIA for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-4\">PETITION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1265-8\">. Although <em>Mazariegos </em>was issued on February 12, 2001, after the regulation's effective date (January 5, 2001), see 65 Fed.Reg. 76133, it appears that the panel did not consider the regulation. <em>See Mazariegos, </em>241 F.3d at 1325 (\u201cThe [INA] does not expressly require that asylum seekers face a threat of persecution throughout their entire country of origin as opposed to a particular place within that country.
