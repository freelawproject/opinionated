Bren-nen, </em>135 Md.App. 247, 762 A.2d 161 (2000). We shall hold that \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3) applies to improved homes as well as new homes and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">In December 1997, Ridge Heating, Air Conditioning, and Plumbing, Inc. (\u201cRidge\u201d), a subcontractor, contracted with Timberwood Construction, Inc. (\u201cTimberwood\u201d), a general contractor, to provide and install heating, air conditioning and plumbing for an addition to the home of Mr. and Mrs. Bren-nen (the \u201cBrennens\u201d). Ridge\u2019s contract was pursuant to a general contract that required Timberwood to complete construction on the addition to the Brennens\u2019 home by April 25, 1998, and the Brennens to pay progress payments totaling $153,085.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Due to financial difficulties, Timberwood abandoned the project on August 3, 1998, breaching its contracts with the Brennens and Ridge. The Brennens found another contractor to finish the job at an additional cost. After the breach, the Brennens were not indebted to Timberwood for any of the work done prior to the breach, including the labor and materials supplied by Ridge. Ridge, however, had not been paid by Timberwood, and on September 30, 1998, Ridge filed a two-count Complaint to Establish and Enforce a Mechanic\u2019s Lien against the Brennens in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. On October 5, 1998, the Circuit Court issued an Order to Show Cause, commanding the Brennens to show cause why the hen should not attach to their property. The Brennens filed a Verified Answer on October 22,1998, denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>liability on the grounds that they were not indebted to Tim-berwood.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">At the show cause hearing on November 12, 1998, the parties agreed, by Consent Order, that the matter should be set for trial in the normal course and that no final lien would be entered at that stage of the proceedings. Following discovery, the Brennens filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on May 9, 1999. On December 29, 1999, Judge Robert E. Cadigan granted summary judgment in favor of the Brennens on the basis that \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3) applied to the Brennens\u2019 home and that Ridge failed to show that the Brennens were indebted to Timberwood.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Ridge noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, presenting the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">\u201cDid the trial court err in applying Real Property \u00a7 9-104(f)(8) of the Maryland Annotated Code, limiting an owner\u2019s liability to a subcontractor who performs work on the owner\u2019s single family dwelling?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court on three grounds: (1) that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decisions and the decisions of this Court have consistently construed \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3) in favor of homeowners; (2) that, in crafting \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3), the Legislature did not intend to distinguish between new and existing homes; and (3) that Ridge bore the risk of breach by Timberwood because, as a subcontractor, Ridge was in a better position to know the general contractor\u2019s financial condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">We granted Ridge\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari to consider the issue of whether \u00a7 9-104(f)(3) applies to an addition to an existing single family dwelling. <em>Ridge Heating v. Brennen, </em>362 Md. 624, 766 A.2d 147 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Before delving into the meaning of the statutory language of \u00a7 9-104(f)(3), it is helpful to understand the structure of Maryland\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien law. In <em>Winkler Const. Co., v. Jerome, </em>355 Md. 231, 734 A.2d 212 (1999), we explained how the mechanic\u2019s lien law protects subcontractors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>\u201cMaryland Code, \u00a7 9-102' of the Real Property Article provides, in relevant part, that every budding that is either newly erected or repaired to the extent of 15% of its value is subject to a lien \u2014 a mechanic\u2019s lien \u2014 for the payment of all debts contracted for work done and materials supplied for or about the building. That includes debts owing to subcontractors who have no privity with the owner of the property and whom the owner may not even know worked on or supplied materials for the building.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 235, 734 A.2d at 214-15. We also found that the mechanic\u2019s lien law historically has been construed in the most liberal and comprehensive manner in favor of mechanics and materialmen. <em>Id. </em>at 246, 734 A.2d at 221 (quoting <em>T. Dan Kolker, Inc. v. Shure, </em>209 Md. 290, 296, 121 A.2d 223, 226 (1956)). This liberal construction is essential to subcontractors, who enhance the value of the homeowner\u2019s property but have no direct contractual relationship with the owner and therefore cannot otherwise subject the owner\u2019s property or assets to a mechanic\u2019s lien. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">In 1982, Chapter 251 of the Real Property Article, also known as the \u201cresidential exception,\u201d was enacted. In contrast to the general purpose of the mechanic\u2019s lien law, discussed above, the goal of the residential exception is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACD\">\u201cto \u2018limit[ ] the liability of an owner to a subcontractor for work performed and materials rendered by the subcontractor on a single family dwelling erected on the owner\u2019s land for his own residence, to the extent that the owner has rendered payment to the contractor.\u2019 The expressed intent of the Legislature was clearly remedial, but remedial, in this instance, in favor of the owner, rather than the claimant. The ability under the existing law of an owner, upon receipt of a subcontractor\u2019s notice, to withhold the amount of the claim from the prime contractor was obviously not regarded as sufficient protection in the case of a single family residence being built for the owner\u2019s own residential use. By the time the notice is received, the owner may already have paid the prime contractor or have accumulated set-offs or credits exceeding what is owed on the contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number><em>Winkler Const., </em>355 Md. at 248, 734 A.2d at 222. The statute we are here concerned with, Real Property \u00a7 9-104(f)(3), is part of Chapter 251 and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">\u201c(f) Payments by owner to contractor after notice, limitation on lien against certain single family dwellings.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, the lien of the subcontractor against a single family dwelling being erected on the land of the owner for his own residence shall not exceed the amount by which the owner is indebted under the contract at the time the notice is given.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Ridge argues that, although the Brennens have paid for the work done on their home, \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3) does not protect them against a lien because the phrase \u201cdwelling being erected\u201d means new homes, not homes repaired, rebuilt or improved. Ridge\u2019s argument is based on the statutory language, case law, and policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">In interpreting \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3), Ridge relies heavily on other sections of the residential exception that refer to \u201cbuildings erected\u201d and buildings \u201crepaired, rebuilt, or improved.\u201d For example, \u00a7 9-102(a) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">\u201cEvery building erected and every building repaired, rebuilt or improved to the extent of 15 percent of its value is subject to establishment of a lien in accordance with this subtitle for the payment of all debts, without regard to the amount, contracted for work done for or about the building and for materials furnished for or about the building, including. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">According to Ridge, the opening sentence of \u00a7 9-102(a) clearly differentiates between a building erected, meaning a newly-constructed home, and every building repaired, rebuilt or improved. It follows, Ridge reasons, that, if the Legislature intended \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3) to apply to new and existing homes, it would have said as much, as it did in \u00a7 9-102(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">As for case law, Ridge correctly observes that no Maryland court has considered the meaning of the phrase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>\u201cbeing erected.\u201d Nevertheless, Ridge draws three points from a single case, <em>Ridge Sheet Metal Co., Inc. v. Morrell, </em>69 Md.App. 364, 517 A.2d 1133 (1986). Ridge argues that: (1) although a significant change occurred in the mechanic\u2019s lien law in 1982, it is still to be interpreted in favor of mechanics and suppliers; (2) the Legislature intended to limit the protection of \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3) to owners of new homes; and (3) the residential exception was designed to jumpstart the housing market during an economic downturn by protecting owners of new homes from mechanics\u2019 liens.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">We do not find Ridge\u2019s arguments persuasive. The statutory language is anything but clear as to the distinction between new and improved homes. The phrase \u201cbeing erected\u201d may reasonably be applied to many types of construction, including new homes, an addition to an existing home, or a home erected on an existing foundation after a disaster such as a fire. In <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 517 A.2d 730 (1986), we recognized the rule that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">[WJhere a statute is plainly susceptible of more than one meaning and thus contains an ambiguity, courts consider not only the literal or usual meaning of the words, but their meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives and purpose of the enactment. In such circumstances, the court, in seeking to ascertain legislative intent, may consider the consequences resulting from one meaning rather than another, and adopt that construction which avoids an illogical or unreasonable result, or one which is inconsistent with common sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 75, 517 A.2d at 732-33 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The Legislature has not indicated, nor has any court suggested, that other sections of the statute draw the distinction Ridge seeks. We find that, in enacting \u00a7 9-102(a), the Legislature likely intended to establish that, for the purposes of the mechanic\u2019s lien laws, a building that is \u201cerected\u201d is the equivalent to one that is \u201crepaired, rebuilt, or improved to the extent of 15% of its value.\u201d The crucial distinction is between homes improved to the extent of 15% of their value and homes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>improved to less than 15% of their value, not merely between new and improved homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">The holdings of this Court and the courts below reinforce our reading of the Legislature\u2019s intent. The language of <em>Ridge Sheet Metal Co., Inc. v. Morrell, </em>69 Md.App. 364, 517 A.2d 1133, cited by Ridge for the proposition that the Legislature intended to limit \u00a7 9-104(f)(3) to construction of new homes, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">\u201cTurning to the legislative intent, we glean from the preamble to chapter 251 quoted previously that the Legislature intended in <em>limited </em>situations to shift the risk of loss from the owner of a single family dwelling to the subcontractor. The enactment of \u00a7 9-114 under chapter 251 in 1982 further evidences the Legislature\u2019s intent to ameliorate owner liability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 374, 517 A.2d at 1138 (emphasis added). At no point does the Court of Special Appeals state or imply that \u201climited situations\u201d means only those situations where a homeowner builds a new home. Moreover, the relevant case law has evolved since <em>Ridge Sheet Metal. See Winkler Const. Co., v. Jerome, </em>355 Md. 231, 734 A.2d 212 (1999); <em>Reisterstown Lumber Co. v. Tsao, </em>319 Md. 623, 574 A.2d 307 (1990); <em>Best Drywall, Inc. v. Berry, </em>108 Md.App. 381, 672 A.2d 116 (1996); <em>F. Scott Jay &amp; Co., Inc. v. Vargo, </em>112 Md.App. 354, 685 A.2d 799 (1996); <em>Grubb Contractors v. Abbott, </em>84 Md.App. 384, 579 A.2d 1185 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Generally, courts have hesitated to construe the statute against homeowners. For example, in <em>Best Drywall, Inc. v. Berry, </em>the court decided whether a vacation home is a single family dwelling being erected on the land of the owner for his own residence within the meaning of \u00a7 9-104(f)(3). <em>Best Drywall, </em>108 Md.App. at 383, 672 A.2d at 117. In so doing, the court applied from <em>Grubb Contractors </em>and <em>Ridge Sheet Metal </em>the principle that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">\u201ccontrary to the general purpose of the overall mechanic\u2019s lien statute to protect subcontractors and materialmen, \u00a7 9-104(f)(3) clearly has as its purpose an intent to shift respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>sibility for insuring payment of a subcontractor from the owner of the dwelling to the prime contractor, i.e., to limit the subcontractor\u2019s ability to lien the single family residence. Consistent with the reasoning in <em>Ridge Sheet Metal </em>that the subcontractor\u2019s broad reading of \u201cindebted\u201d in \u00a7 9-104(f)(3) was inimicable [sic] to the intended limiting effect of that particular section of the statute, we conclude here that Best Drywall is better able than appellees to bear the risk of loss in this type of situation also.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 394, 672 A.2d at 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">This Court has dealt with \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3) twice since <em>Ridge Sheet Metal. </em>In <em>Reisterstown. Lumber Co. v. Tsao, </em>319 Md. 623, 574 A.2d 307 (1990), we held that whether a new home is intended as the owner\u2019s \u201cown residence\u201d is determined as of the time when the subcontractor commences work. <em>Id. </em>at 631, 574 A.2d at 311. We reasoned that, by using the phrase \u201cown residence,\u201d the General Assembly surely did not intend to put on the lien claimant the burden of proving that throughout the entire course of construction the owner of the home intended to make it his \u201cown residence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Later, in <em>Winkler Const. Co., Inc. v. Jerome, </em>355 Md. 231, 734 A.2d 212 (1999), we held that \u00a7 9-104(f)(3) does not require the hen claimant to aver in the complaint whether, at the time the subcontractor\u2019s notice was sent, the owner had paid the prime contractor in full. <em>Id. </em>at 253, 734 A.2d at 224. The basis for this holding was the same as in <em>Reisterstoum: </em>\u201cthat the mechanic\u2019s lien law should not be construed in such a way as to make the burden on the claimant so difficult as effectively to withdraw the remedy that the Legislature has clearly provided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 252, 734 A.2d at 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\"><em>Reisterstown </em>and <em>Winkler </em>are not controlling in that they concern the burdens borne by a lien claimant, whereas here we are concerned with a phrase that governs the applicability of the statute. Nevertheless, we may still draw two lessons from <em>Reisterstoum </em>and <em>Winkler: </em>in interpreting \u00a7 9-104(f)(3), we seek rules that can be applied with \u201crelative simplicity,\u201d <em>Reisterstoum, </em>319 Md. at 631, 574 A.2d at 311, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>that strike a fair and reasonable balance of the competing interests of homeowners and subcontractors. <em>Winkler, </em>355 Md. at 254, 734 A.2d at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">There is no support for the claim that the Legislature, in attempting to encourage construction, favored construction of new homes over improvements. In <em>Ridge Sheet Metal, </em>the Court of Special Appeals reasoned that \u201c[i]ncreasing the risk of double payment for the single family dwelling owner may well dampen the enthusiasm of the prospective house builder.\u201d 69 Md.App. at 375, 517 A.2d at 1138. This analysis, however, was part of the court\u2019s discussion of \u201cmanifest fairness,\u201d not legislative intent. Moreover, if Ridge\u2019s view were adopted, a family that has paid for building a new home on a vacant lot would not be subject to a subcontractor\u2019s lien, while a family such as the Brennens, having spent the same amount of money, will be in danger of losing their home through foreclosure on a mechanic\u2019s lien. Creating a risk of double payment for homeowners considering expensive improvements surely will not benefit the construction industry, which profits from improving homes. Because the Legislature has given us no indication that it wanted to encourage only one type of construction, we cannot ascribe to it an intent that would impede rather than encourage construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In light of the foregoing, we hold that \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3) applies to an addition to an existing home. We see no basis in the statutory language or case law for reading the phrase \u201cbeing erected\u201d so that a the owner of a new home is protected from double payment while the owner of a improved home is not. In keeping with <em>Reisterstown </em>and <em>Winkler, </em>our reading allows for simple and efficient application of \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3). Finally, favoring owners of new homes over owners of improved homes is inconsistent with the one policy rationale Ridge has supplied: encouraging new construction. Assuming Ridge is correct that the Legislature hoped to increase construction, then, absent evidence of contrary legislative intent, \u00a7 9-104(f)(3) should be interpreted to foster construction on new <em>and </em>existing homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONERS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\">.

Brennen, </em>362 Md. 624, 766 A.2d 147 (2001), to consider whether Maryland Code (1974, 1999 RepLVol.) \u00a7 9-104(f)(3) of the Real Property Article,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> applies to homes that are merely repaired or improved and not simply to those new homes that are \u201cbeing erected.\u201d A divided panel of the Court of Special Appeals construed the statute to apply to the former, 135 Md.App. 247, 258, 762 A.2d 161, 167 (2000), and the majority affirms that judgment. 366 Md. 342, 343, 783 A.2d 695 (2001). I do not agree and, because I conclude from \u00a7 9-104(f)(3)\u2019s clear and unambiguous language that it has application only with respect to new homes, <em>i.e. </em>single family dwellings \u201cbeing erected,\u201d I respectfully dissent. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Historically, the mechanic\u2019s lien law, remedial legislation, see \u00a7 9-112, has been construed \u201cin the most liberal and comprehensive manner in favor of mechanics and material-men.\u201d <em>T. Dan Kolker, Inc. v. Shure, </em>209 Md. 290, 296, 121 A.2d 223, 226 (1956); <em>see generally Winkler Constr. Co. v. Jerome, </em>355 Md. 231, 734 A.2d 212 (1999) (discussing the historical development of the mechanic\u2019s lien laws). Notwithstanding our decision in <em>Barry Properties v. Fick Bros., </em>277 Md. 15, 19, 353 A.2d 222, 226 (1976) (holding unconstitutional provisions of the then-existing mechanic\u2019s lien law on the basis that they deprived owners of procedural due process), and subsequent amendments that were remedial in favor of homeowners, <em>see, e.g., </em>1982 Md. Laws, ch. 251,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and designed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>afford a greater measure of due process to homeowners, liberal construction of the mechanic\u2019s lien laws in favor of mechanics continues to be appropriate. This is so because \u201c[t]he need for a liberal construction is particularly important with respect to subcontractors who, though benefitting the owner and enhancing the value of the owner\u2019s property by the provision of their labor or materials, have no direct contractual relationship with the owner and therefore cannot otherwise subject the owner\u2019s property or assets to the payment of their claims.\u201d <em>Winkler, supra, </em>355 Md. at 246, 734 A.2d at 221. Where some provisions were intended to benefit the homeowner, while the statute in general is intended to benefit mechanics and materialmen, courts must interpret the provision at issue, in the context of the entire statute, in \u201ca sensible manner\u201d that \u201cprovides a fair and reasonable balance to the competing interests,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 253, 734 A.2d at 225, so as to give \u201cfull force to [the provisions designed to protect homeowners] without unduly crippling a subcontractor\u2019s ability to obtain a lien.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255, 734 A.2d at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Section 9 \u2014 104(f)(3), as we have seen, was added to the Real Property Article in 1982 as a part of the \u201cresidential exception\u201d to the mechanic\u2019s lien law. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">(f) Payments by owner to contractor after notice; limitation on lien against certain single family dwellings.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, the lien of the subcontractor against a single family dwelling <em>being erected </em>on the land of the owner for his own residence shall not exceed the amount by which the owner is indebted under the contract at the time notice is given, (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Thus, \u00a7 9-104(f)(3) limits a homeowner\u2019s liability to a subcontractor to the amount of the homeowner\u2019s indebtedness to the prime contractor at the time the subcontractor\u2019s notice of intention to file a mechanic\u2019s lien is given.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">The majority in the Court of Special Appeals broadly construed \u00a7 9-104(f)(3) so as to prevent a subcontractor from establishing a mechanic\u2019s lien against the owner of an existing single family home who has contracted to have that home remodeled or repaired, reasoning that such a construction is consistent with the 1982 amendment to the mechanic\u2019s lien law and its stated rationale, which it characterized as being \u201cto protect the family and limit exposure of personal residences as opposed to commercial enterprises, to avoid subjecting homeowners to liability for double payment, and to shift the risk of loss from the homeowner to the subcontractor, who is in a better position to protect itself by requiring that the owner agree to authorize the progress draw payable to both prime and subcontractor.\u201d 135 Md.App. at 259-60, 762 A.2d at 167. It concluded that the language, \u201cbeing erected on the land of the owner for his own residence,\u201d was intended merely to make clear that \u00a7 9-104(f)(3)\u2019s limitation on liability does not extend to commercial builders. <em>Id. </em>at 259, 762 A.2d at 167. Noting the dissent\u2019s observation, \u201cObviously, the legislature understands how to eliminate any linguistic distinctions between new and existing construction ...,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 259, 762 A.2d at 167, the majority opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">[Djivining an intent to distinguish between new construction and \u2018erection\u2019 of an addition to an existing structure is less plausible than the difference between home improvements, remodeling, and repairs as contradistinguished from new construction and building on an addition. Significantly, the legislature could have expressly excluded additions \u2018erected\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>or self-contained units added to existing improvements \u2018erected on the land of the owner for his [or her] own residence\u2019 had that been the intent underlying the enactment of the legislation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The majority in this Court agrees with that result. Characterizing the phrase, \u201cbeing erected,\u201d as \u201canything but clear,\u201d it being reasonable, they assert, to apply it \u201cto many types of construction, including new homes, an addition to an existing home, or a home erected on an existing foundation after a disaster such as a fire,\u201d 366 Md. at 342, 783 A.2d at 694, and noting its belief that, \u201cin enacting \u00a7 9-102(a), the Legislature likely intended to establish that, for the purposes of the mechanic\u2019s lien laws, a building that is \u2018erected\u2019 is the equivalent to one that is either \u2018repaired, rebuilt, or improved to the extent of 15% of its value,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 342-343, 783 A.2d at 694, the majority draws a distinction \u201cbetween homes improved to the extent of 15% of their value and homes improved to less than 15% of their value, not merely between new and improved homes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It also relies on the holdings of this Court, <em>see Winkler, supra; Reisterstown Lumber Co. v.

Insurance Com\u2019r, </em>332 Md. 124, 132-33, 630 A.2d 713, 717-18 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The critical question to be resolved in this case is whether \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3) applies to both newly constructed single family homes and existing single family homes that are being repaired or improved. The answer to this question lies in the interpretation of the phrase \u201cdwelling being erected.\u201d As the petitioner correctly points out, the Legislature has not defined the phrase and, although \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3) previously has been before the Court on other issues, this Court has not interpreted it. The petitioner maintains that the ^phrase, \u201cdwelling being erected,\u201d and thus \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3), is clear and unambiguous, the plain meaning of which limits its application to new homes. Support for its interpretation lies, the petitioner submits, in those other sections of the mechanic\u2019s hen law that distinguish between buildings being erected and those that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>repaired, rebuilt, or improved. See, for example, \u00a7 9-102(a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which, as relevant provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">Every building erected and every building repaired, rebuilt or improved to the extent of 15 percent of its value is subject to establishment of a lien in accordance with this subtitle for the payment of all debts, without regard to the amount, contracted for work done for or about the building and for materials furnished for or about the building....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">I agree with the petitioner, \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(8) is clear and unambiguous and, giving the phrase \u201cdwelling being erected\u201d its plain and ordinary meaning, has application only to new homes. \u201cBeing\u201d is the present participle of the verb \u201cto be.\u201d A \u201cpresent participle\u201d is an expression \u201cused to express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>present action in relation to the time indicated by the finite verb in its clause, to form progressive tenses with the auxiliary \u2018be,\u2019 and to function as a verbal adjective.\u201d <em>The American Heritage College Dictionary </em>1082 (3rd ed.1997). \u201cTo erect,\u201d simply put, means to construct or establish. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>562 (7th ed.1999); <em>see also The American Heritage College Dictionary </em>465 (3rd ed.1997). Taken together, the import of the words \u201cdwelling being erected\u201d can only be to limit \u00a7 9-104(f)(3)\u2019s application to dwellings that are in the process of being constructed \u2014 in other words, to new homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">As we have seen, the majority concludes that \u00a7 9-104(f)(3) is ambiguous. To so conclude does not make it so. To be sure, the particular wording of a statute or the context in which the words are used may render a statute ambiguous. <em>See Gardner v. State, </em>344 Md. 642, 647-48, 689 A.2d 610 (1997). Moreover, that a term may be free from ambiguity when used in one context but of doubtful application in another context is well settled. <em>See Truck Ins. Exch. v. Marks Rentals, </em>288 Md. 428, 433, 418 A.2d 1187 (1980). Nevertheless, there is nothing ambiguous about the phrase, \u201cdwelling being erected,\u201d or the context in which it is being used. \u201cErect,\u201d as pointed out, has a definite meaning-to construct or establish. \u201cConstruct,\u201d in turn, means \u201cthe act of building by combining or arranging parts or elements,\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>308 (7th ed.1999); <em>see also The American Heritage College Dictionary </em>299 (3rd ed.1997), and \u201cestablish\u201d means \u201cto set up.\u201d <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>308 (7th ed.1999); <em>see also The American Heritage College Dictionary </em>469 (3rd ed.1997). On the other hand, \u201crepair,\u201d <em>see The American Heritage College Dictionary </em>1156 (3rd ed.1997) (\u201cto restore <em>to </em>sound condition after <em>damage </em>or injury; fix\u201d), \u201crebuild,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 1139, 418 A.2d 1187 (\u201cto build again\u201d), and \u201cimprove,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 684, 418 A.2d 1187 (\u201cto raise to a more desirable or more excellent quality or condition; make better\u201d), have different meanings, each relating to work done on an existing structure. It follows that referring to a building being erected has a vastly different meaning than a reference to one being repaired, rebuilt, or improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>Nor does the context suggest otherwise. Indeed, reference to the statutory context produces the opposite result; rather than making the meaning of the phrase \u201cdwelling being erected\u201d ambiguous, the Legislature\u2019s recognition, in \u00a7 9-102(a), of the distinction between new construction, characterized by the phrase \u201cbuilding being erected,\u201d and work on existing buildings, characterized by reference to \u201cbuilding repaired, rebuilt or improved\u201d actually clarifies its meaning. The statutory context, in other words, demonstrates that the Legislature knew how to, and did, define precisely the reach and application it intended \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3) to have.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co., supra, </em>308 Md. at 69, 517 A.2d at 730, is misplaced. There, the Court was required to construe \u201cpedestrian\u201d as used in Maryland Code (1957, 1986 Repl.Vol.) Article 48A, \u00a7 539(a). A parking lot attendant, who was sitting on a stool when he was struck by a car, sought PIP benefits pursuant to \u00a7 539(a), which included among those eligible for such benefits, \u201cpedestrians injured in an accident in which the insured motor vehicle is involved.\u201d The ambiguity of the meaning of the word \u201cpedestrian\u201d was manifest in this context: Maryland Code (1984 RepLVol.), \u00a7\u00a7 11-145 of the Transportation Article and <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1664 (1971) defined \u201cpedestrian\u201d as \u201ca person afoot\u201d and \u201ca person who travels on foot,\u201d while the policy of \u00a7 539(b)\u2019s legislatively mandated insurance coverage, which was \u201cnot so related to the motor vehicle laws of the State as to compel a like construction of terms used in the two statutes,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 74, 517 A.2d at 732, would be thwarted by that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The majority\u2019s reading of \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3) is, in any event, inconsistent with other relevant canons of statutory construction. By interpreting the phrase \u201cdwelling being erected\u201d to include both dwellings being constructed, <em>i.e. </em>new single family homes, <em>and </em>those being repaired or improved, the majority, in effect, adds words to \u00a7 9-104(f)(3), thus, giving it a forced interpretation, reflecting an intention not evidenced by its plain language. In the process, it dramatically extends the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>section\u2019s application by precluding subcontractors from establishing mechanic\u2019s liens against any owner-occupied, single-family homes. To be sure, as the majority correctly observes, the legislative intention in enacting the \u201cresidential exception\u201d was to protect homeowners, rather than, as evidenced in the remainder of the law, materialmen and mechanics. Nevertheless, neither the terms of the statute itself nor the legislative history provides a basis for the majority\u2019s conclusion that the Legislature intended for \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3) to apply so broadly.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In fact, if the Legislature\u2019s intent was to have \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3) apply to all single family homeowner occupied dwellings, it is difficult to understand why it chose to use the \u201cbeing erected\u201d language at all. If, as the intermediate appellate court suggests, <em>see </em>135 Md.App. at 259, 762 A.2d at 167, the purpose of this language is merely to emphasize that the subsection only applies to homeowners, a far more sensible approach would have been for the Legislature to state simply that \u00a7 9-104(f)(3) is limited to \u201ca single-family dwelling on the land of the owner for his own residence.\u201d Another, and perhaps the more obvious, way of phrasing the statute would have been to state explicitly, \u201cthis subsection does not apply to commercial builders.\u201d The Legislature adopted neither of these approaches. We, therefore, must presume that it had a reason for including the phrase \u201cbeing erected\u201d and give that phrase its ordinary meaning. Yet, the majority\u2019s construction of \u00a7 9-104(f)(3) impermissibly renders the phrase both superfluous and nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Section 9-102(a) also is relevant to the interpretation of \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3). Because it predated the enactment of \u00a7 9-104(f)(3) and, is a part of the statutory scheme of which \u00a7 9-104(f)(3) is a part, its existence and content are presumed to have been known by the Legislature when it promulgated the later statute. <em>GEICO, supra, </em>332 Md. at 132-33, 630 A.2d at 717-18. Thus, \u00a7 9-102(a) is part of the context in which \u00a7 9-104(f)(3) must be viewed. Reading the two statutes together should resolve any ambiguity the majority finds in \u00a7 9-104(f)(3), in favor of the petitioner. The distinction drawn between buildings that are \u201cerected\u201d and those that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>\u201crepaired, rebuilt, or improved\u201d in other sections of the mechanic\u2019s lien law also undermines the majority\u2019s construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">As noted, \u00a7 9-102(a) differentiates between buildings that are erected and those that are repaired, rebuilt or improved. As Judge Kenney in the Court of Special Appeals pointed out in dissent and the petitioner now argues, having drawn that distinction in \u00a7 9-102, a part of the statutory scheme, the Legislature could not have intended that \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3), which only refers to residential homes \u201cbeing erected,\u201d apply to both situations. The majority attempts to explain away the Legislature\u2019s recognition, in \u00a7 9-102, of the distinction between new construction and repairs, rebuilding and improvements. It does so by surmising that, \u201cin enacting \u00a7 9-102(a), the Legislature likely intended to establish that, for the purposes of the mechanic\u2019s lien laws, a building that is \u2018erected\u2019 is the equivalent to one that is either \u2018repaired, rebuilt, or improved to the extent of 15% of its value.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">As it does in connection with its interpretation of \u00a7 9-104(f)(3), the majority gives \u00a7 9-102(a) a strained interpretation to reach a meaning that is not evident from, or even marginally supported by, the plain language. If, as the majority initially concludes, the phrase \u201cbeing erected\u201d reasonably includes various kinds of construction, it would have been unnecessary for the Legislature to specify in \u00a7 9-102(a) that both erected buildings <em>and </em>buildings that are substantially repaired, rebuilt, or improved are subject to establishment of a lien. In any event, the more sensible interpretation of \u00a7 9-102(a) is that by specifying that both \u201cbuildings erected\u201d and buildings \u201crepaired, rebuilt, or improved to the extent of 15%\u201d of their value constitute \u201cproperty subject to lien,\u201d the Legislature sought to create a statutory remedy that would protect materialmen when they are at their most vulnerable: when they are providing labor and materials in the substantial amounts required for either new home construction or major repairs and improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Furthermore, although the majority holds that \u201cthe crucial distinction is between homes improved to the extent of 15% of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>their value and those improved to less than 15% of their value,\u201d 366 Md. at 349, 783 A.2d at 698, it fails to apply that analysis to its construction of \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3). Under such analysis, \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3) only applies to an addition to an existing home if the addition exceeds 15% of that home\u2019s value. Although there is evidence of the value of the contract and thus the amount of the work to be done on the Brennen\u2019s home, there simply is no evidence as to the value of the Brennen residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The majority\u2019s holding that the distinction is between residences improved by more than 15 percent of their value and those that are not, while I believe it not to be a proper interpretation of the statute, is fraught with significant difficulties in its application, not the least of which is the specter of a trial within a trial as to the value of the homeowner\u2019s residence as well as the relative value of the improvements. This is not productive of a simple and efficient application of \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3), the goal that the majority states will be furthered by its approach. <em>See </em>366 Md. at 353-354, 783 A.2d at 701. Most certainly, a rule attaching \u00a7 9-104(f)(3)\u2019s protection to property values and repair estimates would be substantially more cumbersome than one that simply limits the subsection\u2019s application to new homes. In addition, as I have shown, the majority\u2019s approach renders superfluous the language of \u00a7 9-102(a) distinguishing between such buildings, and ignores that the Legislature was aware of \u00a7 9-102(a) when it enacted \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3) and apparently chose to limit the latter\u2019s application. Thus, examination of the statutory context of \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3) does not support the majority\u2019s reading of the Legislature\u2019s intent. Rather, it only serves to confirm the plain meaning of the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Finally, the cases on which the majority relies, <em>Winkler, supra; Reisterstown Lumber, supra; Best Drywall, supra; F. Scott Jay &amp; Co., supra; Grubb, supra, </em>do not support its conclusion. Those cases have discussed \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3), but in other contexts. The majority concludes, 366 Md. at 351, 783 A.2d at 700, that \u201cgenerally, courts have hesitated to construe the statute against homeowners,\u201d <em>see, e.g., Reisterstoum Lumher, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number><em>supra, </em>and point to the need for rules that are easy to apply and that strike a balance between the competing interests of homeowners and subcontractors. <em>See, e.g., Winkler, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">In none of those cases was the meaning of the phrase \u201cbeing erected\u201d presented to the court for resolution. And, rather than being in conflict with the construction urged by the petitioner and the dissenting judge in the intermediate appellate court, the cases are consistent. In <em>Winkler, </em>the Court ruled in favor of the subcontractor, holding that \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3) did not require an allegation in the complaint that, at the time notice of the lien was sent, the owner had not paid the prime contractor in full. <em>See Winkler, supra, </em>355 Md. at 254-55, 734 A.2d at 225. Citing <em>Reisterstown Lumber, supra, </em>319 Md. at 623, 574 A.2d at 307, the Court reasoned, \u201cthe mechanic\u2019s lien law should not be construed in such a way as to make the burden on the claimant so difficult as effectively to withdraw the remedy that the Legislature has clearly provided.\u201d <em>Wink-ler, </em>355 Md. at 252, 734 A.2d at 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\"><em>Reisterstown Lumber, </em>although characterized by the majority as one of two cases in which this Court recently \u201cdealt\u201d with \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3), technically was not a \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3) case at all.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, at issue in <em>Reisterstown Lumber </em>was whether \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(a)(2), which is worded identically to \u00a7 9-104(f)(3), applies \u201cwhen homeowners contract to have a single family dwelling built on their land with the intent to make it their residence, but, during the course of construction, decide to place the house on the market for sale.\u201d 319 Md. at 625, 574 A.2d at 308. The Court answered this question affirmatively, holding that \u201cwhether the improvements are \u2018for [the owner\u2019s] own residence\u2019 is determined as of the time when the subcon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>tractor commences an otherwise substantially uninterrupted performance of work for, or selling of materials to, the contractor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 631, 574 A.2d at 311. It is of interest that the Court addressed the effect of making the decision turn on the homeowners intent at some later time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB0\">In selecting the standard, \u2018for [the owner\u2019s] own residence,\u2019 the General Assembly surely did not intend to put on the lien claimant the burden of demonstrating a predominant intent over the entire course of construction in order to avoid the residential exception. Indeed, it is difficult enough to establish intent at the moment of the res gestae in the prosecution of some crimes. A construction of \u00a7 9-104(a)(2) which is heavily dependent on subjective intent or on tracing, over a long period of time, the conduct of persons with whom the claimant has no privity would not allow liens to be established, or the residential exception to be'applied, with relative simplicity.\u201d reasoning \u201cthe General Assembly surely did not intend to put on the lien claimant the burden of demonstrating a predominant intent over the entire course of construction in order to avoid the residential exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-6\"><em>Id. </em>New construction was involved in this case, as to which Judge Rodowsky commented: \u201cThe problem presented by this case is of limited scope. It arises only when an owner is having a home built on the owner\u2019s land, and there is a change of plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 630, 574 A.2d at 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s view, these cases do not evidence a trend favoring homeowners although they do, as they must, acknowledge the purpose of the residential exception. In addition, to the extent the cases instruct courts to strike a fair and reasonable balance between the competing interests of homeowners and subcontractors, they also underscore that this balance may, on occasion, require that even the \u201cresidential exception\u201d should be construed in favor of subcontractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">The remaining cases on which the majority relies are simply unpersuasive. Two of them, <em>see Best Drywall, supra; F. Scott Jay &amp; Co., </em>supra,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> are factually distinguishable from the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number><em>sub judice </em>because they involve, as I believe \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3) <em>requires, </em>newly constructed dwellings rather than existing homes being repaired or improved. Although <em>Grubb, supra, </em>involved an addition to an existing residence, as Judge Kenney pointed out in dissent, the issue presented and decided in that case was what constitutes a single family dwelling, not the application of \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3) to the construction in that case. 135 Md.App. at 262, 762 A.2d at 169. In any event, <em>Grubb </em>was decided without the benefit of <em>Winkler, </em>which demonstrates that it is possible to give \u201cfull force and effect to \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(a)(2) and (f)(3) without unduly crippling a subcontractor\u2019s ability to obtain a lien.\u201d <em>Winkler, supra </em>at 255, 734 A.2d at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">In summary, \u00a7 9-104(f)(3) clearly and unambiguously limits its application to new homes, not to existing homes that are merely repaired or improved and that interpretation is confirmed by examination of the statutory context in which it appears. I would hold that \u00a7 9 \u2014 104(f)(3) neither applies to an addition to an existing home nor prevents a subcontractor from establishing a lien against such a single family home.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Judge WILNER joins in the views herein expressed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-7\">.
