In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>petition, Bar Counsel asserted two complaints alleging violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC) 1.1 (competence); 1.3 (diligence in representation); 1.4 (communication with clients); 1.16(a)(2) (declining or terminating representation); 3.2 (expediting litigation); 8.1(b) (disciplinary matters); and 8.4(d) (misconduct) in connection with Respondent\u2019s representation of Michael Sims, Lorraine Sims, Earn Branch and Terlonda Sims<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (collectively referred to as \u201cSims\u201d), and Shantrice Braswell<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in unrelated cases. This Court referred the matter to Judge Marcella A. Holland of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to conduct an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with Md. Rules 16-709(b)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 16-711(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Following an evidentiary hearing, at which Respondent and his counsel were present and fully participating, Judge Holland found, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent violated MRPC 1.3, 1.4(a), 1.16(a)(2), and 3.2 relating to his representation in both the Sims and Braswell matters and Rule 1.4(b) in the Sims matter. Judge Holland further concluded that Respondent did not violate MRPC 1.1, 8.1(b) and 8.4(d) in both the Sims and Braswell matters, nor Rule 1.4(b) in the Braswell matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>From the evidentiary record below, Judge Holland made the following findings of fact pertaining to Respondent\u2019s conduct regarding his representation of Sims and Ms. Braswell.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">A. <em>General Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">1. Respondent is an attorney licensed to practice law in the State of Maryland since 1960. Respondent has represented between fifteen and twenty thousand clients in automobile negligence cases. While serving in the military, Respondent investigated automobile cases for two years. He worked as a claims adjuster for USF &amp; G between 1956 and 1959.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">2. Respondent was previously sanctioned for violation of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">3. Respondent was notified of the present action on 4 September 1998. The response to the action was filed on 24 February 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">B. <em>Facts Relevant to Sims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">1 On 22 December 1990, Sims was in an automobile accident. As a result of the accident they retained the Respondent to represent them. They received medical treatment for soft tissue injuries arising from the acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>dent through January 1991, collectively incurring $5,293.00 in medical bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">2. Respondent contacted the defendant\u2019s insurance carrier, CNA, in an effort to settle the case between the date of the accident and July 1992. Respondent did not make a demand for payment during these discussions and CNA denied payment. No written notification of denial was presented to Respondent by CNA. On 13 July 1992, Respondent submitted Sims\u2019 medical bills to CNA. Personal Injury Protection (PIP) was paid to Sims by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company on 21 February 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">3. On 22 July 1993, Michael Sims was convicted in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for five (5) years with all but one (1) year suspended, and four (4) years probation upon release.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">4. According to Respondent, he was reluctant to proceed with the negligence suit, in the event it could not be settled out of court, based on Michael Sims\u2019s recent criminal record. None of the other co-plaintiffs had a criminal record. Respondent\u2019s eventual decision not to pursue the civil case in trial was based on Michael Sims\u2019s criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">5. Through the course of the civil case, Respondent spoke primarily with Michael Sims. According to Respondent, Michael Sims was the spokesperson for the group of co-plaintiffs and had permission to speak on their behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">6. On 21 December 1993, Respondent filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on behalf of the Sims plaintiffs. Respondent failed to serve the defendant in the case with a Complaint and Summons. CNA never received notice of the Complaint filed in Court and therefore closed its file regarding the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">7. On 23 September 1997, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City sent out a Notification to Parties of Contemplated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Dismissal pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-507.[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] In response, Respondent filed a Motion to Suspend Maryland Rule 2-507 on 27 October 1997. The defendant in the matter, Raymond Wolf, Sr., filed Defendant\u2019s Opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Defer Dismissal Pursuant to Rule 2-507 on 12 December 1997. A hearing was scheduled on 15 December 1997. Plaintiff did not appear for the hearing in person or through Respondent. Respondent\u2019s motion was denied and the case was dismissed without prejudice on 15 December 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">C. <em>Facts Relevant to Ms. Braswell</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">1. On 11 January 1995, Shantrice Braswell, a pedestrian, was struck by a car driven by Myrtle Weissberg in a hit and run accident. Ms. Braswell was a minor at the time of the accident.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">2. Respondent was retained by Tammy Braswell, Shan-trice\u2019s mother, on her behalf. Respondent had previously represented Mrs. Braswell in another matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">3. On 12 January 1995, Respondent obtained the name and address of the defendant from the Motor Vehicle Administration based on. a license plate number provided by an unidentified witness to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">4. In January 1995, the defendant\u2019s insurance company, CNA, contacted Respondent and acknowledged representation of the defendant. Respondent did not make a \u2022demand to the insurance company, but the insurance company offered $1,000.00 to Ms. Braswell.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>5. Ms. Braswell received medical treatment from 13 January 1995 until February 1995 for soft tissue injuries received in the accident. Respondent received copies of those medical records on 13 August 1996. Respondent made a claim for PIP more than one year after the accident occurred due to the fact that he did not have the plaintiffs medical records. There are no records of written or oral communication by the Respondent requesting the necessary medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">6. On 3 November 1997, a complaint was filed in the District Court of Maryland sitting in Baltimore City. The defendant filed a notice of intention to defend on 22 December 1997 through her attorney, Mary G. Weidner, Esquire, and mailed interrogatories to' Respondent. A trial date was set for 2 February 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">7. Defense counsel contacted Respondent on 26 January 1998 regarding not having received the answers to interrogatories. Respondent, the following day, filed a motion requesting a postponement of the trial date, which was granted. The trial date was rescheduled for 8 June 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">8. On 9 February 1998, defense counsel, again, contacted Respondent regarding the missing answers to interrogatories. At this time, Respondent explained that he had been unable to meet with his client to answer the interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">9. Defense counsel filed a Motion for Sanctions against Respondent for failure to provide discovery on 12 February 1998. Respondent did not file a response to that motion. At the hearing on this matter, Respondent testified that Mrs. Braswell missed an appointment to answer the interrogatories. Respondent cited the missed appointment as the reason the interrogatories were not answered. Respondent did not reschedule the appointment, nor did he mail the interrogatories to Mrs. Braswell to answer, claiming it was his practice to meet with the client to go over the interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>10. On 8 June 1998, Respondent failed to appear for the trial and the case was dismissed with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">11. Respondent filed a motion to strike the judgment on 8 July 1998, which was denied. Respondent filed an appeal in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on 21 August 1998. A hearing was held on 31 March 1999. On 12 April 1999, an Order was signed vacating the dismissal with prejudice and further remanded the case to the District Court so that an order dismissing the case without prejudice could be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">12. Respondent sent a letter to Mrs. Braswell on 20 September 2000, explaining that the case was dismissed without prejudice and the statute of limitations would ran on 7 July 2001, Ms. Braswell\u2019s twenty-first (21) birthday. The letter further explained that Ms. Bras-well could refile the claim, but would need to hire a new attorney if she \"wished to pursue the matter further.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">C. <em>Facts Concerning Respondent\u2019s Personal Circumstances</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">1. Respondent suffered numerous personal tragedies between mid-May and mid-June 1998. Among those tragedies were the deaths of his mother on 31 May 1998 and mother-in-law on 9 June 1998. While attending to these tragedies, Respondent was frequently out of the office and therefore unaware of his trial schedule. According to Respondent, his failure to appear for trial on 8 June 1998 was due to his attention to these personal matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Respondent filed three exceptions to Judge Holland\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Respondent\u2019s first two exceptions related to Judge Holland\u2019s failure to make any findings of fact or conclusions of law concerning several defenses, raised in Respondent\u2019s Answer to Petition for Disciplinary Action, pertaining to the pre-petition proceedings. Respondent also excepted to Judge Holland\u2019s conclusion that he violated MRPG 1.3, 1.4(a), 1.16(a)(2), and 3.2 in both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Sims and Braswell matters and Rule 1.4(b) in the Sims matter. We find these exceptions to be without merit and overrule them. On the other hand, Petitioner excepts to Judge Holland\u2019s conclusion that Respondent did not violate MRPC 1.1 and 8.4(d). We sustain Petitioner\u2019s exceptions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We address Respondent\u2019s exceptions below.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">It is well settled that this Court has original jurisdiction over all attorney disciplinary proceedings. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Zdravkovich, </em>362 Md. 1, 20, 762 A.2d 950, 960 (2000); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sheridan, </em>357 Md. 1, 17, 741 A.2d 1143, 1152 (1999); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 470, 671 A.2d 463, 473 (1996); <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 16-709(b) (stating \u201c[c]harges against an attorney shall be filed on behalf of the [Attorney Grievance] Commission in the Court of Appeals.\u201d). As to Respondent\u2019s exceptions to Judge Holland\u2019s findings, \u201c \u2018we [make] an independent, detailed review of the complete record with particular reference to the evidence relat[ed] to the disputed factual finding.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sheridan, </em>357 Md. at 17, 741 A.2d at 1152 (quoting <em>Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 470, 671 A.2d at 473-74 (quoting <em>Bar Ass\u2019n v. Marshall, </em>269 Md. 510, 516, 307 A.2d 677, 680-81 (1973))). In our review, \u201cwe must keep in mind that the findings of the [hearing] judge are <em>prima facie </em>correct and will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 470, 671 A.2d at 474. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kemp, </em>303 Md. 664, 674, 496 A.2d 672, 677 (1985); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Collins, </em>295 Md. 532, 548, 457 A.2d 1134, 1142 (1983); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kahn, </em>290 Md. 654, 678, 431 A.2d 1336, 1349 (1981). We note that the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>judge \u201c \u2018may elect to pick and choose which evidence to rely upon,\u2019 \u201d <em>Kemp, </em>303 Md. at 675, 496 A.2d at 677 (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Nothstein, </em>300 Md. 667, 684, 480 A.2d 807, 816 (1984)), for she or he \u201cis in the best position to assess first hand a witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Sheridan, </em>357 Md. at 17, 741 A.2d at 1152. Therefore, we will not tamper with Judge Holland\u2019s factual findings if they are grounded in clear and convincing evidence. <em>See Kahn, </em>290 Md. at 679, 431 A.2d at 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">We recently reiterated the definition of clear and convincing evidence in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mooney, </em>359 Md. 56, 753 A.2d 17, (2000):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">The requirement of \u201cclear and convincing\u201d or \u201csatisfactory\u201d evidence does not call for \u201cunanswerable\u201d or \u201cconclusive\u201d evidence. The quality of proof, to be clear and convincing, has also been said to be somewhere between the rule in ordinary civil cases and the requirement of criminal procedure \u2014 that is, it must be more than a mere preponderance but not beyond a reasonable doubt. It has also been said that the term \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence means that the witnesses to a fact must be found to be credible, and that the facts to which they have testified are distinctly remembered and the details thereof narrated exactly and in due order, so as to enable the trier of the facts to come to a clear conviction, without hesitancy, of the truth of the precise facts in issue. Whether evidence is clear and convincing requires weighing, comparing, testing, and judging its worth when considered in connection with all the facts and circumstances in evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">359 Md. at 79, 753 A.2d at 29 (quoting <em>Berkey v. Delia, </em>287 Md. 302, 320, 413 A.2d 170, 178 (1980) (citing <em>Whittington v. State, </em>8 Md.App. 676, 679 n. 3, 262 A.2d 75, 77 n. 3 (1970))).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">B. <em>Respondent\u2019s Exception 1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Respondent asserts that Judge Holland erred in failing to make any findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to issues set forth in his second, third, fourth, fifth and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>seventh defenses in his Answer to Petition for Disciplinary Action, which we summarize below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\"><em>Second Defense: </em>Petitioner\u2019s pleading for disciplinary action improperly alleged, in the same single count, multiple charges of misconduct arising from two separate and distinct causes of action, specifically, the Sims and Braswell matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-6\"><em>Third Defense: </em>Respondent was denied due process[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] in Petitioner\u2019s pre-petition proceedings, specifically: (a) Respondent was excluded from participation in the selection of the members of the Inquiry Panel; (b) the membership of the original Inquiry Panel was altered without Respondent\u2019s knowledge or prior notification, in spite of there having been ample time to do so, thereby effectively depriving Respondent of his ability to object to a panel member for cause;[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] (c) Petitioner improperly combined for hearing two separate and distinct causes of action, Sims and Braswell, before the same Inquiry Panel, thereby depriving Respondent of a fair and impartial hearing; and (d) Petitioner improperly sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>mitted Respondent\u2019s prior disciplinary history to the Inquiry Panel before it had made a determination in the Sims and Braswell matters, and such submission deprived Respondent of a fair and impartial hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-4\"><em>Fourth Defense: </em>It was improper for Bar Counsel\u2019s office to appear for Petitioner in this action, when the complainant in the grievance proceeding was Bar Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\"><em>Fifth Defense: </em>Petitioner\u2019s functioning as complainant, investigator, charging party, prosecutor, hearing agency and, in its administrative proceedings, as the deciding agency, deprived Respondent of due process of law and equal protection of the laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\"><em>Seventh Defense: </em>The hearing judge\u2019s post-petition proceeding was tainted by Petitioner\u2019s pre-petition proceedings and activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Respondent was not prejudiced by Judge Holland considering multiple charges of misconduct arising from the Sims and Braswell matters in a single disciplinary proceeding. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Stewart, </em>285 Md. 251, 259-60, 401 A.2d 1026, 1030 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">We now turn to Respondent\u2019s exception relating to Judge Holland\u2019s failure to make any findings of fact and conclusions of law concerning the above enumerated defenses regarding the pre-petition proceedings. We find that Respondent\u2019s exception on this issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">While it is true that Judge Holland did not address this in her memorandum, she was not obligated to do so and her omission did not prejudice Respondent. It is well settled, a point conceded by Respondent at both the evidentiary hearing and in his exceptions, that \u201cif a lawyer is given notice and the opportunity to defend in a full and fair hearing before a three-judge panel [then serving much the same function as a single judge does currently], the question whether he was accorded due process of law by the Inquiry Panel and the Review Board is ordinarily immaterial.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>285 Md. at 259, 401 A.2d at 1030. <em>See also Harris, </em>310 Md. at 202, 528 A.2d at 897; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number><em>Bar Ass\u2019n of Baltimore v. Posner, 275 </em>Md. 250, 255, 339 A.2d 657, 659-60 (1975); <em>Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Frank, 272 </em>Md. 528, 538, 325 A.2d 718, 723-24 (1974). We have held that attorney disciplinary proceedings for professional misconduct are not criminal proceedings, and \u201c[ajccordingly, a lawyer charged with misconduct is not entitled, at any stage of disciplinary proceedings, to all of the constitutional safeguards accorded an accused in a criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>285 Md. at 258-59, 401 A.2d at 1029-30. We have likened proceedings conducted by the Inquiry Panel and Review Board \u201cto the proceedings conducted by a grand jury in criminal cases. Their purpose is to aid in determining whether to institute disciplinary action. They are investigatory in nature and informal to the extent that the rules of evidence need not apply.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>285 Md. at 259, 401 A.2d at 1030. <em>See also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McBurney, </em>282 Md. 116, 121-23, 383 A.2d 58, 61-62 (1978); <em>Frank, 272 </em>Md. at 538, 325 A.2d at 723-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Respondent urges this Court to reassess the reasoning of <em>Stewart </em>in the instant case in light of the fact that Petitioner violated its own procedural guidelines when it failed to give Respondent prior notification of substitutions made to the membership of the Inquiry Panel as originally constituted. We are not persuaded. Moreover, we addressed this issue in <em>Harris, </em>when we explained that if there is cause for objection to a Panel member based on conflict of interest grounds, an attorney may give written notice to the Panel Chairman in accord with procedural guidelines. 310 Md. at 202-03, 528 A.2d at 897-98. There was nothing to preclude Respondent from submitting written notification to the Panel Chairman within the required ten (10) days of his Panel hearing, when he first became aware of the identity of the ultimate Panel members and their alleged potential conflicts. While the record indicates Respondent\u2019s counsel made a verbal objection at the Inquiry Panel hearing, there is nothing to indicate he put his objection in -writing as required by the Guidelines. Moreover, this Court is not convinced that there was an actual or apparent conflict of interest between Respondent and any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Panel member, or any prejudice as a result of the substitutions. Respondent was afforded notice and an opportunity to defend in a full and fair hearing before Judge Holland. Accordingly, his various defenses asserting denial of due process in the pre-petition proceedings are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">C. <em>Respondent\u2019s Exception 2</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">For the reasons enumerated above, we overrule Respondent\u2019s second exception that Judge Holland failed to afford appropriate effect to the evidence bearing upon the issues raised by his second, third, fourth, fifth and seventh defenses, particularly whether the effect of Petitioner\u2019s activities and administrative proceedings deprived Respondent of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">D. <em>Respondent\u2019s Exception 3</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">We now turn to Respondent\u2019s third exception relating to Judge Holland\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law that he violated MRPC 1.3, 1.4(a), 1.16(a)(2), and 3.2 in both the Sims and Braswell matters, and Rule 1.4(b) in the Sims matter. Respondent argues these findings and/or conclusions are not supported by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">We have made an independent and thorough review of the record, and conclude that Judge Holland\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law as they relate to these violations are supported by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">i. <em>Violation of MRPC 1.3</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct <em>1.3 </em>\u2014 Diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">Judge Holland concluded that Respondent failed to diligently represent Sims based on her findings that Respondent did not file a complaint in the matter until nearly three years after the accident (even though he was hired almost immediately following the accident), Respondent failed to serve the defendant, which resulted in a motion for dismissal under Rule 2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>507, and then failed to appear for the scheduled hearing on the motion. In a blanket assertion meant to cover all of Judge Holland\u2019s adverse findings or conclusions, Respondent desires that we excuse his failure to serve the defendant and appear at the Rule 2-507 hearing on the basis that he had no intention of taking the case to trial if it could not be settled.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, Respondent asserts that Michael Sims, a plaintiff in the matter and the alleged spokesperson for his co-plaintiffs, was informed and approved of Respondent\u2019s decision. Judge Holland concluded that Respondent\u2019s filing of a motion to suspend operation of the Rule 2-507 dismissal belied Respondent\u2019s assertion. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Our review of the record indicates Respondent was frustrated in his attempts to settle with the defendant\u2019s insurance company in the three years following the accident, at which point he filed a complaint within one day of the expiration of the statute of limitations. Nearly four (4) years later, and in response to the court\u2019s notification of a contemplated dismissal for lack of prosecution, Respondent filed a motion to suspend operation of Rule 2-507, asserting that Sims had a \u201cmeritorious case\u201d and \u201cif the Court strikes the Order of Dismissal and re-instates the case and suspends the operation of Maryland Rule 2-507, the Plaintiff is <em>ready and eager to proceed with the case </em>and will make every effort to bring the case to a conclusion within such time as the Court orders.\u201d (Emphasis added). Neither Respondent nor Sims appeared for the Rule 2-507 hearing. We stated in <em>Mooney, </em>\u201c \u2018this Court has consistently regarded neglect and inattentiveness to a client\u2019s interests to be [an ethical violation] warranting the imposition of some disciplinary sanction.\u2019 \u201d 359 Md. at 76, 753 A.2d at 27 (quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Montgomery, </em>296 Md. 113, 120, 460 A.2d 597, 600 (1983)). Judge Holland\u2019s conclusion that Respondent violated MRPC 1.3 by his failure to serve the defendant and appear at the Rule 2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>507 hearing is supported by clear and convincing evidence. This exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">In regard to the Braswell matter, Respondent acknowledges he failed to appear for trial, resulting in the case being dismissed with prejudice. Respondent offers as explanation for his neglect during that time, the recent death of his mother and frequent absences from his office while attending to the needs of his dying mother-in-law, during which time he was unaware of his trial schedule. He further suggests that any prejudice to his client caused by his failure to appear for trial was remedied as a result of the appeal to the Circuit Court, which modified the District Court\u2019s judgment to dismissal without prejudice. While we sympathize with Respondent\u2019s personal tragedies and attendant duties during this time, Respondent\u2019s inability to diligently represent Ms. Bras-well was a violation of MRPC 1.16(a)(2), discussed <em>infra. </em>Moreover, extenuating circumstances surrounding Respondent\u2019s neglect, as well as the fact that his client ultimately was not prejudiced, are considerations for determining the proper sanction. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Jaseb, </em>364 Md. 464, 481-82, 773 A.2d 516, 526 (2001) (quoting <em>Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 488-89, 671 A.2d at 483 (suggesting a non-exclusive list of mitigating factors this Court will consider in determining the proper sanction) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Respondent excepts to Judge Holland\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 1.3 by failing to answer defendant\u2019s interrogatories in the Braswell case. Respondent argues his failure to do so was the result of Mrs. Braswell\u2019s lack of cooperation in missing a scheduled appointment to review the interrogatories. Judge Holland rejected his assertion, noting Respondent\u2019s testimony that he made no further effort to reschedule the appointment or to mail the interrogatories to Mrs. Braswell as a means to obtain answers. In our review of the record, we find Respondent\u2019s exception to be without merit. Defendant\u2019s interrogatories were mailed to Respondent on 22 December 1997. Respondent failed to respond to the interrogatories prior to the 8 June 1998 court date, in spite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>of repeated attempts by defendant\u2019s counsel to secure discovery, including a hearing for sanctions on the matter. We agree with Judge Holland that Respondent\u2019s failure to make reasonable attempts to respond to defendant\u2019s interrogatories in furtherance of his client\u2019s interests was in violation of Rule 1.3. Accordingly, we overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">ii. <em>Violation of MRPC 1.4</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct <em>1.4 </em>\u2014 Communi<em>cation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">(a) A lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">(b) A lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Respondent next excepts to Judge Holland\u2019s conclusion that he violated MRPC 1.4(a) and (b) in the Sims case by failing to communicate with the plaintiffs, other than Michael Sims. Respondent asserts there was an agreement among the Sims plaintiffs that Michael Sims would represent the group regarding communication with Respondent. Finding no evidence that such an agreement existed, either by witness testimony from the Sims plaintiffs or a written agreement or documentation of an oral agreement, Judge Holland concluded that Respondent violated MRPC 1.4(a) by failing to communicate with the Sims plaintiffs, other than Michael Sims, about the status of their case. For the same reason, Judge Holland concluded Respondent violated MRPC 1.4(b) by faffing to explain to the Sims plaintiffs, other than Michael Sims, the consequences of allowing the lawsuit to be dismissed. Respondent argues that this reasoning is erroneous because his testimony at the evidentiary hearing provided evidence of the existence of the agreement. Moreover, he argues, Petitioner bore the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence the nonexistence of the agreement, whether through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>witnesses or documents. Respondent\u2019s argument is misguided.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Petitioner proved by clear and convincing evidence through Respondent\u2019s own testimony that Respondent had communicated with Michael Sims to the exclusion of the other co-plaintiffs. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Respondent failed to sustain his burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of an agreement among the Sims plaintiffs that Michael Sims would be their spokesperson. Accordingly, this exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>In regard to the Braswell matter, Respondent excepts to Judge Holland\u2019s conclusion that he violated MRPC 1.4(a) by not keeping Mrs. Braswell reasonably informed of the status of her minor child\u2019s pending case, including a $1,000 settlement offer made by defendant\u2019s insurance company. Respondent notes that the only witnesses in the Braswell matter were Mrs. Braswell and the Respondent.

Applying the clearly erroneous standard, we will not substitute our judgement for that of Judge Holland where it was dependent on her assessment of witness credibility. <em>See Sheridan, </em>357 Md. at 17, 741 A.2d at 1152; <em>Hanis, </em>310 Md. at 210, 528 A.2d at 901.

The record indicates repeated testimony from Respondent explaining that his failure to serve the Sims defendant was due, at least in part, to medical illness and family tragedies. This was further attested to in his motion to suspend dismissal of the case under Rule 2-507, which provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"akt-dedup-0\">The Plaintiffs Counsel underwent serious cancer surgery with complications and after effects, had death of a parent, mental illness of another parent as the result of the death of the first parent during the period of time that this case was filed, through and until recent date and has fallen behind on his schedule and work....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">For the reasons set forth in the preceding paragraph, service of process in this matter was not completed through no fault of the Plaintiff who has a meritorious case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"arl-dedup-0\">Respondent cannot have it both ways. There is clear and convincing evidence that Respondent\u2019s representation of Sims was substantially impaired by his distraction with personal problems. Accordingly, we overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Along the same lines, Respondent asserts that Judge Holland erred in concluding that Respondent violated MRPC 1.16(a)(2) in the Braswell case by failing to withdraw from his representation of Ms. Braswell while he was attending to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>needs of his dying mother and mother-in-law, and mourning their subsequent deaths. Respondent concedes that as a result of these occurrences, he failed to appear for trial, and the case was dismissed with prejudice. Respondent suggests, however, that his neglect was mitigated by his subsequent appeal which resulted in a dismissal without prejudice, thereby preserving his client\u2019s claim until such time as she attained the age of twenty-one (21) years. As previously noted, <em>supra, </em>extenuating circumstances surrounding Respondent\u2019s neglect, as well as the fact that his client ultimately was not prejudiced, are more properly considerations for determining the proper sanction. <em>See Jaseb, </em>364 Md. at 481-82, 773 A.2d at 526 (quoting <em>Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 488-89, 671 A.2d at 483 (citations omitted)). Judge Holland concluded, and we agree, that under the circumstances, Respondent should have foreseen that his ability to represent Ms. Braswell would be substantially impaired by his preoccupation with personal matters during this time.

Respondent argues that his actions in the matter, including his failure to appear at the Rule 2-507 hearing, were within the undertaking of his agreement with the Sims clients not to proceed to trial if the case did not settle. Judge Holland concluded that Respondent offered no reasonable explanation for his failure to serve the defendant in the nearly seven (7) years since the date of the accident. She rejected Respondent\u2019s explanation that he never intended to proceed to trial if the matter did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>settle, again noting that Respondent\u2019s actions in filing suit after failed settlement attempts with the defendant\u2019s insurance company and his subsequent motion to suspend the Rule 2-507 action proved otherwise.

For the reasons stated below, we sustain Petitioner\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">i. <em>Violation of MRPC 1.1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct <em>1.1 </em>\u2014 Competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">Judge Holland concluded that Respondent did not violate MRPC 1.1 based on her findings that Respondent had extensive knowledge and experience in handling automobile negligence cases, that Respondent was aware of the type of injury, and its impact, in both the Sims and Braswell cases, and that he had communicated and negotiated with the insurance company in both cases. Citing <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mooney, </em>359 Md. 56, 753 A.2d 17 (2000), Petitioner asserts that Respondent\u2019s failure to appear at the Rule 2-507 hearing in the Sims matter, and at trial in the Braswell matter, was incompetent representation and a violation of MRPC 1.1. We are unable to reconcile Judge Holland\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>conclusion with our holding in <em>Mooney; </em>therefore, we sustain Petitioner\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">In <em>Mooney, </em>we held that an attorney\u2019s failure to appear in court for a client\u2019s trial, absent an acceptable explanation, was incompetent representation and a violation of MRPC 1.1. <em>Mooney, </em>359 Md. at 74, 753 A.2d at 26. Competent representation, however, encompasses more than an attorney\u2019s legal knowledge, skill or preparedness. It necessarily includes, at a minimum, the attorney\u2019s presence at any court proceeding for which he or she was retained, absent an acceptable explanation for that attorney\u2019s absence. <em>Id. </em>As we stated in <em>Mooney, </em>\u201ca complete failure of representation is the ultimate incompetency.\u201d 359 Md. at 74, 753 A.2d at 25. Respondent argues that unlike the attorney in <em>Mooney, </em>he has provided sufficient explanation for his absence in both proceedings, specifically, his agreement with the Sims plaintiffs, through Michael Sims, not to proceed to trial if the matter did not settle, and the extenuating circumstances surrounding his personal misfortunes which caused him to miss the trial in the Braswell matter. For the reasons previously stated, <em>supra, </em>Respondent has not provided satisfactory explanation for his absences. We therefore sustain Petitioner\u2019s exception and hold that Respondent violated MRPC 1.1 in both the Sims and Braswell matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">ii. <em>Violation of MRPC 8.4(d)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Maryland Rule of Professional <em>Conduct </em>\u2014 Misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to: ...</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice;....</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Judge Holland concluded that Petitioner failed to provide clear and convincing evidence to support its allegation that Respondent violated MRPC 8.4(d).

Likewise, in Braswell, Respondent rescheduled an original court date of 2 February 1998 and subsequently failed to appear at trial on 8 June 1998. Respondent therefore violated MRPC 8.4(d). The circumstances surrounding his failures are matters that go to the severity of the sanction. <em>See Ficker, </em>319 Md. at 315, 572 A.2d at 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Having determined that Respondent has violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a), 1.16(a)(2), 3.2, and 8.4(d) in both the Sims and Braswell matters and 1.4(b) in the Sims matter, we now must consider the appropriate sanction to be imposed.

In making a determination of the appropriate sanction, this Court may consider, as a nonexclusive list, the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-4\">[A]bsence of a prior disciplinary record; absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; personal or emotional problems; timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct; full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; inexperience in the practice of law; character or reputation; physical or mental disability or impairment; delay in disciplinary proceedings; interim rehabilitation; imposition of other penalties or sanctions; remorse; and finally, remoteness of prior offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-5\"><em>Jaseb, </em>364 Md. at 481-82, 773 A.2d at 526 (quoting <em>Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 488-89, 671 A.2d at 483 (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Considering all of the circumstances in the case, we conclude that the appropriate sanction to be imposed is suspension from the practice of law in this State for six (6) months.
