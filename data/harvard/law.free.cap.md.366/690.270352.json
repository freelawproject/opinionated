While Anderson was on duty as a security guard at the hotel, two men entered the hotel lobby and pointed a sawed-off shotgun at the desk clerk, attempting a robbery. Anderson, who was in the hotel lobby at the time, took out his police service handgun, and a gun battle ensued between Anderson and the robbers. The plaintiff James Lovelace, a guest of the hotel who happened to be in the lobby at the time, was struck and injured by a bullet fired from Anderson\u2019s handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">In Lovelace\u2019s tort action against Anderson and the hotel owners and operators, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Anderson and the hotel owners and operators, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. We granted Lovelace\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to consider the tort liability, if any, of Anderson and the hotel owners and operators for Anderson\u2019s allegedly negligent shooting of Lovelace. We shall reverse the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">The trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was based on numerous depositions, affidavits, and exhibits. The testimony on several matters was conflicting, and we shall in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>our review of the facts note some of those conflicts. Nevertheless, as the tort action against the defendants Anderson and the hotel owners and operators was decided by a grant of the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, we must review the facts, and all inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. <em>See, e.g., Taylor v. Nations-Bank, </em>365 Md. 166, 173-174, 776 A.2d 645, 650 (2001) (in reviewing \u201cthe propriety of the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment * * *, the evidence, and all inferences therefrom, are viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party\u201d); <em>Jones v. Mid-Atlantic Funding, </em>362 Md. 661, 679, 766 A.2d 617, 626 (2001) (\u201cwhen considering the granting of summary judgment we examine the facts and the inferences derived from the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party\u201d); <em>Walpert v. Katz, </em>361 Md. 645, 650 n. 2, 762 A.2d 582, 584 n. 2 (2000); <em>Okwa v. Harper, </em>360 Md. 161, 178, 187, 757 A.2d 118, 127, 132 (2000); <em>Williams v. Baltimore, </em>359 Md. 101, 113-115, 753 A.2d 41, 47-48 (2000); <em>Ashton v.

East, </em>363 Md. 408, 422, 768 A.2d 1029, 1036 (2001). Judge Rodowsky for the Court in the <em>PaineWebber </em>opinion, 363 Md. at 422-423, 768 A.2d at 1036-1037, went on to set forth the reasons for this principle, quoting from <em>Gresser v. Anne Arundel County, </em>349 Md. 542, 709 A.2d 740 (1998), and <em>Geisz v. Greater Baltimore Med. Ctr., </em>313 Md. 301, 545 A.2d 658 (1988), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-6\">\u201c \u2018[W]e will not speculate that summary judgment might have been granted on other grounds not reached by the trial court.\u2019 \u2019\u2019Gresser, 349 Md. at 552, 709 A.2d at 745. In <em>Geisz v. Greater Baltimore Med. Ctr., </em>313 Md. 301, 314, n. 5, 545 A.2d 658, 664 n. 5 (1988), we stated the rule as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>\u201c \u2018On an appeal from the grant of a summary judgment which is reversible because of error in the grounds relied upon by the trial court the appellate court will not ordinarily undertake to sustain the judgment by ruling on another ground, not ruled upon the trial court, if the alternative ground is one as to which the trial court had a discretion to deny summary judgment. For example, a motion might be denied in order to allow the party opposing the motion a further opportunity through discovery to present a triable issue of fact. <em>See Metropolitan Mtg. Fund v. Basiliko, </em>288 Md. 25, 415 A.2d 582 (1980). Thus, in <em>Henley v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>305 Md. 320, 503 A.2d 1333 (1986), a case of alleged negligent hiring, we reversed a summary judgment for a defendant because, contrary to the trial court\u2019s conclusion, we found a triable issue of hiring. We would not, however, consider if a lack of proximate cause was an alternative support for the judgment because \u2018[t]he effect of our ruling on the issue of proximate cause, or any other issue not considered by the trial judge would be to deprive the trial judge of discretion to deny or to defer until trial on the merits the entry of judgment on such issues.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 333, 503 A.2d at 1340.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-5\"><em>See also, e.g., Bishop v.

Anderson\u2019s duties for the Baltimore City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Police Department at that time consisted of \u201cadministrative stuff that ... came across my desk, with reference to photographs, vehicles, vehicle maintenance, ... medical.\u201d He was not, at the time, \u201con the streets\u201d for the Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">Also in December 1993, during his off-duty hours as a Baltimore City policeman, Anderson was employed as a security guard at a hotel outside of Baltimore City. The hotel was then called the Days Inn, and it was located on Security Boulevard in Baltimore County. According to Anderson\u2019s deposition testimony, he worked 24 or 25 hours per week for the Days Inn. Anderson further testified that, at the time he and other security guards were hired by the Days Inn, the person who hired them \u201cwanted us to work security. She had special, you know, assignments for us that she wanted, and one of them was to prevent robberies if we could.... \u201d When on duty as a security guard for the Days Inn, Anderson would not wear his police uniform but would dress in \u201cjust regular everyday plain clothes.\u201d Anderson further testified that, when he and others were on duty as security guards, the management of the Days Inn \u201cdid not want our guns to show.\u201d Anderson\u2019s police service handgun was a Glock 17 nine millimeter semi-automatic pistol which, when fully loaded, would hold seventeen bullets. He carried this handgun, concealed, when acting as a security guard for the hotel. Anderson had not obtained from the Maryland State Police a permit to carry a handgun when employed as a security guard at the Days Inn in Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">During the late afternoon and evening of December 2, 1993, Anderson was not on duty in Baltimore City as a policeman. Instead, he was on duty as a security guard at the Days Inn, working the 4:00 p.m. to midnight shift. He was paid by the owners and operators of the Days Inn for the 4:00 p.m. to midnight period on December 2, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">On the evening of December 2, 1993, James Lovelace was a guest at the Days Inn on Security Boulevard, and he had been a guest at the hotel for the previous five or six days. Prior to the evening of December 2, 1993, Lovelace had been intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>duced to Anderson, and he knew that Anderson was one of the security guards at the Days Inn. Michael Gordon was employed as a desk clerk at the Days Inn, and he was on duty behind the desk during the evening of December 2, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">At about 8:10 p.m. on December 2, 1993, Lovelace walked into the lobby at the Days Inn and stood at one end of the front desk which was about ten feet in length. Gordon was behind the front desk, and Anderson was sitting on a sofa in the lobby. A few seconds after Lovelace entered the hotel lobby, two men, later identified as Earl Jennings and Randy Terry, and both \u201cdressed in a scrubby fashion,\u201d entered the hotel lobby and walked to the front desk. The testimony as to where Jennings and Terry were standing at the front desk was conflicting. Terry removed a sawed-off shotgun from under his coat, pointed it at the desk clerk Gordon, and yelled \u201chold up.\u201d Jennings immediately thereafter took out a bag, handed it to Gordon, and Gordon started toward the cash register.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Anderson testified that when Terry pointed the shotgun at Gordon and yelled \u201chold up,\u201d Anderson stood up, unzipped his jacket, got out his pistol, and announced \u201cpolice.\u201d According to Anderson, Terry turned around and fired at Anderson. Anderson stated that he returned the fire, that he was shooting with \u201ctunnel vision,\u201d that the \u201conly thing I could see was that shotgun and the two suspects,\u201d and that he lost \u201csight of Mr. Lovelace.\u201d Anderson discharged twelve rounds of ammunition in \u201cabout three seconds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Jennings was killed by a shot to his head. Terry was shot in the back, but he was able to flee. Terry was later apprehended, convicted of attempted robbery and attempted murder, and sentenced to imprisonment for 32 years. Anderson lost three fingers from his left hand as a result of the gun battle. Anderson did not know that Lovelace had been shot until sometime after the gun battle.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">Lovelace\u2019s testimony contradicted Anderson\u2019s in some particulars. According to Lovelace, after Terry pointed a shotgun at Gordon and yelled \u201chold up,\u201d and after Jennings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>handed a bag to Gordon, Anderson stood up and fired the first shot. Lovelace testified that Anderson did not say \u201cpolice\u201d before firing that initial shot. Lovelace also indicated that Anderson\u2019s first shot struck Jennings, and that Jennings then fell to the floor. Immediately thereafter, Lovelace dropped to the floor although he had not been hit at that time. Lovelace stated that he was lying on the floor with his feet near Jennings\u2019s head, and that he saw Terry get shot and stagger out of the lobby. Lovelace testified that he then saw that Anderson was pointing his gun in the direction of Jennings\u2019s head and Lovelace\u2019s feet, that the gun went off, and that the bullet hit Lovelace\u2019s feet. The bullet went through one foot and into the ankle of Lovelace\u2019s other foot. After he was shot, Lovelace was able to move over to the sofa. When Lovelace was at the sofa, he saw Jennings sit up, clutch his mid-section, and heard him \u201cmoaning and groaning.\u201d Thereupon, Lovelace testified, \u201cSergeant Anderson stood in back of him [Jennings] and shot him in the back of the head and killed him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Lovelace was initially taken to St. Agnes hospital in Baltimore, and he was later treated at a Veterans Administration (VA) hospital. At the time of his deposition in 1997, Lovelace was still going to the VA hospital every two weeks for treatment because of the injury to his feet, and he needed a cane in order to walk.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Terry testified that, after he yelled \u201chold up,\u201d Anderson fired the first shot, that the first bullet hit Terry, and that Terry returned the fire. According to Terry, Anderson did not identify himself as a police officer. Terry stated that Jennings did not fire a gun, that Terry had both a 12 gauge shotgun and a .357 magnum handgun, and that he did not begin shooting until Anderson shot him. Terry testified that he fired the shotgun twice and the handgun six times. Terry claimed that he did not see Anderson until Anderson fired his gun. Terry estimated that the gun battle lasted five or six minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">A ballistics expert, who had worked fifteen years for the Maryland State Police Crime Laboratory, stated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>bullet recovered from Lovelace\u2019s body was fired from Anderson\u2019s Glock 17 nine millimeter pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">This case was further complicated by the fact that the ownership of the Days Inn changed on December 2,1993. Up until sometime on December 2nd, Sage Hospitality Resources, Inc., managed the hotel under a managing agreement with the owner, the Bank of Baltimore, and Sage employed Anderson as a security guard. On December 2, 1993, the hotel was sold to Sterling Hotel, Inc., and Sterling, either then or sometime thereafter, became Anderson\u2019s employer. Although the closing occurred in the evening of December 2nd shortly before the attempted robbery, the evidence was conflicting as to the private hotel corporation which was Anderson\u2019s employer when the attempted robbery took place. When asked \u201cwhat if any participation did Sage Resources, Inc., have in the managing of the premises\u201d after \u201cthe closing took place,\u201d a representative of Sage testified, \u201cnone I believe.\u201d Certain documentary evidence supported an inference that Sage\u2019s management responsibilities ended prior to the attempted robbery. Other documentary evidence and pay records, however, indicated that Sage\u2019s management responsibilities extended beyond the closing to the end of the day.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission determined that Sage Hospitality Resources, Inc., and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, were co-employers of Anderson at the time of his injury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Certain regulations of the Baltimore City Police Department, as well as state statutory provisions, have been relied upon by various parties in this case. These concern secondary employment of police officers, authority of police officers outside of their territorial jurisdiction, and immunities of police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.VoL), Art. 27, \u00a7 729A, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-7\">\u201cA law enforcement agency may not prohibit secondary employment but may promulgate reasonable regulations as to a law enforcement officer\u2019s secondary employment.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Rules and Regulations of the Baltimore City Police Department, contained in various \u201cGeneral Orders\u201d of the Department, specifically regulate secondary employment by police officers, including secondary employment outside of Baltimore City. General Order 6-90, paragraphs one and two, provide for the obtaining of the Department\u2019s permission to engage in secondary employment and limit allowable secondary employment to that specified in the permission. Paragraph nine of the same General Order requires a police officer engaging in secondary employment to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-9\">\u201c9. Obtain a handgun permit from the Maryland State Police, when you are required by your secondary employers to be armed as a condition of your employment. In this case, you are armed under the authority of your secondary employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">Paragraph eleven of the same General Order, relating to secondary employment outside of Baltimore City, states that a police officer</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-11\">\u201c11. May obtain secondary employment outside the City of Baltimore, as long as all the following conditions are met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>a. You are acting as a private citizen, without exercising powers and duties of a police officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-5\">b. You are not using Baltimore City Police credentials or equipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-6\">c. You are not acting as a special police officer or private detective, except when employed in accident reconstruction or arson investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">d. You are not operating as a private detective, guard and/or watchman agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">Anderson had received permission from the Baltimore City Police Department to work as a security guard at the Days Inn. Nevertheless, as previously mentioned, Anderson had not obtained a permit from the Maryland State Police to carry a handgun while engaged in his secondary employment. In an affidavit filed in support of the plaintiffs\u2019 opposition to the motions for summary judgment, Colonel Wilbert T. Travers, Jr., a former Superintendent of the Maryland State Police, expressed the opinion that Anderson\u2019s secondary employment was in violation of Baltimore City Police Department regulations concerning secondary employment, that he was not acting as a Baltimore City Police Officer during the gun battle, and that he was guilty of gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">A state statutory provision in effect in December 1998, and presently codified as Code (2001), \u00a7 2-102 of the Criminal Procedure Article, delineates the authority of a police officer to exercise police powers outside of the officer\u2019s jurisdiction. Subsections (b)(c) and (d) of \u00a7 2-102 provide in pertinent part as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-10\">\u201c(b) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 (1) Subject to the limitations of paragraph (3) of this subsection, a police officer may make arrests, conduct investigations, and otherwise enforce the laws of the State throughout the State without limitations as to jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-11\">\u201c(3) A police officer may exercise the powers granted by this section when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>(i) 1. the police officer is participating in a joint investigation with officials from another state, federal, or local law enforcement unit, at least one of which has local jurisdiction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-4\">2. the police officer is rendering assistance to another police officer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-5\">3. the police officer is acting at the request of a police officer or State Police officer; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">4. <em>an emergency exists; and</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\">(ii) <em>the 'police officer is acting in accordance with regulations adopted by the police officer\u2019s employing unit to carry out this section.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-8\">\u201c(c) <em>Required notifications. </em>\u2014 (1) A police officer who acts under the authority granted by this section shall notify the following persons of an investigation or enforcement action:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-9\">\u201c3. the chief of police or chiefs designee, when in a county with a county police department, except Baltimore City;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-10\">\u201c(d) <em>Immunities and exemptions; employee status. </em>\u2014 A police officer who acts under the authority granted by this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-11\">(1) has all the immunities from liability and exemptions as a State Police officer in addition to any other immunities and exemptions to which the police officer is otherwise entitled; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-12\">(2) remains at all times and for all purposes an employee of the employing unit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-13\">The plaintiffs have consistently argued that Anderson was in violation of subsections (b)(3)(4)(ii) and (c)(l)(i)(3) of the above-quoted statute, that, therefore, he was not acting as a Baltimore City police officer during the evening of December 2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>1993, and that, for this reason, he was not entitled to the immunities of a police officer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Some statutory provisions referred to by the parties concern the immunities of government officers or, specifically, police officers. Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-507(b)(l) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">\u201cAn official of a municipal corporation, while acting in a discretionary capacity, without malice, and within the scope of the official\u2019s employment or authority shall be immune as an official or individual from any civil liability for the performance of the action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-7\"><em>See also </em>\u00a7 5-511(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201can official of a governmental entity, while acting in a discretionary capacity, without malice, and within the scope of the official\u2019s authority is immune\u201d from tort liability). We have pointed out that the purpose of these provisions \u201cwas to codify existing public official immunity, and not to extend the scope of qualified immunity beyond its Maryland common law boundaries.\u201d <em>Ashton v. Brawn, supra, </em>339 Md. at 116 n. 23, 660 A.2d at 470 n. 23. We have also held that a police officer, while acting in the scope of his employment as a police officer, is a \u201cpublic official\u201d for purposes of the public official immunity doctrine. <em>Williams v. Baltimore, supra, </em>359 Md. at 138-139, 753 A.2d at 58-59, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">The doctrine of public official immunity under Maryland law was summarized by the Court in <em>James v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>288 Md. 315, 323-324, 418 A.2d 1173, 1178 (1980) (emphasis in original):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-9\">\u201cBefore a governmental representative in this State is relieved of liability for his negligent acts, it must be determined that the following independent factors <em>simultaneously </em>exist: (1) the individual actor, whose alleged negligent conduct is at issue, is a <em>public official </em>rather than a mere <em>government employee or agent; </em>and (2) his tortious conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>occurred while he was performing <em>discretionary, </em>as opposed to <em>ministerial, </em>acts in furtherance of his official duties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">\u201cOnce it is established that the individual is a public official <em>and </em>the tort was committed while performing a duty which involves the exercise of discretion, a qualified immunity attaches; namely, in the absence of malice, the individual involved is free from liability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">As indicated above, the defense of public official immunity generally applies only to negligent acts. In <em>DiPino v. Davis, </em>354 Md. 18, 49, 729 A.2d 354, 370 (1999), after setting forth the above-quoted language from <em>James v. Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>Judge Wilner for the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">\u201cThose principles apply to negligent conduct, not to intentional conduct. In <em>Cox v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>296 Md. 162, 460 A.2d 1038 (1983), we made clear that a police officer, who might otherwise have the benefit of this immunity, does not enjoy it if the officer commits an intentional tort or acts with malice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-8\"><em>See also Ashton v.

Judge Cathell for the Court, in <em>Williams v. Baltimore, supra, </em>359 Md. at 143-145, 753 A.2d at 64-65, recently discussed in detail this principle, as well as our earlier cases, and particularly <em>Ashburn v. Anne Arundel County, </em>306 Md. 617, 510 A.2d 1078 (1986). We explained in <em>Williams, </em>359 Md. at 143-144, 753 A.2d at 64 (footnotes and some citations omitted, emphasis in original):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">\u201cThus, we recognize the general rule, as do most courts, that absent a \u2018special relationship\u2019 between police and victim, liability for failure to protect an individual citizen against injury caused by another citizen does not lie against police officers. Rather, the \u2018duty\u2019 owed by the police by virtue of their positions as officers is a duty to protect the public, and the breach of that duty is most properly actionable by the public in the form of criminal prosecution or administrative disposition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-8\">\u201cAs evidenced in the wording of <em>Ashbum, </em>Maryland recognizes that liability for failure to protect an individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>citizen against injury caused by another citizen, where the officer is performing a discretionary act, does not lie against an officer, <em>absent a \u2018special relationship.\u2019 </em>In the presence of a \u2018special relationship\u2019 liability may lie and immunity may not survive. Thus, \u2018[t]he public duty doctrine ... is not an absolute bar to recovery.\u2019 ... As we continued in <em>Ashbum:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-4\">\u201c \u2018A proper plaintiff, however, is not without recourse. If he alleges sufficient facts to show that the defendant policeman created a \u2018special relationship\u2019 with him upon which he relied, he may maintain his action in negligence. <em>See Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 815(b).\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Moreover, when a police officer is acting outside of his or her jurisdiction, the General Assembly has appeared to require the presence of two additional circumstances as a condition for immunity. Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-605(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">\u201c \u00a7 5-605.

This provision, however, has no application to the present case. Employees of the Baltimore City Police Department were not included within the Local Government Tort Claims Act until the enactment of Ch. 364 of the Acts of 1997, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>effective October 1, 1997. Section 2 of Ch. 364 provides that \u201cthis Act shall be construed only prospectively and may not be applied or interpreted to have any effect on or application to any cause of action arising before the effective date of this Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">This action commenced when James Lovelace and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City a complaint for compensatory tort damages, based on the injury Lovelace suffered during the evening of December 2, 1993, at the Days Inn. Named as defendants were Kenneth Anderson, Sage Hospitality Resources, Inc., Sterling Hotel, Inc., the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, the Baltimore City Police Department, the Baltimore City Police Commissioner, and the State of Maryland. The plaintiffs asserted that Anderson acted both with negligence and with gross negligence. The plaintiffs alleged, in the alternative, that each of the defendants (other than Anderson) was Anderson\u2019s employer at the time and that Anderson was acting in the scope of his employment for such defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Upon the motion of the defendant Sterling Hotel, Inc., the Circuit Court for Baltimore City transferred the case to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">Thereafter, motions to dismiss were filed on behalf of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, the Baltimore City Police Department, the Baltimore City Police Commissioner, and the State of Maryland. The motions to dismiss on behalf of the Mayor and City Council, the Police Department, and the Police Commissioner, asserted that the complaint failed to state a claim against the movants upon which relief could be granted, that the movants were protected by immunity, that the movants were not proper defendants, and that, for purposes of respondeat superior tort liability, the governmental employer of Anderson on December 2, 1993, was not Baltimore City but was the State of Maryland. <em>See Clea v. City of Baltimore, supra, </em>312 Md. at 666-671, 541 A.2d at 1305-1307. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>In the motion to dismiss by the State of Maryland, the State asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that it was entitled to governmental immunity and that \u201c[t]he State of Maryland is not vicariously liable for alleged tortious conduct of a police officer who did not act in the scope of his public duties.\u201d By separate orders entered at various times, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County granted the motions to dismiss filed by the Mayor and City Council, the Police Department, the Police Commissioner, and the State of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">After extensive discovery, including numerous depositions, and the filing of affidavits and exhibits, the defendants Anderson, Sage, and Sterling filed motions for summary judgment. Following a hearing, the Circuit Court on June 12, 1998, rendered a final judgment granting the motions for summary judgment. In its judgment order, the court determined that Anderson was at the time of the gun battle working as a security guard for the hotel and not as a police officer. The summary judgment was premised upon the assumption that there was sufficient evidence to show that Anderson acted negligently, but the court held that there was no evidence to show that his action \u201cwas intentional, [or] with malice or gross negligence.\u201d The court further held that \u201cAnderson, though working as a security guard at the time, possessed the same immunity from suit as if he [were] working as a police officer.\u201d Since, in the court\u2019s view, there was no evidence of malice or gross negligence, Anderson was held to be immune from a tort suit based on simple negligence. The Circuit Court\u2019s final judgment on June 12, 1998, did not expressly purport to resolve the conflict as to whether Sage or Sterling or both were Anderson\u2019s employers when the shooting incident took place, and the order simply granted summary judgment in favor of both Sage and Sterling, as well as Anderson. The court seemed to be of the view that Anderson\u2019s qualified immunity extended to his hotel employer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>The plaintiffs appealed, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <em>Lovelace v. Anderson, </em>126 Md.App. 667, 730 A.2d 774 (1999). While agreeing with the Circuit Court that there was no evidence of malice or gross negligence on the part of Anderson, the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 reasoning differed substantially from that of the trial court. Whereas the Circuit Court had held that, during the gun battle, Anderson was acting as a private security guard for the hotel and not as a police officer, the Court of Special Appeals held that when the hold up began, \u201cAnderson reverted to his police officer status,\u201d that he \u201cwas not the agent of either Sage or Sterling,\u201d and that he was acting exclusively \u201cwithin the scope of his employment as a law officer at the time of the shooting,\u201d <em>Lovelace v. Anderson, supra, </em>126 Md.App. at 689, 705, 707-708, 730 A.2d at 786, 795, 796. Since, in the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 view, Anderson was acting solely as a police officer, the appellate court concluded that neither Sage nor Sterling were liable under the principle of respondeat superior, and that Anderson was entitled to public official immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Relying on the holding of <em>Bradshaw v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>284 Md. 294, 305, 396 A.2d 255, 262 (1979), that a governmental employer \u201ccannot be held liable under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>\u201d when the governmental employee individually is not liable because of public official immunity, the Court of Special Appeals held that \u201cthere can be no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>liability on the part of [Anderson\u2019s] employers, the State of Maryland,\u201d the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, the Baltimore City Police Department, and the Police Commissioner. <em>Lovelace v. Anderson, supra, </em>126 Md.App. at 707, 730 A.2d at 796. The Court of Special Appeals overlooked the fact that the above-mentioned holding in <em>Bradshaw v. Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>had been expressly overruled in <em>James v. Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>288 Md. at 331, 418 A.2d at 1182. <em>See DiPino v. Davis, supra, </em>354 Md. at 48 n. 6, 729 A.2d at 370 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of certiorari presenting several questions, and this Court granted the petition. <em>Lovelace v. Anderson, </em>355 Md. 610, 735 A.2d 1105 (1999). None of the defendants filed a cross-petition for a writ of certiorari. Our order granting the certiorari petition neither limited nor expanded the issues for review by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The plaintiffs baldly assert in their brief that the Circuit Court erred in granting the motions to dismiss filed on behalf of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, the Baltimore City Police Department, the Police Commissioner, and the State of Maryland, and that \u201cthe judgments in favor of all of the defendants should be reversed.\u201d (Petitioners\u2019 brief at 41, 49). Nevertheless, the questions presented in the certiorari petition, and repeated in the plaintiffs\u2019 brief, relate solely to the liability of Anderson, Sage, and Sterling. Furthermore, the arguments in the certiorari petition and in the plaintiffs\u2019 brief are directed exclusively at the tort liability of Anderson, Sage, and Sterling.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">The plaintiffs contend that it was error to grant the motions for summary judgment filed by Anderson, Sage, and Sterling, because there were numerous material facts in dispute relating to the liability of these three defendants. In addition, the plaintiffs maintain that the evidence was sufficient to show that Anderson was guilty of ordinary negligence and, alternatively, gross negligence. The plaintiffs further argue that, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>several reasons, neither Anderson nor the hotel owners and operators were entitled to any form of immunity. The plaintiffs claim that Anderson was not acting as a police officer during the evening of December 2, 1993, that Anderson was acting in the scope of his employment as a security guard for the hotel, and that he was, during the attempted robbery and gun battle, doing precisely what he was hired to do and paid to do for the hotel. A principal thrust of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument is that Anderson was acting exclusively for the hotel owners and operators during the evening of December 2,1993. Alternatively, the plaintiffs assert that Anderson was acting within the scope of his employment for both the hotel and the Police Department during the incident on December 2nd, and that, therefore, a jury could properly find that Sage, or Sterling, or both, were liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior. The plaintiffs do not in any manner deal with the holdings of the courts below or the defendants\u2019 arguments as to why Baltimore City, the Police Department, the Police Commissioner, or the State, are not liable in tort for Anderson\u2019s actions during the evening of December 2,1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Maryland Rule 8 \u2014 131(b) provides that, in reviewing the decision of an intermediate appellate court, unless otherwise provided by order of this Court, \u201cthe Court of Appeals ordinarily will consider only an issue that has been raised in the petition for certiorari or any cross-petition.... \u201d For a detailed discussion of this provision, <em>see </em>Judge Cathell\u2019s opinion for the Court in <em>Wynn v. State, </em>351 Md. 307, 319-325, 718 A.2d 588, 594-597 (1998). As the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari presented no issues relating to the possible tort liability of Baltimore City, the Police Department, the Police Commissioner, and the State, we shall not in this opinion decide whether the motions to dismiss filed by these defendants should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">In addition, even if a question concerning the liability of these four governmental defendants had been included in the certiorari petition, the absence of any argument in the petitioners\u2019 brief dealing with the possible liability of these defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>dants would ordinarily preclude our consideration of such issue. In another case involving an attempt to impose tort liability upon the Baltimore City Police Department and the Police Commissioner, based upon the tortious conduct of a police officer, we stated <em>(Clea v. City of Baltimore, supra, </em>312 Md. at 671, 541 A.2d at 1307, emphasis deleted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">\u201cThe issue of the Police Department\u2019s and the Commissioner\u2019s liability or non-liability, as state agencies, for Officer Leonard\u2019s conduct has never been raised in this case. The pertinent principles, considerations, and authorities have been entirely overlooked. Absent any briefing or argument whatsoever concerning the issue, we decline to decide it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Consequently, for the reasons set forth above, we shall affirm the judgment in favor of Baltimore City, the Baltimore City Police Department, the Baltimore City Police Commissioner, and the State of Maryland, without directly ruling upon any of the issues raised or discussed in the courts below relating to the liability or non-liability of those four defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">We shall next address the Circuit Court\u2019s holding that, although Anderson was working as a security guard for the hotel and not as a police officer during the attempted robbery, Anderson nevertheless was entitled to a police officer\u2019s public official immunity and that such immunity extended to his private employer or employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">Preliminarily, as we have previously discussed, even if the defense of public official immunity were available to Anderson, it would not extend to his employer or employers. <em>DiPino v. Davis, supra, </em>354 Md. at 48 n. 6, 729 A.2d at 370 n. 6; <em>James v. Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>288 Md. at 332, 418 A.2d at 1182 (\u201cthe master remains liable for the servant\u2019s conduct even though the servant is himself not hable because of a personal immunity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Moreover, while acting as a private security guard for the hotel, Anderson was clearly not entitled to public official immunity. One is entitled to public official immunity only when he is acting as \u201ca <em>public official </em>rather than\u201d in some other capacity and only when \u201chis tortious conduct occurred while he was performing discretionary, as opposed to ministerial, acts <em>in furtherance of his official duties,\u201d James v. Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>288 Md. at 323, 418 A.2d at 1178 (emphasis added and deleted). <em>See, e.g., DiPino v. Davis, supra, </em>354 Md. at 48-49, 729 A.2d at 370; <em>Clea v. City of Baltimore, supra, </em>312 Md. at 672-673, 541 A.2d at 1308; <em>Ashburn v. Anne Arundel County, supra, </em>306 Md. at 622-624, 510 A.2d at 1080-1081.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Privately employed security guards, however, are not entitled to immunity when their negligence in attempting to prevent crimes or apprehend criminals is a proximate cause of injury to innocent third persons. <em>Giant Food v. Scherry, </em>51 Md.App. 586, 591, 444 A.2d 483, 487 (1982), and cases there cited. <em>See also Giant Food v. Mitchell, </em>334 Md. 633, 645, 640 A.2d 1134, 1139-1140 (1994), discussing -with approval the <em>Scherry </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The <em>Scherry </em>case involved an armed robbery of a cashier at a store in a shopping center. An armed security guard employed by the store, and on duty at the store, fired two shots at the fleeing robber. One of the shots went through a window at the plaintiffs residence across the street from the shopping center, and caused injury to the plaintiff. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the store. After pointing out that Maryland law gave the security guard the right and authority to arrest the robber, Judge Wilner for the Court of Special Appeals continued (51 Md.App. at 591, 444 A.2d at 487):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">\u201cThese kinds of situations, in which an innocent bystander is injured or killed in the course of an attempt to apprehend a criminal or defend an attack on one\u2019s person or property, arise in a variety of contexts \u2014 some more life-threatening to the actor than others, some involving felons and felonies, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>others involving misdemeanants and misdemeanors. The context is important in determining the reasonableness of the action taken, but the basic standard seems to be the same. Where the evidence shows that the actor ... acted without due regard to the danger caused to innocent third parties, he (and his employer) have been held liable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">A person, including an off-duty public official, who negligently injures someone while acting in the scope of his or her employment for a private employer, is not entitled to public official immunity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The theory of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 affirmance of the summary judgment was that, when the attempted robbery began during the evening of December 2, 1993, Anderson\u2019s status automatically changed from a privately-employed security guard to a Baltimore City police officer, that he was acting exclusively as a Baltimore City police officer, and that he \u201cwas not the agent of either Sage or Sterling,\u201d 126 Md.App. at 705, 730 A.2d at 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">In light of the evidence presented in the Circuit Court, as well as the pertinent regulations and statutory provisions, Lovelace makes a forceful argument in support of the Circuit Court\u2019s holding that Anderson was acting entirely as a private security guard for the hotel and not as a Baltimore City police officer. At the very least, a factual matter for the jury on this issue may have been presented. <em>See Great </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number><em>Atlantic Tea v. Imbraguglio, </em>346 Md. 573, 590, 697 A.2d 885, 893 (1997) (\u201cOrdinarily, the existence of the employer/employee relationship is a question reserved for the fact finder\u201d). Nonetheless, solely for purposes of these appellate proceedings, we shall assume <em>arguendo </em>that Anderson was acting in the scope of his employment as a Baltimore City police officer during the incident on the evening of December 2, 1993. We shall further assume <em>arguendo </em>that he was not acting maliciously or with gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">What the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding overlooked, however, is the settled principle of Maryland law that \u201c[a] worker may simultaneously be the employee of two employers.\u201d <em>Whitehead v. Safway Steel Products, </em>304 Md. 67, 79, 497 A.2d 803, 809 (1985). <em>See also, e.g., Great Atlantic Tea v. Imbraguglio, supra, </em>346 Md. at 591, 697 A.2d at 894 (\u201cThat an employee can concurrently serve two employers is not a novel concept in Maryland law\u201d); <em>Auto. Trade Ass\u2019n v. Harold Folk Enterprises, </em>301 Md. 642, 659, 484 A.2d 612, 621 (1984) (\u201cAs an initial matter, we recognize \u2018that, under certain circumstances, a person performing a given function simultaneously may be the employee of two employers\u2019 \u201d); <em>Comptroller v. Atlantic Supply Co., </em>294 Md. 213, 222, 448 A.2d 955, 960 (1982); <em>Keitz v. National Paving Co., </em>214 Md. 479, 491, 134 A.2d 296, 301 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Thus, in a case somewhat like the present one in that a workers\u2019 compensation proceeding had determined that one entity was the employer when an incident occurred, and the issue in a later tort case was whether a different entity was the employer for purposes of respondeat superior liability, this Court explained <em>(Mackall v. Zayre Corp., </em>293 Md. 221, 228-229, 443 A.2d 98, 102 (1982)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">\u201cThe relevant issue actually litigated in the workmen\u2019s compensation proceeding was Alden\u2019s status as an employer and the fact determined there was that Alden was Mackall\u2019s employer. Zayre\u2019s status as Mackall\u2019s employer was not in issue and, therefore, was not determined in the workmen\u2019s compensation proceeding. The issue presented in the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>sequent tort action was Zayre\u2019s status as Mackall\u2019s employer, and the fact to be determined there was whether Zayre, as well as Alden, was her employer. Accordingly, under the applicable principle of collateral estoppel, Zayre was not prevented, in the subsequent tort action, from litigating its status as Mackall\u2019s employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">\u201cThis Court has repeatedly recognized that, under certain circumstances, a person performing a given function simultaneously may be the employee of two employers. <em>Keitz v.

In <em>Great Atlantic Tea v. Imbraguglio, supra, </em>346 Md. at 590-591, 697 A.2d at 893-894, Judge Karwacki for the Court listed five principal criteria for determining the existence of an employer-employee relationship:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-8\">\u201cThey include \u2018(1) the power to select and hire the employee, (2) the payment of wages, (3) the power to discharge, (4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>the power to control the employee\u2019s conduct, and (5) whether the work is part of the regular business of the employer.\u2019 <em>[Whitehead v. Safway Steel Products, </em>supra,] 304 Md. at 77-78, 497 A.2d at 808-09 (citing <em>Mackall v. Zayre Corp., </em>293 Md. 221, 230, 443 A.2d 98, 103 (1982)); <em>see also Keitz v. National Paving and Contracting Co., </em>214 Md. 479, 491, 134 A.2d 296, 301 (1957).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">As.to whether a particular action is within the scope of the employment relationship, we have delineated numerous considerations, including whether the action was in furtherance of the employer\u2019s business or was personal to the employee, whether it occurred during the period when the employee was on duty for the employer, whether it related to the employee\u2019s duties, whether the action was in a broad sense authorized by the employer, whether the employer had reason to expect that the type of action might occur, whether it occurred in an authorized locality, etc. <em>See Sawyer v. Humphries, </em>322 Md. 247, 255-260, 587 A.2d 467, 470-473 (1991), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">In applying these and other factors, \u201cthere are few, if any, absolutes.\u201d <em>Sawyer v. Humphries, </em>322 Md. at 255, 587 A.2d at 471. Moreover, in ascertaining whether there is an employer-employee relationship and whether certain action is within the scope of that relationship, \u201cthe same basic principles and considerations, applicable to employees generally, are used to determine whether \u2018police officers, [and] watchmen ... \u2019 are acting within the scope of their employment. <em>See Cox v. Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>296 Md. at 170-171, 460 A.2d at 1042.... \u201d <em>Sawyer v. Humphries, </em>322 Md. at 258, 587 A.2d at 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Turning to the present case, the evidence that was before the Circuit Court for purposes of the motions for summary judgment was more than sufficient to show an employment relationship between Anderson and the hotel during the attempted robbery, and to show that Anderson was acting within the scope of that employment relationship, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that he was also acting as a Baltimore City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>police officer. Anderson was hired as a security guard by the hotel, and he was paid by the hotel for the entire period of time in question. He was on duty as a hotel employee at 8:10 p.m. on the evening of December 2, 1993. The hotel had the authority to discharge him as a hotel security guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">The evidence also shows that providing security for the hotel and its guests was part of the hotel\u2019s business. Anderson himself testified that, when he was hired, he was told that one of his duties for the hotel was to prevent robberies if he could. In addition, under Maryland common law, an innkeeper owes a duty of providing security for the innkeeper\u2019s guests and their baggage, and is liable if that duty is breached by the negligence of the innkeeper or the innkeeper\u2019s employees. <em>See, e.g., Roueche v. Hotel Braddock, </em>164 Md. 620, 622-628, 165 A. 891, 892-895 (1933); <em>Treiber v. Burrows, </em>27 Md. 130, 143-147 (1867); <em>Giles v. Fauntleroy, </em>13 Md. 126, 137 (1859); <em>Apper v. Eastgate Associates, </em>28 Md.App. 581, 586, 347 A.2d 389, 392-393 (1975), modified on other grounds and affirmed, 276 Md. 698, 350 A.2d 661 (1976). <em>See also Nalee, Inc. v. Jacobs, </em>228 Md. 525, 529, 180 A.2d 677, 679 (1962).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Furthermore, Anderson\u2019s testimony concerning the duties for which he was hired by the hotel, the manner of dress, the hotel management\u2019s direction that security guards\u2019 handguns be concealed, and the assignments given to Anderson and other security guards, showed the type of control which is typical of an employer-employee relationship. Anderson testified that the hotel management person who hired and supervised the security guards</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>\u201cwanted us to work security. She had special, you know, assignments for us that she wanted and one of them was to prevent robberies, if we could, and police the lot to prevent vehicle thefts, thefts from the vehicles, and wanted us to check on rooms because people would more or less get done with the room and pass the key on to a friend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">\u201cWe had to check the rooms and make sure the rooms were empty and supposed to be empty. We also worked as guest service, if people needed towels or soap in their rooms, we did that, too. We had a multitude of assignments there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">The hotel management may not have exercised control over all of the details of how a security guard would attempt to stop a robbery in progress, regardless of whether the security guard was an off-duty police officer or was a trained security guard who was not connected with a police department. Nevertheless, such control is not a prerequisite for an employer-employee relationship. What this Court said in <em>Greer Lines Co. v. Roberts, </em>216 Md. 69, 81, 139 A.2d 235, 240-241 (1958), is fully applicable to the employment of a security guard trained in law enforcement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\">\u201cIt was suggested by the companies that they could not exercise control over Jarvis because of a lack of knowledge of mechanical work. The right to control may exist, although the ability to control does not. The fact that a particular occupation involves technical skill and training, which put control of the details beyond the capacity of the employer, while a circumstance to be considered, does not require a conclusion of law that no member of a trade or profession involving skill or technical training can be an employee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">The evidence that was before the Circuit Court for purposes of ruling on the motions for summary judgment demonstrated that, during the attempted robbery of the Days Inn, Anderson was employed by the hotel as a security guard and was acting within the scope of that employment. In preventing the completion of an armed robbery, Anderson was performing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>one of the specific duties for which he had been hired by the hotel management.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Neither the Circuit Court\u2019s holding nor the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding in the case at bar can be reconciled with settled principles of Maryland agency law. To reiterate, the same basic principles of Maryland agency law, for determining whether actions of employees generally are within the scope of particular employment relationships, are equally applicable to police officers. <em>Sawyer v. Humphries, supra, </em>322 Md. at 258, 587 A.2d at 472; <em>Cox v. Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>296 Md. at 170-171, 460 A.2d at 1042-1043. Under those principles of Maryland agency law, the plaintiffs clearly produced sufficient evidence that Anderson was acting within the scope of his employment for the hotel to preclude summary judgment in favor of the hotel.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">In other jurisdictions which apply normal principles of agency law under circumstances similar to those in the present case, courts regularly hold that the off-duty police officers and their private employers are liable for injuries resulting from the police officer\u2019s tortious conduct in the scope of the officer\u2019s secondary private employment. For example, in <em>Dillard Department Stores v. Stuckey, </em>256 Ark. 881, 511 S.W.2d 154 (1974), the plaintiff, while shopping at the defendant\u2019s department store, was arrested for alleged shoplifting by an off-duty police officer employed by the store as a security guard. In affirming a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against the store, the Supreme Court of Arkansas stated (256 Ark. at 883, 511 S.W.2d at 155):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">\u201cIn essence the appellant contends that ... an employer, by engaging an off-duty policeman as its agent, can immunize itself from liability for an unlawful arrest whenever the officer acts upon his own initiative. That contention, however, runs counter to the basic rule that a principal is liable for its agent\u2019s torts when committed in the course of his employment and for the principal\u2019s benefit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>As indicated by the Arkansas Supreme Court, the application of special rules for off-duty police officers, engaged in secondary private employment, grants to the private employers an immunity which cannot be squared with traditional agency principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Moreover, there is little rational basis for exempting off-duty police officers employed as security guards and their private employers from liability for the tortious acts of the security guards, but not exempting former police officers, retired police officers, trained security guards, and their employers, from liability. Several cases applying traditional agency principles have made this precise point. Long ago, one federal judge expressed the following view <em>(Kusnir v. Pressed Steel Car Co., </em>201 F. 146, 150-151 (S.D.N.Y.1912)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV7\">\u201cWhere private parties, even with the consent of the state, employ its police officers to represent them, and do special work for them in protecting and preserving their property and maintaining order on their premises, and such officers are engaged in the performance of their duties to their employers, and are acting within the scope of their powers and duties, they become and are the servants and employes of such private parties and their representatives, and for [tortious] acts, ... unnecessarily committed by them in the line of their duty, and when engaged in the performance of such duties, to the injury of others, the master or employer is liable. Employers cannot escape responsibility for the [tortious] acts of persons employed by them, and representing them, and paid by them, by employing constables, marshals, sheriffs, and peace officers of the state, provided such ... acts are done by such representatives where and while acting within the general scope of the authority conferred on them. To establish a rule to the contrary would lead to the grossest acts of infamy and outrage, and destroy, as it ought, respect for government and courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">\u201cThe state would not be liable for such acts, and if the employer \u2014 that is, the master, who makes the officer his representative for his private purposes \u2014 is not, because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>wrongdoer is a police officer, such officer may perform the work he is employed to do in the most grossly careless, wanton, and willful manner, fraught with great peril to others, and the injured party must look to the wrongdoer, usually of no pecuniary responsibility, and not the employer, who employed the wrongdoer to do the very acts complained of....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">The Supreme Court of Tennessee in <em>White v. Revco Discount Drug Centers, </em>33 S.W.3d 713, 721 (Tenn.2000), pointed out that cases applying special rules, and refusing to apply traditional agency principles, to the private secondary employment of off-duty police officers, have \u201cresulted in over-insulating private employers who would otherwise be subject to liability if the security guard were not also employed by a municipal police department.\u201d The court continued (33 S.W.3d at 722): \u201cMoreover, eliminating vicarious liability for private employers who hire off-duty police officers encourages such employers to shift their risk of liability to the municipality solely because their employees are also employees of the local police department.\u201d The Supreme Court of Tennessee concluded <em>(id. </em>at 722):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">\u201cUnder the ... rule [applied in some states], the private employer may take advantage of the benefits of hiring an off-duty officer without assuming any of the normal risks of liability associated with hiring non-officer employees. We simply do not believe that in many cases, the risk of loss is properly shifted from the private employer to the municipality or to an innocent plaintiff, and we therefore disagree with the public policy rationales advanced by many of our sister jurisdictions ... on this issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-6\">\u201cAfter due consideration, we conclude that issues of employer liability for the acts of off-duty police officers are best resolved under traditional principles of Tennessee agency law. Use of agency principles in Tennessee to resolve this complex issue has several advantages. First, because traditional agency principles have been used in this state for two centuries, they possess the advantages of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>experience and straightforward application. In addition, these principles do not depend upon the splitting of legal hairs into meaningless distinctions, which is a hallmark of many of the other approaches.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><em>See also, e.g., J.J.

Lovelace relied on the adjudication in the workers\u2019 compensation case that Sage was Anderson\u2019s co-employer at the time of the gun battle. The Circuit Court, during a hearing, rejected the collateral estoppel argument, apparently being of the view that \"Maryland has never had a rule of ... issue preclusion\u201d based on adjudications in workers\u2019 compensation proceedings. The Circuit Court\u2019s June 12, 1998, final judgment order did not deal with the issue, since the court was of the view that Anderson\u2019s hotel employer would be entitled to immunity regardless of whether that employer was Sage or Sterling or both. Presumably because it was not an issue underlying the grant of summary judgment, the collateral estoppel issue has not been raised on this appeal. The issue could, of course, be raised in the Circuit Court after remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b745-9\"><em>. </em>Even if an off-duty police officer, while working in the scope of employment as a security guard for a private business, were somehow entitled to public official immunity, such immunity would not apply under the facts of this case. As earlier mentioned, a police officer is not entitled to the qualified immunity if there is a special relationship between the victim and the police offieer. <em>Williams v. Baltimore, </em>359 Md. 101, 143-144, 753 A.2d 41, 64-65 (2000); <em>Ashburn v. Anne Arundel County, </em>306 Md. 617, 510 A.2d 1078 (1986). There does exist a special relationship between an innkeeper's employees and the innkeeper\u2019s guests. As discussed in Part IV of this opinion, <em>infra, </em>an innkeeper and the innkeeper's employees owe a duty to the inn\u2019s guests to protect the guests and their property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b749-6\">. As pointed out by Chief Judge Orth for the Court of Special Appeals in the <em>Apper </em>case, 28 Md.App. at 586 n. 7, 347 A.2d at 392-393 n. 7, and discussed by this Court in the <em>Hotel Braddock </em>case, 164 Md. at 622-628, 165 A. at 892-895, and the <em>Treiber </em>case, 27 Md. at 143-147, at an early period under the common law, an innkeeper was an insurer of the safety of the innkeeper\u2019s guests and their baggage, and was strictly liable for injury to the guests or their baggage. The absolute duty of an innkeeper was later changed to a duty to use reasonable care.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b754-5\">. With regard to the employment of off-duty police officers by private businesses as security guards, very few cases in other states take the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>same position that the Court of Special Appeals adopted in the case at bar, namely that when an incident involving unlawful conduct occurs, the security guard always reverts to his status as a police officer and is no longer an employee of the private business. One case taking this position, and the only case on point relied upon by the Court of Special Appeals, is <em>Bauldock v. Davco Food, Inc., </em>622 A.2d 28 (D.C.App.1993). <em>See also Whitely v. Food Giant, Inc., </em>721 So.2d 207 (1998); <em>Darden v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co., </em>171 Ohio St. 63, 167 N.E.2d 765 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"A7r\">As discussed in the text above, numerous cases apply ordinary agency law principles to the employment of off-duty police officers by private businesses. This position, we believe, is most consistent with the prior holdings of this Court. <em>See, e.g., Sawyer v. Humphries, </em>322 Md. 247, 258, 587 A.2d 467, 472 (1991); <em>Cox v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>296 Md. 162, 170-171, 460 A.2d 1038, 1042 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"AUQ\">Many cases apply various \u201cmiddle grounds\u201d between the position of the Court of Special Appeals and the cases applying normal agency law principles. The most frequent \u201cmiddle ground\u201d is to examine the nature or the character of the off-duty officer\u2019s conduct and to determine whether it is the type of act for which the private employer hired the officer or is the type of act which police officers perform. <em>See McWain v. Greyhound Lines, </em>357 So.2d 780 (Fla.App.1978); <em>Gentry v. Auto Dealers Exchange, </em>498 N.E.2d 405 (Ind.App.1986); <em>Neallus v. Hutchinson Amusement Co., </em>126 Me. 469, 470-471, 139 A. 671, 672 (1927); <em>Graalum v. Radisson Ramp, Inc., </em>245 Minn. 54, 57-59, 71 N.W.2d 904, 907-908 (1955); <em>Burnett v. Griffith, </em>769 S.W.2d 780 (Mo.1989); <em>Rice v. Harrington, </em>38 R.I. 47, 50-51, 94 A. 736, 737-738 (1915); <em>Duran v. Furr\u2019s Supermarkets, </em>921 S.W.2d 778 (Tex.App.1996); <em>Wheatley v. Washington Jockey Club, </em>39 Wash.2d 163, 165-166, 234 P.2d 878, 879-880 (1951). As several of these cases recognize, however, the difficulty with this test is that the nature of the activity for which the private employer hired the off-duty policeman is often the same as the nature of the activity which the policeman performs when on duty for the police department. <em>See also </em>the discussion by the Supreme Court of Tennessee in <em>White v. Revco Discount Drug Centers, </em>33 S.W.3d 713, 719-722 (Tenn.2000). Consequently, most of the cases in this middle category take the position that it is for the jury to determine whether the private business or the police department is the employer. The typical result is an affirmance of the jury\u2019s decision that the off-duty officer and the private employer are liable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
