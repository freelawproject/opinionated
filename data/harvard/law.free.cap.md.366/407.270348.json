(\u201cIrocc\u201d), and liquidated damages to the contracting public body for Irocc\u2019s violations of the Maryland Prevailing Wage Act, Maryland Code (1988,1995 Repl. Vol.), State Finance and Procurement Article, \u00a7\u00a7 17-201-17-226. On 1 September 1998, the Maryland Deputy Commissioner of Labor and Industry (\u201cthe Commissioner\u201d) issued a Final Decision and Order adopting the Proposed Decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Appellee sought judicial review by the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. On 26 October 2000, the Circuit Court affirmed that part of the decision of the Commissioner holding Appellee liable to the public body for liquidated damages, but reversed the decision of the Commissioner regarding restitution, finding that Appellee was not liable for restitution to Irocc\u2019s employees. Appellant, the Maryland Division of Labor and Industry, filed an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. We issued a writ of certiorari on our own initiative while the case was pending in the Court of Special Appeals, <em>Maryland Div. of Labor and Indus, v. Triangle General Contractors, Inc., </em>364 Md. 139, 771 A.2d 1069 (2001), to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">Whether the Circuit Court erred in concluding a general contractor is not jointly liable for the wage violations of its subcontractor under Maryland Code (1988, 1995 Repl. Vol.), State Finance and Procurement Article, \u00a7 17-222(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">\n<em>A. Relevant Factual Record</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AR_\">Appellee, Triangle, was the general contractor on a state-funded project erecting the \u201cComputer &amp; Space Sciences Building\u201d at the University of Maryland at College Park. Irocc <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>was Triangle\u2019s initial masonry subcontractor on that project. On 31 December 1991, pursuant to Maryland Code (1988,1995 Repl. Vol.), State Finance and Procurement Article, \u00a7\u00a7 17-208 and <em>17-211</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>Appellant\u2019s Commissioner issued a determination of the prevailing wage rates for the project.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These prevailing wage rates applied to all employees working on the project, including those of Triangle, Irocc, and the other subcontractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">In the Summer of 1994, Mr. James C. Dugent, an investigator for the Maryland Division of Labor and Industry, began visiting the site weekly at the University of Maryland to verify that the employees on the job were working in the correct classifications and to ensure they were being paid the prevailing wage rate for their classifications. In October of 1994, Mr. Dugent learned from Mr. Cesar Rivera of the Coalition of Fair Contracting, Inc. (a union-related organization), that some of Iroec\u2019s employees\u2019 paychecks were bouncing and, important to this appeal, that Irocc may not be paying some of its employees the proper prevailing wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">On 1 June 1995, Mr. Dugent sent a letter to Irocc, with a carbon copy to Appellee, informing Irocc that his investigation revealed \u201c[t]he contractor and/or subcontractor is delinquent in submitting payroll records [and] ... has allegedly underpaid employee [Mr. Antonio Pena].\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The letter requested a photo-copy of the employee\u2019s restitution check and an $1,210 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>check for liquidated damages for \u201clate payrolls and misclassifi-cation of employee.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mr. Dugent did not receive a response to that letter from Irocc or Appellee. On 20 September 1995, Mr. Dugent sent another letter to Irocc, with a carbon copy to Appellee, informing Irocc that \u201c[t]he contractor and/or subcontractor is delinquent in submitting payroll records [and] . .. has allegedly underpaid employeefs] [Mr. Antonio Pena and Mr. Francisco Pena].\u201d He requested copies of the restitution checks provided to both employees, together with liquidated damages. Again, Mr. Dugent received no response from Irocc or Appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">On 31 January 1996, the Commissioner, pursuant to \u00a7 17-221(g)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, sent notice to Appellee and Irocc informing them of the facts disclosed by Mr. Dugent\u2019s investigation (which now included 3 former Irocc employees \u2014 Antonio Pena, Francisco Pena, and Fernando Gomez \u2014 who assertedly had not been paid the appropriate prevailing wage), including a calculation of the restitution and liquidated damages owed under \u00a7 17-222<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, and notifying them that an administrative hearing would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>be held on the charges at the \u201cearliest possible date.\u201d The State subsequently withheld from its payments due to Appel-lee the contested amounts, as provided for under \u00a7 17-221(e).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\n<em>B. Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">In accordance with COMAR 21.11.11.04B, Appellant\u2019s Commissioner delegated his hearing responsibility, granted under \u00a7 17 \u2014 221(h), to the OAH. On 14 August 1996, 1 April and 2 April 1997, a hearing was held before an AL J of the OAH. On 1 July 1997, the ALJ issued a Proposed Decision concluding \u201cthat Irocc Masonry, Inc. violated [the Prevailing Wage Act] by submitting inaccurate payroll records<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and failing to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>employees the prevailing wage for their classifications,\u201d and recommending that Appellee <em>or </em>Irocc pay restitution to Antonio Pena, Francisco Pena, and Fernando Gomez (the former employees of Irocc), and that Appellee pay liquidated damages to the public body for Irocc\u2019s violations of the prevailing wage statute. Appellee filed exceptions to this decision with the Commissioner pursuant to COMAR 21.11.11.04E(3). On 1 September 1998, the Commissioner issued a Final Decision and Order adopting the Proposed Decision, but modified the ultimate conclusion to require Triangle <em>and </em>Irocc to pay restitution and liquidated damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Appellee then filed an action for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. On 26 October 2000, the Circuit Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order affirming in part and reversing in part the decision of the Commissioner. The Circuit Court affirmed the decision that Appellee was liable to the public body for liquidated damages under \u00a7 17-222(a) (rendering \u201c[a] contractor\u201d liable for liquidated damages), finding \u201c[t]he evidence established that ... three employees were underpaid for a period of 196 days.\u201d Finding merit in Triangle\u2019s legal argument that \u00a7 17-222(b) (rendering \u201ca contractor or subcontractor\u201d responsible for restitution) only makes liable for restitution the actual employer of the workers not paid the prevailing wage, the Circuit Court reversed the decision of the Commissioner regarding restitution, holding that Appellee was not liable for restitution to Irocc\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Appellant filed an appeal in the Court of Special Appeals. On 9 May 2001, we issued a writ of certiorari on our own motion while the case was pending in the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">We review an administrative agency\u2019s decision \u201cunder the same statutory standards as the Circuit Court.\u201d <em>Gigeous v. E. Corr. Inst., </em>363 Md. 481, 495, 769 A.2d 912, 921 (2001) (footnote omitted). Therefore, \u201cwe reevaluate the decision of the agency, not the decision of the lower court.\u201d <em>Gigeous, </em>363 Md. at 495-96, 769 A.2d at 921 (citing <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n v. Balt. Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>273 Md. 357, 362, 329 A.2d 691, 694-95 (1974)). In reviewing an administrative agency decision, we are \u201c \u2018limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s finding and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Board of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 67-68, 729 A.2d 376, 380 (1999) (quoting <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994)). In applying the substantial evidence test to questions of fact,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aza\">a reviewing court decides \u2018whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u2019 A reviewing court should defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record. A reviewing court \u2018must review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it; ... the agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid, and ... it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence and to draw inferences from that evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-6\"><em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 68, 729 A.2d at 380-81 (alterations in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Even \u201cwith regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u201d <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 69, 729 A.2d at 381 (citing <em>Lussier v. Md. Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>343 Md. 681, 696-97, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>684 A.2d 804, 811-12 (1996); <em>McCullough v.

Moreover, the \u201cexpertise of the agency in its own field should be respected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Nevertheless, \u201cwhen a statutory provision is entirely clear, with no ambiguity whatsoever, \u2018administrative constructions, no matter how well entrenched, are not given weight.\u2019 \u201d <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 69 n. 2, 729 A.2d at 381 n. 2 (quoting <em>Macke Co. v. Comptroller, </em>302 Md. 18, 22-23, 485 A.2d 254, 257 (1984)). <em>See also State Dept. of Assessments and Taxation v. Greyhound Computer Corp., </em>271 Md. 575, 589, 320 A.2d 40, 47 (1974) (\u201c[T]he unvarying construction of law by the agency charged with its enforcement over a long period of time ... cannot override the plain meaning of the statute or extend its provisions beyond the clear import of the language employed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The Commissioner, in his Final Decision and Order, held Appellee liable for liquidated damages and restitution under \u00a7 17-222(a) and (b), respectively, for its subcontractor\u2019s direct violations of the Prevailing Wage Act. The Commissioner read \u00a7 17-222(a) as clearly requiring \u201ca general contractor to pay liquidated damages for underpayment \u2018to each laborer or other employee ...,\u2019\u201d regardless of who the laborer\u2019s or employee\u2019s actual employer was, and found, in effect, Appellee strictly liable for restitution under \u00a7 17-222(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The Circuit Court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision finding Appellee liable for liquidated damages<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>, but reversed that part of the decision holding Appellee liable for restitution. In so doing, the Circuit Court determined that \u00a7 17-222(b) of the State Finance and Procurement Article does not impose joint or strict liability for restitution on a contractor for the wage underpayments by its subcontractor for the subcontrac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>tor\u2019s employees. Rather, the court read \u00a7 17-222(b) as imposing liability on either the contractor or subcontractor, depending on which violated the prevailing wage requirements as to its respective employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Appellant urges us to adopt the Commissioner\u2019s decision and contends that the Circuit Court erred in its interpretation of \u00a7 17-222(b). Appellant argues that, based on the purpose <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and legislative history<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the Prevailing Wage Act, and on a reading of the subtitle as a whole, \u00a7 17 \u2014 222(b) imposes liability on a general contractor for restitution to its subcontractor\u2019s employees. Appellee believes the Commissioner erred in his reading of \u00a7 17-222(b), and therefore urges us to affirm the decision of the Circuit Court. Triangle maintains that the \u201clanguage of the statute is clear and unambiguous,\u201d and argues that \u201cit is clear that the contractor or subcontractor have individual responsibility\u201d for restitution only to their respective employees under \u00a7 17-222(b). We agree with Appellee and therefore affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In 1988, in culmination of a lengthy code revision process, the Prevailing Wage Act was recodified as \u00a7\u00a7 17-201-17-226 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>of the State Finance and Procurement Article.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Chapter 48, \u00a7 2 of the Acts of 1988. A comparison of the Act prior to and after the revision reveals that the recodification did not simply renumber the Act from \u00a7 12 to \u00a7 17 of the State Finance and Procurement Article. It also reworded, rearranged, and added sections to the Act. <em>Com,pare </em>Maryland Code (1985, 1986 Supp.), State Finance and Procurement Article, \u00a7\u00a7 12-301-12-315, <em>with, </em>Maryland Code (1988, 1995 Repl. Vol.), State Finance and Procurement Article, \u00a7\u00a7 17-201-17-226. Section 17-222, at issue in this case, was formed early in this recodifi-cation process. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">\u00a7 17-222. Liability for failure to pay prevailing wage rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">(a) <em>Liquidated damages. </em>\u2014 A contractor under a public work contract is liable to the public body for liquidated damages of $10 for each laborer or other employee for each day for which:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">(1) the laborer is paid less than the prevailing wage rate of a mechanic while performing a task required to be performed by a mechanic or mechanic\u2019s apprentice; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">(2) the employee is paid less than the prevailing wage rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">(b) <em>Restitution.\u2022 </em>\u2014 If a contractor or subcontractor pays an employee less than the amount the employee is entitled to receive for the work performed, the contractor or subcontractor shall make restitution to the employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">The available legislative history of H.B. 1 of 1988 (which became Chapter 48, \u00a7 2 of the Acts of 1988) indicates that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>inclusion of \u201cor subcontractor\u201d in what was to become \u00a7 17-222(b) occurred before first reading. This language apparently was devised either by the staff of the then Division of Statutory Revision, the Procurement Revision Review Committee, or the Procurement Code Revision Workshop, and included in H.B. 1 before first reader consideration by the legislature. After first reader, H.B. 1 was \u201creviewed extensively not only by the House Constitutional and Administrative Law Committee, to which [it] was referred, and its work group, but also by the House Economic Matters Committee and a workgroup of that Committee.\u201d <em>Report on House Bill 1 </em>(Third Reading File Copy), at 19 (15 March 1988). No change was made in the relevant language of \u00a7 17-222(b) from that which appeared in the first reader version. Although there are abundant references in the documentation pertaining to H.B. 1 that state, in one form or another, that the changes made in the course of the recodification of the State procurement law were intended to be stylistic, a re-organization, and non-substantive, we could find no such specific reference to the relevant new language of \u00a7 17-222(b), save possibly the general Revisor\u2019s note, <em>supra </em>at n. 11. In any event, we conclude that the inclusion of \u201cor subcontractor\u201d in \u00a7 17-222(b) effected a clear substantive change in the Prevailing Wage Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The \u201ccardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.\u201d <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423, 429 (1995) (citing <em>Fish Mkt. Nominee Corp. v. G.A.A., </em>337 Md. 1, 8, 650 A.2d 705, 708 (1994)). The first step in determining legislative intent is \u201cto look at the statutory language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where statutory provisions are \u201cclear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as it is written.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 261, 647 A.2d 1204, 1206-07 (1994)). In such circumstances, \u201c \u2018no construction or clarification is needed or permitted, it being the rule that a plainly worded statute must be construed without forced or subtle interpretations designed to extend or limit the scope of its operation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Giant Food, Inc. v. Dept. of Labor, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>356 Md. 180, 189, 738 A.2d 856, 861 (1999) (quoting <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 73, 517 A.2d 730, 732 (1986)). The language of a statute, therefore, is to be given \u201cits natural and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Montgomery County, Maryland v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 523, 636 A.2d 448, 452 (1994) (citing <em>Harford County v. Univ. Of Md. Med. Sys. Corp., </em>318 Md. 525, 529, 569 A.2d 649, 651 (1990); <em>NCR Corp., v. Comptroller, </em>313 Md. 118, 124, 544 A.2d 764, 767 (1988); <em>Utt v. State, </em>293 Md. 271, 286, 443 A.2d 582, 590 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">The statute here is clear and unambiguous. Section 17-222(b) provides, \u201c[i]f a contractor <em>or </em>subcontractor pays an employee less than\u201d the prevailing wage, then \u201cthe contractor <em>or </em>subcontractor shall make restitution to the employee.\u201d (Emphasis added). The word \u201cor\u201d in this statute, and in common usage, is generally used to indicate an alternative. <em>See </em>Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (9th ed. 1989). An \u201calternative\u201d \u201coffer[s] a choice between two or more things only one of which may be chosen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Based on a plain reading of the statute, the alternative in \u00a7 17-222 is not open-ended, that is, Appellant is not free to choose whether to charge a contractor, subcontractor, or both for restitution, regardless of fault. Under the statute, if a contractor pays its employees less than the prevailing wage, then the contractor is liable for restitution. Likewise, if a subcontractor underpays its employees, then the subcontractor alone, not the contractor (absent actual culpability on the contractor\u2019s part), is liable to make restitution. To read \u00a7 17-222(b) otherwise would require us to \u201cexpress an intention which is not evidenced in the original form.\u201d <em>Welsh v. Kuntz, </em>196 Md. 86, 93, 75 A.2d 343, 345 (1950). That is an act which we are \u201cnot at liberty\u201d to do. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Appellant argues that the Legislature did not intend \u00a7 17-222(b) to shield a contractor from liability for restitution to its subcontractor\u2019s employees. When the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, however, we normally do not look \u201cbeyond the words of the statute itself to determine legislative intent.\u201d <em>Giant Food, Inc., </em>356 Md. at 188, 738 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>at 860. We presume that the General Assembly \u201chad, and acted with respect to, full knowledge and information as to prior and existing law and legislation on the subject of the statute and the policy of the prior law.\u201d <em>In re Special Investigation No. 236, </em>295 Md. 578, 576, 458 A.2d 75, 76 (1983). As noted earlier, the 1988 Report on House Bill 1, which recodified the Prevailing Wage Act and added \u00a7 17-222, indicated that \u201c[the Prevailing Wage] subtitle was reviewed extensively not only by the House Constitutional and Administrative Law Committee ... and its work group[,] but also by the House Economic Matters Committee and a workgroup of that Committee.\u201d <em>Report on House Bill 1 </em>(Third Reading File Copy), at 19 (15 March 1988). Based on the amount of time and personnel resources expended in drafting and scrutinizing the recodification of the Procurement Law, coupled with the fact that the recodification was not simply a mere renumbering, we are'unable to find that the pertinent language in \u00a7 17-222(b) was anything but calculated and intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The Court sometimes refers to a supplemental principle of statutory construction, in addition to the general principles and \u201ccardinal rules,\u201d to guide it when the issue at hand involves a recodification or code revision. Specifically, that supplemental principle is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-5\">[Recodification] of statutes is presumed to be for the purpose of clarity rather than change of meaning and, thus, even a change in the phraseology of a statute by a codification will not ordinarily modify the law unless the change is so radical and material that the intention of the Legislature to modify the law appears unmistakably from the language of the Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-6\"><em>Hoffman v.

This principle is both a rebuttable presumption and tempered by the scope of its appropriate application being described as \u201cordinarily.\u201d This principle, however, is not triggered if the plain meaning rule is dispositive of the relevant inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">For example, in <em>Abramson v. Montgomery County, Maryland, </em>328 Md. 721, 616 A.2d 894 (1992), Judge Chasanow, writing for the Court, considered whether the added term \u201cperson,\u201d in a requirement that a \u201cperson\u201d exhaust all administrative remedies before appealing to the Tax Court, included governmental entities. Prior to the pertinent recodification, the statute used the term \u201cparty,\u201d which had been interpreted to include governmental entities. The Revisor\u2019s note to the amended section indicated there was no \u201csubstantive change\u201d intended by the conversion from \u201cparty\u201d to \u201cperson.\u201d Regardless of the Revisor\u2019s note, the Court refused to accept the argument that \u201cperson\u201d likewise should be read to include a governmental entity. <em>Abramson, </em>328 Md. at 737, 616 A.2d at 901-02. In so doing, the Court looked to the general principle of statutory interpretation that, \u201c[w]hen a statute\u2019s language is clear and unambiguous, ... we need look no further for some hidden legislative intent.\u201d <em>Abramson, </em>328 Md. at 736-37, 616 A.2d at 901-02 (citing <em>Management Personnel Servs. v. Sandefur, </em>300 Md. 332, 341, 478 A.2d 310, 314 (1984)). The Court further supported its conclusion by noting that in another section of the same regulatory scheme, the General Assembly referred to a \u201cperson or governmental unit,\u201d indicating that the terms were not meant to be overlapping. <em>Abramson, </em>328 Md. at 737, 616 A.2d at 902. No reference is made in <em>Abramson </em>to the supplemental principle of statutory interpretation regarding the presumption in cases concerning recodifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Similarly, in <em>In re Taylor, </em>312 Md. 58, 537 A.2d 1179 (1988), Judge Orth, writing for the Court, found a substantive change in a statute, without reference to or analysis under the supplemental rule. In this case, the Revisor\u2019s note did not express a legislative intent. The Court determined that Maryland\u2019s tools-of-the-trade bankruptcy exemption could be applied to protect large, mobile farm implements and vehicles.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The recodified statute deleted the requirements that the exempted tools be \u201cmechanical,\u201d and that the exempted appliances be \u201cmoved or worked by hand or foot.\u201d <em>In re Taylor, </em>312 Md. at 67, 537 A.2d at 1183-84. The Court found that, although the Revisor\u2019s note did not indicate \u201cwhether the changes in the \u2018tools\u2019 exemption were or were not \u2018of a substantive nature,\u2019 \u201d the \u201cnew enactment was more than a streamlining of the old statute.\u201d <em>In re Taylor, </em>312 Md. at 68, 537 A.2d at 1184. The Court \u201cs[aw] the legislative intent in enacting [the section] emanating bright and clear from the plain language of the subsection.\u201d <em>In re Taylor, </em>312 Md. at 70, 537 A.2d at 1185. <em>See Board of Supervisors of Elections of Balt. City v. Weiss, </em>217 Md. 133, 138, 141 A.2d 734, 737 (1958) (The Court read a substantive change into a statute, without applying the supplemental rule, when the Revisor\u2019s notes did not explicitly indicate such a change. In so doing, the Court noted that the revision of the law \u201cwas no mere casual rearrangement of sections,\u201d rather it included five years of study, and therefore it would be \u201cunreasonable\u201d to hold any changes \u201cwere inadvertent and not intended.\u201d). <em>See also Mid-Atlantic Power Supply Ass\u2019n v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md., </em>361 Md. 196, 760 A.2d 1087 (2000). In sum, we conclude the present case may be decided under the plain meaning rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Principles of statutory construction confirm that we may \u201cconsider the consequences resulting from one meaning rather than another, and adopt that construction which avoids an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>illogical or unreasonable result, or one which is inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Bd. of License Comm\u2019rs v. Toye, </em>354 Md. 116, 123, 729 A.2d 407, 411 (1999) (quoting <em>Tucker, </em>308 Md. at 75, 517 A.2d at 732). Appellant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 17-222(b) would place strict liability on a contractor for its subcontractor\u2019s wage rate violations. This, in our opinion, is an unreasonable result and is not supported by the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Additionally, when \u00a7 17-222(b) is read in conjunction with \u00a7 17-222(a), it is apparent that the Legislature intended subsection (b) to place liability on subcontractors, not contractors, for their own wage rate violations. The liquidated damages provision in subsection (a) explicitly limits liability to \u201c[a] contractor.\u201d This makes clear that the Legislature recognized in 1988 how to express its intent to hold a contractor strictly liable for damages, and that it chose not to utilize such an approach in subsection (b) with regard to restitution. Also, there are subsections of the Prevailing Wage Act in which the Legislature in 1988 explicitly placed joint liability on contractors and subcontractors. For instance, in \u00a7\u00a7 17-214 and 17-215, the subsections requiring the full payment of prevailing wages on public works contracts, the Legislature stated that, \u201c[e]ach contractor <em>and </em>subcontractor under a public work contract shall pay not less than the prevailing wage rate of ...,\u201d and \u201c[ejach contractor <em>and </em>subcontractor subject to this subtitle shall pay each employee not less than the prevailing wage rate required under this subtitle.... \u201d (Emphasis added). With these, the Legislature evidenced its ability to require joint liability of contractors and subcontractors, but again, it chose not to employ such an approach in \u00a7 17-222(b). Because the Legislature did not use similar language in subsection (b) as in subsection (a), nor the phrase \u201ccontractor <em>and </em>subcontractor,\u201d we will not read \u00a7 17-222(b) as holding a contractor strictly or jointly liable for its subcontractor\u2019s wage violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Moreover, it is also a natural presumption that the Legislature \u201cdoes not intend to use words in vain or to leave a part of its enactment without sense or meaning, but intends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>that every part of it shall be operative.\u201d <em>Welsh, </em>196 Md. at 98, 75 A.2d at 348. It is for that reason that we avoid reading a statute in such a way as to render a word or phrase \u201c \u2018surplus-age, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Atkinson v. State, </em>331 Md. 199, 209, 627 A.2d 1019, 1024 (1993) (quoting <em>Sandefur, </em>300 Md. at 341, 478 A.2d at 315). If we were to read \u00a7 17-222(b) as Appellant suggests, holding a contractor liable for restitution to its subcontractor\u2019s employees, we would essentially be reading \u201cor subcontractor\u201d out of the statute. We are not at liberty to modify the plain meaning of a statute in such a way.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">We conclude that the language of \u00a7 17-222(b) of the Prevailing Wage Act unambiguously places liability for restitution on a subcontractor for its own prevailing wage rate violations, not on a contractor. Although we often give deference and considerable weight to an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute which it administers, in this case, the language of \u00a7 17-222(b) is entirely clear. We, therefore, do not adopt the Commissioner of the Division of Labor and Industry\u2019s construction, and interpret \u00a7 17-222(b) based on the plain meaning of its words.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b442-6\">.
