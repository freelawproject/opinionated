Where a lease to a party contains an absolute contract for the sale of the demised premises by the lessor to the lessee, upon certain stated terms, and also certain other real estate, a judgment against the lessee will become a lien on the lessee\u2019s interest in the property; and any subsequent change in the terms of the sale, adding further burdens on the purchaser, will not affect the rights of the judgment creditor.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b425-11\" pgmap=\"425\">3.

In case Colby failed to purchase, Preston, Kean &amp; Co. might enforce the agreement, and retain all the machinery and improvements put upon the premises by him, as agreed damages for breach of the contract. Colby also agreed to buy, and Preston, Kean &amp; Co. to convey to him, lots 6, 7 and 8, of block 4, of Day\u2019s subdivision of part of the said north-east quarter of section 4, aforesaid, for the sum of $1300, payable in one year from date, with interest thereon at the rate of six per cent per annum;</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-5\" pgmap=\"428(134) 429(363)\">Colby formed a co-partnership with his son and one Gardner, under the firm name of Colby, Gardner &amp; Co., for the purpose of manufacturing plows, and that firm took possession of the property thus demised, and placed upon it improvements and machinery of value, and on the 31st of May, A. D. 1881, the firm of Colby, Gardner &amp; Co. borrowed $3000 of Preston, Kean &amp; Co., and gave their promissory note therefor, payable within ninety days from that date. The firm failed on the 1st day of October, A. D. 1881, being then still indebted to Preston, Kean &amp; Co. for the full amount of the loan, and the further sum of $200 for rent of said premises. It was then agreed between Colby, and Preston, Kean &amp; Co., that they should at once convey the premises to him, and that he should then convey them in trust, to secure the sum before agreed upon as their price, and also the indebtedness of the firm of Colby, Gardner &amp; Co. for borrowed money and rent. This agreement was, on the same day, accordingly carried out. Preston, Kean &amp; Co. conveyed, absolutely, to Colby, and he conveyed the premises, in trust, to John Farson, as trustee, to secure the before named indebtedness, evidenced by four promissory notes of that date, executed by Colby to bis own order, and by him duly indorsed, all bearing interest at the rate of seven per cent per annum,\u2014one for $4500, due six months after date, and the other three for $4500, due, respectively, on the 1st dajr of May, in the years A. D. 1884, 1885 and 1856. A provision in the deed of trust authorized the holder, in case of default in the payment of the principal or interest, or any part thereof, to declare the whole of the notes due and payable. At the same time that these instruments were executed, Colby, Gardner &amp; Co. sold and transferred all their stock, materials, machinery and personal property then on said premises, to Preston, Kean &amp; Co., upon an agreement between the parties that the same should be sold, and the proceeds applied to the payment of the note for $4500, in which was embraced the indebtedness for borrowed money, and for rent. Preston, Kean &amp; Co. afterwards took possession of said personal property, and sold a portion of it, realizing therefrom $436.15. Gardner then filed his bill for a dissolution and settlement of the partnership, making Preston, Kean &amp; Co. parties. A receiver was appointed, and Preston, Kean &amp; Co. turned over to him the residue of the personal property in their hands, and he afterwards sold it, under an order of the court, for $311.45. The receiver also sold the interest of the firm in the real estate to Allen Breed, on the 11th of April, A.

D. 1881. Breed thereupon filed his bill in chancery, in the Superior Court of Cook county, against Gorham and the sheriff, to enjoin a sale of the property under this levy, upon the ground that the judgment had not become a lien upon it before he received a conveyance of it; but the trial court, on hearing, dismissed the bill, and that ruling was affirmed, on appeal, first, in the Appellate Court, and afterwards in this court.

Hayes, who was then the owner and holder thereof; that no part of said notes has been paid; that Hayes has, by virtue of the terms of the trust deed, declared all of the notes, and the interest thereon, due, and requested complainant to foreclose, etc.; that said notes were, in fact, given to secure the entire amount of purchase money for the real estate described in the trust deed; that Colby is insolvent, and a non-resident; that there are due and unpaid $400, in taxes and assessments; that $19,500, with interest thereon, at the rate of seven per cent, from the 1st day of October, A.

D. 1884, to April 30, A. D. 1885. On the 3d of June, A. D. 1884, Charles T. Gorham entered his appearance in the cause, and on the 14th of the same month he filed his answer, in which he denies that Colby was ever indebted to Preston, Kean &amp; Co. in the sum of $19,500, for the purchase price of the premises; that he has no knowledge of the trust deed except hearsay; denies'that the trust deed ever was, or now is, a lien upon the premises, except subject to the lien of defendant; avers that the trust deed has been paid; denies that Frederick W- Hayes ever was or is the owner of the notes; denies that he could declare them due, to the prejudice of defendant; denies that Hayes authorized complainant to foreclose the mortgage; denies that Colby is insolvent, and that the premises are a scant security; avers that the property is worth $30,000, and is increasing in value; sets up that he recovered judgment against Colby in that court, in 1879, for $5500, and immediately issued execution thereon; that the next\" year Colby purchased the premises for $16,200, and defendant\u2019s judgment immediately became a lien thereon; that after his lien had attached, Colby and Preston, Kean &amp; Co. conspired together to defraud him out of his lien, and for that purpose they executed the trust deed and notes in question, and they now seek to obtain a vendor\u2019s lien for $19,500, or $3000 more than Colby paid for the same; that on April 15, 1882, a sale of Colby\u2019s interest in the premises, but subject to the defendant\u2019s lien, was made by order of the court, and that Preston, Kean &amp; Co. bought it, and paid for it, but caused it to be deeded to Allen Breed, without his knowledge or consent, and that Preston, Kean &amp; Co.\u2019s mortgage title then passed with the title so purchased; that defendant was not a party \u25a0to that suit; that by virtue of the defendant\u2019s prior judgment lien the premises were sold February 14, 1883, and he became the purchaser; that there was no redemption from that sale, and on May 20, A. D. 1884, he received a sheriff\u2019s deed, and his title became absolute. The litigation with Breed is then set out, alleging that Breed, in fact, had no interest in it, hut that his name was used by Preston, Kean &amp; Co. to sub-serve their own ends.

D. 1881, between Preston, Kean &amp; Co., on the one hand, and Gilbert A. Colby, on the other, there was no connection between the leasing and the sale of the property in controversy, farther than when the terms in regard to the sale were complied with, the lease, would expire. There was no stipulation, expressly, or in effect, that a failure to \u00a1iay rent according to the terms in regard to the r\u00e9nting should bar or impair the right of Colby to purchase, or that any arrears for rent should be a charge upon the land as for so much purchase money. On the contrary, the sale was to be effected simply by paying and giving notes for the stipulated sums, as agreed upon as the price, within the time specified. Nor was the agreement that the sale should be at the end of three years, from the 1st day of May, A. D. 1881. The language is: \u201cColby further agrees, within three.years from the date hereof, to purchase the above described premises, and Payne\u201d (who acted in behalf of Preston, Kean &amp; Co.,) \u201cto convey, or to cause to be conveyed, to Colby, at the sum of $15,000, to be paid as follows, to-wit: $5000 cash, and $5000 in one year and $5000 in two years from the date of said cash payment, with interest oh said deferred payments at the rate of six per cent per annum, payable annually, and said deferred payments- to be secured by a mortgage or trust deed on said premises. * * * Colby also agrees to buy, and Payne\u201d (who acted in behalf of Preston, Kean &amp; Co.,)' \u201cto convey, or cause to be conveyed, to Colby, lots 6, 7 and 8, of block 4, of Day\u2019s subdivision, * * * for the sum of $1300, and interest thereon, at the rate of six per cent per annum, from date, and to pay the same, principal and interest, within one year from date. \u201d</p> <p id=\"b439-6\" pgmap=\"439\">Gorham\u2019s judgment became a lien on Colby\u2019s interest in these lots. (Breed v. Gorham, 108 Ill. 81). The judgment having been obtained, and an execution having been issued thereon, within a year after its date, before the agreement was entered into, the lien attached the moment that Colby obtained his interest,\u2014i. e., the moment that the agreement was made; and when that lien, was enforced by levy and sale, and the execution of a deed pursuant thereto, by the sheriff, {there having been no redemption,) Gorham\u2019s title related back to the commencement of the lien, and embraced the interest that Colby then had in the property. Elder v. Derby, 98 Ill. 232; Hart et al. v. Wingart, 83 id. 284.</p> <p id=\"b439-7\" pgmap=\"439(227) 440(178)\">Since, as to the eight lots, comprising block 4, of Hubbard, Crocker &amp; Stone\u2019s addition, the agreement was, that Colby was to buy, and Preston, Kean &amp; Co. were to convey, within, and not at, the termination of three years, it must follow, that it was competent for Colby to make the payment, and the promissory notes, and deed of trust securing them, for the deferred payments, and Preston, Kean &amp; Co. to make the conveyance on the 1st day of October, A. D. 1881; and since it was competent for Colby, in order to protect his title,' or Gorham, in order to protect his lien, to pay off one or all of the promissory notes at any time after their execution, it is impossible that the substitution of promissory notes, running for the times those run which were executed on the 1st day of October, A. D. 1881, for the cash payment, and for promissory notes for the deferred payments, running for the times those were to run, as provided by the agreement of May 1, A. D. 1881, can have denied or impaired any rights which Gorham had by virtue of his lien. But the lots wrere, by the contract of May 1, to be charged only with the payment of the purchase money,\u2014those in each block for their own cost, respectively; and the deferred payments were to bear only six per cent interest. To add, therefore, to the burden of these lots, $3000, for money borrowed by the firm of Colby, Gardner &amp; Co., and $200 for back rent due from Colby, and to require the payment of seven per cent interest, instead-of six per cent, upon the deferred payments, was, to that extent, to impair and destroy Gorham\u2019s lien, and was inadmissible; and the circuit court, therefore, properly held, that while the execution of the deed on the 1st day of October, A. D. 1881, by Preston, Kean &amp; Co., to Colby, and the taking back by them, from him, of a mortgage, at the same time, did not enlarge the rights of Colby in the lots, beyond what they were under the contract of May 1, A. D. 1881, it was not admissible, since Gorham\u2019s lien had attached before that time, to destroy or sensibly impair Colby\u2019s interest in the lots as it was fixed by the agreement of May 1, A. D. 1881.</p> <p id=\"b440-5\" pgmap=\"440(225) 441(150)\">But the mortgage or deed of trust executed on the 1st of October, A. D. 1881, contains this clause, \u25a0 among others: \u201cThat in case of default in the payment of the said notes, or any or either of them, or any part thereof, or in case of the breach of any of the covenants or agreements therein mentioned, it shall then be lawful for the said party of the second part,\u201d (i. &lt;?., John Farson) \u201cor his successors in trust, on application of the legal holders of said notes, or either of them, to enter into and upon, and take possession of, the premises thereby granted, or any part thereof; and to collect and to receive' all rents, issues and profits thereof, and in his own name, or otherwise, to file a bill in any court, \u201d etc. And the bill here alleges, that Frederick W. Hayes is the owner and holder of the notes secured by the deed of trust; \u201cthat none of said notes, or any part thereof, nor any interest, has been paid by said Colby, and that the said Frederick W. Hayes, who is now the holder and owner of all of said notes, has, by virtue of the terms of said trust deed, declared all of said notes, and the interest thereon, due and payable, and has requested your orator\u201d (John Farson,) \u201cto foreclose said mortgage.\u201d These allegations are all disproved. The complainant, John Farson, testified, that he never had any conversation with Frederick W. Hayes about this trust deed, nor about the notes that it was given to secure. He repeated this more than once, and he also testified that he had no recollection of eyer having seen the trust deed before it was presented to him upon his examination as a witness. Samuel Kean, a member of the firm of Preston, Kean &amp; Co., testified, in substance, that the property of the notes never went out of Preston, Kean &amp; Co.; that the notes were simply transferred to Hayes in trust, in fact, for a purpose that was never-consummated,\u2014the real ownership, all the time, remaining in Preston, Kean &amp; Co.,\u2014and they were, before the hearing, re-transferred to Preston, Kean &amp; Co.</p> <p id=\"b441-5\" pgmap=\"441\">The decree, without any amendment having been made to-the bill, or any cross-bill having been filed, found that Preston, Kean &amp; Co. were the owners of the notes, and decreed payment to them. There was' clearly such a variance between the allegations and proofs, and. the allegations and the decree, as renders it erroneous. Parkhurst v. Race et al. 100 Ill. 558 ; Hall v. Towne, 45 id. 493; Randolph v. Onstott, 58 id. 52. The bill should either have been amended after it was ascertained that Preston, Kean &amp; Co. were the owners of the notes, and' the parties at whose instance the immatured indebtedness was declared due, or a cross-bill should have been filed setting up such facts. Jenkins v. International Bank et al. 111 Ill. 470; White et al. v. White, Jr. 103 id. 438; Purdy et ux. v Henslee et al. 97 id. 389.</p> <p id=\"b441-6\" pgmap=\"441(72) 442(310)\">But we are of opinion that it was not competent for Preston, Kean &amp; Co. to declare the last note due, and have a bill for foreclosure filed on the 3d day of May, A. D. 1884, when this bill was filed. The evidence is uncontradicted, that in February, A. D. 1884, the attorney and agent of Gorham applied to Preston, Kean &amp; Co., on behalf of Gorham, to ascertain what amount, included in the notes secured by the deed of trust, was due from Colby to them on the original purchase of the lots, and which Gorham was, therefore,-bound to pay. They refused to converse with him upon the subject, but referred him to their attorney, Mr. Culver. Mr. Culver informed him that the amount was $19,500, and $3125 interest thereon, and soon afterwards, Mr. Culver, in another conversation with the attorney and agent of Gorham, in regard to the amount that Gorham should pay to Preston, Kean &amp; Co. on account of Colby\u2019s original purchase of the lots, repeated the demand that he should pay $19,500 principal, and $3125 interest thereon, and informed him that Preston, Kean &amp; Co. would not accept any less sum. At no subsequent time, before filing the bill, did they indicate that they would accept any less sum than that thus demanded by their designated agent\u2014for the purpose of declaring the amount of their demand\u2014Mr. Culver ; and that demand is repeated in this bill. It has been seen that that amount included $3200, and one per cent per annum of interest on the amount actually due, besides seven per cent per annum interest on the $3200, which Colby was not obligated- to pay by the terms of the agreement between him and Preston, Kean &amp; Co., of May 1, 1881, and which, therefore, was not chargeable against Gorham. Where a creditor, in advance of an offer to pay, or in response to such offer, informs the party under obligation to pay, that he will not accept the amount actually due, in discharge of the indebtedness, the party under obligation to pay is relieved of the duty of tendering the amount actually due. Wight v. Gardner, 66 Ill. 95; McPherson v. Walker, 40 id. 371; Dwen v. Blake, 44 id. 136.</p> <p id=\"b442-5\" pgmap=\"442\">Gorham, then, not having been in the wrong in not having paid or tendered the amount actually due, it was inequitable to declare a forfeiture and file a bill before the last note was due.</p> <p id=\"b443-3\" pgmap=\"443\">Since the decree below must be reversed for these reasons, it is only necessary to speak of the form of the decree, to avoid repeating, in the future, what we deem to be erroneous therein.</p> <p id=\"AXFs\" pgmap=\"443(321) 444(26)\">By the terms of the contract of May 1, A. D. 1881, the indebtedness incurred in the purchase of the eight lots constituting block 4, was to be charged against those lots, and the indebtedness incurred in the purchase of the three lots was to be a charge against those lots: It would, therefore, manifestly violate the rights of Gorham, under that contract, to charge, in any contingency affecting his right to redeem, the' indebtedness incurred in the purchase of the first mentioned lots, against the second mentioned lots, or the reverse. So, also, when Gorham\u2019s title became perfected, no equity of redemption remained in Colby. He, thereafter, did not have, in any event, any further interest in the property. Preston, Kean &amp; Co.\u2019s right of foreclosure was, therefore, then limited to the amount fixed as the purchase price by the contract of May 1, 1881, and interest thereon at six per cent per annum. The evidence sufficiently proves that the value of the property is greater than the amount that Gorham is required to pay under that contract, and so there can be no strict foreclosure, under our practice. Gorham is therefore entitled to redeem by paying the amount chargeable against him, with current interest, at any time within twelve months from the day of sale. No one else having a right to redeem from the sale, the decree should\" not direct the sale to be for an amount, chargeable against Colby or some one else than Gorham, greater than that which Gorham is required to pay. Gorham having a right to redeem by paying a certain amount, his property can not be subjected to sale for a greater amount. There may, undoubtedly, in foreclosing mortgages, often, in the same case, be separate decrees on account of the distinct indebtedness of different parties; but the distinct indebtedness of different parties can not all be charged against the mortgaged property, unless they are all liens upon the property, under the mortgage, prior to the title of the owner of the equity of redemption.</p> <p id=\"b444-5\" pgmap=\"444(353) 445(85)\">The evidence showed some outstanding title or claim in Preston, Kean &amp; Co. on account of taxes. It is not claimed that they have acquired a title, adverse to Gorham, in that way, and it is clear they could not. The amount, however, may be important in taking an account between the parties. The evidence shows that Colby, in October, A. D. 1881, turned over the possession of these lots to Preston, Kean &amp; Co., informing them that he should have nothing more to do with them. They accepted this possession, and thereafter necessarily occupied the relation, to Colby, of mortgagees in possession, and, as such, it was their first duty to pay, from rentq, or profits derived otherwise from the use of the property, all claims for taxes. It is claimed, and evidence is given tending to support the claim, that this relation was subsequently destroyed by a decree of court, on bill filed by Gardner, who had been a partner of Colby, against the two, Colby and Preston, Kean &amp; Co., to dissolve partnership, ordering thes'e lots to be placed in the possession of a receiver, and subsequently to be sold, as well as certain personal property, by the receiver, for the payment of the $3000 borrowed by Colby, Gardner &amp; Co. from Preston, Kean &amp; Co., and included in the deed of trust, as has been before seen. These lots were not the property of Colby, Gardner &amp; Co., but the individual property of Gilbert A. Colby. Under no principle had a court of equity, at the instance and on behalf of the members of that firm, any right to interfere with the individual property of members of the firm, which had been, in good faith, previously devoted to the payment of the debts of the individual; and we are unable to comprehend how, if the facts had been presented to the court by Preston, Kean &amp; Co., their possession could have been disturbed. The proof in this record is not satisfactory, because not full in this respect. Gorham was not made a party to the suit, and Gilbert A. Colby was not personally served with process, as we understand the record, but Preston, Kean &amp; Co. were made defendants, and were personally before the court. If Preston, Kean &amp; Co. failed, in that suit, to assert their rights to the possession, as seems apparent from the evidence before us-, they can not, as against the failure to perform their duty in relieving the property from any claim on account of taxes, allege this deprivation of possession of the property.</p> <p id=\"b445-5\" pgmap=\"445\">The judgment of the Appellate Court affirming the decree of the circuit court, as also that decree, is reversed.</p> <p id=\"b445-6\" pgmap=\"445\">Judgment reversed.</p> <p id=\"b445-7\" pgmap=\"445\">Mr. Justice Magbuder did not take part in the decision of this case.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
