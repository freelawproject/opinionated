Stolich, appeals from her conviction and sentence, following a no contest plea, for operating a motor vehicle under the influence. Stolich contends that the trial court erred by finding her guilty in view of her proffered defense that she was merely following the orders of a police officer when she drove her car while intoxicated. We conclude that the evidence in the record did not require the trial court to find that Stolich was operating under the orders of a police officer when she drove her car while intoxicated. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">Stolich tendered a plea of no contest, and the case was submitted to the trial court upon certain, stipulations of fact and Stolich\u2019s testimony, both on cross-examination and direct-examination. The stipulations of fact were recited into the record as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">\u201c1. That the defendant, Tammy Stolich, and Roger Conley, were investigated by [a] Beavercreek Police Department officer and we believe it is Officer Wilson on February 12, 1994, at 12:22 a.m. when he investigated their car parked at the conservancy area in the city of Beavercreek.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\"><em>\u201c2. </em>The check of the I.D. of both occupants of [the] vehicle showed that there was an active warrant for Roger Conley.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">\u201c3. The Greene County Sheriff\u2019s office was called to handle the warrant issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">\u201c4. Mr. Conley was intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-16\">\u201c5. Greene County Sheriffs officers arrived and took custody of Mr. Conley.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>\u201c6. Approximately ten minutes after the first contact, which was about 12:22 in the morning, Tammy Stolich was allowed to leave the area, driving the vehicle which she and Mr. Conley had been in.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u201c7. At 1:23 in the morning of February 12, 1994, the defendant, Tammy Stolich, was stopped for marked lanes and [a] DUI violation by Deputy Pettiford, Greene County Sheriffs office, off U.S. 68 at Jacoby Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\u201c8. There was probable cause for the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">\u201c9. Tests were given and a valid intoxilyzer test was administered and the defendant tested .262.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">\u201c10. There was proper jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">\u201c11. There was no search of the defendant\u2019s vehicle by the Beavercreek Police Department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">Stolich then testified, both on direct examination and on cross-examination. Her testimony on direct examination included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-11\">\u201cQ. Okay. Did a police officer come up to your car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-12\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-13\">\u201cQ. All right. Did he have any discussion with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-14\">\u201cA. He asked for identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-15\">\u201cQ. And did you produce that identification?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-16\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-17\">\u201cQ. Okay. Did he have any other discussion with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-18\">\u201cA Not really.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-19\">\u201cQ. Okay. At any point did he \u2014 at some point did you leave that area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-20\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-21\">\u201cQ. Okay. Did anyone tell you to leave that area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-22\">\u201cA. Yes, he brought by I.D. back to the car and told me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-23\">\u201cQ. Okay. He who?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-24\">\u201cA. The officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-25\">\u201cQ. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-26\">\u201cA Told me to go on home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-27\">\u201cQ. Okay. And did you go home after that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-28\">\u201cA Well, I intended to, but I was out in the country in an area I\u2019m not familiar with and I got lost.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>On cross-examination, Stolich\u2019s testimony included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">\u201cQ. Okay. Okay. So the Beavercreek officer told Roger to come with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">\u201cA. Mmm-hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">\u201cQ. And he took him away?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">\u201cA. (Indicated in the affirmative.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">\u201cQ. What happened? And then you were\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">\u201cA. Well, they stayed there. He didn\u2019t take him away. He just took him to his car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-11\">\u201cQ. Took him to his car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-12\">\u201cA. Mmm-hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-13\">\u201cQ. Right. And then you stayed in your car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-14\">\u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-15\">\u201cQ. What happened immediately after that? What happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-16\">\u201cA. He brought my license back and handed them [sic ] to me and told me I was free to go home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-17\">\u201cQ. Did you have any discussion with him about what was going to happen to Roger?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-18\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-19\">\u201cQ. Did you say anything or talk to him at all about bond or to get bond for Roger?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-20\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No, I don\u2019t believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-21\">\u201cQ. Okay. Could you have told the officer that you would go get bond, try to find a bondsman for him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-22\">\u201cA. No, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-23\">\u201cQ. Okay. And was the officer at all concerned to you about having the car parked or getting it moved from where it was parked, was there any discussion about illegally parked or anything like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-24\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-25\">\u201cQ. And when the \u2014 . Okay. Did the officer have you do any field sobriety tests?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-26\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-27\">\u201cQ. Nothing like that at all. And just had basically the kind of contact that you testified here to, is that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-28\">\u201cA. Right? He just\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>\u201cQ. Most of the attention would be fair to say, was focused on Roger?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">\u201cA. Right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Following Stolich\u2019s testimony, argument was presented by counsel for both parties. Following the argument, the trial court found Stolich guilty on the no contest plea, and imposed sentence accordingly. Stolich appeals from her conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Stolich\u2019s sole assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred in failing to recognize, as a defense to a DUI charge, the fact that the state through its police officers had instructed defendant to drive in the same condition that led to the DUI charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">Essentially, Stolich contends that because she had received an order to drive her car away from the place where it was parked, she had the unacceptable choice of either refusing to obey the order of a police officer, or driving while she might be, and was in fact, intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Stolich acknowledges that she has not found any Ohio cases directly on point, but cites <em>State v. Melvan </em>(1992), 80 Ohio App.3d 443, 449, 609 N.E.2d 595, 599-600, as a case in which some sympathy was expressed for the proposition that following the direction of a police officer is a defense to a charge of drunk driving. In that case, the first officer to stop the defendant told him to go home, but it appeared that the defendant made no effort to do so. Consequently, the court of appeals concluded that the defense was. not available to the defendant in that case, even if it would otherwise be a valid defense, because he was not following the direction of a police officer when he was stopped the second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">We, also, would find some sympathy for Stolich if we could accept as proven her proposition of fact that she had been ordered to leave the scene by the police officer who arrested her companion, Roger Conley. However, we cannot accept this proposition of fact as having been proven to the satisfaction of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">In her direct testimony, Stolich was asked whether anyone had told her to leave the area. In response to that question, Stolich asserted that the police officer who arrested Conley had told her to go on home. However, on cross-examination, in response to a more open-ended question (\u201cWhat happened immediately after that, what happened next?\u201d), Stolich testified that the officer told her she \u201cwas free to go home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">On this record, we conclude that the trial court could have found that the police officer who arrested Stolich\u2019s companion merely told her that she was free to go home. In so advising Stolich, the police officer may not have been using his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>best judgment, since Stolich tested .262, a high concentration of alcohol, an hour later. However, permitting an individual to leave is not the same as directing, ordering, or requiring the individual to leave the scene. Even if we assume the defense of following the direction of a police officer is a valid defense, we conclude that the trial court was not required to find the necessary factual predicate on this record. Accordingly, the trial court could find, as it did, that Stolich was guilty of the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Stolich\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Stolich\u2019s sole assignment of error having been overruled, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b388-9\">Gkady and Frederick N.
