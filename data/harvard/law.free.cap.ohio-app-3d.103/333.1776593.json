Young, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">Plaintiffs-appellants and cross-appellees, Iseral and Una Bishop (\u201cappellants\u201d), appeal from a jury verdict in favor of defendants-appellees and cross-appellants, Barrett Paving Materials, Inc. (\u201cBarrett\u201d), Plainville Concrete Services, Inc. (\u201cPlainville\u201d), and Carl E. Oeder <em>&amp; </em>Sons Sand &amp; Gravel (\u201cOeder\u201d). The jury found appellees and cross-appellants (\u201cappellees\u201d) not liable for either nuisance or trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">Oeder, Barrett, and Plainville operate a sand and gravel processing facility, an asphalt plant, and a concrete plant, respectively. Appellants are two of six original plaintiffs who live in the immediate vicinity and who sued appellees under common-law theories of nuisance and trespass. Appellants claim that appellees\u2019 operations generate dust, noise and odors that interfere with their use and ownership of their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">Iseral Bishop purchased his property on Turtle Creek Road in the early 1960s. His wife, Una, joined him there after their marriage. Oeder, owner of the property upon which appellees conduct their operations, purchased the tract and some miscellaneous on-site equipment in 1972. Before Oeder\u2019s purchase, Ohio Gravel Company leased the mineral rights to the tract. Oeder erected a concrete plant on the site in the year it was purchased. Plainville leased the concrete plant in 1986. In 1987, Barrett bought a blacktop plant built on the site in 1980. There was testimony that there had been gravel mining in the immediate area since the 1930s, before the construction of any of the original plaintiffs\u2019 homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>On December 8, 1993, the trial court granted partial summary judgment for appellees, concluding there was no evidence of negligence supporting a qualified nuisance action. The cause proceeded to trial on the issues of absolute nuisance and trespass. The jury eventually found for appellees. Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Oeder and Plainville filed cross-appeals in this case. They set forth a total of three cross-assignments of error based on the trial court\u2019s earlier decision to allow appellants to proceed to trial on the issue of absolute nuisance. However, the cross-appeals were not filed within time, and this court does not have jurisdiction to consider them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">On appeal, appellants set forth eight assignments of error. Under their first assignment of error, appellants argue that the trial court abused its discretion in instructing the jury on the \u201ccoming to the nuisance defense.\u201d The court, quoting in part from <em>Eller v. Koehler </em>(1903), 68 Ohio St. 51, 57, 67 N.E. 89, 91, issued the following instruction:</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">\u201c[The coming to the nuisance] defense may limit any Plaintiffs from recovering on their nuisance claim if that Plaintiff knew of the situation or in the exercise of ordinary care should have known of the situation and voluntarily placed himself or herself in the proximity of an activity which he or she now alleges to be a nuisance. [\u2018][0]ne who becomes a resident of a trading or manufacturing neighborhood, or who remains while in the march of events a residence district gradually becomes a trading or manufacturing neighborhood should be held bound to submit to the ordinary annoyances, discomforts and injuries which are fairly incidental to the reasonable and general conduct of such business in his chosen neighborhood.[\u2019] \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">In <em>Eller, </em>the Supreme Court implicitly recognized that priority of occupation may be considered along with other evidence in determining whether the use of a nuisance on defendant\u2019s property is unreasonable. In <em>Gruic v. Knight </em>(App.1933), 15 Ohio Law Abs. 502, 505, the court explicitly recognized this argument, stating: \u201cThe fact that [the plaintiff] voluntarily places himself in a situation whereby he suffers inconvenience and injury from my use of my estate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>is of importance in determining whether said use of my estate is reasonable and not injurious to such a reasonable use of his estate as he is entitled to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Appellants emphasize that Oeder did not purchase its property until 1972, after they had purchased their lot. However, this court believes that the defense, where applicable, should be premised on the continuity of the claimed nuisance, not necessarily on the continuity of the named defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u201cComing to the nuisance\u201d does not constitute an absolute bar to a nuisance complaint. However, the argument may be considered as one factor among others relevant in determining whether a defendant\u2019s operations are unreasonable. This court concludes that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in instructing the jury that it could consider the \u201ccoming to the nuisance defense.\u201d Appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Appellants complain under their second assignment of error that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could find appellees liable in trespass only if appellants established that appellees\u2019 operations caused \u201csubstantial physical harm\u201d to their property. Appellants asked the trial court to instruct the jury that appellees were liable for trespass if their operations caused dust or dirt to fall on appellants\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Trespass is often described as any intentional invasion of a plaintiffs interest in the exclusive possession of his or her property. In contrast, a nuisance requires a substantial and unreasonable interference with the plaintiffs use and enjoyment of his or her property. Traditionally, an intrusion on property by airborne particulates was actionable under a nuisance claim but did not constitute a trespass. See Annotation (1980), 2 A.L.R. 4th 1054, 1055.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">However, a number of courts nationwide now recognize that the invasion of airborne particulates may interfere with a complainant\u2019s interest in exclusive possession and may therefore constitute a trespass. In <em>Borland v. Sanders Lead Co., Inc. </em>(Ala.1979), 369 So.2d 523, a widely cited case on the subject, the Alabama Supreme Court laid out the elements of trespass by airborne pollutants:</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>\u201cIn order to recover in trespass for this type of invasion [in this case pollution emitted from the defendant\u2019s smoke stack] a plaintiff must show (1) an invasion affecting an interest in the exclusive possession of his property; (2) an intentional doing of the act which results in the invasion; (3) reasonable foreseeability that the act done could result in an invasion of plaintiffs possessory interest; and (4) <em>substantial damages </em>to the res.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Traditionally, any tangible invasion of property constituted a trespass and entitled a landowner to at least recover nominal damages. However, such a rule is not appropriate where the incursion is the result of airborne particulates. In <em>Bradley v. Am. Smelting &amp; Refining </em>(1985), 104 Wash.2d 677, 691, 709 P.2d 782, 791, the court considered the \u201csubstantial damages\u201d element for a cause of trespass based on airborne particulates and stated: \u201cNo useful purpose would be served by sanctioning actions in trespass by every landowner within a hundred miles of a manufacturing plant. Manufacturers would be harassed and the litigious few would cause the escalation of costs to the detriment of the many.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Although \u201csubstantial damage\u201d is not a traditional element of trespass, trespass was not traditionally available as a remedy for airborne particles and pollutants deposited on a plaintiffs land. This court approves of the elements of trespass by airborne pollutants set forth in <em>Borland </em>and adopted in <em>Bradley. </em>The trial court did not err in instructing the jury that appellees were culpable in trespass for causing dust or dirt to fall on appellants\u2019 property only if the jury concluded that appellants had established \u201csubstantial damages.\u201d Appellants\u2019 second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Under their third assignment of error, appellants complain that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding evidence that dust emissions from appellees\u2019 operations exceeded national Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) Ambient Air Quality Standards. Appellants\u2019 fourth assignment of error involves the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow a defense expert to calculate for the jury dust emissions from appellees\u2019 operations using \u201cemission factors\u201d created by the United States EPA and utilized by the Ohio EPA. We will address both assignments of error together.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">On November 11, 1993, appellees filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude appellants from referring to Ohio Ambient Air Quality Standards at trial. The trial court apparently issued an order on this motion; however, appellants did not make the trial court\u2019s order part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">During the trial, Tony Wisbeth, an environmental engineer, and Charles Zimmer, an expert in air quality testing and analysis, testified for appellants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>The trial court would not allow these witnesses to testify that the result of certain air quality tests exceeded EPA ambient air quality standards. The court also prevented the witnesses from using \u201cemission factors\u201d in an attempt to demonstrate that dust probably originated from appellees\u2019 operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Both appellants and appellees cite R.C. 3704.09 of the Ohio Air Pollution Control Act. That section states in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u201cDeterminations made by the director of environmental protection or other persons acting under sections 3704.03 and 3704.04 of the Revised Code shall not be used as evidence in civil actions nor create any presumption of law or finding of fact which shall inure to or be for the benefit of any person other than the state, and sections 3704.01 to 3704.07 of the Revised Code do not create, enlarge, or abrogate existing private rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">R.C. 3704.03(D) empowers the Ohio Director of Environmental Protection to:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">\u201cAdopt, modify, and rescind rules prescribing ambient air quality standards for the state as a whole or for various areas of the state that are consistent with and no more stringent than the national ambient air quality standards in effect under the Federal Clean Air Aet[.] \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Appellants argue that R.C. 3704.09 does not apply because they tried to introduce clean air standards promulgated by the federal EPA, not the Ohio EPA. On the other hand, appellees argue that Ohio\u2019s \u201cadoption\u201d of the federal standards is a \u201cdetermination\u201d under R.C. 3704.09. Appellees claim that appellants\u2019 attempt to introduce the federal standards is an attempt to avoid R.C. 3704.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">Appellants want this court to conclude that R.C. 3704.09 does not preclude them from introducing standards established by the federal EPA. However, as far as this court can tell from the available record, the trial court did not explicitly state that R.C. 3704.09 prevented appellants from introducing federal EPA standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">This court does not know whether the trial court\u2019s order was premised solely or in part on R.C. 3704.09. The trial court\u2019s order on appellees\u2019 motion <em>in limine </em>is not a part of the record. This court therefore does not know the scope, the basis, or the reasoning behind the trial court\u2019s decision not to allow appellants\u2019 experts to testify that samples taken at Turtle Creek Road exceeded EPA standards or use EPA \u201cemission factors.\u201d Accordingly, we will not attempt to interpret R.C. 3704.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">We note, however, that although appellants were not permitted to introduce, evidence that certain air samples exceeded EPA standards, the trial court did allow Wisbeth and Zimmer to compare actual air samples with a background level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>of particulates they would expect to find in a rural setting. This background level was based on local governmental data. Appellants were also permitted to compare air samples taken from the area with air samples from other locations. Significantly, the trial court did not permit appellees to introduce evidence that they complied with EPA standards and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">A trial court has broad discretion in determining whether to admit or exclude evidence, and unless the court abused its discretion and materially prejudiced a party, the decision will stand. <em>Krischbaum v. Dillon </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 58, 66, 567 N.E.2d 1291, 1298-1299. After completely reviewing the transcript provided, this court is not convinced that the trial court abused its discretion or materially prejudiced appellants by prohibiting them from introducing evidence that air samples exceeded ambient air quality standards established by the federal EPA or from using federal \u201cemission factors.\u201d Appellants\u2019 third and fourth assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Under appellants\u2019 fifth assignment of error they contend that the trial court should not have allowed appellees to introduce evidence that their plants were operated consistent with industry standards. Appellants argue that under absolute nuisance theory culpability is irrelevant. However, there is no indication that the trial court allowed appellees to introduce the evidence complained of as an attempt to demonstrate to the jury that they were not culpable.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Barrett and Plainville argued at trial that their operations did not contribute to the alleged nuisance. Barrett and Plainville had the right to introduce evidence to support this argument. The trial court properly allowed these individual appellees to introduce evidence that they complied with industry standards so that they could attempt to show that they were not responsible for creating or adding to any dirt and dust at the site. Significantly, the trial court gave the jury a limiting instruction on evidence of industry standards, stating that conformity to business practices is not justification for unreasonably \u201cinterfering with the property or personal rights of their neighbors * * We overrule appellants\u2019 fifth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Appellants complain under their sixth assignment of error that the trial court abused its discretion in precluding one of appellants\u2019 experts from testifying about the unreasonable nature of the dust emitted from appellees\u2019 operations. On voir dire, Zimmer offered his opinion that dust levels he observed at Turtle Creek Road were unreasonable and sufficient to minimize appellants\u2019 enjoyment of their property. The trial court concluded that the proffered opinion was based on Zimmer\u2019s \u201cpersonal belief as to what was acceptable and not acceptable and was not an \u2018expert opinion.\u2019 \u201d There is no indication in the record that the trial court abused its discretion in not allowing Zimmer to offer his opinion on the issue. Appellants\u2019 sixth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>In their seventh assignment of error, appellants object to the following portion of the jury instructions:</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\u201cNevertheless, not all annoyances or inconveniences suffered are compensable. Trivial and everyday and ordinary annoyances, discomforts and injuries which are fairly incidental to the reasonable and general conduct of a gravel mine, concrete plant, and asphalt plant are not compensable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Appellants contend that this instruction erroneously placed the burden on appellants to prove that the level of dust, odor and noise was unusual for these types of operations. They claim this instruction is inconsistent with the nature of an action in absolute nuisance, <em>ie., </em>strict liability. Appellees note that the language above was taken from <em>Eller v. Koehler, supra, </em>68 Ohio St. 51, 67 N.E. 89. They argue that, when read in context, the statement quoted above is not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The statement quoted above is not a clear or accurate instruction regarding nuisance. However, the statement is only a small portion of the trial court\u2019s instruction on appellants\u2019 nuisance claim. Where the trial court misstates the law or creates an ambiguity in a portion of its jury instructions, it is not reversible error where the court\u2019s instructions, considered as a whole, are not prejudicial to the objecting party. <em>Snyder v. Stanford </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St.2d 31, 44 O.O.2d 18, 238 N.E.2d 563, paragraph three of the syllabus. Having reviewed the trial court\u2019s instructions on nuisance as a whole, the court is not convinced that they were incorrect or prejudicial. Appellants\u2019 seventh assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Appellants\u2019 eighth and final assignment of error alleges that the trial court submitted \u201cspecial verdict\u201d forms to the jury in violation of Civ.R. 49(C). In this case, the trial court submitted distinct verdict forms to the jury on the separate claims of nuisance and trespass. A general verdict is defined as \u201c[a] verdict whereby the jury finds either for the plaintiff or the defendant in general terms.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed.Rev.1979) 1399. \u201cThe \u2018special\u2019 verdict is a statement by the jury of the facts it has found \u2014 in essence, the jury\u2019s answers to questions submitted to it; the court determines which party, based on those answers, is to have judgment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">In this case, the trial court issued two general verdict forms \u2014 one for nuisance and one for trespass. Civ.R. 49 does not prohibit multiple general verdicts. Appellants\u2019 final assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b376-11\">Walsh, P.J., and Koehler, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-9\">. Under App.R. 4(B)(1), all cross-appeals should have been filed within ten days of appellants' appeal. Appellants filed their notice of appeal on January 21, 1994, the last day of the thirty-day period for filing such notice. Plainville and Oeder had until January 31, 1994, to file notice of cross-appeal, but did not file their notices until February 1, 1994, one day out of time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b372-10\">. Under traditional principles, recovery in trespass was unavailable where dust or smoke were repeatedly released over the plaintiff's land. Reynolds, Distinguishing Trespass and Nuisance: A Journey Through a Shifting Borderland (1991), 44 Okla.L.Rev. 227, 232, citing <em>Thackery v. Union Portland Cement Co. </em>(1924), 64 Utah 437, 231 P. 813 (no trespass where cement plant released dust and smoke over farm). Trespass has often been defined in terms of a direct or immediate physical or tangible invasion of the plaintiff\u2019s property; some courts had held that if an intervening force, such as wind or water, carries pollutants onto the plaintiff\u2019s land, then the entry is not \u201cdirect.\u201d See <em>Bradley v. Am. Smelting &amp; Refining </em>(1985), 104 Wash.2d 677, 686, 709 P.2d 782, 787. Other courts considered a \"tangible invasion\u201d or \"object\u201d to be more substantial than dust, gas, or fumes. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
