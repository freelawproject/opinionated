In his first assignment of error, Foley contends that failure to display a valid driver\u2019s license when it is not in the driver\u2019s possession is not a violation of R.C. 4507.35. Foley maintains correctly that pursuant to the statutory language, a failure to display a license is only a violation of the statute if the license is \u201con or about\u201d the driver\u2019s person and the driver refuses to show the license to a police officer upon request. If the license is not on the driver\u2019s person, as was the situation in the case before us, then no more than a prima facie violation is established, which may be rebutted upon satisfactory proof of a valid driver\u2019s license. <em>State v. Green </em>(1984), 13 Ohio Misc.2d 14, 13 OBR 301, 462 N.E.2d 466; <em>State v. Bankston </em>(Oct. 2, 1986), Montgomery App. No. CA 9811, unreported, 1986 WL 11114.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Foley rebutted the prima facie case against him by exhibiting his valid driver\u2019s license in court. Accordingly, no violation of R.C. 4507.35 was established. Foley\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Because Foley\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained, his second assignment of error is moot. App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Therefore, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the defendant-appellant is discharged from further prosecution in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b243-11\">Hildebrandt, P.J., Marianna Brown Bettman and Painter, <em>33., </em>concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
