Young, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">Appellant, Miami University (\u201cMiami\u201d), appeals the decision of the Butler County Court of Common Pleas granting the motion of appellee, Lisa Armitage, to dismiss the university\u2019s appeal from a decision of the State Personnel Board of Review (\u201cSPBR\u201d). The lower court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to hear Miami\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">Miami employed Armitage as an Administrative Specialist in the Office of Student Financial Aid. Effective October 12, 1993, the university placed Armitage on involuntary disability separation (\u201cIDS\u201d) pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 123:1-3-01 <em>et seq., </em>which rules are promulgated under R.C. 124.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">Armitage appealed the IDS to the SPBR. On August 10, 1994, an administrative law judge recommended that the SPBR disaffirm Armitage\u2019s placement on IDS. On October 4, the SPBR adopted this recommendation, over Miami\u2019s objections, and ordered the university to restore Armitage to her former position with full back pay and benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-14\">Miami appealed the SPBR\u2019s order to the Butler County Court of Common Pleas on October 19, 1994. Armitage filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on October 31,1994. On November 28,1994, the court entered an opinion and order dismissing the appeal, holding that R.C. 124.34 does not provide for an appeal of a decision of the SPBR unless \u201cdisciplinary reasons\u201d are involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>On appeal to this court, Miami sets forth the following two issues for review under its sole assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">\u201c(1) Section 124.34 of the Ohio Revised Code grants to the employer (state agency) and its employees the right to appeal an adverse decision of the State Personnel Board of Review in an involuntary disability separation, case.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">\u201c(2) The General Assembly\u2019s amendment of Section 124.03 of the Ohio Revised Code to include involuntary disability separation in the definition of discharge grants employees placed upon involuntary disability separation and their employers the same statutory rights as apply when employees are otherwise removed under Section 124.34.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The lower court, per Judge John R. Moser, cogently addressed these issues in its opinion and order dismissing the appeal filed on November 28, 1994. The lower court followed <em>Collyer v. Broadview Dev. Ctr. </em>(1991), 74 Ohio App.3d 99, 598 N.E.2d 75. That portion of the lower court\u2019s decision addressing these issues is worth quoting in its entirety:</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">\u201cWe next review Miami\u2019s appellant [sic ] rights under R.C. 124.34, which states in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">\u201c \u2018In cases of removal or reduction in pay for disciplinary reasons, either the appointing authority or the officer or employee may appeal from the decision of the State Personnel Board of Review or the Commission to the Court of Common Pleas of the county in which the employee resides in accordance with the procedure provided by \u00a7 119.12 of the Revised Code.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">\u201cArmitage argues that only where there is a \u2018removal or reduction in pay for disciplinary reasons,\u2019 can an appointing authority or employee appeal, thus precluding Miami from any appellate] rights for IDS. Miami, on the other hand contends that this is not a proper interpretation. Miami\u2019s contention is that this provision should be read as follows, \u2018In cases or removal or in cases of reduction in pay for disciplinary reasons.\u2019 If we were to follow this interpretation, there would be no right of appeal in cases of <em>removal </em>for disciplinary reasons. We believe that the prepositional phrase \u2018of removal or reduction in pa/ modifies the word \u2018cases\u2019 and the word \u2018cases\u2019 refers to \u2018disciplinary reasons.\u2019 Thus, having arrived at this interpretation, we would conclude there are no appellate rights to the Court of Common Pleas under R.C. \u00a7 124.34, unless disciplinary reasons are involved. <em>Sub judice, </em>Armitage was not removed for disciplinary reasons. We realize that this imposes considerable restrictions on an appeal from the PBR, however, a litigant has only a statutory not an inherent right to appeal. <em>Corn v. Board of Liquor Control </em>(1953), 160 Ohio [St.] 9, 11 [50 O.O. 479, 480, 113 N.E.2d 360, 361]; <em>Collyer, supra </em>[74 Ohio App.3d at 101, 598 N.E.2d at 76-77]. We also cite <em>Collyer, supra, </em>at 101 [598 N.E.2d at 76-77], for the proposition that under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>\u2018R.C. \u00a7 124.34, only removals and reductions in pay imposed for disciplinary reasons may be appealed.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u201cWe recognize as Miami urges, that R.C. \u00a7 124.03 was amended one year after <em>Collyer </em>was decided. R.C. \u00a7 124.03 deals with \u2018Powers and Duties of State Personnel Board of Review.\u2019 This Section sets forth the jurisdiction of the PBR to hear various appeals and the amendment included the language, \u2018As used in this division, discharge includes involuntary disability separations.\u2019 Therefore, says Miami, there was a legislative intent to allow appeals from the PBR for IDS. If this were true, the General Assembly should have amended R.C. \u00a7 124.34, which deals with appeals from the PBR to the Common Pleas Court. In addition, however, we observe that the General Assembly may have been concerned that due to <em>Collyer, supra, </em>there may not exist an appeal from the appointing agency to the PBR. In <em>Collyer, </em>the appointing authority filed objections contending that the PBR had no authority to review a disability separation and for that reason, the appointing authority did not have to provide the PBR with a notice of its action as required by R.C. \u00a7 124.03. The amendment laid to rest such contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u201cR.C. \u00a7 124.03 itself acknowledges that all of its decisions may not be subject to an appeal to a court. For example, this Section includes the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">\u201c \u2018In any hearing before the Board, including any hearing at which a record is taken that may be the basis of an appeal to a court, an employee may be represented * * *.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\u201cThis language anticipates that there may be hearings which cannot be appealed or otherwise the words \u2018including any hearing at which a report is taken that may be the basis of an appeal to. the court\u2019 would be superfluous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">This court adopts the reasoning of the trial court quoted above in its entirety. Miami does not suggest that an IDS is strictly equivalent to a disciplinary action. Under the plain language of R.C. 124.34, only removals and reductions in pay imposed for \u201cdisciplinary reasons\u201d may be appealed to the common pleas court. <em>Collyer, supra, </em>74 Ohio App.3d at 101-102, 598 N.E.2d at 76-77. Had the legislature intended otherwise, it could have amended the section to confer such a right to appeal. Miami\u2019s assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b498-12\">Walsh, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AKx\">Koehler, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Koehler, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AM3\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The trial court\u2019s well-written decision adopted by the majority of this court holds that there is no appeal from the decision of the State Personnel Board of Review in the case of an involuntary disability separation of an employee. They reason that, if there were, the legislature would have told us so.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Is it possible that the legislative intent would allow such interpretation of the statute or was it a drafting oversight in the enactment of the amendment? Whether by legislative intent or oversight, this court\u2019s affirmation effectively denies either the employer or the employee the complete due process which is accorded other employees and employers in the case of removals or reduction in pay for disciplinary reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\u25a0Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
