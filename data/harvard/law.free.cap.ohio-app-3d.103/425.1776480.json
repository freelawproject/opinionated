The relevant facts are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">On October 7, 1993, around 1:30 p.m., two female Ohio State University students were stopped and threatened with a gun while they were walking back to their dormitory room. The students were returning from lunch. As they reached the second flight of stairs at the dormitory, a young male who was a couple of steps behind, called out to them by saying, \u201cExcuse me.\u201d The women turned around, and the young man then demanded, \u201cGive me your gold.\u201d After he was advised that they did not have any gold, the man pointed a gun at one of the student\u2019s neck and said, \u201cGive me your necklace.\u201d The victim did not respond because she was \u201cshocked,\u201d the other victim responded with profanity, advising the man that she was not giving him anything. The assailant put his gun away and said, \u201cNo, I was just kidding.\u201d He left after hearing noise or other commotion in the dormitory.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">The women ran upstairs to their room and related the incident to their other roommate. Together, they ran back outsid\u00e9, caught up with the man, and yelled, \u201cWhy did you -do that?\u201d The man continued to walk away. The women followed him to his car and obtained his license plate number. Appellant was later arrested after two of the three women identified him in a photo array. Appellant denied any involvement in the incident. After a jury trial, appellant was convicted as charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">Appellant now appeals and raises two assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">\u201cAssignment of Error I</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">\u201cThe convictions of the defendant must be reversed because the evidence admitted against the defendant was insufficient to support a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>\u201cAssignment of Error II</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\u201cThe trial court erred in that it failed to accept the defendant\u2019s proposed jury-instruction as to Count Two of the indictment, providing the jury with instructions on the lesser included offense to robbery of theft by force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we are guided by <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, which stands for the proposition that verdicts, in criminal cases, will be sustained where there is evidence upon which a rational trier of fact could conclude that each material element of the offense has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Under this standard of review, the evidence must be viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution. <em>Id:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The elements necessary to establish the offense of robbery are set forth in R.C. 2911.02, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">\u201cNo person, in attempting or committing a theft offense, as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised code, or in fleeing immediately after such attempt or offense, shall use or threaten the immediate use of force against another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">The elements necessary to establish the offense of aggravated robbery are outlined in R.C. 2911.01(A), as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">\u201cNo person, in attempting or committing a theft offense, as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, or in fleeing immediately after such attempt or offense, shall do either of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b462-13\">\u201c(1) Have a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance, as defined in section 2923.11 of the Revised Code, on or about his person or under his control;</p>\n<p id=\"b462-14\">\u201c(2) Inflict, or attempt to inflict serious physical harm on another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-15\">The jury found appellant guilty of R.C. 2911.02 and 2911.01(A)(1). Appellant alleges that his conviction must be reversed because there was no testimony regarding whether the victims perceived a threat, and because there was no evidence regarding the operability of the gun. On this basis, appellant claims the state failed to prove that appellant threatened the immediate use of force against the victims for purposes of establishing the offense of robbery, and further failed to prove that a deadly weapon was involved for purposes of establishing aggravated robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-16\">After a careful review, we find that the record contains sufficient facts upon which a rational trier of fact could conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant committed every element of the crimes charged in the indictment. The evidence clearly indicates that appellant pointed a gun at the victims, cocked the gun, and then pointed the gun at one of the victim\u2019s throat, all in an attempt to commit a theft offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Although the crime of aggravated robbery may be established without proving operability of the gun (see <em>State v. Vondenberg </em>[1980], 61 Ohio St.2d 285, 15 O.O.3d 349, 401 N.E.2d 437), the facts here permit the jury to infer that the gun was not only a deadly weapon under R.C. 2911.01(A), but also a deadly weapon capable of firing a projectile for purposes of the firearm penalty enhancement specification under R.C. 2929.71. One of the victims testified that she was familiar with the gun and that it was, in fact, a firearm. She described it in detail, and she had no doubt it was a real gun because she heard it click when appellant cocked it. From the totality of the circumstances, the pointing of the gun at the victims, the description of the gun from eyewitnesses, and appellant\u2019s demand for the gold necklace while aiming the gun at the victim\u2019s neck, the evidence is sufficient to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant possessed a firearm. <em>State v. Murphy </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 206, 208, 551 N.E.2d 932, 934-935. \u201cFirearms\u201d are, by definition, deadly weapons. R.C. 2923.11(B)(1). See, also, <em>State v. Marshall </em>(1978), 61 Ohio App.2d 84, 86, 15 O.O.3d 93, 94, 399 N.E.2d 112, 113. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s conviction for aggravated robbery, \u2022with a firearm specification, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The evidence also supports a finding of \u201cthreat of immediate use of force\u201d for purposes of establishing the offense of robbery. After the victims told appellant that they did not have any gold, appellant cocked the gun, pointed it at one of the victim\u2019s neck and demanded her necklace. Noise and commotion in the dormitory interrupted the confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Evidence of whether the victims actually perceived a threat is not necessary. Evaluation of the nature of a threat is subject to an objective, not subjective, test. <em>State v. Davis </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 91, 94, 6 OBR 131, 132-133, 451 N.E.2d 772, 774-775. We find the evidence amply supports the objective test.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">As there is evidence to support each and every element of the offenses, the conviction will not be disturbed upon appeal. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">In his second assignment of error, appellant takes issue with the trial court\u2019s failure to charge on the offense of theft by threat, a lesser included offense of robbery. The summary distinction between theft by threat and robbery is that robbery requires a threat of immediate force, while theft by threat only requires a threat of future harm. <em>Davis. </em>Although the victims refused to give appellant their \u201cgold\u201d and eventually ran away, this does not imply that the threat was not of immediate force. Appellant cocked the gun before pointing it at the victim\u2019s neck. It was the victims\u2019 denial which prompted appellant to act more forcefully by pointing the gun to the victim\u2019s neck and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>demanding her necklace. Noise or other commotion interrupted the confrontation and allowed the victims to escape and appellant to \u201cpeacefully bow out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Entitlement to an instruction bn theft by threat requires evidence which reasonably supports both an acquittal on the robbery charge and a conviction on the lesser charge of theft by threat. <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 213, 533 N.E.2d 286. The facts, in evidence here, simply do not meet this test. As noted above, the evidence does not support an acquittal on the robbery charge. Further, theft by threat under R.C. 2913.02(A)(4) requires proof that appellant \u201cknowingly obtain or exert control over either the property or the services\u201d of another. Appellant never obtained or exerted control over the gold. Appellant, therefore, was not entitled to an instruction on the lesser offense of theft by threat. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Appellant\u2019s assignments of error are overruled, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b464-7\">John C.
