BURRELL, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeoR\">OPINION AUTHOR</p>\n<p id=\"b407-29\">This consolidated opinion addresses four separate appeals stemming from summary judgments granted in a lawsuit filed in 2011 to quiet title to real estate located in the Branson Landing subdivision (\u201cthe 2011 case\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appeals are brought by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Defendants Douglas L. Coverdell (\u201cCover-dell\u201d) and Coverdell Enterprises, Inc. (\u201cCEI\u201d) (collectively, \u201cAppellants\u201d), and these appeals are related to two other appeals brought by Appellants arising out of another lawsuit filed in 2003 (\u201cthe 2003 case\u201d). That case also involved land located in the Branson Landing subdivision, and our opinion deciding those consolidated appeals is being issued this-same date. <em>See Empire District Electric Company v. Coverdell, </em>484 S.W.3d 1 (Mo.App.S.D. 2015) <em>(\u201cEmpire II\u2019).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We hold in <em>Empire II </em>that the trial court committed prejudicial error when it dismissed with prejudice Coverdell\u2019s adverse possession claim in the 2003 case. As a result, that opinion reverses three summary judgments and remands the case for further proceedings consistent with the opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">We also reverse three summary\u2018judgments entered in this case, but we do so for a different reason. The reason the summary judgments entered in the instant case must be reversed is that this case should not have proceeded while the 2003 case remained unresolved. We therefore remand the matter with a direction that the trial court stay these proceedings pending a final resolution of the 2003 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Overview of Claims and Challenged Judgments</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Plaintiffs Arvest Bank (\u201cArvest\u201d) and U.S. Bank (collectively, \u201cLienholders\u201d); Defendants HCW Development Company, LLC (\u201cHCW Development\u201d), HCW Private Development, LLC (\u201cHCW Private\u201d), and HCW North, LLC (\u201cHCW North\u201d and these defendants, collectively, \u201cHCW Entities\u201d); and two intervenors, the City of Branson (\u201cBranson\u201d) and the Empire District Electric Company (\u201cEmpire\u201d), have all filed briefs and will be referred to collectively as \u201cRespondents.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Lienholders filed this case after the 2010 judgment was entered in the 2003 case and while the appeal of that judgment was pending before this court. <em>See Empire I, </em>344 S.W.3d at 844. After multiple amendments had been made to the petition in the instant case, U.S. Bank ultimately sought to quiet title, based upon deeds or, alternatively, adverse possession, in Branson as to Lots 1 and 4 and in Empire as to Lots 3 and 6.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> U.S. Bank also sought declarations, <em>inter alia, </em>that: (1) the lease by Branson as to Lot 6 .and the sublease by. HCW Private as to land we will refer to as \u201cRetail Tract\u201d were valid;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (2) U.S. Bank possessed \u201ca valid leasehold deed of trust\u201d with \u201ca first lien position\u201d encumbering Retail Tract; and (3), Appellants had no rights to \u201cany part of Lots 1, 3, 4 or 6[.j\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> U.S. Bank alleged that its deed of trust (\u201cU.S. Bank deed of trust\u201d) encumbering Retail Tract was used to secure a $90,000,000 indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Arvest\u2019s claim, based upon a chain of deeds, sought to have title quieted in Branson as to Lot 1 and in Empire as to Lot 6. It also sought declarations, <em>inter alia, </em>that: (1) Branson had a valid lease of Lot 6; (2) HCW Private had a valid sublease as to Retail Tract, (3) HCW North had valid leases as to two tracts in Lot 1 that we will refer tu as \u201cNorthwest Tracts\u201d; (4) Arvest had a valid first lien as to Northwest Tracts; and (5) Appellants had no right to \u201cany part of Lots 1 and 6[.]\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Arvest asserted in its statement of uncontroverted facts that Arvest\u2019s deed \"of trust (\u201cArvest deed of trust\u201d) encumbering Northwest Tracts was executed to secure a debt \u201cin the maximum amount of $3,956,-250.00[.]\u201d -</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">Branson\u2019s cross-claim sought to quiet title in itself as to all of Lots 1 and 4, and in Empire as to all of Lots 2, 3, and 6 based upon deeds, or alternatively, adverse possession. Branson also sought a decree, <em>inter alia, </em>that Appellants \u201chave no right, title or interest in and to or right of possession to any of the Braiiso\u00f1 Landing[.]\u201d HCW Entities and Empire answered Lien-holders\u2019 claims, but they made no additional, specific claims for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">Appellants asserted \u201cCLAIMS AGAINST PLAINTIFF AND OTHER DEFENDANTS\u201d as a part of their response to U.S. Bank\u2019s amended petition. These claims sought to quiet title in Appellants as to \u201cProperty A and Property B\u201d based upon a chain of deeds, and, in the alternative, to quiet title \u2019to these same properties in Coverdell based upon ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>verse possession (the alternative claim will hereinafter be referred to as \u201cAppellants\u2019 claim\u201d). Appellants also sought a declaration, <em>inter alia, </em>that Empire, Branson, and Lienholders had no rights , in Property A and Property B. We observe \u2014 -without so holding \u2014 that. Property A .may overlap part of the peninsula and an area south of the peninsula in Branson Landing, and Property B appears to be a smaller portion of Property A, which Coverdell allegedly conveyed to CEI.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The instant appeals challenge the following three judgments, which we will collectively refer to as \u201cthe summary judgments\u201d: (1) a June .2013 judgment (\u201cU.S. Bank\u2019s judgment\u201d) certifies as final a September 2012 summary judgment entered in favor of U.S. Bank (\u201cU.S. Bank\u2019s interlocutory judgment\u201d) declaring, <em>inter alia, </em>th\u00e1t: (a) title 'is quieted in Branson as to the parts of Lots 1 and 4, and in Empire as to the parts of Lots 3 and 6, each of which are described in Retail Tract; (b) HCW Private has a valid lease in'Retail Tract; (c) U.S. Bank deed of trust is valid and is the first lien; and (d) Appellants have no \u201cright, title or interest, in and to, or right of possession of\u2019 Retail Tract<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>; (2) .an August 2, 2013 summary judgment on Branson\u2019s motion (\u201cBranson\u2019s judgment\u201d) that, <em>inter alia: </em>(a) quieted title in favor of Branson -as to specific portions of Lot 1 described as \u201cThe Western Peninsula\u201d (\u201cWestern Peninsula\u201d) and \u201cPark Addition!;,]\u201d and in favor of Empire as to specific portions of Lots 2 and 6 described as the \u201cBranson Town Company Tract\u201d (\u201cBran-son Town\u201d); (b) denied any right of Appellants in Lots 1, 2, and 6, or of \u2018Western Peninsula, Park Addition, [Branson Town and] Eastern Peninsula [sic]\u201d; (c) dismissed with prejudice Appellants\u2019 \u201cAmended Claim\u201d for \u201cfail[ure] to state a claim upon which relief can. be granted\u201d; and (d) denied dismissal of the 2011 case<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>; and (3) an August 5, -2013 summary judgment in favor of Arvest (\u201cArvest\u2019s judgment\u201d) that, <em>inter </em>'alia&gt;\u25a0 (a) quieted title in favor of Branson as to Northwest Tracts, and denied any right by Appellants to these parts of Lot 1; and (b) dissolved pertinent notices of lis pendens.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Background Regarding the Claims and Judgments Entered in the 2003 Case After the Remand Ordered in <em>Empire I</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Lienholders successfully intervened in the 2003 case after our remand in <em>Empire I, </em>claiming that they held separate deeds of trust that secured financing for lessees \u2014 $90,000,000 as to U.S, Bank\u2019s interest, and $3,956,250 as to Arvest\u2019s interest. <em>Empipe II </em>at: 4-5. U.S. Bank\u2019s cross-claim sought to quiet title in Branson as \u201cto all of Lots 1 and 4\u201d and in Empire as \u201cto all of Lots 3 and 6[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. It further sought a declaration that Appellants had no right or interest as to \u201cLots l, 3, 4 or 6[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Arvest\u2019s cross-claim against Appellants sought to quiet title in Branson as \u201cto all of Lot 1\u201d and in Empire as to \u201call of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Lot 6[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 8, as well as a declaration that Appellants had no interest in this land.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 8-9. Branson claimed \u201cthat Empire owned Lots 2, 3, and 6; that Bran-son owned Lots 1 and 4; and Bran'son leased the lots owned by Empire.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. Empire claimed ownership of what we refer to as \u201cEastern Peninsula\u201d and \u201cBranson Town[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Appellants\u2019 answers and separate cross-claims sought decrees that Coverdell owned \u201cProperty A\u201d by either deed or adverse possession and that he had. conveyed a portion of that land, identified as \u201cProperty B[,]\u201d to CEI. The legal descriptions used for Properties A and B in the 2003 case and in the instant case appear to be identical. <em>See id. </em>at 11 n. 12, and 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">U.S. Bank then received, a judgment in the 2003 case that did not expressly decree quiet title in. Branson or Empire, but it did conclude that Branson owned a part of Lot 1 and that Empire owned a part of Lot 6, both being in Retail Tract. - <em>Id. </em>at 17-18. We refer to this smaller portion of Retail Tract as \u201cRetail North.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 17. U.S. Bank\u2019s 2003 case judgment declared U.S. Bank\u2019s deed of trust to be a valid, \u201cfirst priority\u201d encumbrance on Retail North, and it denied Appellants any Interest in Retail North. <em>Id. </em>at 18.'</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">. Branson received a judgment in the 2003 case that quieted title in Empire as to the parts of Lot 2 known as Eastern Peninsula and Branson Town, and it quieted title in Branson as to the parts of .Lot 1 known as Western Peninsula and Park Addition.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> M at 18. Branson\u2019s 2003 case judgment denied Appellants any. right or interest in \u201cWestern Peninsula, Eastern Peninsula, Park Addition[, and Branson Town] now known as Lots 1, 2 and 6[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">Arvest received a judgment in the 2003 case that quieted, title in. Branson as to .Northwest Tracts in- Lot 1, declared leases and subleases for HCW Entities valid, and declared Arvest\u2019s deed of trust to be the lien of first priority. <em>Id. </em>at 16-17. Ar-vest\u2019s 2003 case judgment also declared that Appellants had no right or interest in Northwest Tracts. <em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">Additional Procedural History in the Instant Case</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">As in our related <em>Empire II </em>opinion, we again focus on .the procedural history, of this case relevant to Appellants\u2019 points on appeal, including various, claims asserted by the parties.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">After the original petition was served, Appellants moved to dismiss the case in August 2011, based on an assertion that Lienholders lacked standing or, alternatively, that the case be stayed based on litigation involving \u201cthe property\u201d being addressed in the 2003 case (\u201cAppellants\u2019 first dismissal motion\u201d). Appellants\u2019\" motion asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that Lienholders\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>filed the instant case \u201cseeking to quiet title to property that [they] admit is already the subject of another quiet title suit that has been in litigation in this [c]ourt for more than eight years,\u201d and then relied on the principle that a second action may be stayed where a prior pending action would adequately. determine the parties\u2019 rights, citing <em>Brink v. Kansas City, </em>358 Mo. 845, 217 S.W.2d 507, 510 (1949). It does not appear from the docket that Arvest responded to Appellants\u2019 first dismissal motion. U.S. Bank\u2019s position was that it had standing and that the 2003 case would \u201cnot determine [U.S. Bank\u2019s] rights to its property because that case concerns only property against whieh Coverdell has asserted a claim, and it is a different property.\u201d Appellants\u2019 motion was denied in- March 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Later that same month, Appellants filed another motion to dismiss or stay the case (\u201cAppellants\u2019 second dismissal motion\u201d). This motion also cited <em>Brink </em>and added that Lienholders had intervened in the 2003 case. U.S. Bank\u2019s response suggested that in the 2003 case, Appellants claimed \u201cpart of the land encumbered by\u201d the U.S. Bank deed of trust and, in the instant case, U.S. Bank made \u201cclaims concerning parcels in which [Appellants] have no claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Arvest adopted U.S. Bank\u2019s response, and it also filed its own suggestions, adding that the pleadings in the 2003 case only dealt with.\u201cthe eastern half of the peninsula\u201d and that the land in the 2011 case \u201clies entirely in the west half of the peninsula\u201d and south of it. HCW Entities moved to strike Appellants\u2019 second motion to dismiss on the ground that Appellants had not been granted leave to file a second motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">On June 6, 2012, U.S. Bank filed its motion for summary judgment based on Count I of its amended petition addressing Lots 1, 3, 4, and 6; a statement of uncon-troverted facts; and a memorandum of law. At a June 8, 2012 hearing, the trial court informed the parties that the instant case was to be \u201clitigated first\u201d before the 2003 case, and Appellants\u2019 second dismissal motion was treated as having been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">On June 15, 2012, Appellants filed an answer to Arvest\u2019s amended petition that presented no separate counter-claim. On July 26, 2012, Appellants filed a response to U.S. Bank\u2019s summary judgment motion asserting that there was \u201ca genuine issue of material fact[,]\u201d requesting additional time to complete discovery, and including an affidavit of counsel representing Appellants. None of these filings included a response by Appellants to the specifically numbered paragraphs of uncontroverted facts asserted in U.S. Bank\u2019s summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">In August 2012, Appellants filed a response to U.S. Bank\u2019s amended petition that included, <em>inter alia, </em>Appellants\u2019 claim. At a hearing on - September 14, 2012, the trial court sustained Branson\u2019s motion to require Appellants to make their claims more definite and certain, granted Appellants \u201c20 days ,.. to-file sufficient facts[,]\u201d and took U.S. Bank\u2019s summary judgment motion under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">On September 19, 2012, the trial court entered U.S. Bank\u2019s interlocutory judgment that, in addition to making the decrees already summarized, found that \u201cCoverdell\u2019s claims to property south of the base of the Peninsula, as that phrase has been used by the parties, is derived from a <em>quit claim </em>deed from W.F. Hoke and Vera Hoke to [Tori]\u201d that set \u201cout a legal description for more property than the Hokes received from [their predecessors in title]; approximately twenty seven acres more.\u201d The' subsequent deed from Tori to Coverdell was found to \u201calso [describe] more property than [Tori] could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>have held title to.\u201d -The trial court also found that Appellants failed to file a response to U.S. Bank\u2019s summary judgment motion that complied with Rule 74.04. U.S. Bank\u2019s interlocutory judgment did not dispose of all claims in the case, and it was not designated as final even in regard to the claims it did address.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">On October 3, 2012, Appellants filed an \u201cAMENDED CLAIM AGAINST PLAINTIFF AND OTHER DEFENDANTS TO QUIET TITLE AND ADVERSE POSSESSION\u201d that added new factual allegations to Appellants\u2019 claim, but retained Properties A and B as the disputed properties. At the end of October 2012, Bran-son moved for summary judgment on its cross-claim, specifically seeking to quiet title in itself as to Lot 1 and in Empire as to Lots 2 and 6, along with a judgment in Branson\u2019s favor on Appellants\u2019 claim. Branson also filed a statement of specifically numbered uncontroverted facts,, along with suggestions supporting its motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">On November 21, 2012, Arvest filed its motion for summary judgment on Count I of its amended petition concerning Lots 1 and 6, a statement of uncontroverted facts, and supporting suggestions. HCW Entities joined in this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">On January 17, 2013, Coverdell filed motions to strike, or, alternatively, that he be granted additional time to respond to the motions for summary judgment. On this same date, Coverdell moved to set aside U.S. Bank\u2019s interlocutory judgment, or, alternatively, to be granted additional time for conducting discovery and preparing a response to U.S. Bank\u2019s summary judgment motion. On June 14, 2013, Coverdell filed a similar motion that sought yet more time to respond to the summary judgment motions. That same day, Coverdell also moved to dismiss \u201cthe 2011 Case in its entirety, including all parties and claims,\u201d based upon \u201cthe doctrine of mootness[.]\u201d Coverdell argued that \u201cthe parties, issues and subject matter are identical in the 2003 and 2011 Cases and the 2003 Case has already been fully resolved by virtue of the May' 29, 2013 hearing and the Orders subsequently \u2022 entered, making any subsequent ruling by this Court unnecessary, ineffectual and duplicative!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-11\">On June 21, 2013, Coverdell filed responses to the summary judgment motions that, included responses to the uncontro-verted facts set forth in those motions. During a hearing that took place that same day, the trial court heard argument from the parties concerning U.S. Bank\u2019s motion to certify its interlocutory' judgment as final, the motions for summary judgment filed by Branson and Arvest, and Cover-dell\u2019s assertion that \u201c[p]art of\u2019 the property he. claimed had been acquired by the Hokes through adverse possession. U.S. Bank\u2019s judgment certifying its interlocutory judgment as final was entered by the trial court later that day, and Appellants timely filed separate notices of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">Thereafter, Branson\u2019s and Arrest\u2019s judgments were also entered, and they contained the decrees as described above. Appellants timely filed separate notices of appeal as to these additional judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">\n<em>CEFs Point on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">CEI\u2019s sole point contends that \u201cany judgment\u201d in the 2011 case favoring Respondents was \u201cvoid\u201d because \u201cthe trial Court lacked authority and jurisdiction to decide this matter in that Empire, Bran-son, HCW, U.S. Bank and Arvest lacked standing as parties in. this case[.]\u201d The point is nearly identical to the one it presented in its appeal of the 2003 case. Except for record- citations, CEI\u2019s argument supporting its point in this appeal is also essentially the same as its argument in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>2003 case appeal, including its attempt to incorporate .Coverdell\u2019s \u2022 arguments. The similarity, extends even to a description of \u201cthe instant case\u201d as one where \u201cboth Branson and . Empire dismissed their claims .after evidence had been introduced at trial and without seeking leave of court.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We deny CEI\u2019s point here for the same reason it was denied in <em>Empire II </em>\u2014 the supporting argument fails to present an understandable explanation of or test for standing supported by citations to authority that are linked to claimed deficiencies on the part of Respondents.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\">\n<em>A Summary Disposition of Four of Cover-dell\u2019s Points on Appeal Based on Our . Analysis of Similar Arguments'Addressed in Empire II \u25a0</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Coverdell presents six points.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Points I and II contend -the trial court erred in granting summary judgments in favor of U.S. Bank and Arvest as the Lienholders had \u201cno interest ... sufficient to permit [them] to bring a quiet title action under [section] 527.150.\u201d In the 2003 case, Coverdell unsuccessfully challenged standing by Lienholders via an appellate motion that attacked the sufficiency of Lienholders\u2019 own interests and ineffectively lumped them-in with Empire and Branson. <em>Empire II </em>at 20-24. His standing challenges against. Lienholders are brought in a different manner here. In this appeal, the challenge is presented in a point relied on (Point I as to U.S. Bank and Point II as to Arvest), and both points assert a theory applicable solely to Lien-holders \u2014 that a lien against land is not a sufficient interest for a quiet title action under section 527.150. Despite this procedural improvement, the underlying nature of Lienholders\u2019 claims in both cases is the same, and our analysis of standing for purposes of section 527.150.1 also remains the same. For the reasons set forth in <em>Empire II, </em>we also hold here that section 527.150.1 permits a party claiming an interest in real property based upon a deed of trust to institute an action under section 527.150.1 against another party who also claims an interest'in the real property.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 21-24. Points I and II are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Points IV and V assert the trial court erred \u25a0 in dismissing Coverdell\u2019s adverse possession claim (on two separate occasions) because he had sufficiently pleaded such a claim. Coverdell successfully asserted a similar theory in <em>Empire II, </em>but we do not review the merits of the similar points brought here because they are rendered moot by our partial grant of Cover-dell\u2019s Point III, <em>infra. </em>For ease of analysis, we will address that particular point after we take up Coverdell\u2019s sixth point.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\"><em>Point VI </em>\u2014 Indispensable <em>Party</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Coverdell\u2019s sixth point contends the trial court did not have authority to enter the summary judgments because it denied an \u201cindispensable party\u2019s express attempt to intervene.\u201d Some of the briefing on this point is similar to that presented in support of Coverdell\u2019s comparable point in <em>Empire II </em>that claimed' the trial court lacked authority to decide the case when it denied intervention to an indispensable party. Once again, the point brought here fails to specify the alleged indispensable party. In <em>Empire II, </em>Coverdell argued that Branson Label had received \u201c \u2018a deed to the subject property\u2019 \u201d before 1998, but he did not contend that Branson Label had any present claim to the subject property. <em>Id. </em>at 28. A new twist added to his argument in this appeal is that the trial court was \u201cexpressly requested to permit Bran-son Label\u2019s intervention and under a mandatory duty, to order that it be made a party by the Rules, [but] no such, action was taken by the trial-court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">Arvest and Empire respond that the point is not preserved because the notice of appeal did not include an order denying Branson Label the opportunity to intervene. Indeed, Coverdell cites no such order in his brief. Coverdell replies that \u201cthe absence of a necessary and indispensable party on appeal \u2014 is jurisdictional. It may be raised at any time.\u201d. In addition to our skepticism about this claim in light of our supreme court\u2019s more recent view of what is beyond a trial court\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d <em>see J.C.W. ex rel. Webb v. Wyciskall</em>a, 275 S.W.3d 249, 251-54 (Mo. banc 2009), the authority Coverdell cites as supporting this claim, <em>Brown v. Greene Cnty., Mo., </em>677 S.W.2d 432 (Mo.App.S.D.1984), is inapposite. <em>Brown </em>stated that the <em>\u201cfailure to. state ,a claim </em>is jurisdictional ... [and] ... may be raised for the first time on appeal[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433-34 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">But all of these arguments fail to address the more basic, underlying problem: Coverdell\u2019s failure to include material in the record on appeal demonstrating Bran-son Label\u2019s effort to intervene. Coverdell cites a \u201cMOTION\u201d purportedly filed by Mr. Rea, <em>pro se, </em>on March' 9, 2012 as \u201can American and an Individual Missourian and a Taney [Countian] and a Taxpayer o[f] Branson, Missouri[,]\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Coverdell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>also represents that \u201cBranson Label\u2019s claim to title to the subject property\u201d is shown by two lawsuits documented in Gov-erdell\u2019s appendix. The referenced appendix contains purported copies of a complaint filed on behalf of Branson Label against Branson, Empire, and the HCW Entities in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri on May' 13, 2014, plus a complaint filed in the same court the next day on behalf of Branson Label against seven companies not parties to the instant case;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">As Branson and U.S. Bank point out, the copies of the materials Coverdell relies on are not in the legal file. The docket entry included in the record that concerns Mr. Rea\u2019s March 2012 motion simply notes without further detail that it was filed.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Andj as would be expected, the docket entries include nothing about lawsuits filed in federal court approximately nin\u00e9 months after the summary judgments' were entered. Coverdell\u2019s reply brief fails to cite the legal file for any other material in the record documenting an effort by Branson Label to intervene or a current claim by it to the property at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Rule 84.04(h) provides that in addition to particular matters specified in subsections (1) \u2014 (3), \u201c[a]n appendix also may set forth matters pertinent to- the issues discussed in the brief such as copies of exhibits, excerpts from the written record, and copies of new cases or other pertinent authorities.\u201d It does not provide that documents not a part of the record on appeal (apart from applicable legal authority) may be included in the appendix. \u201cThe mere inclusion of documents in an appendix to a brief does not make them part of the record on appeal.\u201d <em>J &amp; M Sec., LLC v. Brown, </em>388 S.W.3d 566, 570-71 (Mo.App.E.D.2012). Rule 81.12(a) provides that \u201c[t]he record On appeal shall contain all of the record, proceedings and evidence necessary to the determination of all questions to be presented, by either appellant or respondent, to the appellate court for decision.\u201d The legal file is to \u201ccontain clearly reproduced exact copies of the pleadings and other portions of the trial record previously reduced to written form,\u201d. Rule 81.12(a). Further, it is the duty of the appellant to prepare the legal file by ordering the necessary documents from the clerk, copies of which are then certified by the clerk of the trial court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Rule 81.12(c). We do not consider materials that are not a part of the record.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>J &amp; M Sec., </em>388 S.W.3d at 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">As a result of the omission, Coverdell fails to even demonstrate that \u201cBranson Label\u2019s intervention\u201d was sought, much less that Branson Label was a necessary party. Based upon the same reasoning articulated in <em>Empire II </em>at 28-29, we cannot find on this record that Branson Landing is an indispensable party under Rule 52.04(b). Coverdell\u2019s Point VI is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\"><em>Point III- </em>\u2014 Abatement <em>Doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Coverdell contends in his third point that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWk\">the trial court erred in denying Cover-dell\u2019s timely filed motion to dismiss because this action was duplicative of and later filed than the 2003 case ... in that Rule 55.27(a)(9) requires a trial court to dismiss an action where there is <em>&amp; </em>previously filed action involving the same parties and the same res.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">The argument that follows the point, however, broadens what options Coverdell asserts were available to the trial court under such circumstances, maintaining that.it \u201cwas required to dismiss, consolidate or stay further proceedings until the [2003 case] was fully and finally resolved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">\u201cThe granting or refusing of a stay of proceedings rests in the trial court\u2019s discretion, the exercise of which will not be disturbed on appeal unless clearly abused.\u201d <em>Green v. Miller, </em>851 S.W.2d 553, 556 (Mo.App.W.D.1993). \u201cStay, of proceedings is not a matter of right but involves the exercise of some discretion by the trial court' as to granting and as to duration; but it would be an abuse of discretion to refuse a stay properly required by the circumstances.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Great Am. Ins. Co. v. Jones, </em>396 S.W.2d 601, 605 (Mo. banc 1965), Our review of the denial of a motion to dismiss, \u201cas part of the .appeal from a final judgment[,]\u201d is also for abuse of discretion.. <em>In re O.J.B., </em>436 S.W.3d 726, 729 (Mo.App.W.D.2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">We don\u2019t blame Coverdell for hedging a bit in his brief on the appropriate relief available on this \u201cpreviously filed action\u201d claim because the existing case law on the subject is not exactly a model of clarity and consistency, as illustrated by the . following selection of statements from a few of those cases. \u201cAbatement, also known as the \u2018pending action doctrine,\u2019 holds that where a claim involves the same subject matter and parties as a previously filed action so that the sam\u00e9 facts and issues are presented, resolution should occur through the prior action and the second suit should be dismissed.\u201d <em>HTH Cos., Inc. v. Mo. Dept. of Labor &amp; Indus. Relations, </em>154 S.W.3d 358, 361 (Mo.App.E.D.2004). The \u201cpendency of a prior action is not ground for dismissal with prejudice, but ground only to stay' or abate the later action.\u201d <em>Hubbard v. Mercantile Bank of Kansas City, </em>773 S.W.2d 517, 519 (Mo.App.W.D.1989) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">In <em>Hubbard, </em>the western district of this court did not actually reach the' question of whether the case \u201cshould be stayed or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>abated[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 519; it simply reversed what was deemed a- dismissal with prejudice in light of another pending suit. <em>Id. </em>at 518-19. Nonetheless, we find its following discussion on abatement persuasive: \u201cA 'plea in abatement is essentially a 'request, not that an action be terminated, but that it be continued until such time as there has been a disposition of the first action or that allowance of this defense be equivalent to a dismissal without prejudice of the abated action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 519 n. 1; <em>Cf. Ryan v. Campbell Sixty-Six Express, </em>276 S.W.2d 128, 130-31 (Mo. banc 1955) (generally, it is proper to \u201cdismiss a second suit where a prior suit is pending \u215b another court involving the same parties and the same subject matter[,]\u201d but there are exceptions, and it was not an abuse of discretion to' stay an initial suit pending the resolution of a second case involving the same' dispute filed in another county); <em>Brink, </em>217 S.W.2d at 510 (the prevailing rule in Missouri is that \u201c[w]here two actions are pending, and a decision in the prior one will adequately determine the rights of the parties, the second action may be stayed until the first is determined\u201d) (internal quotation omitted). In the appropriate case, a stay may effectively serve abatement\u2019s \u201ctwin goals of avoiding wasteful duplication and inconsistent judgments.\u201d <em>Kelly v. Kelly, </em>245 S.W.3d 308, 314 (Mo.App.W.D.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Respondents lodge several waiver arguments against Point III that are ineffective. HCW Entities maintain that \u201cCover-dell did not assert the pending action in his responsive pleading, waiting until he obtained an adverse ruling before seeking to stay the [instant case].\u201d Arvest,. U.S. Bank, Branson, and Empire argue that the motion Coverdell relies on in his brief should not be considered on appeal because it was not filed and presented to the trial court. Empire further argues that Coverdell waived any argument that he was entitled to relief based on Rule 55.27(a)(9) because Appellants\u2019 first and second dismissal motions did not seek dismissal under this rule; it simply sought dismissal for lack of standing and a stay based on the existence of the 2003 case.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">As previously discussed, we do , not consider material that is not included in the record on appeal. <em>J &amp; M Sec., </em>388 S.W.3d at 571. The citation in Coverdell\u2019s brief to the motion to dismiss he relies on is to the <em>\u201cMOTION TO DISMISS\u201d </em>set forth in the appendix to Coverdell\u2019s brief, and the-appendix index suggests that the purported pleading was filed on -February- 22, 2013, but there is no citation to-the legal file, and the- motion does not appear in the -table of contents for the voluminous legal file.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>While Coverdell adds confusion to an already complicated legal record by failing to include in the legal file a file-stamped copy of the pleading he relies on in his brief (if in fact such a pleading was filed), we do not agree that the abatement issue was not presented to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">Appellants\u2019 first and second dismissal motions asserted that the instant case should not go forward because these same issues were being litigated in the 2003 case. It was not necessary for these motions to expressly rely on Rule 55.27(a)(9) in order to present the abatement issue to the trial court. <em>Cf. Blue Ridge Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. </em>Hart, 152 S.W.3d 420, 425 (Mo.App.W.D.2005) (\u201c[r]efusing to -consider the allegations of a motion solely because the motion fails to cite the. specific rule under which it is authorized,.however, exalts form over substance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Respondents also argue that abatement simply does not apply because the parties in the two suits are different \u2014 HCW Entities are not parties. to the 2003 case. Branson quotes the statement in <em>Kelly, </em>245 S.W.3d at 314, that \u201c[t]he abatement doctrine technically does not apply unless the issues are the same, and the alignment and identity of the parties is identical!,]\u201d but Branson, overlooks the case\u2019s comparison to <em>State ex rel. City of Springfield v. </em>Conley, 760 S.W.2d'948, 950 (Mo.App.W.D.1988), suggesting that the rule is flexible enough to apply in some cases where the parties are reversed. <em>Id. </em>Indeed, as our high court has noted, \u201cabatement is manifestly appropriate even though the parties are reversed in the situation in which the second cause of action is essentially identical to the first action filed.\u201d <em>State ex rel. J.E. Dunn, Jr. &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. Schoenlaub, </em>668 S.W.2d 72, 75 (Mo. banc 1984). Moreover, \u201c[e]xtraneous parties to the action do not preclude dismissal when determining if there is sufficient commonality to warrant abatement.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Dunger v. Mummert, </em>871 S.W,2d 609, 610 (Mo.App.E.D.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Another argument made in opposition to Coverdell\u2019s Point III is that- abatement does not apply because the subject matter of the two cases is nob identical. One argument in this vein is an insistence that \u201cthe pleadings of the 2003 case did not involve land at issue in the .[instant] case until being amended <em>after </em>the [instant] case was filed[.]\u201d This position ignores' the claims Appellants had asserted before the 20\u00cd0 judgment that they had title in fee simple absolute to the \u201cdisputed\u201d property and that their broad\u2019legal description in the d\u00e9ed to Tori was 'already a part of the 2003 case when it was first appealed in <em>Empire I, </em>344 S.W.3d at 848. Indeed, while we found in <em>Empir\u00e9: I </em>that Appellants\u2019 counsel had made judicial admissions at trial that were inconsistent with the 2010 judgment, we did not prohibit Appellants from.going.forward on,its claims to the \u201cdisputed\u201d property in the 2003 case. <em>Id. </em>at 852 and 853.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">U.S. Bank insists in its brief, that the instant case \u201cwas filed by [Lienholders] to protect their fee interest in the <em>entirety </em>of the Branson Landing Retail Property[,]\u201d and the summary judgment in its favor in the 2003 case only addressed part of that land. Similarly, Branson argues, that \u201c[i]t may be the case that [Appellants] claimed the same property in both cases, but [Lienholders] claimed more and different property [in the instant case] than was at issue [in the 2003 case].\u201d Thus, the argument is that the two cases may overlap, but the claims in them do not absolutely mirror one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">The overlap is significant, and identical claims are made in the 2003 and in this case. For instance, in this case, U.S. Bank sought to quiet title in Branson and Empire as to Lots 1, 3, 4 and 6 and to obtain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>declaration of the validity of its deed of trust securing the $90,000,000 debt. In the 2003 case, U.S. Bank\u2019s motion to intervene referenced the $90 million debt, and its counterclaim and cross-claim also sought to quiet title in Branson and Empire as to Lots 1, 3, 4, and 6, with its own deed of trust declared valid. In both cases, U.S. Bank sought a declaration that Appellants have no rights to <em>\u201cany part </em>of Lots 1, 3, 4 or 6[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) In both cases, Coverdell claimed ownership of Properties A and B by adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">\u201cIn order for the abatement doctrine to apply, the object, purpose and principles of law raised in the two actions must be the same.\u201d <em>Meyer v. Meyer, </em>21 S.W.3d 886, 890 (Mo.App.E.D.2000) (where it was held that an action for declaratory judgment filed by brothers in circuit court was sufficiently similar to a petition to take against a will filed by the surviving spouse in the probate division). However, abatement may apply to the duplicated claims even if all claims in the two cases do not match. <em>See State ex rel. City of Springfield, Through Bd. of Pub. Utils. v. Conley, </em>760 S.W.2d 948, 951 (Mo.App.W.D.1988) (in which a writ of prohibition directed that no further action be taken regarding a counterclaim that sought \u201ca parallel adjudication of a question already in litigation in\u201d a suit between the same parties in a different county).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Empire optimistically argues that \u201c[w]ith final judgments having been entered in both the 2003 case and the [instant] case, the risk of any \u2018unseemly clashes[J <em>[State ex rel. Coffield v. Buckner, </em>198 Mo.App. 230, 200 S.W. 94, 96 (1917),] is moot.\u201d Yet, even while the legal descriptions relied on by Appellants and the other parties in both cases make identifying the exact ground they are referring to like comparing apples to oranges, there was nonetheless significant overlap in claims asserted in the two cases. Added to that is the significant clash that now exists between the summary judgments here decreeing that Appellants have no rights or interest in Lots 1, 2 and 6 or parts of Lots 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 including Retail Tract, Northwest Tracts, Western Peninsula, Eastern Peninsula, Park Addition, and Branson Town, and the judgments in <em>Empire II </em>denying Coverdell any right or interest in parts of Lots 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 known as Retail North (appearing to be part of Retail Tract), Northwest Tracts, Western Peninsula, Eastern Peninsula, Park Addition, and Branson Town that are now reversed. <em>Id. </em>at 5 and 16-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">We therefore grant Coverdell\u2019s Point III to the extent that it asserts the trial court erred in refusing to enter a stay in the instant case. The summary judgments are reversed, and the trial court is directed to stay any further action in this case pending a final resolution of the 2003 case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b420-8\">MARY W.

Arvest\u2019s amended petition purports to be on behalf of both plaintiffs, but at the February 2012 hearing, where leave was granted for its filing, counsel for U.S. Bank stated that it \"was filed before [U.S. Bank\u2019s] substitution of counsel.

We will nonetheless use the same labels as those' 'used by the parties for parcels that appear similar.

There was no trial in the 2011 case. As support for its latter assertion, CEI refers to purported dismissals filed by Branson and Empire in the 2003 case; no such dismissals were filed in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b414-6\">. There are multiple motions before us to dismiss CEI\u2019s appeal based upon violations of Rules 81.12 and 84.04(c) and an allegation that CEI' is not an aggrieved party under section 512.020. However meritorious these motions might be, we may efficiently analyze CEI\u2019s point.given that it parallels a point we have already decided in the related appeal. Therefore, in the interest of judicial economy, we deny these motions as moot rather then \u00e9mbark upon an extended analysis of issues related to the .legal file and CEI\u2019s briefing. <em>Cf. Estate of Bernskoetter, </em>693 S.W,2d 249, 251 (Mo.App.W.D.1985) (in the interest of judicial economy, the court decided the appeal on the merits rather than procedural error). All rule references are to Missouri Court Rules (2015). All statutory references are to RSMo 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b414-9\">. There are also multiple motions to dismiss Coverdell's appeal based upon violations of Rules 81.12 and 84.04(c) and (d). We exercise our discretion against dismissing Cover-dell\u2019s appeal based upon the errors asserted in these motions as we do not find that the problems related to these rule violations impair our ability to ascertain the errors asserted by Coverdell. <em>Cf. Comp &amp; Soft, Inc. v. AT &amp; T Corp., </em>252 S.W.3d 189, 194 (Mo.App.E.D.2008) (despite shortcomings in the brief, the court could \u201cascertain the gist\" of the appellant\u2019s arguments and the court prefers to reach the merits when possible). That being said, we do note that significant failures by Coverdell to comply with the requirements of Rule 81.12, contributed significantly to our denial of Point VI, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b414-10\">. As in <em>Empire II, </em>Coverdell also argued that Rule 52.01 had not been satisfied. As in that case, we do not review the specific require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>ments of this rule because the argument was not included in a point relied on. <em>Id. </em>at 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b415-8\">. <em>Cf. A.D.D. v. PLB Enters., Inc., </em>412 S.W.3d 270, 277 (Mo.App.W.D.2013) (\"after <em>J.C.W. ex rel.

The purported motion states that its purpose is to cause fee trial court \"to understand that the real property known as Branson Landing is indeed owned in part by this individual Movant.\u201d He goes on to add feat \"as the owkr [sic] of lands known as fee Branson Landing, and Lands once owned by [Branson Label] and Lillian E.

It does not- explain any relationship between Mr. Rea and Branson Label. . The prayer seeks \"leave to amend all of the pleadings filed in this cause and to add additional parties[,]\u201d but it does not specifically request that Branson Label be made a party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b416-7\">. In support of Point VI, Coverdell does not argue any Significance to Branson Label being included in the description provided for \"John Doe and Jane Doe\u201d as possible defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b416-8\">. Two other docket entries reference \"A Derivative Action by [Mr.] Rea, A Shareholder of [Branson Label] and Branson Paper Inc. and [Tori],\u201d as being filed on two separate dates in April 2012, but these pleadings are not ' . included in the legal file. No other docket entri\u00e9s were found referencing Branson Label. According to additional docket entries, Mr. Rea filed various other pleadings and correspondence before the trial court, but copies of such materials are not identified in the table of contents for the legal file, and Coverdell does not refer to them in either Point VI or the argument that follows it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b417-10\">. Even if Mr. Rea\u2019s motion was included in the record, Empire and HCW Entities are correct that the document included in the appendix does, not demonstrate that Branson Label actually attempted to intervene or that anyone specifically asked for leave to bring it into the lawsuit. And, as HCW Entities and U.S. Bank point out, the lawsuits purportedly filed elsewhere after the summary judgments in this case were entered do nothing to establish that relevant claims by Branson Label were timely presented to the trial court. <em>Cf. Ozark Mountain Timber Prods., Inc. v. Redus, </em>725 S.W,2d 640, 645 (Mo.App.S.D.1987) (the trial court will not be convicted, pf error on an issue it was not asked to decide).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b418-4\">. Respondents do not challenge the timeliness of Appellants\u2019 motion, and it does not appear that U.S. Bank raised timeliness in its response to Appellants\u2019 motion. <em>Cf. Kelly, </em>245 S.W.3d at 314 (suggesting that the abatement doctrine may be addressed by a court ' <em>sua sponte, </em>especially since a trial court has discretionary power to stay a matter because another action is pending).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b418-6\">. .Further, a pleading filed by the attorney identified in the purported' pleading at or near the time referenced in its certificate of service is not specifically referenced in the docket entries. The purported \u25a0 pleading shows a signature by one- of Coverdell\u2019s attorneys, Robert Cockerham. The closest docket entry suggesting any similarity to the pleading in Coverdell\u2019s appendix is a docket entry from February 25, 2013 reflecting the filing of a \"Motion to Dismiss\u201d but it is stated as being filed by another lawyer, Charles S. Genisio. However,' <em>\"U.S. BANK\u2019S SUGGESTIONS IN OPPOSITION TO [COVERDELL\u2019S and CEI\u2019S] MOTIONS TO DISMISS\" </em>filed on February 28, 2013 is in the legal file and it states that Appellants \u201cseparately argue, in nearly identical motions, that the doctrine abatement [sic] requires the dismissal of the entire 2011 [c]ase ,. on the basis that the earlier-filed 2003 [cjase ... involves ... many of the same parties and claims,\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
