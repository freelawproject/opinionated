The petitioner prayed for instructions as to his duty in the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-5\">The answer averred that the tax in question was the annual state, county and town tax for 1860, and was not in fact assessed till after the death of Mercy Pease, and ought to be apportioned between her estate and the remainder man. The judge of probate ordered the whole amount of the tax to be deducted from the income in the hands of the petitioner; and the respondents appealed to this court. It was agreed that Abner Pease in his lifetime paid the taxes assessed upon his estate in 1852, and that the facts stated in the petition and answer are true; and the case was reserved by Chapman, J. for the determination of the whole court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b255-6\"><em>T.

But this position is, we think, untenable. The period of time fixed in reference to ownership as to taxation is the 1st of May in each year. The liability of an individual to be taxed for any specific property is decided by the relation he bears to it a* that precise day; and whether he may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>have become the owner on the day previous, or ceased to ba such owner the day succeeding, is wholly immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">This tax being assessed upon the property as it existed on the 1st of May, if it was a charge upon Mercy Pease, as the party for whose use and benefit the property was held on that day, the subsequent event of her death on the 33d of May did not discharge that liability. Consequently the income of Mercy Pease, who it is admitted was the person then enjoying the estate, and for whose benefit the estate was held by the executor, is properly chargeable with the whole of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">We see nothing in the act of 1848, <em>c. </em>310, \u00a7 3, (Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>97, \u00a7 34,) providing for apportionment of an annuity or income where a person dies within the year, that can affect the question of this tax, and upon whose estate or income it is chargeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The result is, that the judgment of the probate court, ordering that the amount of this tax be deducted from the amount of funds in the hands of the executor, due to the estate of Mercy Pease, and the balance only be paid to her administrators, is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
