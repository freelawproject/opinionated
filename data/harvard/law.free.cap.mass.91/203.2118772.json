Potter,\u201d on the road leading from Westport Point to the town-house in said town, and in allowing <em>\u201c </em>to-Tripp \u201d the sum of twenty-five dollars for land of his which was taken for the purpose, and ordering the petitioners to pay the same to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-12\">After adjudicating that the highway was a matter of common convenience and necessity, the county commissioners gave notice that they would meet at a certain place on the 31st day of July 1862, and proceed to lay out the highway and appraise the damages. On that day they met, and all parties interested were heard; and on the 8th of the following September, without any new notice, they laid out the highway, and allowed damages to Tripp, and ordered the same to be paid, as set forth in the petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b211-13\">Upon these facts, the case was reserved by <em>Chapman, </em>J. for the determination of the whole court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b211-14\"><em>T. M. Stetson, </em>for the petitioners,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASu\">cited, to the point that the petition was too indefinite to sustain the proceedings, <em>Pembroke </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, </em>12 Cush. 356; <em>Danvers </em>v. <em>County Commissioners, </em>2 Met. 189, <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Rome, 2 </em>Greenl. 55,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b211-15\"><em>C.

We do not think there was any such indefiniteness in the bounds of the road prayed for in the petition, as would require that the proceedings should be quashed. The object of a precise description is to give substantial notice of what is asked and intended to all persons and corporations in-<em>1 </em>crested. There is nothing in the case to show that this has not been accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">2. The notices required by the statute were both given: one, before the view and adjudication on the question- of common convenience and necessity; and the other, before proceeding to lay out the road. There is nothing in the statute, or in the reason of the thing, to prevent the commissioners from completing the laying out at an adjourned or subsequent meeting, and then entering it of record, the parties in interest having been previously fully heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">3. The commissioners had no authority to order the town of Westport to pay the damages which they assessed ; and a writ of <em>certiorari </em>will issue to correct that part of the record only. When the record is before us, that order will be quashed, and instead of it a judgment entered that the damages b\u00e9 paid by the county of Bristol. Gen. Sts. c. 145, \u00a7 9; c. 43, \u00a7 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">\n<em>Writ of certiorari to issue.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
