Section 48 provides that, if the creditor, or some one in his behalf, does not attend, the debtor shall be discharged without an examination. The magistrate had no authority to discharge him except in the manner prescribed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-6\"><em>A. A.

The fact that the party took the poor debtors\u2019 oath before the magistrate discharged him did not render his discharge less valid, even supposing the case to have authorized a discharge without oath, as provided in certain cases.
