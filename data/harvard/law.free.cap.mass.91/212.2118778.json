In order to show a want of probable cause for bringing the suit, he put in evidence a discharge in insolvency obtained by him, taking effect as of December 18th 1858. The defendant was then, against the plaintiff\u2019s objection, allowed to call two witnesses to testify to declarations of the plaintiff that priai to his going into insolvency he did various acts in violation of the insolvent laws; and that quite recently the plaintiff haa stated that the present action was brought without his directions ; that he had no knowledge of it until informed by Townsend ; that he wished to see if he could not stop it; that if he carried it on and recovered anything, Townsend would get it all; and that the reason why he became confused in his testimony at a former trial was because Townsend had instructed him to testify to some things which were not true, and, in testifying under these circumstances, he became confused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>The only instruction given by the judge upon the question of damages was, that the jury, if they found for the plaintiff, would give him such a sum as would indemnify him for the injuries he bad sustained by the wrongful acts of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-4\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, with $10.33 damages ; and the plaintiff moved to set it aside, because of misconduct and irregularity on the part of the jury, and of the officer having them in charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-5\">At the hearing of this motion, it appeared from the testimony of the officer who had charge of the jury that between four and five o\u2019clock in the morning (the jury having retired about 5 p. m. of the preceding day, Thursday,) one of the jurors asked him how long the court was going to keep them there, to which the officer replied that he did not know but they would have to stay there till Saturday night; and that a little after five o\u2019clock of the same morning the jury agreed, sealed up their verdict and separated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-6\">The judge overruled the motion. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b221-7\"><em>S. R.

The plaintiff having put into the case his discharge in insolvency, for the purpose of showing want of proba- <em>\u00a1 </em>ble cause in the suit instituted by the defendant, it seems quite clear that, any evidence tending to invalidate the discharge was relevant and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">2. The evidence of the witnesses as to statements made by the plaintiff was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">3. The instruction to the jury upon the subject of damages was sufficient, in the absence of any request for more specific directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">4 No sufficient ground is shown for sustaining the exception to the ruling of the court overruling the motion of the plaintiff for a new trial on account of the alleged misconduct and irregularity on the part of the jury and the officer having charge o\u00ed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>them. To sustain the exception, the plaintiff must show that the court was, by the rules of law, required to set aside this verdict. But in our opinion the facts present no such case. That an irregularity occurred must be conceded, as the more proper course for the officer would have been to decline giving any answer to the inquiry of the juror. But there was no officious intermeddling on the part of the officer, nor any attempt or previous purpose on his part to hasten the jury to an agreement as to their verdict. His answer to the inquiry of the juror affirmed nothing but his want of knowledge how long the jury would be required to remain together. The defendant may properly object to the motion to set aside this verdict, there being no evidence of any design on the part of the officer to favor either party, or that any such effect was produced by this reply. If the conduct of the officer was irregular, he might properly be punished therefor; but the facts as stated well authorized the presiding judge to refuse to grant the motion of the plaintiff to set aside the verdict for this cause. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roby, </em>12 Pick. 520. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
