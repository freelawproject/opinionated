The witness testified that, when Mrs. Galavan began to make her statement, the defendant was just leaving the room, which was about thirteen feet square, but stopped in a small entry, just large enough to open and close a door, between the bedroom and kitchen, as soon as she began to speak; that she spoke in a natural and ordinary tone of voice, and he could hear her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-10\">The defendant objected to this evidence, and in reply to further questions by the judge the witness stated that he stood about in the middle of the entry while his wife was talking, and as soon as she had finished left the entry and went into the kitchen. Among the questions put by the judge was this: \u201c Did the defendant appear to be listening ? \u201d to which the witness answered, <em>\u201c </em>Yes.\u201d Upon cross-examination the witness testified that she was in such a position that the defendant was in full sight, while his wife was talking, but she could not say whether his face or his back was turned towards the bedroom.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-11\">The witness was thereupon allowed to testify to declarations by Mrs. Galavan, which were relied upon in support of the indictment, and the judge submitted to. the jury the question, under instructions which were not excepted to, whether the defendant heard the statements of his wife, under circumstances which indicated that he understood and appreciated their relation to himself, and which reasonably called upon him to reply to or deny them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>The jury returned a verdict of guilty. The defendant moved in arrest of judgment, because the indictment contained no averment that the cantharides, as mixed and mingled with the water, was poisonous, or known by the defendant to be so; but the motion was overruled. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-5\"><em>J A. Gillis &amp; R.

Sts. c. 160, \u00a7 32, which provide for the punishment of \u201c whoever mingles any poison with food, drink or medicine, with intent to kill or injure another person.\u201d The indictment duly alleges that the defendant mingled poison with water, which he knew was to be drunk by his wife, and with intent to kill and injure her. This is sufficient. The statute does not require that the mixture should be or be known to be poisonous, and the indictment need not therefore allege that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">The statements of the defendant\u2019s wife, while in a room connected by an open door with the narrow entry in which the defendant was standing, related to acts done .by the defendant or in his presence. They were made in the defendant\u2019s own house, in the absence of any officer of the law or anything which might create constraint or apprehension, and under such circumstances that he might well have heard, and, if he did, must have understood them, and known whether they were true or false, and would have been likely, according to common experience, to reply to them, and contradict them if untrue. ' They were therefore admissible in evidence against him, within the rule laid down in the authorities cited by his counsel; and they were submitted to the jury under proper instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Whether the defendant could hear and appeared to be listening depended on his position and attitude, and might well be estimated and testified to by any one who was present at the time and saw them.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>The interrogatory put by the presiding judge to a witness can not be objected to by either party as leading in form.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
