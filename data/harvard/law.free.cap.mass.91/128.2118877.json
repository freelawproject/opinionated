Said Sarah, Ira and Polly Gurney continued to reside in the south part of the same. The two former resided there and were supported by the plaintiff, with such assistance as they themselves and Polly Gurney rendered, until their deaths, in 1848 and 1855. Said Polly lived there and was supported in the same way until June 1st 1855, when she went to the house of the defendant, her brother in law, in East Bridgewater, where she resided until her death, May 21st 1860.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>The will of Polly Gurney, dated January 23d 1858, duly proved and allowed, by which she bequeathed all her property equally to her sister, Mrs. Stetson, and another sister, was introduced in evidence, and it was admitted by the defendant that considerable personal estate bf the testator came into his hands as executor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-5\">There was no evidence that the plaintiff, who knew that the said Polly was living with the defendant, ever furnished or offered to furnish any support for her there, or that he was ever requested so to do, but the plaintiff once asked said Polly to return to his house and offered to support her there; and she once requested him to have the bond in suit and his bond to her given up and cancelled ; but the plaintiff declined to accede to her request. *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-6\">The defendant contended that the part of the bond w'hich provided that the plaintiff should have what the said Polly might receive on her mother\u2019s decease was void as against the policy of the law; but the objection was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-7\">The defendant also asked the court to instruct the jury that, inasmuch as the said Polly had a right under the bonds to require the plaintiff to support her at the hous.e of said Stetson, and as the plaintiff knew of the choice of said Polly to live there, and*as she had lived there for the last five years of her life, and as he had neglected to support her or to pay her board at said Stetson\u2019s, there was not evidence to warrant the jury to find that the bond was forfeited; and that it was the duty of the plaintiff to seek out the said Polly and to furnish her a suitable support or pay her board at said Stetson\u2019s ; but/the judge ruled otherwise, and instructed the jury that, without previous notice and request to the plaintiff so to do, it was not his duty to go and provide her maintenance or pay her board at the defendant\u2019s house; and that the plaintiff\u2019s neglect in that regard during the last five years of her life was not a failure to comply with the provisions of his obligation, so as to prevent a breach of the bond in suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-8\">The defendant offered in evidence a bond of said Polly tc him, dated September 5th 1856, with condition to leave to hire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>\u201c all t.ie personal estate, goods and effects which I may possess at the time of my decease,\u201d and also his bond to her of the same date, with condition for her support. This evidence was offered as tending to prove that the plaintiff was bound to support her at the defendant\u2019s house, and as a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s claim of forfeiture of her bond to him; but the defendant did not offer to show that the plaintiff knew of the existence of these bonds; and the evidence was rejected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-5\">The defendant contended that this action was prematurely brought; that, by the true construction of the bond, the plaintiff was to have only such balance of her personal estate as would appear upon the settlement of the executor\u2019s account, or as would ordinarily be distributed to her next of kin in the case of intestacy; and that such account should be rendered and allowed, ascertaining the balance, and a demand made for the same, before an action could be brought; but the judge overruled the objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-6\">The defendant contended that the bond was void for uncertainty, since, as said Polly might expend and give away whatever she pleased, she might use up her entire estate, and leave no balance to come to the plaintiff; and also that the plaintiff\u2019s remedy, if any, was in equity; but these objections were overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-7\">A verdict was rendered for the plaintiff that the bond was forfeited, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b139-8\"><em>E.

Neither of the bonds stipulates for any demand or notice to be given by said Polly to the plaintiff, nor does the plaintiff\u2019s liability to forfeit his bond depend upon any demand, notice, refusal or neglect. The bonds offered by the defendant were evidence of a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s claim.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXp\">The only question raised at the trial of this case was, whether the plaintiff, on the evidence adduced by both parties, had sustained the allegation of a breach of the bond declared on, and was. entitled to a judgment for the penalty under Gen. Sts. c. 133, \u00a7 9. The extent of the breach and the amount of damage to which the plaintiff might be entitled to recover therefor, were by agreement of parties reserved for future consideration. Upon a careful revision of the rulings under which the case was submitted to the jury, we are unable to find any valid ground of objection to any of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">1. The bond contains no agreement which is against public policy. That it is competent for a party to stipulate for the disposition of his property at the time of his decease is too well settled to admit of doubt or question. The validity of such an agreement has been often recognized by this court. <em>Fitch </em>v. <em>Fitch, </em>8 Pick. 480. <em>Trull </em>v. <em>Eastman, </em>3 Met. 121. <em>Canada </em>v. <em>Canada, </em>6 Cush. 15. Nor is it a material circumstance that the agreement contains a clause by which the defendant\u2019s testator was bound to give to the plaintiff, not only the property which she had in possession at the time of the execution of the bond, but also that which she might receive as heir or legatee of her mother. There might have been force in this objection, if it had appeared that the bond was given and the agreement made without the knowledge or assent of the mother. It might then have been deemed to have operated as a deceit on her, on the principle stated in <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>7 Mass. 112, 122. But it appears by the facts disclosed at the trial that the bond in suit was given in pursuance of a family arrangement or settlement to which the mother and daughter were both parties. An agreement by an heir apparent that he will convey an estate which may coitie to him by descent is valid, if entered into fairly, on an adequate consideration, with the knowledge and assent of the ancestor, and if the bargain is not unconscionable or obtained by oppression or by taking unjust advantage of the necessities of the heir. No element is shown to exist in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>which in any degree tends to invalidate the contract. There! was no deceit or fraud, actual or constructive, practised on the mother, nor would her property, under the stipulations in the bond, be disposed of at her decease in a manner of which she was ignorant, or contrary to her intention. The agreement, so far as it affected the rights and interest of the daughter, was in no respect unconscionable or unjust. It was a reasonable contract, made on an adequate consideration, with the free and voluntary assent of all parties interested.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\"><em>2. </em>There was no evidence of any neglect or failure by the plaintiff to fulfil the agreement into which he entered for the support of the obligor. Conceding that a breach of his contract would be a bar to the maintenance of this action \u2014 a point by no means clear \u2014 the facts disclosed at the trial would not have warranted the jury in finding such breach. No request was proved to have been made of the plaintiff to furnish support to the obligor after she ceased to reside in the same house with him, nor did it appear that after she withdrew therefrom up to the time of her decease, she intended or desired that the plaintiff should any longer be required to fulfil the stipulation for her support, contained in the bond which she held. For aught that appears, she voluntarily waived and abandoned all claims against the plaintiff, and elected to seek her support elsewhere and by other means. Indeed, the agreement into which she entered with Stetson, as shown by the bonds offered in evidence by the defendant, bearing date September 5th 1856, tends very strongly to show that it was her intention, without the knowledge or assent of the plaintiff, to avoid the obligation of the contract into which she had entered with him, and, by ceasing to receive support at his hands, to get rid of the performance of her part of this mutual obligation. Under such circumstances, a tender of performance by the plaintiff was unnecessary, and no inference of a failure or omission by the plaintiff to fulfil the agreement would have been warranted. So that if these bonds had been admitted in evidence, they would not have aided the defence, but wornd have tended to support the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">3. The objection that the suit was prematurely brought is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>untenable. There was clearly a breach of the bond declared on, by the act of the obligor in leaving a last will and testament duly executed, which was proved and allowed in the probate court, and by which the stipulation in the bond, to leave to the plaintiff all the personal estate of which she might die possessed, was broken. This was clearly a forfeiture of the bond, and gave the plaintiff an immediate right of action for the amount of the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">'4. Equally untenable is the objection, that the bond is to be held void for uncertainty. The property which the plaintiff would have been entitled to receive, if the condition of the bond had been complied with, is susceptible of proof. But if it were not, the right to maintain the action would not be thereby affected. The plaintiff would be still entitled to judgment fertile amount of the penalty. Any uncertainty as to the amount of property would affect only the damages for which execution is to issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">5. It was suggested that the plaintiff\u2019s remedy was in equity only. But we can see no ground for this objection. An action at law is an appropriate remedy for a breach of a bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
