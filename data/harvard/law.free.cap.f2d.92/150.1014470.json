The head of the department of justice is the attorney general and the head of the department of banking is the secretary of banking, these offices being provided' for by statute. The attorney general has statutory power \u2018to appoint and fix the compensation of special deputy attorneys-general, and special attorneys, to represent the Commonwealth, for any department, board, or commission thereof, in special work or in particular cases.\u2019 Purdon\u2019s Penna.Stats. title 71, \u00a7 296 [71 P.S.Pa. \u00a7 296]. The secretary of banking is by statute given broad powers over banks within the commonwealth. When it appears to him that a bank is in an unsafe or unsound condition he may, after notice and hearing- and with the consent of the attorney general, take possession of the business and property of' the bank; under certain condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>tions he may take possession without hearing and without the attorney general\u2019s consent. When he takes possession of a bank, he is vested with \u2018all the rights, powers, and duties of a receiver appointed by any court of equity in this Commonwealth;\u2019 while in possession of the bank he is \u2018the representative of the creditors\u2019 thereof. The banking law provides that, in the case of banks the property of which is in the possession of the secretary of banking, all expenses in connection with such possession and of continuing the business or of liquidation \u2018shall first be payable out of the funds of\u2019 such bank \u2018including the compensation of special deputies, assistants, and others employed by the secretary to assist him in such proceedings; the allowance of all such expenses to be subject to the approval of the court.\u2019 Purdon\u2019s Penna.Stats. title 7, \u00a7\u00a7 29, 49 [7 P.S.Pa. \u00a7\u00a7 29, 49].</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u201cThe petitioner was assigned to work under special deputy attorneys general in Philadelphia County in connection with legal matters pertaining to closed banks in that county. Such closed banks were being liquidated by the secretary of banking pursuant to statute. The petitioner\u2019s duties consisted of attempting to collect debts due such closed banks, rendering legal opinions to the deputy receivers in charge thereof, handling the legal matters for the banking department that came up from surrounding counties, prosecuting suits in court, consulting with creditors, depositors, and stockholders of closed banks concerning their claims, procuring substitute trustees for trust estates being administered by such banks, preparing, filing, and presenting accounts in the Orphans\u2019 Court, preparing data in connection with the proposed state banking code, and \u2018in general anything that was assigned by the Special Deputy Attorney General at the time.\u2019 Such attorneys were considered by the department of justice as \u2018available for any purpose at any time.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u201cThe petitioner handled legal matters for the state banking department in connection with the liquidation of the Northern Central Trust Co., the Darby Bank &amp; Trust Co., the United States Bank &amp; Trust Co., the Central Trust &amp; Savings Co., the Mortgage Security &amp; Trust Co., the Park Trust Co., and the Wharton Trust Co., among other closed banks in the Philadelphia area. The petitioner was one of approximately twenty lawyers assigned to like work in Philadelphia County.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\u201cThe particular work and the matters to which the petitioner gave attention were determined by the attorney general\u2019s office. He was free to use his discretion only in simple matters. In regard to all proposed litigation and appeals, he was required first to consult with his superior officers. He was required to follow prescribed forms issued by the attorney general\u2019s office as to preparation of documents and pleadings. His legal opinions were reviewed and often revised by his superiors before being issued. Likewise, briefs were reviewed and frequently entirely redrafted. All matters of policy in particular cases were decided by the attorney general and his deputies. The petitioner\u2019s advice to depositors of closed banks was limited to matters on which his superiors had ruled. All such attorneys were instructed to take no steps and render no opinions on any legal problem involved in closed banks without approval of the attorney general. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">\u201cThe petitioner received no compensation for his services other than his $3,000 salary, but was reimbursed for his expenses. He was furnished with necessary office facilities. He was required to use official letterheads furnished by the department of justice, and signed his letters as \u2018attorney\u2019 for the department of justice. The files in matters handled by him were considered the property of the state and were turned over by him to his successor when his employment was terminated. While the department of justice could have required all his time and had first call on his services, he was permitted to engage in private practice. In 1932 he spent more than 50 percent of his time on state business. He had to give up certain regular employment to accept the employment in the department of justice. His professional income for 1932, aside from the $3,000 salary, was $2,735.60. He was not a member of a law firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">\u201cPetitioner\u2019s salary was paid to him semi-monthly by checks drawn by representatives of the state banking department in charge of closed banks in Philadelphia, the checks being countersigned by the secretary of banking at Harrisburg.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">The taxpayer paid income tax on the $2,735.60, his professional income. He claimed his salary of $3,000 was exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">In pursuance of the statutory authority noted above, \u201cto appoint and fix the compensation of Special Deputy Attorneys General and Special Attorneys to repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>sent the Commonwealth, for any department, board, or commission thereof, in special work or in particular cases,\u201d the Attorney General of the state of Pennsylvania, on October 2, 1931, notified the taxpayer that \u201cit gives me pleasure to appoint you an attorney' in this Department assigned to the liquidation work of the Department of Banking. Your salary will be at the rate of $3,000.00 per annum. The Special Deputy Attorneys General who are assigned to this work in Philadelphia are being advised of your appointment and that you will be available to assist them in any way in which they may find it necessary to call upon you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The uncontradicted testimony of the taxpayer was that \u201cthe Department of Banking had absolutely no authority over me. They did not instruct me as to what banks I was to work. The Attorney General did that.\u201d The Deputy Attorney General testified: \u201cIt was considered that these men were available for any purpose at any time with the Department of Justice. They were controlled entirely by that department.\u201d In view of this uncontradicted evidence, we hold it proven that the taxpayer was an employee of the state acting by its Attorney General. Moreover, it will be noted that the Tax Board made no finding that he was not an employee of the state, but in that regard limited itself to the negative statement, \u201cwe are not satisfied that petitioner can properly be classified as an employee of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\u201d Being an employee of the state or the nation, being engaged in recognized governmental work \u2014 in this case the vital Department of Banking, Therrell v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 88 F.(2d) 869\u2014it follows that the quantum of the employee\u2019s pay, the means by which, he is paid, are features which do not on the one hand determine the liability of the national employee to state taxes or the state employee to federal taxes. The nation and the state, within their respective spheres of governmental administration, are not subject to taxation imposed by other sovereignties. Within their own province, they are exempt from\u2014to them\u2014alien burdens in the way of taxation. Indian Motocycle Co. v. United States, 283 U. S. 570, 51 S.Ct. 601, 75 L.Ed. 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The same constitutional principle that prevents the state of Pennsylvania- from taxing the income of special attorneys of the United States equally prevents the United States from taxing the income of special attorneys of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. As the national banks are \u201cinstrumentalities, means and operations\u201d whereby the federal government exercises a governmental control over them, so the state exercises like governmental control over state banks, for, as said in Indian; Motocycle Co. v. U. S., 283 U.S. 570, 51 S.Ct. 601, 603, 75 L.Ed. 1277, \u201cthis principle is implied from the independence of the national and state governments within their respective spheres and from the provisions of the Constitution which look to the maintenance of the dual system,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">So regarding, and without discussing the elaborate arguments and citations of the respective parties \u2014 all of which have been duly considered \u2014 we limit ourselves to setting aside the order of the Tax Board. This view is in line with the decisions of this circuit in Commissioner v. Coughlin (C.C.A.) 87 F.(2d) 670, and Commissioner v. Hindman (C.C.A.) 88 F.(2d) 44.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
