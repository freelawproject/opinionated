Hassett, 90 F.(2d) 833. We there said (page 840):</p>\n<p id=\"b756-23\">\u201cThe defendant\u2019s contention that these statutes can have a retroactive effect where there has been an irrevocable transfer of the decedent\u2019s interest during his lifetime, even though he reserves the income of the property so conveyed, cannot prevail in view of the decisions of the Supreme Court above cited, together with Helvering v. St. Louis Union Trust Co., 296 U.S. 39, 56 S.Ct. 74, 80 L.Ed. 29, 100 A.L.R. 1239; Becker v. St. Louis Union Trust Co., 296 U.S. 48, 56 S.Ct. 78, 80 L.Ed. 35, and Helvering v. City Bank Farmers\u2019 Trust Co., supra [296 U.S. 85, 56 S.Ct. 70, 80 L.Ed. 62], If doubt exists as to the construction of these statutes, it should be resolved in favor of the taxpayer. Gould v.
