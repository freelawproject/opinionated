The pertinent portion of the Act is a proviso that:</p>\n<p id=\"b604-26\">\u201c \u2022 . .no mark which consists . . \u2022 . merely in words . . . which are descriptive of the goods with which they are used, or of the character or quality of such goods, . . shall be registered <em>it </em>\u2022 \u2022 \u00ab</p>\n<p id=\"b604-31\">The appellant made application in the usual course in the United States Patent Office. The application was refused by the Examiner, upon the ground that the word \u201cMorocco\u201d is merely a descriptive designation of the goods. This refusal was, upon the same ground, confirmed by the Assistant Commissioner of Patents. The appellant then filed, a bill in equity in the District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia under Rev. Stat. \u00a7 4915 (as amended, 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 63), praying that it be adjudged entitled to receive a certificate of registration. After a trial upon the merits on issues of fact raised by an answer filed by the appellee Commissioner of Patents, the trial court ruled- that the word \u201cMorocco\u201d is not registerable and dismissed the appellant\u2019s bill. The trial court made findings of fact as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b604-32\">\u201c1. The application' of the Plaintiff involved in this proceeding is for the registration under the Trade-Mark Act of 1905 of the term \u2018Morocco\u2019 as a, trade-mark for a lacquer finish.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-33\">\u201c2. Plaintiff\u2019s finish when applied to an article gives an appearance indicating a simulation of Morocco leather.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-34\">\u201c3. The word Morocco had been extensively used by Plaintiff in connection with its product.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-35\">The trial court made the following conclusions of law:</p>\n<p id=\"b604-36\">\u201c1. The term Morocco as used by Plaintiff is descriptive of the goods upon which it is used.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>' \u201c2. A word which is aptly descriptive of the goods with which it is used is not registerable as a trade-mark under the Trade-Mark Act of 1905, even if it has acquired a \u2018secondary\u2019 meaning as indicating the goods of the user.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">\u201c3. The term Morocco as used by Plaintiff did not function as a trade-mark to indicate origin or source of manufacture but was employed to designate the type of finish produced by Plaintiff\u2019s product.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">\u201c4. The word Morocco is not register-able by Plaintiff. .</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">\u201c5. The Bill should be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">It appeared from the evidence that the appellant applied the word \u201cMorocco\u201d to a class of paints, variously referred to as enamels, varnishes, lacquers and japans, which were used for a final coat upon either wood or metallic surfaces. According to an affidavit of the president of the appellant \u2022 company, which was introduced in evidence, \u201cthe word \u2018Morocco\u2019 is used to designate our paints and varnishes where there is a special finish that looks like imitation Morocco leather.\u201d The president also testified, according to the narrative statement of evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">\u201c \u2018Morocco\u2019 is applied to a line of finishes that we call imitation leather finishes, more to distinguish them from high gloss or \u25a0flat enamels of the conventional type. The surface of these enamels is not smooth, as for the conventional enamels; they vary from a fairly high gloss to absolutely flat, but the surface is composed of wrinkles of various types, and those wrinkles are not in one direction, but in all directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">\u201cIn the various enamels of this character which we designate as \u2018Morocco,\u2019 these wrinkles vary a great deal as to size and degree of coarseness and fineness. As to the commercial reason for the variation in these different types of finishes which we designate \u2018Morocco\u2019 and for having wrinkles in these finishes, some customers want one type of finish and some want another. I mean by that some want a glossy finish, with shiny spots in there that some of them call \u2018eyes\u2019; others want more or less flat finishes. These variations in finishes are all specified by the same general trademark \u2018Morocco.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">It appeared also from the evidence that the term \u201cMorocco\u201d as used in the trade identifies the product made by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">The appellant urges as errors the trial court\u2019s rulings that the word \u201cMorocco\u201d is descriptive of the goods, and that a word which has acquired a secondary meaning is not registerable even though it be descriptive.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">1. The trial court correctly decided that the term \u201cMorocco\u201d was descriptive of the appellant\u2019s goods. The quoted statement from the affidavit of the appellant\u2019s president supports the trial court\u2019s finding of fact to such effect. There are numerous similar decisions by the courts. Especially persuasive are die following: Barton v. Rex-Oil Co. (C.C.A.1924) 2 F.(2d) 402, 40 A.L.R. 424; Mirrolike Mfg. Co. v. Devoe &amp; Raynolds Co. (D.C.1923) 3 F.(2d) 846; Hercules Powder Co. v. Newton (C.C.A.1920) 266 F. 169; Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Elliott Varnish Co. (C.C.A.1916) 232 F. 588. These cases, respectively, hold descriptive : \u201cDyanshine\u201d as applied to shoe polish; \u201cMirrolike\u201d as applied to furniture, floor and automobile polish; \u201cInfallible\u201d as applied to explosive powders; \u201cRoof Leak\u201d as applied to roof paint. In this jurisdiction Continental Varnish Co. v. Alabastine Co. (1925) 56 App.D.C. 19, 6 F.(2d) 717; In re Swan &amp; Finch Co. (1919) 49 App.D.C. 95, 259 F. 991; and In re Anti-Cori-Zine Chemical Co. (1909) 34 App.D.C. 191, are, we think, controlling. They, respectively, hold descriptive: \u201cOpaline\u201d as applied to varnishes; \u201cSlo Flo\u201d as applied to lubricating grease; \u201cGetwell\u201d as applied to medicines.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-18\">Calling attention to the terms of the statute forbidding registration of words \u201cdescriptive of the goods with which they are used, or of the character or quality of such goods,\u201d the appellant especially urges that the word \u201cMorocco\u201d is not descriptive of its goods foi the reason that the same are in liquid form in cans, and in that form have no leather-like appearance. This is too narrow and technical a use of the term \u201cgoods.\u201d The appellant\u2019s finishes are as much its goods, in the trade-mark sense of the term, when applied to a wood or metallic surface as when in the can. On the facts of the cases above cited the word \u201cDyanshine\u201d does not describe shoe polish in the box, but its effect upon shoes when applied to them; the term \u201cMirro-1\u2018ike\u201d does not describe furniture, floor and automobile polish in the container, but its effect when applied to the surfaces referred to; the term \u201cInfallible\u201d does not describe explosive powder in the container, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>its dependable firing quality in use; the words \u201cRoof Leak\u201d and \u201cOpaline\u201d do not describe paint in the can \u2014 \u201cRoof Leak\u201d describes a capacity of paint, after application, to keep roofs from leaking; \u201cOpa-line\u201d describes the appearance of varnish when applied; \u201cSlo Flo\u201d .does not describe the appearance of lubricating grease itself in the original container, but its quality of viscosity in use; and \u201cGetwell\u201d describes the effect of medicine upon the patient, not the character or quality of the medicine in box or bottle.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">In Re Irving Drew Co. (1924) 54 App.D.C. 310, 297 F. 889, this court held the term \u201cArch Rest\u201d as applied to\" boots, shoes and slippers, not descriptive. The appellant insists that the case is controlling in its favor. As written, the decision is rested upon the proposition that the term \u201cArch Rest\u201d is descriptive, not of the character or quality of the goods themselves, but of their effect upon the wearer. So restricted, the decision is distinguishable from th\u00e9 instant case because the term \u201cMorocco\u201d is descriptive of the appellant\u2019s finishes themselves, in their applied-to-surface form, rather than of their effect, in the sense of In re Irving Drew Co., upon surfaces. The instant case being distinguishable from In re Irving Drew Co., we are not called upon either to follow the case of to modify or overrule it. But we think it fair to state that upon present consideration of the case, it seems to put too narrow a construction upon the Trade-Mark Act (15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 81 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">2. In respect of the appellant\u2019s point that a descriptive word is registerable if it has acquired a secondary meaning: The law is settled that while a secondary meaning may be protected in equity against fraudulent or deceptive use, the existence <em>of </em>a secondary meaning is not a foundation for registration of a descriptive word. See Elgin Nat. Watch Co. v. Illinois Watch Co. (1901) 179 U.S. 665, 21 S.Ct. 270, 45 L.Ed. 365, and see In re Canada Dry Ginger Ale (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1936) 86 F.(2d) 830, overruling, in respect of the point in question, In re Plymouth Motor Corporation (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1931) 46 F.(2d) 211, which is relied upon by the appellant. Lowe Bros. Co. v. Toledo Varnish Co. (C.C.A.1909) 168 F. 627, also relied upon by the appellant, does not hold, as we read it, that the acquisition of a secondary meaning is a foundation for registration of a descriptive word, but merely that <em>a </em>secondary meaning may be protected in equity against deceptive use.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">The decree of the trial court is</p>\n<p id=\"A30\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Judge VAN ORSDEL took no part in the decision of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
