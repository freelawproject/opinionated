Young, resident of Hawaii, died testate in 1926, leaving two surviving children, the beneficiaries of the trust herein involved. After certain bequests, she willed the residue of her estate to petitioners, as trustees, directing certain payments to said children \u201ceach and every month in advance on the first day of the month, beginning as of the date of my death and making the first payment as soon as possible after my death.\u201d The specific source (income or corpus) of such monthly payments was not designated. Upon the beneficiaries attaining a specified age, the trust was to terminate and \u201call the principal and accumulated income\u201d was to be distributed to the two children in equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>shares. Provisions for various contingencies, not pertinent here, are not detailed. The trustees were further empowered \u201cto pay to my daughter or son or to use and apply for her or his benefit prior to the distribution of the principal, portions of the income or accumulated income derived from the trust estate in addition to the amounts hereinabove set forth if and whenever in their discretion such additional income shall be needed. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Petitioners distributed $12,000 of the 1932 trust income to the beneficiaries. The only issue here presented is whether or not this sum constituted an allowable deduction from the gross income of the trust for such year under the Revenue Act of 1932, \u00a7 162 (b) (26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 162 (b) and note).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">The Supreme Court has held that, if such payments are to be made to the beneficiaries in any event and are not conditioned upon the existence of sufficient trust income, they are not deductible in computing the taxable net income of the trust estate. Helvering v. Pardee (1933) 290 U.S. 365, 370, 54 S.Ct. 221, 78 L.Ed. 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">The fact that payments were in fact made out of income is immaterial. Bush et al. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (C.C.A.9 1937) 89 F.(2d) 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">However, if payments to beneficiaries are to be made from income onlyi such sum constitutes an allowable deduction. Helvering v. Butterworth (1933) 290 U.S. 365, 54 S.Ct. 221, 78 L.Ed. 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">In the absence of express directions, annuities may be paid from principal where the income is insufficient. In re Hardy\u2019s Estate (1916) 86 N.J.Eq. 405, 99 A. 326, L.R.A.1917E, 578; Liberty Title &amp; Trust Co. et al. v. Stevens et al. (1934) 115 N.J.Eq. 506, 171 A. 531, 535, affirmed (1935) 117 N.J.Eq. 404, 176 A. 167; In re Johnston\u2019s Estate (1919) 264 Pa. 71, 107 A. 335; Moody Bible Institute of Chicago v. Pettibone et al. (1937) 289 Ill.App. 69, 6 N.E.(2d) 676; Theobold on Law of Wills, p. 637; Thompson on Construction of Wills (1928), p. 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">In determining whether or not the monthly payments were to be made regardless of available income, the intention of the testatrix, as expressed in her will, is controlling. Such intent must be \u201cdeduced from a consideration of the whole instrument.\u201d Colton v. Colton (1888) 127 U.S. 300, 8 S.Ct. 1164, 1168, 32 L.Ed. 138.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">The monthly payments were unqualifiedly made payable \u201ceach and every month.\u201d Such mandatory language is not effaced by reference in the residual clause to \u201call the principal\u201d nor by the direction for discretionary payments of \u201cadditional income.\u201d Such scattered phrases are insufficient to sustain petitioners\u2019 contention that the monthly payments were conditioned upon the existence of income. They merely manifest the testatrix\u2019 belief that the income of the trust would be ample for such monthly payments. Such belief is immaterial. In re Johnston\u2019s Estate (1919) 264 Pa. 71, 107 A. 335. It is her expressed intention which governs. The fact that the beneficiaries were the natural objects of the testatrix\u2019s bounty is significant in determining her intent as to the source of payment. Moody Bible Institute of Chicago v. Pettibone et al., supra; Matter of Stewart\u2019s Estate (1931) 142 Misc. 670, 255 N.Y.S. 389, 390. Considering the will as a whole, it is clear that the testatrix\u2019 prime purpose was to assure the adequate support and maintenance of her children until they attained the age of thirty-five, at which time they were to receive the residue of her estate. It is unlikely that she intended such purpose to be obviated in the event that the trust produced insufficient income to meet the monthly payments. Provision was made against alienation and hypothecation. Additional payments in time of need were authorized. Such spendthrift trust provisions, together with the lack of specification of the source of the unconditional monthly payments, compel the conclusion that it was the testatrix\u2019s intention that the monthly payments should be made regardless of available income.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
