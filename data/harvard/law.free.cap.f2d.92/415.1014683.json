From this it appears that at some time during the trial the court concluded that it did not have jurisdiction because, at the time the attachment was sued out, appellee was undergoing reorganization in another court under section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 207). At the time the ruling was made, the court had before it a proposed amendment to the declaration in attachment, as well as the above-mentioned motion for a nonsuit. The order recites that the dismissal is for want of jurisdiction, but neither the order nor the opinion discloses whether the court reached its conclusion from the pleadings or the evidence. Since the record does not disclose the evidence upon which the ruling of the court may have been based, and which may have supported it, we cannot say that the court was in error. Spruill v. Crawford, 64 App.D.C. 118, 75 F.(2d) 522; certiorari denied, 294 U.S. 714, 55 S.Ct. 513, 79 L.Ed. 1247; Turner v. Board of Public Instruction (C.C.A.) 75 F.(2d) 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-24\">It is urged that the legal conclusion upon which the judgment is based is shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>by the opinion of the court to have been based upon facts set out in the pleadings. However, the opinion does not so state. While jurisdiction of the court may not have been wanting solely because of the pendency of the bankruptcy proceeding, we must assume, in the absence of a bill of exceptions, that the facts were before the court which showed a lack of jurisdiction. Auzenne v. American Book Bindery Co., 64 App.D.C. 330, 78 F.(2d) 214; American National Red Cross v. Raven Honey Dew Mills (C.C.A.) 74 F.(2d) 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
