This appeal is from the refusal of a preliminary injunction. The hearing was on the pleadings, affidavits, depositions, and documentary evidence. The judge thus expressed the ground on which he refused the injunction: \u201cWhether there was in fact a conspiracy can be better determined on final hearing and with the evidence much more complete than it is now. It is sufficient to say the evidence in its present form does not sufficiently establish the alleged conspiracy.\u201d The conspiracy is denied, and the evidence of it is wholly circumstantial and not conclusive, and is on many points in serious conflict. The jurisdiction of the court is not the issue and there is no controlling question of law to be settled. The District Judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to interfere before the contested fact issues are finally tried out. Rice &amp; Adams Corp. v. Lathrop, 278 U.S. 509, 49 S.Ct. 220, 73 L.Ed. 480; United Fuel Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission, 278 U.S. 322, 49 S.Ct. 157, 73 L.Ed. 402; Alabama v. United States, 279 U.S. 229, 49 S.Ct. 266, 73 L.Ed. 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
