It thus extended the use of these horses over the whole of the states of Oregon and Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"AG5\">We are unable to see how this extension of the use to the area of both states changes our interpretation of the policy as including other activities of a camping nature, such as \u201cthe use of the truck by the injured Boy Scout in receiving from him and the other Boy Scouts the camping outfit and carrying him and the outfit to the place where the camp was to be pitched.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"APW\">Petition denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
