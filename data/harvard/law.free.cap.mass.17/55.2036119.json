[ * 56 ] * <em>Cummings, </em>for the defendant. I am to distinguish this case from the one cited for the plaintiffs; and it will be found to differ in one essential fact. In that case, the defendants were citizens and residents in <em>Massachusetts, </em>nor does it appear that they were ever within the state of <em>New York. </em>In the case at bar, the parties were all citizens of and residents in <em>New York, </em>at the time of making the contract, and long after. If this Court will ever recognize a statute of limitations enacted by another state, they will give effect to the one pleaded in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-14\"><em>Nichols, </em>in reply.
