At that term the defendant filed a plea in abatement, alleging that since the judgment was rendered for the plaintiffs in the Common Pleas, and an appeal entered by the defendant, and before the then present term of this Court, the said <em>Rachel </em>intermarried with one <em>Samuel Allen, </em>who was then living; wherefore the defendant prayed judgment if the plaintiffs ought further to be answered, &amp;c., and for his costs. To this plea the plaintiffs demurred generally, and the demurrer was joined by the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-7\"><em>Newton </em>and <em>Burnside, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZS\">If a <em>feme sole </em>plaintiff marries pending her suit, the writ abates. So if she sues alone as administratrix <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>. By the statute of 1783, <em>c. </em>24, \u00a7 19, where a <em>feme sole, </em>who is executrix or administratrix jointly with one or more persons, shall marry, such marriage shall operate as an extinguish ment or determination of her power and authority. Several administrators are in law as one person. But for this marriage, the defendant, in case he recovered his costs, would have been entitled to his execution therefor against <em>Rachel Newell, </em>as well as her co-administrators. And such judgment would have been against them personally. She had no right then, by a voluntary act on her part, to lessen or defeat the defendant\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-8\">The plaintiffs ought not to be in a better situation, than they would hp.ve been if they had brought the action in their own right which they might have done, and which indeed would have been more regular; since by virtue of the * statute [ * 342 ] of 1788, c. 51, $ 3, they were personally seised of the land by virtue of the levy of the execution.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b283-9\"><em>Lincoln, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b283-11\"> 14 <em>Mass Rep, </em>295, <em>Swan, Administratrix, </em>vs. <em>Wilkinson.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b283-10\"><em>By the </em>Court.</author>\n<p id=\"A2b\">\u2014The plea is predicated upon the common law doctrine, that in an action by a <em>feme sole </em>her marriage abates the writ. But this is altered by our statute of 1783, c. 24, in relation to <em>femes sole </em>who are joint administrators or executors with other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>persons, by which it is provided that in such case, if the <em>feme sole </em>marries, her right to administer shall cease, and the other administrators or executors may proceed in the same manner as if she were naturally dead. Had <em>Rachel Newell </em>died, the action would have survived to the other- administrators; and by force of the statute the same consequence follows from her marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Although the plaintiffs might have brought the action in their own personal right, yet as they chose to sue as administrators, and the action lay for them in that capacity, the remaining plaintiffs may proceed in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\n<em>Plea adjudged bad</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
