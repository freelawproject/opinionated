Cushman, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0v\">relied on the above provision of the statute, as establishing the pauper\u2019s settlement derivatively from his father, in <em>Harwich; </em>and, to show that he gained no new settlement with his father in <em>Orleans, </em>cited the case of <em>Springfield </em>vs. <em>Wilbraham </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b330-9\"><em>Reed, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARI\">agreed that no settlement had been acquired by the pauper in <em>Orleans. </em>But he contended, upon the authority of the case of <em>Dillingham, Ex\u2019r, </em>vs. <em>Burgis &amp; Al. </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark>, that the privilege granted by the act of incorporation to the remonstrants, was personal to them, and had no operation upon their children after they were of age. It would operate a great hardship upon the defendants, if this provision shall be construed to fix the estates of the remonstrants to <em>Brewster, </em>and at the same time to leave their descendants chargeable to <em>Harwich.</em></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"A_Mh\"> <em>Swt </em>1802, <em>c. 76.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b330-16\"> 4 <em>Mass.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"At_\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">The pauper\u2019s father had his settlement in <em>Harwich, </em>before the act to incorporate <em>Brewster. </em>His wife and children had their settlement also under him, in <em>Harwich.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">By that act, neither the habitancy nor the settlement of the father, nor of any of his family, was changed ; for by the second section they were to remain, while they constituted his family, as if no division of the town had taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">When he removed to <em>Orleans, </em>he carried with him his right to a settlement in <em>Harwich, </em>which continued until he gained [ * 400 ] a new settlement in <em>Orleans. </em>The settlement of * his family likewise continued. When <em>Malachi, </em>the pauper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>came of age, he was capable of gaining a settlement for himself, and no longer depended upon his father for his settlement. But as he never gained any, he retained the .settlement derived from his father in <em>Harwich.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">It has been argued that the provision, in the section referred to, established a personal privilege in the remonstrants, at whose instance the provision was introduced, and in their families; so that when one of the remonstrants should die, his children coming of age would be inhabitants of <em>Brewster.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">This is true; but as the act did not operate upon the children, any more than upon the father, at the time it was passed ; and although, as they came of age, they would be inhabitants of <em>Brewster </em>if they continued to reside within the limits of that town, they would not have settlements there, by virtue of the incorporation. The pauper, however, did not remain there; but went, while under age, with his father to <em>Orleans; </em>so that he never had either habitancy or settlement in <em>Brewster.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">\n<em>Defendants defaulted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
