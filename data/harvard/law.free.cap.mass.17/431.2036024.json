The defendants join in demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b357-13\"><em>Whitman, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aj4D\">It is very clear that the proceedings against <em>Marblehead </em>furnish an estoppel to that town to question the settlement of these paupers. Now, if they are legally settled in <em>Marblehead, </em>it is certain they cannot be settled in <em>Hingham; </em>for no one can have two settlements at the same time. It is true that in cases of private concern, an estoppel applies only as between the same parties or privies; but in affairs of a public and general nature, all persons may avail themselves of an estoppel. Such was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>plainly the intent of the legislature, in the statute of 1793, <em>c. </em>59, \u00a7 9. The reason of the provision in that section extends to the present case, as much as it would to an action against the town of <em>Marblehead. </em>In the cases of <em>Leicester </em>vs. <em>Rehoboth </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>, <em>Marlborough </em>vs. <em>Rutland </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>, <em>Greene </em>vs. <em>Monmouth </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark>, and <em>Freeport </em>vs. <em>Edgecumbe </em><footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark>, it will be seen that all parties are estopped, when the matter depends on notice given and not answered. The present case is the stronger, in that the suit is for [ * 433 ] * the very sum, which the plaintiffs have recovered against the town of <em>Marblehead.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b358-6\">Thatcher, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b358-8\"> 4 <em>Mass.

The facts stated in it arose <em>inter alios. </em>None are estopped by deed or by pleadings, but parties and privies; and none others can take advantage of an estoppel. The defendants are strangers to the record in the former suit. If the plaintiffs have heretofore made a mistake in calling upon a town not liable, this furnishes no reason why they should not be permitted to call on another town, whom they ha\\e since discovered to be legally answerable.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
