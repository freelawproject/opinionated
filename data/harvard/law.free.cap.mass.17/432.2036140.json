The execution was seasonably returned into the office of the register of deeds, and was there recorded ; but the plaintiff took it from that office, before it had been returned into the clerk\u2019s office, and has ever since retained it in her possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number><em>Benajah Pond, </em>the appraiser chosen by the defendant at the time the said execution was extended, had been before that time convicted, in the Supreme Court of the state of <em>Rhode Island, </em>of the crime of passing counterfeit bank notes, knowing them to be counterfeit; and the sentence of the Court had been executed upon him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-5\">Judgment was to be entered, as the opinion of the Court should be upon these facts, upon the nonsuit of the plaintiff or the default of the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b359-6\">* Metcalf\u2018 for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_y\">The levy is not of record, [ * 434 ] and the plaintiff has therefore no title to the land. The title remains in the defendant <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-7\">The only distinction between the case at bar and that of <em>Ladd </em>vs. <em>Blunt </em>is, that here the plaintiff prevented the return of the execution. In <em>Tobey </em>vs. <em>Leonard </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>, the Court say, a creditor may decline to record the levy, if he intends not to take the lands in satisfaction. For the same reason he may prevent a return of the execution and levy into the clerk\u2019s office.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-8\">The appraiser chosen 'by the defendant was not \u201c discreet \u201d within the intention of the statute <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark>. Whether appraisers are likened to witnesses or to jurors, he was incompetent <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark>; and the plaintiff had no opportunity, until this time, to make the objection.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b359-9\"><em>Richardson </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZG\">If there were no other objection to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, it would seem to be sufficient that after judgment and satisfaction in this suit, she may cause her former execution and levy to be returned, and thus have two satisfactions of one debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-10\">In the case of <em>Ladd </em>vs. <em>Blunt, </em>it was admitted by the demurrer that there was no record of the return of the execution, and of the levy made under it; but the present case finds that there was such a record, and the plaintiff could have held the land, if she had so elected.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b359-13\"> 4 <em>Mass.

In such case the creditor is not bound to record his levy, but may waive it and avail himself of his judgment. But after seisin is delivered by the sheriff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>under a lawful levy, which devests the title of the debtor, the creditor cannot waive his levy, and resort to his judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">If in the case of <em>Ladd </em>vs. <em>Blunt, </em>the defendant, in place of demurring to the replication, had filed a rejoinder alleg- [ * 435 ] ing * that the creditor had neglected to record the execution and levy, the judgment might have been different from what it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\"><em>Plaintiff </em>nonsuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
