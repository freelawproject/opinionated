Root and Another.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b186-16\"><em>A, </em>being in failing circumstances, conveyed his estate to <em>B </em>and <em>C, </em>taking their promissory note for the value ; with intent to prevent the estate from attachment by his creditors, and to save it for the benefit of his family At the same time he transferred to them sundry securities for the payment of money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>with which they were to purchase in a previous encumbrance upon the estate; and gave them also his promise in writing, that the said note should never be collected. <em>A </em>died insolvent; and his administrator recovered judgment upon the note; although it was more than sufficient to discharge all claims upon his estate, and the surplus would go to the benefit of his family.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-5\">This was an action of <em>debt. </em>The declaration contained four counts, as to all of which, except the second, the jury found their verdict for the defendants. In the second count, the plaintiff declares on a promissory note for 5072 dollars, 43 cents, dated March 4th, 1811, made payable by the defendants to <em>Simon Lamed, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, in three years from the date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-6\">At the trial, which was had on the general issue at the last May term in this county, before <em>Wilde, </em>J., the signatures of the defendants were not controverted by <em>Root; </em>and <em>Hunt, </em>the other defendant, had been defaulted at a previous term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-7\">The defence made by <em>Root </em>was payment, or a discharge from <em>Lamed; </em>and to show such payment or discharge, he * read to the jury a paper signed by <em>Lamed, </em>of the [ * 223 ] same date with the note, in which he promised to save the said <em>Root </em>and <em>Hunt </em>harmless from the same, and that it should in no way or manner be collected to their injury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-8\">To explain the circumstances under which the said supposed discharge was given, and the intention of the parties in that transaction, the plaintiff offered to prove the confessions made by <em>Hunt, </em>the other defendant, as contained in a statement of facts made and signed by him. This evidence was objected to on the part of <em>Root, </em>principally on the ground that the plaintiff had no right to offer evidence tending to prove that the discharge was given with an intent to defraud the creditors of <em>Lamed, </em>and because <em>Hunt, </em>previous to making the confessions, had become insolvent, as was proved in the case. The objection was overruled by the judge, it being in evidence that <em>Larned\u2019s </em>estate was insolvent, unless the plaintiff should recover in this action; and that this suit was prosecuted partly for the benefit of the creditors of the estate, although the whole debt claimed is not necessary for the payment of the debts of the intestate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-9\">The said confession of <em>Hunt </em>was to the following effect, <em>viz., </em>that at the time the note in question was made, <em>Lamed </em>applied to him and <em>Root </em>to purchase the estate on which <em>Lamed </em>then lived, and upon which the bank of <em>Columbia </em>had before extended an execution against <em>Lamed </em>on account of a debt due from the <em>Berkshire </em>bank, of which he had been a director. He, at the same time, delivered to them certain promissory notes of divers persons to the amount of the sum for which they gave their note. Among the notes thug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>delivered to them, was one for 1500 dollars, payable by <em>Root </em>him self to <em>Lamed. Root </em>and <em>Hunt </em>purchased the estate of the Colum<em>lia </em>bank, giving their promissory notes for 5631 dollars, payable in one, two, and three years without interest. They then gave to <em>Lamed </em>their joint bond, conditioned to convey to him or his assigns the same estate, upon payment of the sum of [ * 224 ] 5072 dollars. *The object of the parties to this transaction was to save the property to <em>Larned\u2019s </em>family, and to guard against attachments on account of the debts of the <em>RerJcshire </em>bank. <em>Hunt </em>took into his possession all the notes delivered by <em>Lamed </em>to him and <em>Root, </em>giving the latter a receipt and promise to account to him for a moiety of the proceeds when collected. The notes were all collected by <em>Hunt, </em>except that payable by <em>Root, </em>which he assigned to <em>Whitwood Sf Swift, </em>as collateral security to them as endorsers on a note for a house, of which <em>Hunt </em>was one, and on which <em>Root </em>had been sued, and judgment had been rendered against him by agreement for 1550 dollars. But on a fair adjustment, there will be due to <em>Whitwood Sy Swift </em>100 or 200 dollars less than that judgment, which <em>Root </em>may avail himself of. Only 900 dollars have been paid by <em>Hunt </em>to the bank of <em>Columbia. </em>After <em>Hunt </em>perceived himself in failing circumstances, he made notes to <em>Root </em>and <em>learned for the amount </em>due <em>from him to them </em>respectively. Those which were payable to <em>Lamed </em>were endorsed to <em>Root, </em>and judgment had been recovered upon them, but was <em>wholly unsatisfied; </em>and <em>Hunt\u2019s </em>property had been wholly taken by others of his creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-5\">The defendant then offered another paper, signed by <em>Hunt </em>at another time, in the form of an affidavit, which had been given by him at the request of the plaintiff, and used by the plaintiff in the trial of this action, or of another, between the same parties in the Court of Common Pleas. But this being the declaration of one of the defendants, the judge was of opinion that it could not by law be admitted in evidence, and it was rejected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-6\">It was contended on behalf of the defendant <em>Root, </em>that, at most, the note and discharge, taken in connection with <em>Hunt\u2019s </em>declarations, amounted to no more than evidence of a trust and confidence reposed by <em>Lamed </em>in <em>Root </em>and <em>Hunt; </em>and that, upon this ground, <em>Root </em>could not be made responsible for more of the trust money than he had received, <em>viz., </em>one or two hundred dollars on [ * 225 ] his own note to Lamed; * and that he had acted with sufficient care in permitting <em>Hunt, </em>a practising lawyer, and the confidential friend of <em>Lamed, </em>to keep and collect the notes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-7\">On the whole evidence, the judge instructed the jury that, if they were satisfied the note was justly due, and had not been paid, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>and that the supposed discharge was made with an intent of both parties to conceal <em>Lamed\u2019s </em>property from his creditors, and to prevent them from securing the same, for the purpose of obtaining payment of their demands against him; they should find for the plaintiff on the second count, the said supposed discharge being in such case void by law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-4\">The jury accordingly returned their verdict on that count, in favor of the plaintiff for the whole amount of the note. If the direction was wrong, and the Court should be of opinion that the plaintiff was not entitled, by law, to recover, the verdict was to be set aside, and the plaintiff to become nonsuit; otherwise, judgment was to be rendered according to the verdict; or the same might be altered, and the amount of the debt reduced, in case the Court should so direct.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b189-5\"><em>Jarvis, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8q\">If this verdict is to stand, the defendant <em>Root </em>will be held to pay a great sum of money, for which he has never received the smallest consideration ; and this, in a considerable part, for the benefit of the family of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, although the whole originated in his fraudulent intention to evade the payment of money, for which the law had made him liable But we trust there are objections to the verdict, sufficient to induce, the Court to set it aside.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-6\">The statement made by the defendant <em>Hunt </em>was improperly admitted in evidence. We do not deny that the declarations or confessions of a partner are generally admissible, as against his copartner. But this is true only so long as the copartnership exists <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>. Bankruptcy or gross mismanagement operates the dissolution of a copartnership; and here, in addition to insolvency, is disclosed * as gross mismanagement and injurious conduct [ * 226 ] in <em>Hunt, </em>towards <em>Root, </em>as can be easily imagined. This written and precise statement is also very different from accidental oral confessions of a party in court, which might at the same time be explained or done away by other circumstances disclosed. But this declaration was <em>ex parte, </em>without notice to <em>Root, </em>and may have been procured by fraudulent means, out of his power to detect. These views are greatly corroborated by the fact that <em>Hunt, </em>after wards, and upon more deliberate recollection, gave an account, undei oath, differing materially from that which was read in evidence <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-7\">The last fact goes strongly to show that the second statement should have been received to explain the former one. It was under oath, given at the plaintiff\u2019s instance, and had been used by him in another trial. It must, therefore, be taken for true, as it relates to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>the plaintiff, who would be estopped to deny it. It may, indeed, be considered as his own confession. He has acknowledged the truth of it by producing it in evidence heretofore.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-5\">It is respectfully suggested that the instruction to the jury that, if they found the discharge to be fraudulent, the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict, was not correct. The discharge was not fraudulent, inasmuch as it went to avoid the note, and left the defendants liable to <em>Lamed\u2019s </em>creditors as his trustees. The fraud was in giving the note, and the attention of the jury should have been directed to that object.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-6\">If the discharge was fraudulent, so was the note also, and consequently void. They were parts of the same transaction; and the remedy of the plaintiff was for the consideration. Then <em>Moot, </em>as trustee, would be answerable only for the money he had actually received <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-7\">An administrator cannot take advantage of his intestate\u2019s fraud for the benefit of creditors <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark>. Or, if this be not so, yet [ * <em>227 </em>] it is clearly wrong that he should do it further * than the amount of the claims on the estate shall justify; certainly not for the benefit of the heirs of the fraudulent party.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-8\">If, then, the plaintiff is entitled to recover any thing in this action, the amount found by the verdict should be reduced to such a sum as shall equal the existing lawful claims against the estate of the intestate <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-9\"><em>Howe, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\"> <em>Watson on Partnership, </em>280.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b189-9\"> 3 <em>Johns. </em>250, 252.\u201410 <em>Johns. </em>66.\u20146 <em>Johns. </em>267.\u20144 <em>Mass.

It is the confession of a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">The other statement of <em>Hunt, </em>made at a different time, was not legal evidence when offered by the defendant; for it was the declaration of a party in his own favor. If <em>Hunt </em>had been viewed in the light of a witness, it would have been competent to use subsequent declarations, to impeach prior ones. But here is a party; and it is as if the action had been tried against <em>Hunt </em>alone, in which case his own subsequent declaration could not be used tc impair the effect of a previous confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>The plaintiff\u2019s having used the second declaration in another trial, cannot oblige him to receive it now as evidence. Then, he used him as a witness, and was obliged to content himself with all he was willing to swear to. Here he has his confession, which he has a right to make use of against <em>Hunt </em>or his partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The objection to <em>Hunt\u2019s </em>statement, that it is the confession of a partner after the copartnership, cannot prevail. For it is the confession of facts which took place before the dissolution; and it may be doubted whether the joint interest is dissolved, until the note is paid. Bankruptcy in <em>England </em>is widely different from a mere inability to pay one\u2019s debts here.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">*It was suggested that the statement of <em>Hunt </em>might f * 228 ] have been procured improperly, by surprise or collusion. This may be objected to all confessions and all evidence. The answer is, that if facts of the kind are proved, the effect of such evidence will be destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The direction of the judge to the jury, that if the discharge of the note was fraudulent, their verdict should be for the plaintiff, we think was entirely correct. For if that was fraudulent, it left the note good and valid. There was an adequate consideration for the note; no one can doubt <em>Hunt\u2019s </em>liability upon it, and if he was liable, it follows that <em>Root </em>was equally so. For he voluntarily engaged himself with <em>Hunt; </em>and, indeed, the consideration came to him as much as to <em>Hunt; </em>and he would have had the benefit of it, but for his confidence in <em>Hunt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">But it is said, that if it were fraudulent, this discharge cannot be avoided, so as to set up the note ; and this would be true if <em>Lamed </em>were living, and endeavoring to avail himself of the note. But his creditors may do it, and the administrator, who represents the creditors, may show the fraud to avoid the receipt. Assignees of a bankrupt might do it. If this were not so, it would be easy for men to provide for their families, to the prejudice of their creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Nor does it make any difference, that less than the amount of the note is wanted for the creditors, and that the surplus will go to the heirs of the intestate. This is but an incident to the right of the administrator to recover for the use of the creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">The fifth section of the \u201c act regulating the descent and distribu tian of intestate estates,\u201d provides for the recovery of real estate fraudulently conveyed, for the benefit of creditors. This is a necessary provision, because the intestate did not die seised; but no such provision is needful for the recovery of debts due to the intestate <footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">With respect to the position, that <em>Root </em>is to be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>as trustee, and, so, answerable only for what he has [ * 229 ] * actually received; we cannot view him in this light. He was indebted to the full amount of the note, equally with <em>Hunt. </em>The object of <em>Lamed </em>was to have the security of <em>Root. </em>It was only through the consent of <em>Root </em>that <em>Hunt </em>had all the property; and if <em>Root </em>suffers from misplaced confidence in <em>Hunt, </em>it is to be lamented; but not to be remedied by us.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(6)\">\n<p id=\"Apr\"> <em>Stat. </em>1805, <em>c. </em>90.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
