The statute under consideration was most clearly intended to prevent a multiplicity of suits. To effect this desirable purpose, it should receive the most liberal construction; particularly as it is not expressed in technical language. By \u201c moneys paid,\u201d must naturally [ * 67 ] * be understood any moneys paid to or received by the plaintiff, or for his use and benefit <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-6\"><em>Saltonstall, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AA\">There are two statutes upon this subject. The first is that of 1784, c. 28, &lt;\u00a7&gt;12, which provides that, \u201c when an action shall be brought to recover a debt on book accounts, an account stated by the parties, a <em>quantum meruit, quantum valebat, </em>or for services done upon an agreed price, the defendant may file <em>any account </em>he hath, in the clerk\u2019s office,\u201d &amp;c. Under this provision, the defendant could not claim to set off his demand, because the action is not within the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-8\">But the statute of 1793, c. 75, revising the whole subject matter of the prior one, must operate as a repeal of it <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark>. It is evident that the last was intended as a substitute for the first. Probably the actions, in which accounts might be filed under the former law, were found to be too limited; and the permission to file <em>any account, </em>too general.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-9\">If, however, the first statute is still in force, then the account filed is not within either. It is an established rule, that all acts iny <em>pari materie </em>are to be taken as if they were one law <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-10\">The account cannot be filed under the first provision, because the action is for <em>money paid; </em>nor under the second, because accounts can only be filed, by- that statute, in actions for goods delivered, moneys paid, or services done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-11\">This is a mere statute regulation. In <em>England, </em>similar statutes have received a strict construction <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark>. There is no reason in equity, which entitles them to any other construction ; for the defendant, in all cases, has an ample remedy by action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-12\">A. charge for money had and received is not within the meaning of goods delivered, moneys paid, or services done; and it cannot, therefore, be filed <footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b62-14\"> <em>Plowd. </em>57.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"Aky\"> <em>Plowd. </em>232.\u20141 <em>Co. 110.\u2014Dr. and Student, </em>856.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(3)\">\n<p id=\"b62-15\"> 12 <em>Mass.

It is a very useful provision, and therefore claims a liberal construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The plaintiff objects that the defendant\u2019s demand is not within the statute, because it is neither for goods delivered, moneys paid, or services done. But we must not be too nice in the construction of a remedial statute like this. <em>Where money is in the hands of one party, which belongs to another, it is no great straining of language to call it money paid </em><footnotemark>(7)</footnotemark>. It would not be insisted, if a demand for goods delivered were filed by the defendant, that the goods should actually have been delivered by him, and received by the plaintiff, on account of the same cause of action. So money in the hands of the plaintiff, and due to the defendant, need not have been paid by the latter in satisfaction of the sum demanded in the action. Independent accounts may be set off, and the balance makes the debt. There can be no inconvenience in this, as the plaintiff is by the statute entitled to notice; and if the defendant\u2019s demand is not sufficiently explicit, the Court can require of him an explanation, in the nature of a bill of particulars. We are all of opinion that the set-off claimed in the case at bar is within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\"><em>New trial </em>granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(7)\">\n<p id=\"b63-7\"> [This is so palpably wrong that no comment is necessary.\u2014Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
