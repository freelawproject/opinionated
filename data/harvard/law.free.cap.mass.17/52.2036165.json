The execution was then [ * 65 ] delivered to another officer, who * levied the same upon the land demanded in this action, as the estate of which one <em>Levi Mills </em>had died seised.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-8\">The said <em>Mills, </em>in September, 1817, purchased a share in the capital stock of the said, corporation, and retained the same until his death in the following November.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-9\">The tenants are the heirs at law of the said <em>Mills.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-10\">Upon these facts appearing at the trial before the chief justice, at the last April term in <em>Ipswich, </em>a nonsuit was directed, subject to the opinion of <em>the </em>whole Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b60-11\"><em>Mosely, </em>for the demandant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ae3\">The only difficulty arises from the circumstance of <em>Mills </em>dying before the levy of the execution and rendition of the judgment. But in other cases of contract, the estate of a deceased contractor is still liable; and an equitable construction of the statute, and such a one as would give to it the operation clearly intended by the legislature, will sustain the demandant\u2019s title in this case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b60-12\"><em>Pickering </em>and <em>Oerrish, </em>for the tenants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Ay6\">\n<em>By the Court.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A6v\">There is no question in our minds, respecting the constitutional authority of the legislature to enact the law on which the demandant\u2019s claim to the land is predicated. Indeed, considering the well-known condition of many of the manufacturing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>corporations in the state, the necessity of legislative interposition for the safety of their creditors cannot be doubted. But we must give to the statute such a construction as shall not go beyond its necessary intendment. The provision is, that a creditor, in a rertain case, may levy his execution upon the body or estate of any member of the corporation. This must be understood of such as were members at the time of the commencement of the action, and of those only. In the case before us, <em>Mills, </em>whose estate was seized and levied upon, had ceased by his death to be a member of the corporation before the suit was brought. His estate was not then liable within the intent of the statute, and the demandant acquired no title to the demanded premises by his levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\"><em>Judgment for the </em>tenants,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
