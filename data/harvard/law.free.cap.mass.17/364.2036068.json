On the trial, which was ha.d on the general issue, before <em>Wilde, </em>J., at the sittings here after the last October term, the following facts were disclosed :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-5\">The tenant <em>Barnes, </em>on the 7th of May, 1817, lent to one <em>David, S. Ingersoll </em>2000 dollars, on a mortgage of the demanded premises. On the 3d of August, 1818, a suit was brought by <em>Barnes </em>for the recovery of the possession * of the mort- [ * 366 J gaged premises. In that suit <em>Ingersoll </em>appeared, and put in a plea of usury, offering to support the plea by his own oath, according to the statute. But <em>Barnes, </em>on the Court\u2019s inquiring of him whether he was prepared to negative the said plea, and to swear that he had not, directly or indirectly, taken or received more than after the rate of six per cent, on the loan, did swear to that effect; whereupon the Court awarded him the usual judgment for possession. As soon afterwards as his judgment entitled him, <em>Barnes </em>received from the sheriff seisin and possession of the mortgaged premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-6\">Afterwards, on the 9th of December, <em>Ingersoll, </em>for the considera tian of 50 dollars, quitclaimed, sold and conveyed by deed <em>all his ~ight, title, and interest, </em>in the premises, to the present demandant <em>Adams, </em>who was well acquainted with all the preceding facts, and on the 13th of December, 1819, brought the present action, for the recovery of the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-7\">The demandant offered evidence to prove usury on the original contract between <em>Ingersoll </em>and <em>Barnes, </em>which was objected to by the tenant. <em>Ingersoll, </em>also, was offered as a witness to prove the usury, and was objected to; but both the objections were overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-8\">The tenant then contended that the former judgment was an estoppel to the demandant, and that no evidence ought to be admitted, to try the question of usury in the present action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-9\">The judge overruled this objection, reserving the question for the Court. The trial proceeded, and the jury found a verdict for the demandant; which was taken, subject to the opinion of the Court upon the facts and objections above stated; the tenant moving for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b303-10\"><em>W.

He had nothing left in him but the right in equity to redeem. He could no longer question the right of the mortgagee.

The estate passed unencumbered. If the demandant, then, can show that conveyance to be void, for usury or any other cause, he has a good right to judgment for the land <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark>. The tenant should have pleaded the judgment, if he relied on it as an estoppel. If the judgment in the former action could be given in evidence without pleading, the demandant might well impeach it by any evidence, as perjury on the first trial.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b303-11\"> 9 <em>Mass.

Whether the former judgment was an estoppel to the demandant; and, 2dly, If so, whether the tenant could avail himself of it, without pleading it. We are of opinion with the tenant on both questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">As to the first point, it is clear that the judgment estopped <em>Ingersoll, </em>the mortgagor. <em>Barnes </em>had brought his action to recover the land now in controversy, claiming it by virtue of the mortgage <em>Ingersoll </em>made a defence, which, if proved, would have avoided the mortgage. But the defence was not maintained, and <em>Barnes\u2019s </em>title was established by that judgment; and <em>Ingersoll </em>was thereby concluded from disputing that title again upon the same ground. We think it equally clear that the judgment estops the demandant. It is such an estoppel as runs with the land, and extends to all who are privies in estate to either of the parties to that judgment. A judgment, which affects directly the estate and interest [ * 368 ] in the land, and * binds the right of the parties, is at least as effectual as a release or confirmation, by one party to the other. Such an estoppel makes part of the title to the land, and extends to all who claim under either of the parties to it <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Estoppels are said to be odious; but when they constitute part of the assurance and title to the land, as in the present case, they are founded in the strongest equity and justice, and are entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>the most favorable consideration. By the former judgment, <em>Ingersoll </em>had lost his title to this land, so far as it was affected by the mortgage; and <em>Barnes </em>had acquired a right, which was indefeasible as between him and <em>Ingersoll, </em>to hold possession of the land, until his debt was paid. It would then be highly inequitable, if <em>Ingersoll </em>could convey to a stranger the right to bring <em>Barnes\u2019s </em>title again into doubt and controversy. <em>Ingersoll, </em>also, after that judgment, had no estate left in him, excepting the right of redemption ; and his grantee could not, in justice or equity, claim any greater or better estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The estoppel, in the present case, is also founded on those prin ciples of law, which are intended to repress litigation, and to prevent a multiplicity of suits. If the demandant could now contest <em>Barnes\u2019s </em>title under that mortgage, it must be that <em>Ingersoll </em>had assigned to him a mere right of action; which is prohibited by law. Again, if the demandant could purchase that right of action, he might also sell it; and, therefore, if he should try this action on its merits, and fail to recover, he might, on the same principle, assign the right to another, who should bring a new action; and that assignee, in the like event, might assign it to a third; and there would be no end to the litigation, so long as an individual could be found, who would be willing to risk the costs of a suit, for the chance of recovering the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">As to the second question, it is settled that an estoppel like the present, which affects the title and estate, shall in general have the same effect when offered in evidence, as when specially pleaded. The exception is, when the point * in question [ * 369 ] is presented by the pleadings, and is alleged or denied as the case may be, and the other party, instead of pleading the estoppel, puts the question of fact to the jury. The case before cited of <em>Trevivan </em>vs. <em>Lawrence </em>presents an example of the general rule, and of the exception; and the doctrine was recognized by this Court in the case of <em>Howard </em>vs. <em>Mitchell </em><footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark>, and in that of the <em>Commonwealth </em>vs. <em>Pejepscut Proprietors </em><footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark>. The case at bar is clearly not within the exception. The declaration contains no inti motion of the origin of the demandant\u2019s title; and it would have been irregular, if it had. The demandant counts on his own seisin in fee, and alleges a disseisin by the tenant. The latter could not know, from such a declaration, that the demandant\u2019s title was derived from <em>Ingersoll. </em>He was not bound, nor would it even be safe for him to rely merely on the estoppel to <em>Ingersoll </em>and his assigns Under such a declaration and the general issue, the demandant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>at liberty to show a right of possession in himself by any title, ana any evidence in his power; and the tenant might, in like manner, rebut the demandant\u2019s evidence, and show a right of entry or of possession in himself. If an estoppel, by judgment or otherwise, made part of the tenant\u2019s title, it was no more necessary.for him to plead it, than it would have been to set forth in a special plea all his title deeds, and every other part of his evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">A case might have arisen out of this transaction, which would have required the estoppel to be specially pleaded. Suppose that in that former suit the mortgage had been proved to be usurious, and <em>Ingersoll </em>had accordingly recovered judgment; this would have been an estoppel to <em>Barnes, </em>and all persons claiming under him. If, then, he had assigned the mortgage to a stranger, and the assignee had brought a new suit on it, the assignee ought regularly to set forth in his declaration the mortgage to <em>Barnes, </em>and the assign ment of it to himself. In such a case <em>Ingersoll </em>would [ * 370 ] know that the plaintiff had no title, but as assignee *of <em>Barnes. </em>He might, therefore, plead the usury, with a verification as at common law; and if it was denied by the plaintiff, <em>Ingersoll </em>might rejoin the former judgment by way of estoppel. If, instead of such a rejoinder, he should take issue on the replication, or if he should plead the usury in the manner provided by the statute, offering to prove it by his own oath, he would in either case waive, and lose the advantage of, the estoppel <footnotemark>(7)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The rules of pleading, and of evidence, that we have been considering, do not prevent the tenant, in any real action, from setting forth his title in a plea in bar, giving color, when he shall find it useful. In the case at bar, he might, perhaps, have set forth, in such a plea, the former seisin of <em>Ingersoll, </em>the mortgage to himself, and the assignment by <em>Ingersoll </em>to <em>Adams; </em>and if the demandant had replied that the mortgage was usurious, <em>Barnes </em>might have rejoined the former judgment by way of estoppel. But the only reason of giving color is, that the plea would otherwise amount to the general issue; and of course all the material facts in such a plea might be given in evidence under the general issue. A defendant is, therefore, never required to plead in that manner, and shall not lose any material advantage by omitting to do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The verdict is set aside, and</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">\n<em>A new trial ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(4)\">\n<p id=\"b304-12\"> 1 <em>Salk. </em>276, <em>Trevivan </em>vs. Lawrence.\u20143 <em>Salk. </em>151, S.
