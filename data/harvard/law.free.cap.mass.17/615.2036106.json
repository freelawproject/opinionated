The last of these, in order of time, is that of <em>Emerson </em>vs. <em>Cutts </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>. There the court being of opinion that the note had not, in fact, been <em>paid </em>by the last endorser, the point now presented was merely alluded to. The next case prior to that is the case of <em>Boylston </em>vs. <em>Greene </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>. There the last endorser, having paid the note, again negotiated it, and the new endorsee brought an action upon it against a prior endorser; and the court held that the action could not be maintained. They seemed, however, to say, that they perceived no good reason for the rule ; but, as they found it laid down generally, that a bill or note, being once paid, ceased to be negotiable, they were inclined to adhere to it. The only remaining case is that of <em>Blake </em>vs. <em>Sewell </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark>. This was, in fact, amerems* <em>prius </em>decision. <em>Dana, </em>C. J., directed the jury, that a note, having been once paid, ceased to be negotiable; and a majority of the justices present at the trial concurred in the direction. Yet this was the authority relied upon in <em>Boylston </em>vs. <em>Greene, </em>where the Court say that this rule had been laid down <em>generally. </em>The case of <em>Blake </em>vs. <em>Sewell </em>was decided solely upon the authority of the case of <em>Beck </em>vs. <em>Robley </em><footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-5\">In this last case, <em>Brown </em>drew a bill upon <em>Robley, </em>payable to <em>Hodgson </em>or order. <em>Hodgson </em>negotiated it. <em>Robley </em>* did not pay it, when it came to maturity; and <em>Brown, </em>[ * 617 ] the drawer, took it up, and afterwards transferred it to <em>Beck, </em>who brought this action upon it against the acceptor. A verdict being found for the defendant, on the ground that the bill ceased to be negotiable, when paid by the drawer, a new trial was moved for, but refused; <em>\u201c </em>for,\u201d said Lord <em>Mansfield, </em>\u201c if it were negotiable, <em>Hodgson </em>would be liable, for which there is no color.\u201d The only ground of the decision then was, that <em>Hodgson, </em>who had been discharged by payment of the bill by <em>a. prior </em>party, might be exposed to injury by a new negotiation ; and the reason given shows that if <em>Hodgson, </em>the last party to the bill, had paid it, he might have negotiated it again.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-6\">Indeed, the law had been distinctly so settled before, in the case of <em>Gomez Serra </em>vs. <em>Berkley </em><footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark>; and if the reason given by Lord <em>Mansfield </em>is not sufficient to prove that nothing is to be found in the case of <em>Beck </em>vs. <em>Robley, </em>inconsistent with the position now taken by the plaintiff, the fact that the case from <em>Wilson, </em>in which the law had been settled, was not mentioned as overruled, clearly shows that the case of <em>Beck </em>vs. <em>Robley, </em>so far from impugning the doctrine contended for, confirms it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>So <em>Bayley </em>understood the case of <em>Beck </em>vs. <em>Bobley, </em>and cites it as authority for the proposition, <em>\u201c </em>that a bill or note cannot be endorsed or negotiated, after it has been once paid; <em>if such endorsement or negotiation would make any of the parties liable, </em>who would otherwise be <em>discharged </em>\u201d <footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-5\">Further, it can never be supposed that the last endorser pays a note in order to extinguish it; but merely to redeem himself from the situation in which he stands as endorser. When the note comes back to him, he is remitted to his original rights, and holds an instrument of the same nature, and possessing the same legal qualities, that he did before he made the negotiation. So it may be said in the present case; for this note was never discharged, as between <em>Littlefield </em>and the defendants, or as\u00b0between [ * 618 ] <em>*the </em>plaintiff and the defendants. This doctrine is fully illustrated and confirmed in the recent case of <em>Callon vs. Lawrence </em><footnotemark>(7)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-6\">There cannot therefore be any doubt what the law now is, or what it always has been, in <em>England. </em>In this commonwealth, the case of <em>Boylston </em>vs. <em>Green, </em>resting entirely upon that of <em>Blake </em>vs. <em>Sewell, </em>and this upon the case of <em>Beck </em>vs. <em>Robley, </em>is without any well-derived authority to support it. Nor does it seem to have been much contested ; the Court yielding, with apparent reluctance, to what was supposed to be a well-settled authority. If, therefore, upon a reexamination, they shall find that the extent of former decisions has been misapprehended, it is humbly presumed, that they will go beyond erroneous decisions, and now establish the only true and convenient rule upon the subject.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b508-7\"><em>Leland, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AU1\">It has been often observed in courts of law,\u2014and the observation should always have great weight,\u2014that it is of more importance that rules should be established and known, than whether those rules are originally founded in the purest and highest reason. The state of the law must be acknowledged to be wretched indeed, when the solemn decisions of the highest judicial tribunal, published under the authority of the state, are not to be considered as precedents, to be relied on in cases in all respects similar. The case of <em>Boylston </em>vs. <em>Greene </em>is precisely like the present case. Yet the Court are urged to hold it for naught, to go behind it to find authorities in the books of other countries, wearing a different aspect. It is respectfully believed that this Court will hold itself bound by its own well-considered opinions, and that the same law will be administered to every suitor in similar cases.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\"> 12 <em>Mass.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALF\">The nonsuit, in this case, was ordered upon the strength of two decisions of this Court, in which *it was settled that, when a negotiable instrument had [ * 619 ] been paid and taken up by any party to it, it ceased to be negotiable; and this, since the decisions referred to, has been taken to be the law in this commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The first case alluded to is that of <em>Blake </em>vs. <em>Sewell, </em>a short ac count of which is published in an appendix to the third volume of our reports; the case having been decided in the year 1799, which was before our series of reports commenced. The note on which the action was brought was made by <em>Wilson </em>to <em>Sewell, </em>or order, and endorsed by <em>Sewell </em>to <em>Pomeroy, </em>who endorsed it in blank, and delivered it, for a valuable consideration, to <em>Rogers, </em>who lodged it in the Bank of the United States for collection. It was there paid by <em>Pomeroy, </em>who took it up, and delivered it, for a valuable consideration, to the plaintiff in the action, his endorsement and that of <em>Sewell </em>remaining on it. There were several points of defence in the action; but that upon which the Court decided was the general proposition, that the note, having been paid at the bank by <em>Pomeroy, </em>ceased to be negotiable; and the authority, upon which the Court, relied, was the case of <em>Beck </em>vs. <em>Robley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The other case, decided by this Court, is that of <em>Boylston </em>vs. <em>Greene. </em>In this case the defendant was payee, and first endorser of the note. It had been lodged in the <em>Norwich </em>bank by <em>Lathrop, </em>the endorsee, who paid and took it up, and then assigned it, for a valuable consideration, to the plaintiff in the suit. The case of <em>Blake </em>vs. <em>Sew-ell </em>was relied upon in the defence; and the Court decided that the case came within the principle settled in the former case, and that the plaintiff could not recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">In the opinion given by the Court in the last case, pretty strong intimations were thrown out, that they yielded reluctantly to the authority of <em>Blake </em>vs. <em>Sewell; </em>especially as the whole effect of preventing the plaintiff from recovering would be to give occasion to an action in the name of Lathrop, for the benefit of his assignee, the plaintiff in the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">* We have been called upon now to revise these de- [ * 620 ] cisions; and some authorities have been cited, and some arguments advanced, which have induced us to look more thoroughly into this question than either we or our predecessors seem to have done on the former occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">There is no doubt that in <em>England, </em>at this day, the proposition which has been received here without qualification, that a nego<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>tiable note, once paid, cannot afterwards be transferred, is restrained to cases, where, by such transfer, some party to the bill or note might be prejudiced, or troubled with a suit, who ought to be discharged. As, for instance, if there be several endorsers, none shall be allowed to transfer it but the last; because, if the note is taken up by any prior endorser, and again put in circulation by him, the subsequent endorsers may be exposed to a suit by the new assignee. But where no such consequence will follow, an assignment by the party taking up the bill is lawful, and the assignee may maintain an action upon it in his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">This seems to be a reasonable distinction; and it appears by an examination of the case of <em>Beck </em>vs. <em>Robley, </em>upon which alone the case of <em>Blake </em>vs. <em>Sewell </em>rests, that nothing more was decided than that an assignment of the latter character, <em>viz., </em>one which might prejudice some party to the instrument, who was legally discharged, could not be made. The reason which finally satisfied Lord <em>Mansfield </em>in this case, he having thought at the trial that the action was maintainable, was, that if the assignment was good, <em>Hodgson, </em>in whose favor the bill was drawn, and who had returned it to <em>Brown, </em>would be liable. <em>Brown </em>was the drawer of the bill, and when it was returned by <em>Hodgson, </em>he paid him the amount; <em>Hodgson\u2019s </em>name having been before endorsed upon the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The true character of this case seems not to have been considered when the attention of the Court was heretofore drawn to this question. Certainly the only point settled by it is, that where [ * 621 ] the putting of the bill or note into circulation *anew will endanger a party who ought not to be charged, then it cannot be negotiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The case reported by Sergeant <em>Wilson </em>cannot be law if the decision in the case of <em>Beck </em>vs. <em>Robley </em>went so far as has heretofore been supposed by the Court. In this latter case the payees of a promissory note endorsed it to <em>Gomez, </em>the plaintiff in the action. They took it back again, and paid the plaintiff the amount. After-wards, upon a new consideration, they again passed it to the plaintiff ; and although the objection was taken that the note had been once paid, the plaintiff recovered. Now, this is perfectly consistent with <em>Beck </em>vs. <em>Robley, </em>according to the view of that case as above given; but wholly inconsistent with it in the view that has been taken of it heretofore. It may be justly inferred that, as the case in <em>Wilson </em>was not even cited, much less overruled, in the case of <em>Beck </em>vs. <em>Robley, </em>the limited is the true construction of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">But a late case in the King\u2019s Bench has brought these cases distinctly before the court, and has settled the law in that country, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>the plaintiff in this action would wish to have it settled here. In the case referred to, one <em>Pywell </em>drew his bill on <em>Lawrence, </em>payable to himself or order. <em>Lawrence, </em>the defendant in the action, accepted the bill. It was then just like a promissory note payable to <em>Pywell </em>or order. He endorsed it to <em>Taylor, </em>and <em>Taylor </em>to <em>Barnett, </em>who paid it to his bankers. When it became due, the bankers presented it; but not being paid, it was returned to <em>Barnett. </em>A week after this, <em>Pywell, </em>the first endorser, called on <em>Barnett, </em>and paid the amount. <em>Barnett </em>struck out his and <em>Taylor\u2019s </em>endorsements, and delivered the bill to <em>Pywell; </em>and six months after this <em>Pywell </em>paid it to <em>Call\u00f3n, </em>the plaintiff. The case of <em>Beck </em>vs. <em>Robley </em>was cited, but was held not to be like the principal case; because in this there was not any name left upon the bill to be prejudiced. All the judges, in giving their opinions, deem it necessary to distinguish the case from that of <em>Beck </em>vs. <em>Robley; </em>which they do effectually by showing that <em>Hodgson\u2019s </em>name was * left <em>[*622] </em>on the bill; whereas, in the case before them, the endorsements subsequent to <em>Pywell\u2019s </em>were struck out.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Now, in our cases, the assignment was made by the last endorser, ' so that no one could be prejudiced who was not legally bound to pay; and, in the case before us, it was the payee himself who took up the bill, there being no endorsement upon it but his own ; which is making it precisely like the case of <em>Callon </em>vs. <em>Lawrence. </em>So that in <em>England, </em>such an action as the one now before us, would unquestionably be sustained. It may not be amiss to remark that among the justices of the King\u2019s Bench, who decided this case, is <em>Bayley, </em>the author of one of the most approved treatises upon bills of exchange; in which book, long before this case came up, he had stated the law to be as adopted and sanctioned by the court; having given the construction to <em>Beck </em>vs. <em>Robley, </em>which is now thought the true one.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">In this state of things, the law being clearly settled in <em>England, </em>the cases in our court having been decided upon a mistaken consideration of the case of <em>Beck </em>vs. <em>Robley, </em>and reason and convenience being altogether in favor of the <em>English </em>doctrine as now understood ; and, furthermore, it being settled here that the interest in the note would pass to the plaintiff in this action, so that the only effect of adhering to the former decisions would be to oblige him to bring his action in the name of his assignor; we have only to consider whether it is expedient to overrule the former decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The importance of adhering to decisions once deliberately made will always be duly estimated by judicial tribunals. Every motive, personal and public, is in favor of it. But when a whole bench shall be unanimous in their opinion that any former decision of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>own or of others is wrong, the duty is as imperative to overrule it, as it is to adhere, where there may only be doubts of its correctness. This is especially proper in cases which may be overruled [ * 623 ] without danger to commerce, or any * infringement of established rules of property. And the opinion, which we have now come to, makes no other change than to give a right of action directly, where it might be had indirectly, in a case where no one can possibly be injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The nonsuit is set aside, and a new trial granted <footnotemark>(8)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(8)\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\"> [See note to <em>Blake </em>vs. <em>Sewell, </em>3 <em>Mass. </em>556.\u2014Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
