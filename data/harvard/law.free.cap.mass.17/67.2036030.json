The three heirs were <em>Samuel W., Rebecca W., </em>one of the tenants, and <em>Adam W.\u2014Samuel W. </em>died about two years after his father.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-6\">After the death of the first-named <em>Adam W., </em>viz. in July, 1789, the said <em>Mercy </em>had dower assigned to her in the demanded premises, although not legally entitled thereto, and she still holds the same. Some time afterwards <em>Rebecca W. </em>was married to <em>Simeon Wood, </em>the tenant, and on the 28th of January, 1800, they joined in a conveyance of all the interest in the estate, which descended to her from her father, and from her brother <em>Samuel, </em>to <em>Mercy W., </em>who, with her children, and the lawful heirs of the first-mentioned <em>Adam W., </em>had occupied the land in question from the time of his decease, forming one family.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-7\">Afterwards <em>Adam W., </em>the testator, left the family of <em>Mercy W. </em>and was lawfully married to <em>Nancy Brown; </em>soon after which, <em>viz </em>in January, 1800, he made his will, containing the following devise, <em>viz., \u201c </em>I give and bequeath unto my well-beloved wife, <em>Nancy Well-man, </em>all my estate, real, personal, and mixed; goods, chattels, and estate whatsoever, or wheresoever they may be found, belonging unto me for any cause whatsoever,\u201d and constituted his wife sole executrix. Soon after which he died; and the will was proved by the oaths of two of the subscribing witnesses, the third not being examined, nor any reason assigned on the record why he was not present and sworn. There was no recital of notice being given before the probate. The said <em>Nancy </em>declining the trust of executrix, administration with the will annexed was committed to one <em>Timothy Wellman.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-8\"><em>Mercy W., </em>knowing of the will, still continued in the undisturbed possession of the premises, holding the same for all who [ * 70 ] were interested in it. Believing, however, * that her two children were entitled to shares in the first-mentioned <em>Adam W.\u2019s </em>estate, as well as the three heirs before mentioned, and that <em>Nancy W. </em>was entitled to the share of her husband, the testator ; she was ready to deliver up her share, or to pay over to her a fifth part of the rent (which she conceived to be her proportion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>thereof) when called upon. But the said <em>Nancy </em>never received nor demanded any rent, nor did the said <em>Mercy </em>ever offer to pay her any.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-5\">The said <em>Mercy W. </em>continued her occupation of the premises until March, 1816, when the present tenants, claiming a moiety thereof, as the inheritance of <em>Rebecca Wood, </em>petitioned for partition; which being granted, the parcel of land demanded in this suit was set off to the petitioners (no one of record opposing their right thereto), and they are now in possession of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-6\"><em>Timothy W., </em>when appointed administrator, gave bond according to law, and in March, 1804, was duly licensed to sell so much of the real estate of the testator as should be necessary for the payment of the debts due from the estate. A sale at auction was accordingly duly notified in the same year, but no sale was effected at that time; but in August, 1816, the said <em>Timothy, </em>administrator as aforesaid, and claiming authority under the said license, sold all the estate of the testator at auction, for a sum very incompetent to the payment of the debts due from the estate. He never paid any of the debts, nor rendered any account of his administration; and it is agreed that his sale at auction was illegal and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-7\">Soon after the death of <em>Adam W., </em>the testator, <em>Simeon Wood </em>demanded the estate in question in right of his wife, and continued such demand until he effected his partition; but his claim was continually opposed by <em>Timothy Wellman, </em>jun., one of <em>Mercy W.\u2019s </em>children, on the ground that he was himself entitled as one of the heirs of the first-mentioned <em>Adam W. </em>in his own right; and <em>Wood\u2019s </em>claim was likewise opposed by <em>Mercy W., </em>on the ground that he had no * interest in the estate in right of his wife. [ * <em>71 </em>] But at the time of making such opposition, the said <em>Timothy, </em>jun., did not live on the land, nor constitute a part of his said mother\u2019s family. The said <em>Mercy W., </em>without authority or opposition from the heirs, removed a warehouse standing on the land which descended from <em>Adam W., </em>the father, to another part of the same land, converted it into a dwelling-house, and received rent for the same for many years, for which rent, as well as the rents or profits of the land demanded in this action, she has never accounted to any person. The said <em>Timothy W. </em>was of age when the said <em>Adam W. </em>died.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-8\">The demandants are heirs at law of <em>Nancy W., </em>wife of <em>Adam W., </em>the testator; and the said <em>Nancy W. </em>died in the year 1804.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-9\">Judgment was to be entered for the demandants, or the tenants, as the opinion of the Court should be upon the facts stated. The cause was argued at the last November term, and continued to this term under advisement.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>Mack, </em>for the tenants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aiz\">The will of <em>Adam W. </em>was not duly proved, and consequently the devise to his wife never took effect. It is essential to the valid probate of a will of lands, that the three subscribing witnesses be present and examined, if alive and within the reach of the process of the Court <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>. This Court, in the first case cited, refused to examine the two witnesses, until the third was produced, or his absence accounted for. Another defect in the probate in this case, is the want of previous notice to the heirs of the testator, of the time and place of probate, which is a matter of common right, and not to be dispensed with. There can be no presumption, in this case, in favor of the proceedings, since possession has not followed the devise. If possession had followed the will, perhaps it would be too late to object to the probate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-5\">The devise was but of an estate for life. The words \u201c <em>all my estate\u201d </em>do not necessarily convey a fee; and these are the f * 72 ] only words in the will, which can be at all * relied on in the present case <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>. The testator seems rather to intend to embrace the several distinct kinds of property, which he owned, than to limit the estate or interest which the devisee was to have under the will. The words, \u201cwhatsoever, or wheresoever they may be found, belonging unto me,\u201d amount to a location of the estate devised, and have the same effect as if he had said, \u201c all my estate in <em>S.,\u201d </em>which would have created but a life estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-6\">The testator was never seised. The supposed widow held the whole estate, claiming a part of it for her illegitimate children; and of one third she was seised as tenant in dower, of which the testator was entitled to the reversion only. But, in fact, the pretended widow held the whole, received all the rents and profits, without accounting, or being called on to account, and made essential alterations in the buildings, such as none but one claiming a fee would presume to make ; and all this without opposition from the heirs, or any claim for possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-7\">The devisee never accepted the devise. She never entered upon the land. Indeed she expressly refused to execute the will, knowing probably that the testator had died insolvent, and that she could, therefore, derive no benefit from his intended bounty <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark>. Actual seisin is the taking of corporal possession <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b66-8\"><em>Oliver, </em>for. the demandants.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b66-9\"> 2 <em>Mass.

The objection to the sufficiency of the probate of the will of <em>Adam </em>Wellman. jun., comes too late. Upon the common presumptions in favor of every judicial tribunal, acting within its jurisdiction, we must suppose that all persons concerned had due notice. The presumption in the present case is strengthened by the knowledge we have, that in many counties it was not customary to mention in the decree that such notice had been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">We must also suppose that there was a legal excuse for the ab sence of the third subscribing witness to the will. Various reasons may have existed, which would furnish * such an [ * 73 ] excuse; and as to this also, it was not customary to state such reasons in the decree. It is not now a question, whether the will ought to be proved upon the testimony of two of the witnesses, without accounting for the absence of the third. The law is settled that it cannot be so done. But this very rule of law requires us to believe that the absence of the third witness was accounted for in this case, upon the common presumption before mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">With regard to the estate devised, it is most clearly a fee simple. The testator gives \u201c all his estate, real and personal,\u201d which is sufficient to pass a fee. The words \u201cwhatsoever and wheresoever\u201d cannot possibly be understood as intended to describe the local situation of the estates devised. They were obviously intended to include, with more certainty, every thing the testator had to bestow</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">As to the seisin of the testator, at the death of his father, he was, with the widow and the other heirs, in possession of the premises. The inheritance of his share was cast upon him by the law, and he, with each of the other children, was seised according to his right. The subsequent assignment of dower could only take from him an estate for the life of the widow; leaving him the reversion in fee in his part of that third, and his whole original estate in the residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">The seisin of the devisee was undoubtedly necessary in order to pass the estate to her heirs. 1 <em>H. Black. </em>1, <em>Dally </em>vs. <em>King. </em>It is objected that the devisee refused the trust of executrix; and that she never received any rent, nor personally exercised any act of ownership in the land devised. As to part of it, she was entitled to a reversion only, after the estate in dower, so long as <em>Mercy W. </em>held under that assignment of dower. As to the residue, she was entitled to the seisin and possession, subject to the right of the administrator to sell the land for the payment of the debts of the testator; and the natural presumption * in every [ * 74 ] such case is, that the bounty will be accepted, as it drew after it no charge or risk of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>But the freehold is not by law cast on the devisee, as it is on the heir; and there must be an actual entry by him, or something equivalent to it, to give him a seisin. At the death of the testator, the mother, <em>Mercy W., </em>was in actual possession; and if she held and claimed adversely to the devisee, the latter could not be said to be seised. But if she held as tenant in common with the devisee, admitting the title of the latter, she may be considered as seised to the use of the devisee; or, as it is commonly expressed, the seisin of the one tenant in common may be considered as the seisin of both. Now, it is expressly stated that she did so hold and claim in behalf of herself and the other tenants in common, including the devisee. On such a state of facts, the devisee could not have maintained an action of trespass against <em>Mercy W. </em>The latter had not entered unlawfully ; she had not, in fact, ousted the devisee, nor even claimed a right to hold her out. She was not then seised, in fact, of that portion of the estate which she ad mitted to belong to the devisee. Neither was any one else seised, adversely to the devisee; and it follows that she herself was seised, through the agency of her co-tenant, who held it for her use. The possession was not vacant; the title was not in abeyance ; the devisee had alone the right to be seised; and as no other person was seised, the seisin was necessarily in her.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">It is true that a person could not be thus seised against his will; and the devisee might, by some express disavowal or disclaimer, have prevented this constructive seisin in herself. But no such express dissent appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The case of <em>Sterling </em>vs. <em>Penlington, Vin. Abr. Tit. Curtesy, </em>A <em>pl. </em>11, is expressly in point. The mother there held one third as tenant in dower, and the residue for her absent son. When her daughter, with the husband of. the daughter, demanded possession of the son\u2019s part, the mother refused, imagining the son [ * 75 ] was still alive, and claiming * to hold the land for him. The daughter died; and it afterwards appearing that the son had died before that time, it was decided that the seisin of the mother, as tenant in common with the daughter, gave the latter a sufficient seisin to make her husband tenant by the curtesy. In that case, the daughter had never been actually seised; and her right was denied by the person in possession. But as this arose from the mother\u2019s mistake in supposing her son to be then living; and she claimed for him, and not for herself; and the ground, on which she claimed, was not inconsistent with the title of the daughter, when the facts were ascertained, she never having intended to deny that title; her seisin, although apparently adverse, was considered to be the seisin of the daughter also. This case is also cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>in <em>Viner, Joint tenant, </em>P. <em>a. pi. </em>5, and is to be found in 2 <em>Equ. Cas. Air. </em>730, where it seems to have been taken from <em>Viner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The demandants must recover the whole that was assigned to the tenants on the petition for partition. That partition is valid and effectual, at least as far as it respects the tenants. It seems also to be conclusive on <em>Mercy Wellman, </em>if the demandants are willing to adopt and confirm it. Both parties admit the right of <em>Mercy W. </em>to a moiety of the whole land; and so long as it was held undivided by her and the tenants, the demandants must have brought their action against the tenants for an undivided moiety. A recovery in such an action would have taken away all the estate the tenants had. The partition ought not to benefit the tenants, nor prejudice the demandants. The latter ought, in the present action, to recover all the estate which the tenants have in the land. If the demandants should now recover only an undivided moiety of the land held by the tenants, it would lead to an expensive and useless circuity of action. The demandants, in that case, in order to obtain their right, must recover against <em>Mercy W. </em>a moiety of the land held by her. She must then recover against the tenants the remaining moiety held by * them. This [ * <em>76 </em>] would destroy the partition, which appears to be satisfactory to all the parties interested ; and thus this course would lead to two, or perhaps three, other suits, to effect what may be as well accomplished in this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\n<em>Tenants defaulted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
