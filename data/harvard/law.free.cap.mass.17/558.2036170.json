That no action could be sustained upon the facts in this case. There is no case in the books, of an action founded on similar principles. The consideration, upon which this money came to the defendant\u2019s hands, was a sufficient, though perhaps an illegal one. At common law the winner of money at gaming might maintain an action for it <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>. And if one, to whom money is intrusted, applies the same to the payment of his own debts, the receiver cannot be compelled to refund it to the bailor. Nor does our statute of gaming reach the case, by making the consideration void <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b460-7\">The case of <em>Clarke </em>vs. <em>Johnson &amp; Al. </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> is probably relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>in support of the action; but although, on a cursory perusal, it may seem to favor the plaintiff, on a fuller examination it will be found to have a very different aspect; and the case of <em>Browning </em>vs. <em>Morris </em><footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> shows that Lord <em>Mansfield\u2019s </em>opinion in the former case was not adhered to <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-5\">2. But if another action would lie, the action for money had and received cannot be maintained on the facts found in this case. One cannot at the same time affirm and impeach an act <footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b461-6\"><em>A. Bliss, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"As\">It is immaterial how the defendant became possessed of this money; for the <em>assumpsit </em>arises by legal implication from the fact, that it is found in his possession, he having no lawful title to it, as against the true owner, to whom the law as well as equity regards him as the trustee <footnotemark>(7)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-7\">The action is resisted on the ground that tne money was won at play, under a contract good at common law, and not avoided by the statute. But we deny that any contract, in contemplation of law, was made; for the statute prohibits the act, by which only the con tract is capable of being executed, namely, the play which determines the * chance <footnotemark>(8)</footnotemark>. To a party, who comes [ * 562 J into court to enforce an illegal contract, this answer, says <em>Buller, </em>J., may be given, \u201c that he must draw justice from a pure fountain <em>\u201d </em><footnotemark>(9)</footnotemark>. A contract, which could be made only in violation of a positive and salutary law, is not a fit subject for the countenance of the Court. This action is not in affirmance of any such contract, but proceeds on the ground that no contract was made by the parties, under which the defendant could acquire a title to the money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-8\">Nor does the plaintiff stand <em>in pari delicto. </em>In point of fact, he is wholly innocent; and in point of law, the guilt of the servant is not the guilt of the master; nor would his contract, in such case, bind the master, for he had but a special and limited authority <footnotemark>(10)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-9\">But supposing, the plaintiff to stand in no better light than <em>Sargent, </em>the rule of the civil law should apply, <em>\u201c Ubi et dantis et accipientis turpitudo versatur, non posse repet\u00ed dicimus; quotiens autem accipientis turpitudo versatur, repet\u00ed posse\u201d </em><footnotemark>(11)</footnotemark>. The act against gaming deems the person, who wins and <em>talces </em>the money, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>as the greater culprit. All the penalties are imposed upon him. The loser is subjected to no punishment, unless the gaming be in a tavern, &amp;n.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b462-5\">The rule, by which all persons in any manner connected with an illegal contract, were held to be precluded from relief, has been broken in upon by many late decisions <footnotemark>(12)</footnotemark>; and the courts now recognize the difference, where there is one, in the culpability of the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b462-6\">The distinction made by the legislature, in the act against gaming, is founded in reason and justice; and is well exemplified by the facts in the case at bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b462-7\">The action for money had and received is the proper, if not the only, remedy; and the civil remedy is not merged in the offence of <em>Sargent, </em>of whatsoever character it may be considered <footnotemark>(13)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b460-8\"> <em>Bac.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ad0\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AZoK\">The identical bills, paid by <em>Sargent </em>to the defendant, were proved to be the property of the plaintiff. They were committed to <em>Sargent, </em>as a carrier, to pay to the order of the plaintiff. They came into the hands of the defendant unlawfully ; for gaming is unlawful by our statute. The defendant could have gained no property in them, even as against <em>Sargent, </em>who might have recovered them back within three months. Any other person might have recovered double the amount, without limitation of time; and the defendant was further liable to indictment. How then can he have a right to retain against the true owner, any more than he would a horse, or any other chattel, acquired in the same way ? It is true, in such a case, trover would have been the proper action; and, perhaps, would have been the better action in this case, but for the difficulty of identifying bank notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">We do not see, however, why the action for money had and received will not lie. The notes were paid and received as money; and as to any want of privity, or any implied promise, the law seems to be, that where one has received the money of another, and has not a right conscientiously to retain it, the law implies a promise that he will pay it over.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">Had <em>Sargent </em>paid the money to an innocent person, for a valuable consideration, or to satisfy a debt of his own, the case might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>have been different; as it would be mischievous to require of persons, who receive money in the way of business, or in pay ment of debts, to look into the authority of him from whom they receive it.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
