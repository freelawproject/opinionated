A motion for a new trial, made by the defendant on all these grounds, was overruled by the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-7\"><em>L. </em>Williams, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVt\">in support of the objection taken at the trial to the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, cited the cases of <em>Bristow </em>vs. <em>Wright </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark>, and <em>Commonwealth </em>vs. <em>Morse </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-8\">The evidence proved no extortion technically. If the plaintiff chose, of his own motion, to send this money to the defendant, it is impossible to convert this into extortion practised upon his son <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-9\">The evidence offered by the defendant, which the Court rejected, furnished a strong presumption that the defendant did not act corruptly. It was proper evidence for the jury, and it was not the part of the Court to judge of its force and weight. The defendant could hardly be conscious that he was committing an offence against law, in following the example of the respectable officers of the county, and of many other magistrates <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-10\">The mistake which took place in reference to the pleadings not being submitted to the jury, we should not insist on, but for the circumstances of hardship attending this case <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-11\"><em>W. Baylies, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-P\">It is not material of whom the defendant received this money. It was paid, in contemplation of law, by <em>George Lincoln. </em>Had the declaration alleged the money to have been received of the plaintiff, the evidence would not have maintained it. But if this were not so, the variance is immaterial, and a new trial will not be granted for this cause <footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-12\">The evidence of the custom of officers in the county, to demand and receive illegal fees, was properly rejected. The defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>bound to know that his fees were regulated by statute, and did not depend on the habit of others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-5\"><em>* Shed\u2019s </em>case was very distinct from this. The question [*412] was there merely of construction. In the case at bar there was no pretence of a mistake or misconception of the law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-6\">The loss of the pleadings cannot be material after verdict. The jury understood the issue submitted to them, as well as if they had had the paper with them. The case of <em>Whiting </em>vs. <em>Cochran </em><footnotemark>(7)</footnotemark> was a stronger case than the present, as to this point.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b340-13\"> <em>Doug. </em>665.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b340-14\"> 14 <em>Mass.

The evidence-was, that one <em>Wither ell </em>received the money of the plaintiff, father of the said <em>George, </em>and paid it to the defendant. We think the declaration not supported by this evidence. The person from whom the money is received is he on whom the extortion is practised.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">The evidence offered by the defendant, showing that certain other public officers in the county of <em>Bristol, </em>whose fees are regulated by the same law, have been in the\" habit of receiving greater fees than the law allows, was properly rejected by the Court. It had no tendency to justify or excuse the defendant. If it were to be otherwise held, the consequence might be a com bination of officers; and the illegal acts of each would always be excused by the illegal acts of the rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">As a new trial is to be had, it is not necessary to decide upon the effect of the mistake, which occurred at the former one by the pleadings not having been given to the jury amongst the other papers in the case. <em>A new trial ordered.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
