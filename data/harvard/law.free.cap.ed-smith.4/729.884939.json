And he demanded relief, averring that he had pursued the provisions of the act of July 11, 1851, and had acquired a lien, which this proceeding was instituted to enforce.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b742-5\">The defence insisted upon by the contractor in the court below was, that the claimant had failed to perform his contract of employment for the excavation in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b742-6\">The testimony established that the work was not completed. From the evidence adduced in behalf of the plaintiff, it appeared that the completion was prevented by the interference of the employer himself. The proofs were contradictory on this point, but the justice determined the question in favor of the claimant, and decided that he was entitled to the price fixed in Ms agreement with McAllister.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b742-7\">A personal judgment was given against the defendants jointly.

The judgment should have been for a foreclosure of the lien, and not a personal judgment against the defendant, McAllister. \u201cThe judgment authorized by the statute is to enforce the lien.\u201d \u201cThe proceeding is one to enforce the lien.\u201d <em>(Doughty </em>v. <em>Devlin, </em>1 E.

The lien could not be foreclosed without such proof. <em>(Cronk </em>v. <em>Whittaker, </em>1 E. D. Smith, 647; <em>Pendleburg </em>v. <em>Meade, </em>1 E. D.

It wap shown on the trial that McAllister gave Den<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>nistoun notice to proceed with his work, or if he did not do so, he would employ some one else; that Dennistoun did not proceed, and that McAllister did employ another person and paid him. This state of facts existing, the justice should not have found for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b743-5\"><em>John H. Taylor </em>and <em>Henry W. </em>Johnson, for the claimant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ats\">made and argued the following points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b743-6\">I. The case presents only a disputed question of fact, upon which there was evidence on both sides, and, therefore, the judgment should not be disturbed. The rule is too well settled to admit of doubt, that the verdict of a court or jury, under such circumstances, will not be disturbed on appeal. 1st. It was a disputed question of fact whether or not the plaintiff deserted the work, and refused to fulfill his contract. 2d. It was a disputed question of fact whether or not the defendant, McAllister, prevented the plaintiff from fulfilling his contract. Upon both of these points conflicting testimony was given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b743-7\">II. The justice, after stating the evidence and his conclusions upon the questions of fact presented before him, says, that he thereupon rendered judgment for the plaintiff. This court is bound to presume that this judgment was a legal one in form, unless the contrary expressly appears. We are at a loss to determine in what respects the judgment is informal. The appellant says the erroro consists in the fact that the justice rendered a judgment instead of foreclosing the lien. But the judgment is a foreclosure of the lien. The lien law expressly provides what effect the judgment shall have. The justice can give no other effect to it than the law prescribes. Therefore, we submit that there is no error in the judgment appearing on the face of the return. And we further submit, that even if the justice had rendered a personal judgment against the defendant, Taylor, instead of foreclosing the lien, that could not be a ground of appeal by McAllister. He is not injured thereby. Taylor is the only one who would have a right to complain of such judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b744-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>ILL It is perfectly manifest, from the whole return, that it was conceded that Taylor owed McAllister the amount of the respondent\u2019s claim. If it was not, why did not Taylor defend the suit, and why did he not appeal when the lien was foreclosed against his property ?</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b744-5\">By the Court.</p>\n<author id=\"A4f\">Ingraham, First J.</author>\n<p id=\"AP8\">This action is brought under the mechanics\u2019 lien law, for excavating cellars. The defendant, McAllister, was the contractor, with the defendant, Taylor. Taylor does not appeal. The appeal is brought by McAllister, the contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The evidence clearly establishes that the contract was never performed by the plaintiff, but that the completion of it was either the result of the defendant\u2019s orders or of the refusal of the plaintiff to complete the work without a further advance in the amount to be paid. For the purposes of this appeal, it is immaterial which result is arrived at from the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">By the first section of the act, (September, 1851, p. 953,) the remedy under that act is confined to the party who, in pursuance of an agreement with the contractor, shall, in conformity with the terms of the contract with the owner, perform any labor or furnish- any materials; and by the fourth section, the right to enforce such lien is limited to a period after the labor has been performed, in pursuance of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">To entitle the plaintiff to recover, it is therefore necessary for him to prove a contract between the contractor and the owner, and the performance of labor under an agreement with the contractor, in pursuance of the contract with the owner. <em>(Pendleburg </em>v. Meade, 1 E. D. Smith, 728; <em>Gardin </em>v. <em>Thorp, </em>id. 697.) No such evidence was furnished in this case; but as the appellant confined himself on the trial to the defence, that the plaintiff had not performed his agreement with the contractor, he must be confined to that objection on the appeal, and the existence of a contract between the appellant and the owner must be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">The whole of the evidence on this point shows that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>agreement was not performed. The plaintiff himself proved that the reason why it was not performed was, that the contractor prevented it. For this he had a right of action against the contractor, but under the lien law he obtained no lien on the owner\u2019s interest. That statute gives no remedy for damages for not performing a contract. Where the work has been performed, it then gives to the person doing the work the right to collect the moneys due from the owner, if indebted to the contractor. The whole theory of the statute is based on the supposition that the owner has received, through the contractor, the benefit of labor performed by the laborer, and, therefore, should pay for such labor any moneys in his hands belonging to the contractor. Until the work is performed, a right to a lien on the premises does not accrue. The justice found that the plaintiff was prevented from finishing the contract by the act of the defendant, and was, therefore, entitled to the balance due. Whether such a finding could be sustained in an ordinary action on the contract, it is not necessary now to inquire.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">I have no doubt, however, that it is insufficient to sustain this judgment for the reasons above stated. For the amount of work done under the contract, where the other party prevents its completion, a lien may be acquired; but such lien cannot be extended to damages for the breach of the contract not performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The judgment rendered was defective. The first section of the act (September, 1855, page 760) directs that whenever a judgment shall be rendered in favor of the claimant, such judgment shall direct the sale of the interest of the owner ; and the fifth section provides, that when proceedings are commenced by a person having a claim against a contractor with the owner, judgment may be rendered against the contractor for the amount of his indebtedness, in addition to the judgment provided for in the first section against the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The judgment against the contracter is a personal judgment for the amount he owes the laborer, and the judgment against the owner merely directs the sale of his interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>in the premises to pay the amount found due from him to the contractor to the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Where the owner is the contractor, a liberal construction of these provisions will allow a personal judgment against him for the amount of the indebtedness that may remain after the sale of his interests in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">I think the judgment in this case must he reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
