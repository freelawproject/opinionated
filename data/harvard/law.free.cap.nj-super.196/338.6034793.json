The suits challenged his 1982 election as mayor on the basis of alleged election irregularities and dual office holding. The trial court granted the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-14\">Substantially for the reasons given by Judge Gruccio in his opinion, 196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>145 (Law.Div.1984), we hold that plaintiff was not entitled to reimbursement. The costs he incurred were for the defense of suits that challenged his entitlement to hold office and the regularity of his election. The expenses were not for costs incurred in the defense of legal attacks on his actions taken in the discharge of duties imposed or authorized by law. <em>Compare Barnert v. Paterson, </em>48 <em>N.J.L. </em>395 (Sup.Ct.1886) with <em>Markham v. State, Dept. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number><em>Revenue, </em>298 So.2d 210 (Fla.App.1974). <em>See McQuillin Municipal Corporations </em>(3d Ed 1968) \u00a7 12.137.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">We also agree that the enactment of the Campaign Contributions and Expenditures Reporting Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>19:44A-1, <em>et seq., </em>does not require public subsidy of an official\u2019s election litigation expenses. Moreover, the existence of statutes providing indemnity to a police officer, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-155, or a board of education member, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A.-12-20, for defense of an action connected with the performance of his duties does not make unlawful the public\u2019s failure to indemnify an elected mayor for the kinds of expenses involved here.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
