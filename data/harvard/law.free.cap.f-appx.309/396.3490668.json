Stribling (\u201cStribling\u201d) petitions for review of a final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) affirming her removal from employment by the Department of Education (the \u201cagency\u201d). <em>Stribling v. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>No. DC0752080086-I-1, 2008 WL 3914457 (M.S.P.B. Mar. 4, 2008) <em>(\u201cInitial Decision \u201d), review denied, Stribling v. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>No. DC0752080086-I-1, 2008 WL 3914457 (M.S.P.B. Aug. 4, 2008). Because Stribling has identified no basis for us overturn the Board\u2019s decision, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">At the time of her removal, Stribling was a secretary in the agency\u2019s Office of Federal Student Aid. <em>Initial Decision </em>at 1. In May 2005, Stribling was transferred from Philadelphia to the agency\u2019s office in Washington, D.C. <em>Id. </em>at 20. In connection with this transfer, Stribling was given a government credit card to cover authorized relocation expenses, including a temporary housing allowance. <em>Id. </em>Stribling\u2019s temporary housing allowance expired on August 7, 2005, but she continued to use her travel credit card to pay for housing and other expenses until August 30, 2005. <em>Id. </em>at 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-15\">Additionally, on August 8, 2005, Stribling reported to her supervisor that she had suffered a medical emergency, and she requested to be placed on unpaid leave. <em>Id. </em>Stribling\u2019s supervisor granted the request, but requested specific medical documentation of Stribling\u2019s medical condition and prognosis. <em>Id. </em>at 12-14. When Stribling failed to provide the requested medical documentation, her supervisor ordered her to return to work effective September 15, 2005. <em>Id. </em>Stribling did not return to work for fifteen days during the period from September 15, 2005 through October 5, 2005, nor did she contact her supervisor on those dates to request leave as required by the agency\u2019s collective bargaining agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 7, 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-16\">The agency removed Stribling for absence without leave, failure to follow leave requesting procedures, and misuse of a government travel credit card. <em>Id. </em>at 1. Following a hearing, an administrative judge of the Board found that the agency had proven all three charges by a preponderance of the evidence, and that Stribling had failed to prove either of her affirmative defenses of disability discrimination and retaliation. <em>Id. </em>at 7-28. The administrative judge also concluded that the agency had properly applied the <em>Douglas </em>factors and that the penalty of removal was reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 28-30 (citing <em>Douglas v. Veterans Admin., </em>5 MSPB 313, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 306 (1981)). The full Board denied review, and Stribling appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Preliminarily, we address our jurisdiction to hear Stribling\u2019s appeal. Before the Board, Stribling raised an affirmative defense of disability discrimination, and the Board found that she had failed to prove the defense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 26. Ordinarily, this court has \u201cno jurisdiction over the merits of a mixed case, <em>ie., </em>one involving an adverse action and a claim of discrimination,\u201d unless \u201cthe petitioner files an explicit waiver of the claim of discrimination.\u201d <em>Davidson v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>24 F.3d 223, 223-24 (Fed.Cir.1994). In this case, Stribling explicitly waived her discrimination claims by completing this court\u2019s Rule 15(c) Statement Concerning Discrimination (Form 10), and checking the box stating that \u201cAny claim of discrimination by reason of race, sex, age, national origin, or handicapped condition raised before and decided by the Merit Systems Protection Board or arbitrator has been abandoned or will not be raised or continued in this or any other court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Notwithstanding this explicit waiver, Stribling\u2019s informal brief contains, among her other arguments, an assertion that her affirmative defense of disability discrimination was wrongly decided because \u201c[t]he MSPB failed to consider reasonable accommodation.\u201d Pet\u2019r\u2019s Informal Br. 114. Because Stribling\u2019s Rule 15(c) statement unambiguously waived any claim based on discrimination, and because this is neither a case in which the petitioner\u2019s other arguments cannot be divorced from her discrimination claim, nor one in which the appeal is based entirely on allegations of discrimination, the court deems the argument based on discrimination not before us. Accordingly, we will not address it and do not consider it to defeat our jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9) over Stribling\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">\u201cOur scope of review in an appeal from a decision of the Board is limited. Specifically, we must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless we find it to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Abell v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, </em>343 F.3d 1378, 1382-83 (Fed.Cir.2003) (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c)). \u201cThe petitioner bears the burden of establishing error in the Board\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Harris v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>142 F.3d 1463, 1467 (Fed.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Apart from the discrimination argument we have deemed not before us, Stribling raises two principal arguments on appeal. First, Stribling asserts that the Board made errors in fact-finding by overlooking various emails, questionnaires, letters, and other documents that Stribling has identified in the record. We have reviewed each of the documents that Stribling has identified, and find nothing that contradicts the Board\u2019s findings. Although some of the identified documents concern Stribling\u2019s efforts to obtain treatment for medical conditions, none of the identified documents suggests that Stribling ever obtained or submitted the medical documentation that her supervisor expressly requested to justify her request for leave. Likewise, none of the identified documents suggests that Stribling complied with the terms of the agency\u2019s collective bargaining agreement when requesting leave. Finally, none of the identified documents suggests that Stribling was authorized to use her government travel credit card for expenses after its expiration on August 7, 2005. Thus, we conclude that the Board\u2019s findings concerning Stribling\u2019s absence without leave, her failure to follow leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>requesting procedures, and her misuse of a government travel credit card are all supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Second, Stribling argues that the Board erred by rejecting her claim that she was terminated as a result of protected whistleblowing activity. \u201cTo establish a violation of the Whistleblower\u2019s Protection Act (WPA), we require proof of four elements: (1) the acting official has the authority to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action; (2) the aggrieved employee made a disclosure protected under [5 U.S.C. \u00a7 12802(b)(8); (3) the acting official used his authority to take, or refuse to take, a personnel action against the aggrieved employee; (4) the acting official took, or failed to take, the personnel action against the aggrieved employee because of the protected disclosure.\u201d <em>Drake v. Agency for Int\u2019l Dev., </em>543 F.3d 1377, 1380 (Fed.Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Lachance v. White, </em>174 F.3d 1378, 1380 (Fed.Cir.1999)). The Board found that Stribling\u2019s alleged whistleblowing activity occurred two years prior to her removal, and that it concerned actions by management officials in the Philadelphia office of the Office of Federal Student Aid. <em>Initial Decision </em>at 6 n. 2. Stribling neither explained at the Board nor explains on appeal how her disclosures concerning managers in the Philadelphia office could have been the cause of her termination two years later by different managers in the Washington D.C. office. Accordingly, we have no basis on which to disturb the Board\u2019s rejection of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">In sum, we cannot conclude that the Board\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Abell, </em>343 F.3d at 1382-83. We therefore <em>affirm </em>the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
