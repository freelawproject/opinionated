Ceballos argues that the district court erred in treating his two prior convictions as separate offenses when calculating his criminal history score under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2). Because Ceballos did not object in the district court, review of this asserted procedural error is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 806 (5th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 625, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">Ceballos contends that the district court\u2019s factual finding that he was arrested on two separate dates for his two prior convictions is clearly erroneous. Because this factual finding was \u201ccapable of resolution by the district court upon proper objection at sentencing,\u201d it does not constitute plain error. <em>United States v. Fierro, </em>38 F.3d 761, 773 n. 4, 774 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, we uphold the district court\u2019s calculation of the applicable guidelines sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">Also for the first time on appeal, Ceballos argues that the district court made a clearly erroneous finding that his two prior convictions were for crimes of violence. The district court adopted the factual and legal conclusions contained in the presentence report. Included in the adopted conclusions was a conclusion that Ceballos\u2019s had one conviction for a felony drug-trafficking offense and one conviction for a crime of violence. A review of the entire sentencing transcript does not indicate that the district court, in selecting a sentence from the applicable advisory range, gave Ceballos\u2019s prior convictions, regardless of their characterizations, any undue weight. Ceballos has not shown any error, plain or otherwise, in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-18\">Ceballos has failed to demonstrate, on plain error review, that his sentence is procedurally unsound. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Nor has he demonstrated that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b839-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
