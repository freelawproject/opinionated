Korman, of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Defendant-Appellant Kwame El appeals from a March 24, 2008 judgment of conviction of the District Court sentencing him principally to four years\u2019 probation, including six months\u2019 home confinement after defendant was convicted, after a jury trial, of corruptly endeavoring to obstruct and impede the due administration of the Internal Revenue laws, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212(a). Defendant\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the District Court erred in instructing the jury with respect to the definition of \u201ccorruptly\u201d as it appears in \u00a7 7212(a). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u2018We review de novo the propriety of jury instructions. A jury instruction is erroneous if it misleads the jury as to the correct legal standard or does not adequately inform the jury on the law.\u201d <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>546 F.3d 245, 250 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cReversal is required only if the instructions, viewed as a whole, caused the defendant prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v. Naiman, </em>211 F.3d 40, 51 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Defendant\u2019s claim is without merit. The District Court\u2019s charge that to act \u201ccorruptly\u201d means \u201cto act with the intent to secure an unlawful advantage or benefit either for one\u2019s self or for another\u201d is a formulation that we have explicitly accepted. <em>See United States v. Kelly, </em>147 F.3d 172, 177 (2d Cir.1998) (\u201cThis is a well-accepted definition of the term \u2018corruptly\u2019 when used in th[e] context [of \u00a7 7212(a) ].\u201d). There is nothing in the record to suggest that the instruction was inadequate to inform the jury of the law in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">Accordingly, the March 24, 2008 judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
