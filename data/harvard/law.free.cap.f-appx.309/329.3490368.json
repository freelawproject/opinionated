Miles\u2019 sentence was enhanced pursuant to \u00a7 924(e), the Armed Career Criminal Act, because the district court found that Miles had three qualifying prior convictions: two burglaries and possession of an unregistered firearm. Miles makes two arguments. First, he contends that his two prior burglary convictions are not separate criminal offenses under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Second, he contends that his prior conviction for possession of an unregistered firearm is not a violent felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Both issues are questions of law, and we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s judgment on them. <em>See United States v. Spears, </em>443 F.3d 1358, 1360 (11th Cir.2006) (citation omitted); <em>United States v. Rainey, </em>362 F.3d 733, 734 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The Armed Career Criminal Act provides that a felon convicted of illegal possession of a firearm under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) who has three previous convictions for a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d a serious drug offense, or both, is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of not less than fifteen years imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Under the ACCA, a felony involving conduct that \u201cpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Each predicate offense must have occurred on \u201coccasions different from one another.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 924(e)(1). We have interpreted that language to mean that \u201ca defendant is subject to the sentence enhancement of the ACCA if each of the three previous convictions arose out of a separate and distinct \u2018criminal episode.\u2019 \u201d <em>See United States v. Pope, </em>132 F.3d 684, 689 (11th Cir.1998) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Miles contends that his burglary convictions should not be considered separate and distinct criminal episodes because both burglaries took place on the same night. That argument is knocked out by the <em>Pope </em>decision, which held that two burglaries were separate criminal episodes even though the burglaries occurred on the same night at two offices located only two hundred yards apart. <em>Id. </em>at 692. There, we noted that \u201c[m]ere temporal proximity is ordinarily insufficient to merge multiple offenses into a single criminal episode.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690. Instead, \u201cthe \u2018successful\u2019 completion of one crime plus a subsequent conscious decision to commit another crime makes that second crime distinct from the first for the purposes of the ACCA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 692. Here, the two burglaries occurred at two separate businesses located in two separate places. Miles completed the first burglary, then traveled to the next location and made a conscious decision to commit the second burglary. The district court reviewed Miles\u2019 burglary convictions and properly determined that the two burglaries were separate criminal episodes for the purposes of the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Miles also contends that the district court erred in considering his conviction for possession of an unregistered firearm a \u201cviolent felony\u201d because we do not consider possession of a firearm by a felon to be a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d <em>See United States v. Oliver, </em>20 F.3d 415 (11th Cir.1994). That argument fails. Miles was convicted for possession of an unregistered sawed-off shotgun-a type of firearm specified for registration under the National Firearms Act. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5845(a), 5861(d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have recognized \u201cthat the possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>certain kinds of weapons categorically presents the potential risk of physical injury warranting sentence enhancement for being a crime of violence.\u201d <em>United States v. Owens, </em>447 F.3d 1345, 1347 (11th Cir. 2006) (quotation marks omitted). Therefore we have held that a conviction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d) is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id.; see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) cmt. n. 1 (\u201cUnlawfully possessing a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a) <em>(e.g., </em>a sawed-off shotgun ...) is a \u2018crime of violence.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u201cWe have also held that cases interpreting \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under \u00a7 4B 1.2 provide important guidance in determining what is a \u201cviolent felony\u2019 under the ACCA because the definition for both terms are virtually identical.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>489 F.3d 1112, 1113 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted). Because a conviction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d) is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines, the district court did not err in concluding that the same conviction also qualified as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for the purposes of the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-6\">.
