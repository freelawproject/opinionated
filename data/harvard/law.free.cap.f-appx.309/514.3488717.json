May 30, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 78 231 858 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Dec. 18, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-25\">When the BIA issues an opinion affirming the Id\u2019s decision in part and modifying it in part, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA, confining its review to the rationale of the IJ on which the BIA relied. <em>See Dong Gao v. BIA </em>482 F.3d 122, 125 (2d Cir.2007). Because the BIA assumed Huang\u2019s credibility, we will do the same. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271-72 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); see <em>also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">As an initial matter, because Huang failed to raise any claim based on her membership in a particular social group in her appeal to the BIA, we decline to consider that unexhausted issue. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20 (2d Cir.2007). However, we are unpersuaded by the government\u2019s argument that we are without jurisdiction to consider Huang\u2019s challenge to the denial of her applications for withholding of removal and CAT relief. Before the agency, Huang challenged the IJ\u2019s nexus finding, which was dispositive of both her claims for asylum and withholding of removal. Moreover, while the government is correct that Huang failed to raise the denial of CAT relief before the BIA, the BIA nonetheless addressed that claim, preserving Huang\u2019s challenge to it. <em>See Waldron v. INS, </em>17 F.3d 511, 515 n. 7 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">As amended by the REAL ID Act, Title 8, Section 1158(b)(1)(B)(i) of the U.S.Code provides that an asylum \u201capplicant must establish that race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.\u201d We find no error in the agency\u2019s conclusion that Huang\u2019s claim lacked a sufficient nexus to a protected ground. While Huang\u2019s arguments offer the possibility that a reasonable adjudicator could have found that Chinese authorities were or will be partially motivated to persecute her and other striking workers on account of a perceived anti-government opinion, she articulates no basis on which we are \u201ccompelled\u201d to find \u2014 contrary to the agency \u2014 that such an opinion was or will be a \u201ccentral\u201d motive. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(i), 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>cf. Osorio v. INS, </em>18 F.3d 1017, 1029 (2d Cir.1994) (finding that the agency erred in failing to address the political dimension nor political context of the petitioner\u2019s activities where they were conducted as a part of a union and substantial background evidence indicated that the government perceived union activities as a political threat to their authority). China\u2019s general intolerance for dissent, as exemplified by the regulation banning all strikes, does not compel the conclusion that, in her individual circumstances, the police detained her on account of her political opinion. <em>See Manzur, </em>494 F.3d at 289. In light of the foregoing, the agency\u2019s denial of her asylum and withholding of removal claims was proper. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The agency denied Huang\u2019s application for CAT relief because she failed to demonstrate that she would more likely than not be tortured upon return to China. Huang argues that the agency failed to adequately support that conclusion with any specific findings of fact or law where the evidence indicated that \u201cshe would be subjected to more persecution from Chinese officials as well as from Chinese police who will arrest and imprison her in deplorable conditions\u201d upon her return. However, summary analysis may sometimes be sufficient, and the Court does not require the agency to provide a detailed analysis of insignificant pieces of evidence. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338 n. 17 (2d Cir.2006). So, while the agency must consider \u201c <em>\u2018Significant </em>factual assertions\u2019 \u201d supporting an applicant\u2019s claim, <em>see id. </em>(quoting <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 403 (2d Cir.2005) (emphasis added)), the record here supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Huang failed to meet her burden in establishing that she would more likely than not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>be tortured. Indeed, before this Court, Huang argues only that the evidence indicated that she would be \u201csubjected to more persecution.\u201d However, Huang failed to demonstrate that she was persecuted in the past, and even if she had, torture is \u201csomething more severe than the kind of treatment that would suffice to prove persecution.\u201d <em>Kyaw Zwar Tun v. INS, </em>445 F.3d 554, 567 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
