Our review of the record discloses that Mr. Brown received an award of black lung benefits during his lifetime. He was ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>mitted to hospice care with a terminal diagnosis of pneumoconiosis and the death certif\u00edcate stated that his death was caused by \u201cchronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to or as a consequence of black lung disease.\u201d We find that the decision of the administrative law judge is based upon substantial evidence and is without reversible error. Accordingly, we grant the petition for review, reverse the decision of the Board, and remand for the award of survivor\u2019s benefits to Mrs. Brown. <em>Brown v. Dir., Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>No. 07-0308-BLA (B.R.B. Dec. 31, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">\n<em>PETITION GRANTED; REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
