Korman, of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b555-10\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">Petitioner-appellant Jason Clark appeals from a judgment denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-15\">In this habeas petition arising from his conviction and incarceration in the State of New York, Clark argues that he was deprived of his right to the effective assistance of counsel when deciding whether to plead guilty to the charged offenses. <em>See, e.g., Davis v. Greiner, </em>428 F.3d 81, 87 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201cIt is well settled that a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel extends to plea negotiations.\u201d). Clark alleges that his defense counsel failed to investigate the factual basis of a motion to suppress evidence at the core of the state\u2019s case. Had defense counsel conducted such an investigation and properly advised Clark of the likelihood that the suppression motion would be granted, Clark urges, he would not have agreed to plead guilty. <em>See, e.g., Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985) (\u201c[I]n order to satisfy the \u2018prejudice\u2019 requirement [of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel], the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-16\">In support of his charge of ineffective assistance of counsel, Clark submitted a sworn affidavit in which he alleged that he consented to the search of his apartment only because of \u201coverbearing official pressure.\u201d Appellant\u2019s App. 101. Clark also submitted an affidavit of his father, Eugene Clark, who claimed that he \u201cdid not authorize the search of [his] home\u201d and was not allowed to speak to his son after his son\u2019s arrest by the police. <em>Id. </em>at 132. Neither Clark nor his father allege in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>statements that defense counsel failed to inquire into the circumstances of the search \u2014 and nothing in the record indicates that defense counsel failed to make such an inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">While the record is silent on whether defense counsel was informed of the version of events recounted in the statements of Clark and his father, the record does contain evidence that contradicts their version of events \u2014 evidence that defense counsel possessed at the time he advised Clark to plead guilty. First, Detectives Wilcox and O\u2019Hanlon stated that \u201cdefendant was asked numerous times ... (before defendant left the house with them) whether he wished to speak with his father. The defendant said [n]o, that he\u2019d only yell at him or give him \u2018flack\u2019 or words to that effect.\u201d Appellee\u2019s App. 89. Second, Detective Wilcox reported that, after obtaining Clark\u2019s consent to search his apartment, the police officers \u201cwere then escorted up to [Clark\u2019s] apartment by his father\u201d and that, later that day, Clark\u2019s father called the police on his own initiative to inform them that \u201che had found[ ] the pants that belonged to [a co-defendant] and inside the pocket was a clip to a handgun and it had bullets in it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31. In addition, at a July 5, 1996 preliminary hearing, Clark\u2019s defense counsel was able to cross-examine Wilcox, probing the circumstances leading to Clark\u2019s confession and the search of his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Faced with these background facts and the overwhelming evidence against Clark \u2014 including Clark\u2019s confession, the murder weapon, and the testimony of Clark\u2019s co-defendants \u2014 defense counsel concluded that it was in Clark\u2019s \u201cbest interest\u201d to withdraw his suppression motions and plead guilty. Appellant\u2019s App. 37. Applying, as we must, \u201ca strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), we cannot say that it was unreasonable for defense counsel to recommend that Clark plead guilty, accept responsibility, and express remorse, in an attempt to obtain a more lenient sentence from the judge. The affidavits of Clark and his father suggest that there was a factual basis that might have led to the suppression of evidence, but other facts in the record contradict their version of events. More importantly, nothing in their affidavits \u2014 or, indeed, in the record \u2014 indicates that defense counsel failed to investigate the circumstances of Clark\u2019s arrest and the search of his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Nor does anything in the record indicate that professional incompetence, rather than professional judgment, caused defense counsel to recommend that the suppression motions be withdrawn and a plea of guilty entered. As defense counsel observed after trial, \u201c[he] did not expect [Clark] to receive the maximum sentence of 25 to life, especially when [Clark] cooperated with the District Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201d Appellant\u2019s App. 114. \u201cAlthough his prediction was wrong, his conduct was not unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Bayless, </em>201 F.3d 116, 130 (2d Cir.2000); <em>see also Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (\u201cIt is all too tempting for a defendant to second-guess counsel\u2019s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence, and it is all too easy for a court, examining counsel\u2019s defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable. A fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Accordingly, we conclude that defense counsel\u2019s representation of Clark did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court denying Clark\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
