O\u2019Dwyer, Jr. purports to represent in a suit against various government and private actors. Through this and similar suits, O\u2019Dwyer has been responsible for a large volume of Hurricane Katrina-related litigation in the district court, and for a corresponding bevy of appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have repeatedly rejected O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s arguments, but he persists in re-arguing the same issues in subsequent appeals. The present appeal challenges an order issued April 3, 2007, in which the district court dismissed claims that, for the most part, it had previously dismissed (and whose previous dismissal we affirmed),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but which O\u2019Dwyer re-filed in a new complaint. We AFFIRM the ruling of the district court, and DENY the parties\u2019 cross-motions for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-15\">The district court dismissed O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s claims against Louisiana agencies and officers, in their official capacities, on sovereign immunity grounds under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). We review a 12(b)(1) dismissal <em>de novo. Lane v. Halliburton, </em>529 F.3d 548, 557 (5th Cir.2008). O\u2019Dwyer argues that Louisiana waived sovereign immunity by bringing other lawsuits as a plaintiff in federal court, and constructively waived sovereign immunity by accepting various forms of federal assistance after Hurricane Katrina. This court considered and rejected similar arguments in a prior appeal of this case, and in another argued by O\u2019Dwyer. <em>See O\u2019Dwyer v. United States ex rel. U.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number><em>Army Corps of Eng\u2019rs, </em>277 Fed.Appx. 512 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Fairley v. Stalder, </em>294 Fed.Appx. 805 (5th Cir.2008). Again in this appeal, we hold that O\u2019Dwyer fails to demonstrate that Louisiana\u2019s litigation conduct created \u201cinconsistency, anomaly, and unfairness\u201d to a degree that requires waiver of sovereign immunity, or that Congress, by unmistakable statutory language, conditioned post-Katrina aid on Louisiana waiving sovereign immunity. <em>See Fairley, </em>294 Fed.Appx. at 810 (citing <em>Lapides v. Bd. of Regents, </em>535 U.S. 613, 620, 122 S.Ct. 1640, 152 L.Ed.2d 806 (2002), and <em>Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, </em>473 U.S. 234, 243, 105 S.Ct. 3142, 87 L.Ed.2d 171 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">O\u2019Dwyer presents two additional arguments regarding claims against Louisiana. First, he argues the district court should have granted him discovery regarding purported \u201cstrings attached\u201d to federal Katrina aid, to help him demonstrate constructive waiver. He made the same argument in <em>Fairley, </em>where we determined that \u201cdiscovery [was] unnecessary and dismissal [was] appropriate,\u201d because O\u2019Dwyer failed to identify any statutory requirement of sovereign immunity waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 810. Here as well, he fails to argue that any such discovery would have helped him satisfy the elements of an otherwise viable claim. Second, O\u2019Dwyer suggests he should be allowed to sue Louisiana actors in their official capacities under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Will v. Michigan Department of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989), held that a state is not a \u201cperson\u201d subject to suit under \u00a7 1983. O\u2019Dwyer argues that <em>Will </em>should not apply when sovereign immunity is waived. Having affirmed the district court\u2019s ruling that sovereign immunity was not waived, we need not reach this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">The district court dismissed O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims against individual state officers, on qualified immunity grounds, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). We review a dismissal for failure to state a claim <em>de novo. Dorsey v. Portfolio Equities, Inc., </em>540 F.3d 333, 338 (5th Cir.2008). This court rejected O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s \u00a7 1983 arguments, in connection with the present case, in Appeal No. 06-30840. <em>See O'Dwyer, </em>277 Fed.Appx. at 513. We do so again. <em>See generally Hare v. City of Corinth, </em>135 F.3d 320, 325 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">After dismissing O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s claims against Louisiana agencies and officials in their public and individual capacities, the district court declined to retain supplemental jurisdiction over related state law claims. We review that decision for abuse of discretion. <em>See Guzzino v. Felterman, </em>191 F.3d 588, 596 (5th Cir.1999). We previously determined the district court was within its discretion to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction in this case, <em>see O\u2019Dwyer, </em>277 Fed.Appx. at 513, and reach the same conclusion now. <em>See Guzzino, </em>191 F.3d at 594 (explaining that a district court may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction when, <em>inter alia, </em>it has dismissed all claims with original jurisdiction or there are other compelling reasons).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">In addition, the district court dismissed certain claims removed from state court for failure to effect timely service of process pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(5). We review that decision for abuse of discretion. <em>Lindsey v. U.S. R.R. Ret. Bd., </em>101 F.3d 444, 445 (5th Cir.1996). Once the validity of service has been contested, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing its validity. <em>Carimi v. Royal Carribean Cruise Line, Inc., </em>959 F.2d 1344, 1346 (5th Cir.1992). The parties dispute the source of law for determining the service period, but that dispute is immaterial. O\u2019Dwyer admits his tardiness under any standard. The district court did not abuse its discretion when it dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>missed O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s claims under Rule 12(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">O\u2019Dwyer next complains about alleged misconduct in the proceedings before the district court, while conceding that these issues are \u201cnot yet \u2018squarely\u2019 before This Honorable Court.\u201d We agree, and do not consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Finally, O\u2019Dwyer argues that the state\u2019s lawyers deserve sanctions for allegedly failing, in the proceedings below, to disclose the existence of lawsuits that he argues waived sovereign immunity. It is not clear if this is a request for sanctions from this court or an appeal of the district court\u2019s denial of O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s motion to disqualify the Louisiana Department of Justice. We reject his argument in either event. Sanctions are not appropriate, and the district court was within its discretion to deny the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">In addition to the merits of the appeal, Defendants-Appellees have filed a motion for sanctions against O\u2019Dwyer, to which he responded with a motion for sanctions against them. We DENY both motions for sanctions, and AFFIRM the decision of the district court in all regards.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b860-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b860-12\">. O'Dwyer\u2019s conduct in litigation below led to escalating sanctions, culminating in his suspension from practice before the Eastern District of Louisiana. O'Dwyer has appealed that suspension. Issues related to sanctions imposed against O\u2019Dwyer below are not before the court in the present appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b860-17\">. <em>See O\u2019Dwyer v.
