First, petitioner\u2019s disagreement with the manner in which the BIA considered the hardship evidence is not a colorable constitutional claim. <em>See de Lourdes v. Mukasey, </em>539 F.3d 1102, 1105 (9th Cir.2008). Second, there was no due process violation where the IJ did not consolidate petitioner\u2019s case with that of her husband. <em>See Padilla-Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 972, 979 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201cCongress has provided for individualized hearings before an IJ to determine hardship on family members resulting from removal.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b232-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
