U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">An alien may apply for asylum if he \u201cdemonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). An application filed after one year may be considered \u201cif the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period specified.... \u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Section 1158(a)(3) provides: \u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph (2).\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">Under our current precedent, \u00a7 1158(a)(3) divests us of jurisdiction to review the determination that an asylum applicant filed an untimely application or failed to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse his untimely filing. <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1217 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam) (holding that federal courts lack jurisdiction to review the Attorney General\u2019s decision as to timeliness of an asylum request); <em>see also Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007) (providing that \u00a7 1158(a)(3) \u201cdivests us of jurisdiction to review decisions of whether an alien complied with the one-year time limit, or whether extraordinary circumstances were present to justify untimely filing of the asylum application\u201d). Thus, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that Zulkifli failed to demonstrate that changed conditions justified his untimely filing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). Accordingly, we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction Zulkifli\u2019s petition for review with respect to his asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">Zulkifli argues that he is eligible for withholding of removal because, if he returns to Indonesia, he has a well-founded fear of future persecution because of his conversion to Christianity and marriage to an ethnic Chinese woman. Specifically, Zulkifli asserts that his family has threatened to punish him according to the traditional law by putting him \u201cunder the cul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>ture court\u201d whereby he would be \u201cthrown into the jungle with feet and hands bounded or stoned to death.\u201d Further, Zulkifli offers evidence that Muslim extremist groups in Indonesia persecute Christians and interracial marriages like his, and the Indonesian government has not provided in the past adequate protection for its citizens. The Government responds that substantial evidence exists to support the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s finding that Zulkifli is not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">We review only the BIA\u2019s decision, except we also review the IJ\u2019s decision where the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the Board adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because in this case the BIA adopted the reasoning of the IJ, we review both decisions of the IJ and the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">We review the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test and will affirm if the decision \u201cis supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). Under the substantial evidence test, we can reverse a finding of fact by the IJ or BIA \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). We review the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo. Mejia, </em>498 F.3d at 1256.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">To obtain withholding of removal, an alien seeking withholding of removal must show that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in [his] country [of origin] because of [his] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). \u201cThe alien bears the burden of demonstrating that it is \u2018more likely than not\u2019 [he] will be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to [his] country.\u201d <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232). \u201c[Persecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, [and] ... [m]ere harassment is not persecution.\u201d <em>Ruiz, </em>479 F.3d at 766 (quotations omitted). The standard for withholding of removal \u201cis more stringent than the Veil-founded fear of future persecution\u2019 required for asylum.\u201d <em>Tan, </em>446 F.3d at 1375 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">An alien may satisfy his burden of proof for withholding of removal in two ways. First, an alien may establish past persecution based on a protected ground. <em>Id. </em>Past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution and shifts the burden to the government to show changed conditions in the country or the ability to avoid a future threat through relocation. <em>Id. </em>Second, an alien may establish that it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted upon removal due to race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Id. </em>However, an alien \u201cmust demonstrate that his or her fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. An alien cannot demonstrate that he more-likely-than-not would be persecuted on a protected ground if the alien could avoid a future threat by relocating to another part of the proposed country of removal. <em>Tan, </em>446 F.3d at 1375.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">Because Zulkifli did not allege, and no evidence exists, that he suffered past persecution, he was not entitled to a presump-</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>tion that he had a well-founded fear of future persecution if returned to Indonesia. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1). The IJ and the BIA determined that Zulkifli\u2019s conversion to Christianity and marriage to a woman of Chinese ethnicity did not render it \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that Zulkifli would be persecuted if returned to Indonesia. Having reviewed the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no error. Substantial evidence supports the determination that Zulkifli did not establish an inability to avoid future persecution. Notably, the IJ relied on evidence that the Indonesian government extends \u201cofficial status\u201d to the Christian faith, recognizes some Christian holy days, and the Indonesian constitution guarantees a citizen \u201cthe right to worship according to his or her own religious belief.\u201d Further, the IJ found that large numbers of ethnically Chinese individuals live in peace in several areas of the country, and the Indonesian government \u201cofficially promotes racial and ethnic tolerance.\u201d We agree that the record evidence does not compel a decision contrary to the IJ\u2019s decision and therefore deny Zulkifli\u2019s petition with respect to his withholding of removal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Because we lack jurisdiction to review the determination that Zulkifli failed to file a timely asylum application and conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision affirming denial of Zulkifli\u2019s application for withholding of removal, we dismiss Zulkifli\u2019s petition with respect to the asylum claim and deny the petition with regard to the withholding of removal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">DISMISSED IN PART and DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b389-17\">. Zulkifli has abandoned his claim for relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\"CAT\u201d) because he does not challenge the IJ\u2019s denial on appeal. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b390-8\">. Although \u00a7 106(a)(1 )(A)(iii) of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L.
