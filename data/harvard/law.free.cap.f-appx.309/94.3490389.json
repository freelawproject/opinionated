We dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Torres contends that the appeal waiver in his plea agreement is not enforceable. We conclude that the waiver was knowing and voluntary, <em>see United States v. Nguyen, </em>235 F.3d 1179, 1182-84 (9th Cir.2000), and that the waiver precludes our review of Torres\u2019s remaining contentions, <em>see United States v. Bibler, </em>495 F.3d 621, 623-24 (9th Cir.2007). Accordingly, we dismiss Torres\u2019s appeal of his sentence and his appeal from the denial of his Rule 35 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b121-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
