The government has confessed error. Because the district court erred in concluding that Amendment 599 did not apply to the facts of this case, we accept the government\u2019s confession, vacate the order of the district court, and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">In March 1999 a jury found White guilty of armed bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), (d), and of using a gun during a crime of violence, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 924(c). In addition to the gun, White also displayed a fake bomb when he robbed the bank. In determining White\u2019s sentence for the robbery, the district court applied a three-level upward adjustment to his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E) (1998) for brandishing the fake bomb. The court then calculated White\u2019s imprisonment range for the bank robbery as 235 to 293 months and sentenced White to 293 months. The court also imposed the mandatory consecutive sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment for the \u00a7 924(c) conviction. Without the increase for displaying the fake bomb, White\u2019s sentencing range for the bank robbery would have been 168 to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">White appealed, arguing that the district court erred by imposing the upward adjustment for brandishing a fake bomb given the consecutive sentence he received for using a gun during the same robbery. We rejected this argument, holding that the guidelines permitted the challenged increase because the consecutive sentence for the \u00a7 924(c) count was premised on separate conduct, i.e., the use of the gun. <em>See United States v. White, </em>222 F.3d 363, 372-76 (7th Cir.2000). Use of a bomb to commit a crime is punishable by a minimum of 30 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). And because White\u2019s 60-month sentence for his gun conviction did not adequately account for the use of a fake bomb to the extent Congress intended, we reasoned that the district court was free to enhance White\u2019s sentence for the robbery conviction based on his use of the fake bomb. <em>See White, </em>222 F.3d at 375-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">After we released our opinion in <em>White, </em>the Sentencing Commission issued Amendment 599, and made it retroactive. U.S.S.G. app. C, vol. II, amend. 599 (2000); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10. This amendment clarified the extent to which a sentencing court may impose a weapon adjustment for one offense where the defendant also has been convicted under \u00a7 924(c). Amendment 599 changed application note 2 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, which governs sentencing under \u00a7 924(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> White moved under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence on the basis of the amendment. The district court denied the motion, reasoning that because the amendment was \u201cintended to avoid the duplicative punishment that results when sentences are increased under both the statutes and the guidelines for substantially the same harm,\u201d <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, vol. II, amend. 599 (2000), and the harm inflicted by guns and bombs differ dramatically, White\u2019s punishments would not be predicted on the same harm. White again appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-11\">An interpretation of the sentencing guidelines or an amendment is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>United States v. Liddell, </em>492 F.3d 920, 921 (7th Cir.2007); <em>Alcala, </em>352 F.3d at 1156. The commentary interpreting or explaining a guideline is binding unless it violates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Constitution or federal law, or \u201cis inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\u201d <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993). We must decide whether Amendment 599 would have precluded application of the upward adjustment under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E) had it been in effect at the time of White\u2019s sentencing. We conclude it would have.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Amendment 599 resolved circuit splits over the meaning of \u201cunderlying offense\u201d and whether the adjustment could be applied for the use of multiple weapons by the defendant alone or in conjunction with an accomplice. U.S.S.G. app. C, vol. II, amend. 599 (2000). The amendment tried to harmonize the conflicting interpretations by declaring that the sentence for the \u00a7 924(c) charge \u201caccounts for any explosive or weapon enhancement for the underlying offense of conviction, including any such enhancement that would apply based on conduct for which the defendant is accountable under \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because White\u2019s use of the fake bomb was relevant conduct to the underlying bank robbery offense, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A), the \u00a7 924(c) conviction \u201caccounted] for\u201d the possibility of an upward adjustment under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E). Had the amendment been in place at the time of White\u2019s sentencing imposing the upward adjustment would have been forbidden. <em>See United States v. Diaz, </em>248 F.3d 1065, 1107 (11th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Aquino, </em>242 F.3d 859, 864 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The district court\u2019s order is VACATED and this case is REMANDED for consideration of whether, and to what extent, a reduction in sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) may be appropriate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b34-7\">. In 2002, the text found in Amendment 599 was moved from application note 2 to application note 4. <em>See United States v. Alcala, </em>352 F.3d 1153, 1156 n. 2 (7th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
