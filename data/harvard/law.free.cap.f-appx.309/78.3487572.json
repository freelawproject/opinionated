Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 953, 956 (8th Cir.2008) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">When an asylum decision is based on an adverse credibility finding, as it was in this case, we generally defer to the agency if the credibility finding is supported by \u201cspecific, cogent reason[s] for disbelief.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Upon careful review, we conclude that the BIA and the IJ provided such reasons. <em>See Ezeagwu v. Mukasey, </em>537 F.3d 836, 838-40 (8th Cir.2008) (discrepancies between petitioner\u2019s written affidavit and oral testimony, and petitioner\u2019s failure to mention in affidavit the alleged detentions to which he testified, provided legitimate basis on which to base adverse credibility finding); <em>Prawira v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 661, 662 (8th Cir.2005) (adverse credibility finding was supported by cogent and specific reasons where, inter alia, petitioner\u2019s application failed to mention alleged incidents of persecution that alien emphasized at hearing); <em>cf. Krouchevski v. Ashcroft, </em>344 F.3d 670, 673 (7th Cir.2003) (if petitioner\u2019s explanations and IJ\u2019s adverse inferences from discrepancies both appear valid, reviewing court should not supersede IJ\u2019s credibility finding).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b105-26\">. Chege also pursued withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture, but she does not address these claims in her brief; thus, they are waived. <em>See Chay-Velasquez v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 751, 756 (8th Cir 2004)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Ai\">. The IJ's alternative denial of asylum on the merits is not before the panel. <em>See Kebede v. Gonzales, </em>481 F.3d 562, 564 (8th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (appeals court reviews BIA\u2019s final agency action, not alternative rulings of IJ that were not reviewed by BIA and are not necessary to its decision).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
