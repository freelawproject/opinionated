We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Olushina argues that by misreading and failing to consider pertinent record evidence, the IJ committed an error of law in its discretionary decision rejecting her application for cancellation of removal. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 324 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[T]he REAL ID Act restored the jurisdiction of courts to review even factual and discretionary decisions of the Attorney General ... only to the limited extent that the petition for review of such decisions raises a constitutional claim or a question of law.\u201d); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). The IJ applied, however, the proper legal standard for the exercise of discretion under \u00a7 1229b(a), and reasonably weighed the applicable favorable and adverse factors in denying the application. <em>See Matter of CV-T, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 7, 11 (BIA 1998) (stating that the IJ \u201cmust balance [certain] adverse factors ... with the social and humanitarian considerations\u201d in adjudicating a \u00a7 1229b(a) petition (quotation marks omitted)). The IJ noted Olushina\u2019s steady work history, long residency in the United States, U.S.-born children, and other \u201csubstantial family ties\u201d to the country. The IJ weighed these favorable factors against convictions for theft and fraud in 1995, 1999, and 2004, emphasizing that the most recent arrest occurred after Olushina had been notified that her Legal Permanent Resident status was already in jeopardy. The IJ also pointed out that Olushina was required to pay restitution for the 1995 and 1999 crimes, which belied her contention that she did not personally benefit from the unlawful conduct. The IJ then concluded that Olushina\u2019s repeated failures to follow United States law outweighed \u201cthe hardship that will occur to her two children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Though \u201can unambiguous misstatement of pertinent facts in the record\u201d may indeed raise a question of law, the IJ\u2019s analysis did not rise to this level, even where the IJ incorrectly stated that Olushina had resided in the United States for 20 instead of 25 years and did not specifically describe her value to the community. <em>Khan v. Gonzales, </em>495 F.3d 31, 35-36 (2d Cir. 2007). Rather, Olushina\u2019s contentions \u201cessentially dispute[ ] ... the wisdom of [the IJ\u2019s] exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 329. Therefore, she \u201craises neither a constitutional claim nor a question of law,\u201d <em>id., </em>and we lack jurisdiction to review the petition. <em>See id. </em>at 329 n. 7 (\u201c[T]he court is permitted to review only the \u2018constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon [the] petition for review.\u2019 \u201d (citing \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D))).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
