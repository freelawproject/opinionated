Hidalgo appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to reduce his sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-19\">According to his presentence investigation report (\u201cPIR\u201d), the offense level was 26. Based on his prior criminal history, Hidalgo had four criminal history points for a category III. Three of his four criminal history points stemmed from convictions of harassment. Under the Guidelines, Hidalgo\u2019s recommended sentencing range was 78 to 97 months imprisonment, so the sentence was within the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-20\">On November 1, 2007, the Sentencing Commission released Amendment 709 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual. The pertinent section of Amendment 709 amended application note 12 to \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l), which guides the courts\u2019 analysis of misdemeanor offenses for the purposes of setting the appropriate criminal history category. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n. 12) (2008) (hereinafter \u201cUSSG\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-21\">On February 1, 2008, Hidalgo moved, <em>pro se, </em>for a reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), alleging that Amendment 709 to the Guidelines clarified the manner in which some similar misdemeanor offenses were to be considered in calculating his criminal history. Specifically, Hidalgo argued that his convictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>for harassment were similar to the offense of disorderly conduct listed in \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l), which does not carry criminal history points. Hidalgo claimed that Amendment 709 should be applied retroactively and, consequently, his recommended Guidelines range should be reduced, which would entitle him to a reduction of his sentence. The District Court denied Hidalgo\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">On appeal, Hidalgo argues that under the \u201ccommon sense\u201d test listed in Amendment 709, harassment qualifies as an \u201coffense similar to\u201d disorderly conduct and, therefore, is not an offense that carries criminal history points.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">In determining whether offenses are \u201csimilar\u201d under the terms of \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1), we have followed the \u201celements test\u201d listed in <em>United States v. Elmore, </em>108 F.3d 23, 27 (3d Cir.1997). However, Application Note 12 of Amendment 709 makes it clear that the Sentencing Commission now wishes all circuits to follow the \u201ccommon sense\u201d test first articulated in <em>United States v. Hardeman, </em>933 F.2d 278, 281 (5th Cir.1991). United States Sentencing Manual app. C at 240-41 (2008). Hidalgo contends that Application Note 12 of Amendment 709 should be applied retroactively and his harassment offenses should be analyzed under the new test in the amendment, which may result in his criminal history category being reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">\u201cGenerally, a district court may not alter a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed.\u201d <em>United States v. Wise, </em>515 F.3d 207, 220 (3d Cir.2008). However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">[I]n the ease of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, <em>if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements </em>issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (emphasis supplied). Thus, <em>Wise </em>informs us that \u201cif the applicable Guidelines range has been lowered after a defendant has been sentenced, a district court may ... reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence, but only if the reduction would be consistent with a policy statement issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Wise, </em>515 F.3d at 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">According to USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l), only amendments listed under \u00a7 lB1.10(c) are covered by the policy statement. Therefore, a reduction of sentence is not authorized under a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because the specific amendment the motion is based upon, Amendment 709, is not listed in USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">While acknowledging that Amendment 709 is not listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c), Hidalgo argues that Amendment 709 is a \u201cclarification\u201d of the Guidelines Manual and, therefore, should apply retroactively to his 2004 conviction and sentence. \u201c \u2018[Cjourts can give retroactive effect to a clarifying (as opposed to substantive) amendment regardless of whether it is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Marmolejos, </em>140 F.3d 488, 491 (3d Cir.1998) <em>(quoting United States v. Capers, </em>61 F.3d 1100, 1109 (4th Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-14\">However, a discussion of whether Amendment 709 is a clarifying or substantive amendment is not necessary because it is clear from the language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2) that if the pertinent amendment is not listed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>\u00a7 lB1.10(c), then a reduction of the defendant\u2019s term is not authorized under a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The applicable policy statement, \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\">(2) Exclusions. \u2014 A reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not consistent with this policy statement and therefore is not authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">(A) None of the amendments listed in subsection (c) is applicable to the defendant; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">(B) An amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">Thus, an amendment not listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c) is, by definition, inconsistent with the applicable policy statement. Although <em>Marmolejos </em>held that a clarifying amendment not listed under \u00a7 lB1.10(e) could be applied to reduce a sentence, <em>Marmolejos </em>did not involve a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, but was predicated on a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 action. <em>See Marmolejos, </em>140 F.3d at 489. Since Hidalgo\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion for a reduction in sentence is based upon Amendment 709, which is not listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(c), he is not eligible for a reduced sentence, and a determination of whether Amendment 709 is clarifying or substantive is not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion to reduce the sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-22\">. We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
