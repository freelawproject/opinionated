Because Oshodi was found removable for having been convicted of a controlled substance offense as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B), under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), we have jurisdiction \u201cto review factual determinations that trigger the jurisdiction-stripping provision, such as whether [Oshodi] [i]s an alien and whether she has been convicted of [a controlled substance offense].\u201d <em>Ramtulla v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 202, 203 (4th Cir.2002); see <em>Lewis v. INS, </em>194 F.3d 539, 542-43 (4th Cir.1999) (same). If the predicate conditions are found, then, under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D), we may reach only \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d <em>See Mbea v. Gonzales, </em>482 F.3d 276, 278 n. 1 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-22\">Because we find that Oshodi is indeed an alien who has been convicted of a controlled substance offense, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) divests us of jurisdiction over the petition for review, except to the extent that Oshodi raises a constitutional issue or question of law. The sole issue Oshodi raises in her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>petition for review is whether the Attorney General submitted clear and convincing evidence to demonstrate she was convicted of a controlled substance offense. This is a pure question of law, and is thus renewable. <em>Rosales-Pineda v. Gonzales, </em>452 F.3d 627, 630 (7th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude the Attorney General\u2019s evidence of Oshodi\u2019s conviction was both admissible and clear and convincing. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(3)(B)(vi) (2006); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.41(d) (2008). Thus, we find the Board\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s order of removal was supported by substantial evidence. An<em>im v. Mukasey, </em>535 F.3d 243, 252 (4th Cir.2008). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
