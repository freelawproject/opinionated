On appeal, Hansen argues the district court erred in finding Hansen violated his supervised release conditions, and Hansen also argues his sentence is unreasonable. After carefully reviewing the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">We conclude the district court did not clearly err in finding by a preponderance of the evidence Hansen violated the conditions of his supervised release. <em>See United States v. Carothers, </em>337 F.3d 1017, 1019 (8th Cir.2003) (holding the government must prove by a preponderance of evidence that the defendant violated a supervised release condition; the district court\u2019s finding that a violation occurred is reviewed for clear error; the district court did not clearly err in concluding the defendant violated a condition of supervised release by committing an assault, where the court found the victim\u2019s testimony credible and the defendant\u2019s testimony not credible; and the district court\u2019s witness credibility determinations are virtually unreviewable on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">We further conclude Hansen\u2019s sentence is not unreasonable, <em>see United States v. Tyson, </em>413 F.3d 824, 825 (8th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (standard of review of revocation sentences), because the sentence is within the statutory limit of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), and resulted from the district court\u2019s consideration of appropriate factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), <em>see United States v. Nelson, </em>453 F.3d 1004, 1006 (8th Cir.2006) (explaining the appellate court reviews a revocation sentence to determine whether it was unreasonable in relation to, inter alia, certain \u00a7 3553(a) factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">We grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, deny as moot Hansen\u2019s motion to expedite his appeal, and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-9\">.
