FIC moved for sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>mary judgment; Mary Kay moved for partial summary judgment. The district court granted FIC\u2019s motion and denied Mary Kay\u2019s motion. For the reasons provided below, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Mary Kay is a domestic cosmetics company that, from time to time, has purchased insurance policies from FIC. Mary Kay bought the policy at issue, No. 8146-1317 (the \u201cPolicy\u201d), from FIC in the summer of 2002. The Policy was a renewal of a previous policy that offered similar coverage terms. Among other things, the Policy covered the \u201cSponsored Organization\u201d of \u201cMary Kay Holding Corporation and its subsidiaries\u201d for employee benefit claims filed against one or more such entities from August 1, 2002 to August 1, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">Relevant terms of the Policy\u2019s \u201cFiduciary Liability\u201d section \u2014 the section at issue in this case \u2014 are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-8\">\u2022 [FIC] shall pay ... all Loss ... on account of any Claim first made against the Insured during the Policy Period ... for a Wrongful Act committed, attempted, or allegedly committed or attempted, before or during the Policy Period by an Insured or by any person for [whom] the Insured is legally responsible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-9\">\u2022 [FIC] shall have the right and duty to defend any Claim covered by this coverage section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-10\">\u2022 Insureds ... means ... [Mary Kay Holdings and its subsidiaries]; ... [any Sponsored Plan]; ... [an] Insured Person, or ... any other [entity] so designated----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-12\">\u2022 Wrongful Act means ... any breach of the responsibilities, obligations or duties imposed upon fiduciaries of the Sponsored Plan by [ERISA or] ... any negligent act, error or omission in the Administration of any Sponsored Plan....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-13\">\u2022 Sponsored Plan means ... an [ERISA plan] which is operated solely by [Mary Kay Holding Corporation or its subsidiaries] ... for the benefit of the[ir] employees ... and which existed at the Inception Date of this coverage section or of any policy ... of which this coverage section is a renewal....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-14\">\u2022 Subsidiary ... means any [entity] in which more than 50% of the outstanding securities or voting rights representing the present right to vote for election of directors is owned or controlled, directly or indirectly ... by [Mary Kay],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-15\">\u2022 Administration means giving advice to employees, handling records, or effecting enrollment, termination or cancellation of employees under a benefit plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-16\">\u2022 [FIC] shall not be liable ... in consequence of the failure of the Insured to comply with any law governing workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment, social security or disability benefits or any similar law, except [COBRA]....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-17\">On May 15, 2003, a group led by then-bankrupt Marketing Specialists Corporation filed suit against Mary Kay in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (Case No. 5:03-CV-95) (the \u201cMSC Suit\u201d). Through a series of amended complaints, the MSC Suit made several claims against Mary Kay \u2014 which had apparently supported MSC financially at one time \u2014 and related corporate and individual defendants. Pertinently, among the claims in the MSC Suit were \u201cBreach of ERISA Fiduciary Duties, Prohibited Transactions and Failure to Comply with COBRA.\u201d The district court summarized the claims at issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-18\">[T]he MSC Plaintiffs alleged that officers of Mary Kay, while acting as ERISA fiduciaries with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>MSC\u2019s employee benefits plans, misused and diverted plan assets to pay general corporate obligations in violation of the fiduciary duties imposed by ERISA. The MSC Plaintiffs further alleged that these officers failed to disclose material information to participants of the MSC benefits plans and misrepresented the status of those plans and their rights to continuation coverage under COBRA. The complaint alleged that Mary Kay was vicariously liable for these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. Additionally, the MSC Plaintiffs alleged that Mary Kay was directly liable for failing to provide COBRA continuation coverage to MSC plan participants upon the termination of their employment with MSC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq-\"><em>Mary Kay Holding Corp. v. Fed. Holding Co., </em>No. 3:06-CV-0896, 2007 WL 4179313, at *1 (N.D.Tex. Aug. 14, 2007) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">The MSC Suit\u2019s complaint alleged that \u201cMary Kay was a member of a controlled group ... which included [MSC],\u201d and it is this \u201ccontrol group\u201d relationship that Mary Kay contends exposes it to liability for failing to abide by COBRA for MSC employees. Nevertheless, the complaint never alleges that MSC was a subsidiary of Mary Kay during the Policy <em>term </em>\u2014 i.e., August 2002 to August 2003 \u2014 which is a status required of MSC for coverage. This is understandable given that any subsidiary stake that Mary Kay may have had in MSC was gone by virtue of an April 4, 2002 approval by a federal bankruptcy court of MSC\u2019s reorganization which included cancellation of \u201call of the existing stock of [MSC]\u201d and its reissue to a reorganization trust separate and apart from Mary Kay, effective May 26, 2002. Only the fact \u2014 and not the details \u2014 of the MSC bankruptcy are included in the MSC Suit\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Despite the MSC reorganization, Mary Kay sought Policy coverage for the MSC Suit and notified FIC of the claims on or about May 29, 2003. FIC denied coverage on November 29, 2004, stating that \u201c[because MSC is not a Subsidiary of Mary Kay, the Policy provides no coverage in connection with alleged misconduct involving benefit plans provided or sponsored by MSC.\u201d On June 13, 2005, FIC stated that, as to Mary Kay plan claims, the Policy covers fiduciary breaches, not failures to sponsor the plan benefits at issue in the MSC Suit. In any event, Mary Kay entered into a settlement in the MSC Suit on September 28, 2005, which the court in that case then approved on January 18, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">Mary Kay first filed the present action on May 18, 2006.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In its complaint, Mary Kay seeks to recover the defense and settlement costs that it incurred as a result of the MSC Suit, as well as damages and penalties for failure to promptly pay the claim. Although the original complaint made claims for both indemnity and a duty to defend, only the duty to defend is before this court on appeal. In short, Mary Kay argues that the MSC Suit is covered by the Policy because the suit involved (1) vicarious ERISA fiduciary breaches and COBRA violations relating to benefit plans of MSC, and/or (2) direct COBRA violations relating to benefit plans of Mary Kay as a control group member. FIC denies that the MSC Suit is covered, because (1) there is no liability with respect to MSC plans because MSC was not a covered Mary Kay subsidiary, either under the Policy\u2019s terms or as a result of reorganization, and (2) any liability regarding Mary Kay plans is barred because any such claim would be made against it as a sponsor, not as a covered fiduciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>After a period of discovery, Mary Kay filed a motion for partial summary judgment on February 23, 2007 on its central claim of FIC\u2019s liability under the Policy for Mary Kay\u2019s \u201creasonable and necessary defense costs\u201d in the MSC Suit. FIC then filed a motion for full summary judgment on all claims. On August 14, 2007, the district court granted FIC\u2019s motion and denied Mary Kay\u2019s motion. As to MSC plans, it found that given its bankruptcy, \u201cas of August 1, 2002 <em>[i.e., </em>the Policy\u2019s effective date], MSC was not a subsidiary of Mary Kay, as defined in the Policy, and the MSC employee benefit plans were not sponsored plans,\u201d and, thus, MSC plan-based claims \u201cdo not allege wrongful acts within the scope of the Policy.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court noted that the bankruptcy order constituted evidence outside the \u201ceight-corners rule\u201d that looks only to the policy and complaint for finding a duty to defend in Texas. <em>See Lincoln Gen. Ins. Co. v. Reyna, </em>401 F.3d 347, 350 (5th Cir.2005). Nevertheless, it found that a \u201ccoverage\u201d exception to the rule should apply because subsidiary status under the Policy only concerns coverage and does not implicate the merits of the underlying action. <em>See GuideOne Elite Ins. Co. v. Fielder Rd. Baptist Church, </em>197 S.W.3d 305, 308-09 (Tex.2006). As to Mary Kay plans, the court found that any failure to offer COBRA coverage was a sponsorship issue, and did not fit the Policy\u2019s coverage of fiduciary acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Mary Kay filed a notice of appeal on September 6, 2007. In its brief, Mary Kay notes six issues for review. These issues, however, come down to two basic questions: (1) whether the district court erred in finding that MSC was not a \u201csubsidiary\u201d under the Policy, and (2) whether the district court erred in finding that the claims against Mary Kay under COBRA relating to Mary Kay\u2019s plans were not \u201cwrongful acts\u201d under the Policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">This court reviews grants of summary judgment <em>de novo. Ford Motor Co. v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>264 F.3d 493, 498 (5th Cir.2001). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). This court \u201cmay affirm summary judgment on any legal ground raised below, even if it was not the basis for the district court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Performance Autoplex II Ltd. v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co., </em>322 F.3d 847, 853 (5th Cir.2003). Finally, as to the duty to defend, \u201c[u]nder the eight-corners ... rule, an insurer\u2019s duty to defend is determined by the third-party plaintiffs pleadings, considered in light of the policy provisions, without regard to the truth or falsity of those allegations.\u201d <em>Gomez v. Allstate Tex. Lloyds Ins. Co., </em>241 S.W.3d 196, 202 (Tex.2007). And, in making this determination, \u201callegations against the insured are liberally construed in favor of coverage.\u201d <em>GuideOne, </em>197 S.W.3d at 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">A. <em>MSC Plan Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ah2\">The first ground for Mary Kay\u2019s alleged Policy coverage in the MSC Suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>concerns certain ERISA and COBRA claims relating to benefit plans of MSC, which Mary Kay submits was covered as its \u201csubsidiary\u201d under the Policy. These claims include breaches of fiduciary and co-fiduciary duty, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1104, 1105, prohibited transactions, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1106, and failures to offer plan benefit continuation and related information to participants, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1161, 1166. As described above, the district court found in favor of FIC based on its adoption of a \u201ccoverage\u201d exception to the \u201ceight-corners rule\u201d and, thereafter, its invocation of the bankruptcy order. We affirm the district court\u2019s finding, although we do so on alternative grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">While appreciating the arguments for a limited \u201ccoverage\u201d exception to the \u201ceight-corners rule,\u201d we recognize that Texas has yet to adopt such an exception. <em>See, e.g., Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v. Nokia, Inc., </em>268 S.W.3d 487, 497 (Tex.2008) (observing that \u201cTexas has not\u201d recognized an exception to the \u201ceight-corners rule\u201d); <em>GuideOne, </em>197 S.W.3d at 308-09 (acknowledging, without adopting, a \u201ccoverage\u201d exception to the rule); <em>see also Northfield Ins. Co. v. Loving Home Care, Inc., </em>363 F.3d 523, 531 (5th Cir.2004) (predicting, without applying, a limited exception that the Texas Supreme Court might adopt). Nevertheless, it is unnecessary for us to adopt it here because the district court\u2019s finding can be alternatively, and more directly, affirmed based on the fact that the MSC Suit\u2019s complaint \u2014 which is in the \u201ceight corners\u201d \u2014 fails to include any specific allegations from which Mary Kay subsidiary status during the Policy term can be discerned. <em>See Northfield Ins. Co., </em>363 F.3d at 531 (\u201cIf all the facts alleged in the underlying petition fall outside the scope of coverage, then there is no duty to defend.\u201d); <em>King v. Dallas Fire Ins. Co., </em>85 S.W.3d 185, 187 (Tex.2002) (\u201cIf a petition does not allege facts within the scope of coverage, an insurer is not legally required to defend a suit against its insured.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">The only possible allegation in the MSC Suit\u2019s complaint relating to Mary Kay\u2019s position in MSC is through reference to an arguable Mary Kay subsidiary, \u201cMS Acquisition, Ltd.,\u201d and a March 2001 Form 10-K stating that this entity \u201cowned approximately 81.9% of the outstanding common shares of [MSC].\u201d Yet, not only does this assertion pre-date the Policy term, it pre-dates the bankruptcy of MSC. Bankruptcy, by its very nature, \u201ccauses fundamental changes in the nature of corporate relationships.\u201d <em>Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n v. Weintraub, </em>471 U.S. 343, 355, 105 S.Ct. 1986, 85 L.Ed.2d 372 (1985). This pre-Policy term timing is perhaps not surprising given that the chief focus of the MSC Suit was on events surrounding MSC\u2019s bankruptcy, which occurred well before the Policy term. In any event, stretching arguable ownership allegations from well before to after bankruptcy in order to impose a duty to defend is simply a bridge too far, particularly given the Policy\u2019s present-tense definition of subsidiary \u2014 the Policy defines \u201csubsidiary\u201d as any entity \u201cin which more than 50% of the outstanding securities or voting rights representing the present right to vote for election of directors is owned or controlled, directly or indirectly ... by [Mary Kay].\u201d Thus, we hold that the MSC plan-based claims in the MSC Suit are not covered by the Policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">Of course, the foregoing assumes that it is the Policy term, and not any other prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>point in time, that matters for coverage purposes. Mary Kay argues that by the Policy\u2019s references to \u201crenew[ed]\u201d policies \u2014 -which would include the 2000-2002 policy \u2014 in its definition of \u201csponsored plan,\u201d and to acts \u201cbefore or during the Policy period\u201d in its coverage provision, the Policy \u201cprovides residual coverage to Mary Kay.\u201d Mary Kay\u2019s argument is misguided. First, the operative Policy term \u201csubsidiary\u201d is defined in the present tense. Second, language elsewhere in the Policy indicates \u2014 at least during a term\u2014 that it only covers new subsidiaries with further agreement (and a likely premium adjustment), and does not cover divested subsidiaries. Third, although pre-existing act coverage is understandable, particularly on a renewal, \u201cperpetual coverage of former subsidiaries,\u201d as the district court put it, would likely present complex underwriting issues. We cannot impose such risks on FIC without supporting policy language. <em>See King, </em>85 S.W.3d at 187 (observing that the duty to defend depends upon \u201cthe language of the insurance policy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">B. <em>Mary Kay Plan Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Turning to the second ground for Mary Kay\u2019s alleged entitlement to FIC <em>coverage </em>\u2014 ie., direct claims against Mary Kay under COBRA \u2014 we agree with the district court. In asserting its entitlement to coverage, Mary Kay cites the following language from the MSC Suit\u2019s complaint: \u201cMary Kay was a member of a controlled group of corporations ... which included [MSC] ... [and] Mary Kay has failed to provide continuation coverage to the terminated [MSC] employees and to otherwise satisfy any of the other obligations imposed upon [it] by COBRA\u201d The relevant COBRA obligations \u2014 at least as alleged\u2014 concern the provision of access to Mary Kay plan benefits under the relevant plan(s). <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1161. The problem for Mary Kay, however, is not its status as a covered entity \u2014 indeed, whether as a control group member or not, the MSC Suit has Mary Kay (which is an \u201cinsured\u201d) and its plans (which are \u201csponsored\u201d) clearly in its sights \u2014 but whether the relevant COBRA claims are \u201cwrongful acts\u201d under the Policy. We conclude that they are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-10\">The relevant Policy provisions, which are expressly described as providing \u201cfiduciary liability coverage,\u201d only insure against claims of \u201cwrongful acts.\u201d The Policy defines \u201cwrongful acts\u201d as \u201cany breach of the responsibilities, obligations or duties imposed upon fiduciaries of the Sponsored Plan by [ERISA], as amended, ... or any negligent act, error or omission in the Administration of any Sponsored Plan.\u201d The district court properly found that the COBRA allegations were not covered \u201cwrongful acts\u201d because any alleged failure to offer continuing benefits under its plans rests on Mary Kay as a plan sponsor, and sponsorship acts or omissions are not fiduciary in nature. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1161(a); <em>Lockheed Corp. v. Spink, </em>517 U.S. 882, 890-91, 116 S.Ct. 1783, 135 L.Ed.2d 153 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-11\">One is a \u201cfiduciary\u201d under ERISA only \u201cto the extent ... he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management ... or disposition of [plan] assets____\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21)(A). Though some circuits have allowed fiduciary-based relief for failure to advise participants of COBRA rights, <em>e.g., Bixler v. Cent. Pa. Teamsters Health &amp; Welfare Fund, </em>12 F.3d 1292, 1301 (3d Cir. 1993), this court has taken care to distinguish between fiduciary and statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>ERISA duties. <em>Cf. Lopez v. Premium Auto Acceptance Corp., </em>389 F.3d 504, 509 <em>&amp; </em>n. 9 (5th Cir.2004) (holding that the COBRA notice rule, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1166, is a statutory rule, not a contractual duty). More importantly, the offer of such benefits in <em>themselves </em>\u2014 i.e., the core of the relevant claim in the complaint \u2014 would require inclusion of new participants in Mary Kay\u2019s plans, and, as such, would be a settlor, not a fiduciary, function in any event. <em>See Spink, </em>517 U.S. at 890, 116 S.Ct. 1783 (\u201csponsors who alter the terms of a plan [are not] fiduciaries\u201d); <em>see also Hughes Aircraft Co. v. Jacobson, </em>525 U.S. 432, 444, 119 S.Ct. 755, 142 L.Ed.2d 881 (1999) (\u201cERISA\u2019s fiduciary duty requirement simply is not implicated ... [in] a decision regarding the form or structure of the Plan such as who is entitled to receive Plan benefits____\u201d). COBRA relief may have been available in the MSC Suit, but not as a fiduciary breach, as required for coverage under the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Mary Kay argues that even if the provision (or not) of COBRA benefits was a settlor function, the MSC Suit \u201callege[s] negligent administration by Mary Kay of its own benefits plan.\u201d Mary Kay cites complaint allegations that it \u201cfailed to otherwise satisfy any of the other obligations imposed on [it] by COBRA,\u201d and that MSC \u201csues\u201d various agents of Mary Kay \u201cfor failing to disclose material information, and making knowing and intentional misrepresentations to participants in the Benefit Plans regarding ... their rights to continuation coverage under COBRA....\u201d The complaint defined \u201cBenefit Plans\u201d as \u201cvarious employee Benefit Plans that covered [MSC] employees, including without limitation the [MSC] Employee Group Benefit Plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">Mary Kay\u2019s claim of non-sponsor duties fails for two reasons. First, the allegations that Mary Kay generally failed to comply with obligations of COBRA cannot support a duty to defend, because the MSC Suit\u2019s complaint only states them in a conclusory fashion. <em>See Cornhill Ins. PLC v. Valsamis, Inc., </em>106 F.3d 80, 85 (5th Cir.1997) (\u201cTexas courts do not look to conclusory assertions of a cause of action in determining a duty to defend ... [but to] the facts giving rise to the alleged actionable conduct....\u201d). Second, Mary Kay\u2019s only other basis for COBRA rights vis-a-vis Mary Kay <em>plans </em>\u2014 i.e., its alleged \u201cfail[ure] to disclose material information, and making knowing and intentional misrepresentations to participants in the Benefit Plans\u201d \u2014 excludes such plans because \u201cBenefit Plans\u201d includes only those that \u201ccovered [MSC] employees.\u201d The MSC Suit\u2019s complaint allegations regarding workers \u201clos[ing] health coverage when their employment was terminated shortly after [MSC] filed [for] bankruptcy\u201d and Mary Kay \u201cfailfing] to provide continuation coverage\u201d defeat any claim that the complaint thought of Mary Kay\u2019s plans as having \u201ccovered [MSC] employees,\u201d absent any theory of new enrollment via COBRA. MSC employees were never so covered.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, we affirm the district court on the Mary Kay plan claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to FIC.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b870-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

The district court\u2019s finding that MSC\u2019s plans were not \"sponsored\u201d under the Policy also applied in its analysis of alleged COBRA misrepresentation over such plans.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b873-7\">. Mary Kay also appeals the dismissal of state insurance code and \"bad faith\u201d denial claims, yet given the lack of briefing (no cases or statutory provisions are cited in support), any appeal of the relevant findings is dismissed pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a). <em>See Yohey v.

It should be noted that, at least on appeal, Mary Kay seeks only a duty to defend from FIC, and not indemnity.

In support of its claim for Policy coverage, Mary Kay also invokes the Policy\u2019s express exception of COBRA from a list of certain statutory \"wrongful act\u201d exclusions. As the district court found, however, exceptions to exclusions do not, in themselves, yield insurance coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
