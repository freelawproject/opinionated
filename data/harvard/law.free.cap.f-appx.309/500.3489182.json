We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case, and the issues presented on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-23\">We have no jurisdiction to review an IJ\u2019s decision to deny adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255 when it is based on his or her discretion. <em>Ling Yang v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 278, 279 (2d Cir. 2008); <em>Guyadin v. Gonzales, </em>449 F.3d 465, 468 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) (precluding judicial review of \u201cany judgment regarding the granting of relief under ... [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 1255 [permitting adjustment of status].\u201d). But, we retain jurisdiction to review \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-26\">Sison argues that the IJ erred by improperly \u201cre-adjudicating\u201d or \u201cre-evaluating\u201d Sison\u2019s previously approved 1-140 petition in his decision to deny Sison\u2019s adjustment of status. He did not do so. He based his denial of adjustment of status on an exercise of discretion based in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>part on discrepancies between the 1-140 petition and Sison\u2019s testimony. That is not a \u201cre-adjudication\u201d of the 1-140 petition. Because the IJ\u2019s decision was based on an exercise of discretion, we have no jurisdiction to review Sison\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review of the order of the Board of Immigration Appeals is hereby DISMISSED. Having completed our review, the petitioner\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
