Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 338-39 (9th Cir.1995), we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-17\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s findings that Tezen Cojon was not persecuted in Guatemala because the military never physically harmed him or threatened him, <em>see Canales-Vargas v. Gonzales, </em>441 F.3d 739, 744 (9th Cir.2006), and the military\u2019s murder of Tezen Cojon\u2019s uncle, unrelated to him, did not constitute persecution of Tezen Cojon, <em>see Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 961 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc) (noting that persecution is an extreme concept); <em>see also Prasad, </em>47 F.3d at 340 (although factfinder could have found past persecution, it was not compelled to do so). Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Tezen Cojon failed to establish he had a well-founded fear of persecution because his family members remain in Guatemala apparently unharmed, <em>see Aruta v. INS, </em>80 F.3d 1389, 1395 (9th Cir.1996), and his fear of future persecution is speculative in light of current country conditions, <em>see Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1018 (9th Cir.2003). Therefore, we deny the petition as to Tezen Cojon\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-18\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Tezen Cojon\u2019s contentions regarding with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>holding of removal and CAT relief because he failed to exhaust these claims before the BIA. <em>See Zara v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 927, 930-31 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b146-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
