She argues that the district court erred in determining that her prior state convictions for possession of a controlled substance were aggravated felonies for purposes of U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) (2006). She argues that because her state possession convictions were not subject to a state recidivist enhancement, they should not be considered an aggravated felony for sentencing pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>poses under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). She also argues that the procedural safeguards mandated under federal and state law for application of a recidivist enhancement were not satisfied. She acknowledges <em>United States v. Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d 333, 335-36 (5th Cir.2008), but argues that it did not address the notice issues presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">In <em>Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d at 335-36, we held that <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), did not require that this court abandon its holding in <em>United States v. Sanchez-Villalobos, </em>412 F.3d 572, 577 (5th Cir.2005), that a second state conviction for simple possession qualified as an aggravated felony, which supported the imposition of the eight-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). Similarly, Izaguirre-Meza has four prior state convictions for possession of a controlled substance, at least two of which if filed in federal court would have been punishable as a felony under \u00a7 844(a). Thus, the district court did not err in determining that at least one of her prior convictions may be treated as an aggravated felony for sentencing purposes under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). <em>See Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d at 335-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">We also rejected Cepeda-Rios\u2019s argument that the Government\u2019s failure to comply with the procedural requirements of \u00a7 851(a) prohibited the district court from enhancing his sentence under \u00a7 844(a) based on his first state possession conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 335-36 &amp; n. 11. This court noted that the relevant inquiry was whether the crime was punishable under \u00a7 844(a), rather than whether the Government actually sought to prosecute the defendant under \u00a7 844(a). <em>Id. </em>This court observed further that \u201cCepeda-Rios had the opportunity to object to the finality of his first state possession conviction at his federal sentencing hearing, but he did not do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Likewise, Izaguirre-Meza did <em>not </em>challenge the existence, validity, or finality of her prior state possession convictions at her federal sentencing healing or on appeal. Because the Government did not actually seek to prosecute Izaguirre-Meza under the Controlled Substances Act, and was not a party to Izaguirre-Meza\u2019s state court convictions, \u00a7 851(a) notice was not necessary. <em>See id. </em>Further, in <em>Lopez, </em>the Supreme Court held that the sentencing court \u201cmust look only to whether [a defendant\u2019s] conviction would be considered an \u2018aggravated felony under federal law; whether the crime is classified as a felony or misdemeanor by the state of conviction is irrelevant.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 334. Similarly, the state notice requirements are also irrelevant to the determination of whether the \u00a7 2L1.2 enhancement is warranted. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b868-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
