On appeal, Trent contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel based on his attorney\u2019s alleged actual conflict of interest and that the jury instructions defining the principle of aiding and abetting violated his right to due process by lowering the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof for the essential element of premeditation and deliberation for first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not recite them in detail. We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition. <em>Jensen v. Pliler, </em>439 F.3d 1086, 1088 (9th Cir.2006). Trent\u2019s petition is governed by the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). Under AEDPA, a state prisoner is entitled to relief if the state court adjudication of a claim resulted in a decision that \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">We reject Trent\u2019s contention that he was denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel because his trial attorney had \u201can actual conflict of interest [that] adversely affected [her] performance.\u201d <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 350, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980). We have recognized that an actual conflict may arise from successive representation, \u201cparticularly when a substantial relationship exists between the cases, such that the \u2018factual contexts of the two representations are similar or related.\u2019 \u201d <em>Houston v. Schomig, </em>533 F.3d 1076, 1081 (9th Cir.2008) (citations omitted). Here, however, the California Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that there was no conflict is not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court authority. While it is true that a prosecution witness in Trent\u2019s trial had previously been represented by another attorney in the same publie defender\u2019s office as Trent\u2019s trial counsel, the cases were factually unrelated and Trent\u2019s counsel stated to the trial court that she had no confidential information concerning the earlier case involving the prosecution witness. Further, she informed the trial court that the attorney who represented the prosecution witness in the past refused to speak to her about that case. Finally, the public defender\u2019s office no longer represented the prosecution witness, and the state charges against him had been dismissed at the time of Trent\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>In <em>Houston v. Schomig, </em>this court recently remanded for an evidentiary hearing on a conflict of interest claim arising from the petitioner\u2019s representation by another member of the same public defender\u2019s office that previously had represented a victim and key prosecution witness. <em>See id. </em>at 1081-82. However, there, the factual contexts of the two representations were related, and the public defender representing petitioner stated his belief to the trial court that the witness had been wrongfully convicted in a case related to the feud at issue in petitioner\u2019s case. <em>See id. </em>Here, Trent\u2019s attorney\u2019s situation at trial is readily distinguishable, because the two cases at issue were not related and, more importantly, his attorney had no confidential information from the prior case. Moreover, the witness here pled guilty to an unrelated crime: He was not \u201cwrongfully convicted\u201d for a related crime as was alleged in the <em>Houston </em>case. No Supreme Court authority supports a finding of an actual conflict in such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Having concluded that the record reveals no actual conflict of interest, we need not consider whether Trent\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance was adversely affected by the alleged conflict when she made the decision not to cross-examine the prosecution witness or whether that was a strategic decision. Therefore, Trent\u2019s conflict-based ineffective assistance of counsel argument fails. <em>See Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. at 350, 100 S.Ct. 1708 (\u201c[UJntil a defendant shows that his counsel actively represented conflicting interests, he has not established the constitutional predicate for his claim of ineffective assistance.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Trent\u2019s contention regarding the aiding and abetting jury instruction at his trial is also without merit. The instructions, when evaluated as a whole, clearly require the jury to find all necessary elements of first degree murder including premeditation, even if the jury relied solely on an aiding and abetting theory and the natural and probable consequence instructions to convict (as it did here). <em>See Spivey v. Rocha, </em>194 F.3d 971, 976 (9th Cir.1999) (A jury instruction \u2018\u201cmust be viewed in the context of the entire trial and the jury instructions taken as a whole.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). In the aiding and abetting instruction, the jury was instructed that \u201cthe crime of murder\u201d must be the \u201cnatural and probable consequence of the commission of the crime of assault or battery.\u201d The instruction further stated that \u201c[y]ou are not required to unanimously agree as to which originally contemplated crime the defendant aided and abetted, so long as you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt and unanimously [agree] that the defendant aided and abetted the commission of an identified and defined target crime and that the crime of <em>murder </em>(charged crime) was a natural and probable consequences of the commission of that target crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Trent contends these instructions \u201cobliterated the distinction between first and second degree murder under the natural and probable consequence doctrine.\u201d However, this argument ignores the fact that the jury was instructed only as to first degree murder, because defense counsel withdrew her request for a second degree murder instruction for strategic reasons. Therefore, when the aiding and abetting instructions referred to \u201cmurder\u201d and the \u201ccharged crime\u201d of murder, the jurors could refer to the instructions defining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>first degree deliberate and premeditated murder if they needed clarification as to the elements of murder. Trent therefore has failed to show that any alleged deficiency in the jury instruction by itself \u201cso infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process.\u201d <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 71-72, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (quoting <em>Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 147, 94 S.Ct. 396, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Trent\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus because the California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision affirming Trent\u2019s conviction did not result in an adjudication contrary to \u201cclearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b228-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

Trent has not raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). We, therefore, do not decide whether Trent\u2019s counsel's refusal to cross examine the witness because she believed she had a conflict of interest was ineffective representation, or, if so, whether the <em>Strickland </em>prejudice standard was met.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
