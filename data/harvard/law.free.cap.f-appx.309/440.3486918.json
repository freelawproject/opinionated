Dec. 17, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. 98 560 097 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Feb. 15, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-20\">As an initial matter, although You claimed in his asylum application that he feared persecution in China based on his illegal departure, the IJ did not address this claim in his decision and You did not raise it in his appeal to the BIA or in his brief to this Court. Accordingly, his asylum claim based on his illegal departure from China is deemed abandoned and we do not further address it. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-21\">When \u201cthe BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, we will review both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions \u2014 or more precisely, we review the IJ\u2019s decision in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>eluding the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA.\u201d <em>Yun-Zui Guan, v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of JustiZce, </em>428 F.3d 391, 400-01 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">We find that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. The IJ properly based his adverse credibility determination on his findings that: (1) You\u2019s testimony and his father\u2019s letter were inconsistent regarding the date of his father\u2019s alleged arrest; (2) You\u2019s testimony regarding his knowledge of Falun Gong was inconsistent with his statements at his airport interview; and (4) there was a discrepancy between his testimony and his statement at his airport interview regarding the passport he used to depart China.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The IJ also reasonably found implausible You\u2019s claim that he was able to obtain a notarial birth certificate during the time when he asserted that the Chinese authorities were seeking to arrest him. <em>See Wensheng Yan v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 63, 67 (2d Cir.2007) (providing that where \u201cthe reasons for [the IJ\u2019s] incredulity are evident,\u201d the implausibility finding will be considered to be \u201csupported by substantial evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">While not all of these findings were central to You\u2019s claim that he fears persecution for being a Falun Gong practitioner, because the REAL ID Act applies to You\u2019s applications for relief, the IJ properly relied on these findings where they indicate that You was not credible under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>see also Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir. 2008) (holding that under the REAL ID Act, an IJ is not required to base an adverse credibility determination on findings that are material to the applicant\u2019s claim, but \u201cmay rely on <em>any </em>inconsistency or omission ... as long as the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 establishes that [the] applicant is not credible\u201d (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii))). Further, although You was given the opportunity to explain the discrepancies present in his claim, the IJ reasonably rejected his explanations. <em>Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that the agency need not credit an applicant\u2019s explanations for inconsistent testimony unless those explanations would compel a reasonable fact-finder to do so). Moreover, the IJ did not err in finding that You\u2019s failure to submit evidence corroborating his claim rendered him unable to rehabilitate testimony that had already been cast in doubt. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Accordingly, the IJ properly found that You failed to meet the burden of proof required for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT, where each of his claims was based upon the same factual predicate. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b468-6\">. Contrary to You's argument in his brief to this Court, the record of his airport interview provides a \"sufficiently accurate record\u201d of his statements \"to merit consideration in determining whether [he] is credible.\u201d <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 179 (2d Cir.2004); <em>see also Diallo v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 624, 631-33 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
