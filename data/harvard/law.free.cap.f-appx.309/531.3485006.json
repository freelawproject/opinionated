Boehm, </em>No. 1:05-CV-01167 (N.D.N.Y. Aug. 15, 2007). On appeal, plaintiff contends that the District Court erred in granting defendants\u2019 motion because the evidence before the court, viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff, demonstrated that defendants terminated her employment in retaliation for speech protected by the First Amendment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>construing the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See, e.g., Hoyt v. Andreucci, </em>433 F.3d 320, 327 (2d Cir.2006). \u201cAn order granting summary judgment will be affirmed only when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., </em>451 F.3d 104, 108 (2d Cir.2006) (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)). In order to demonstrate a genuine issue of a material fact, \u201cthe non-moving party may not rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation,\u201d but must instead \u201cpresent \u2018specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Major League Baseball Properties, Inc. v. Salvino, Inc., </em>542 F.3d 290, 306 (2d Cir.2008) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e)) (some internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">In order to prevail on a First Amendment retaliation claim, plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) she engaged in speech protected by the First Amendment, as a result of which (2) she suffered an adverse employment decision, and (3) \u201ca causal connection existed between the speech and the adverse employment decision, so that it can be said that her speech was the motivating factor in the determination.\u201d <em>Gronowski v. Spencer, </em>424 F.3d 285, 292 (2d Cir.2005). Neither side dispute that plaintiffs decision not to attend a political fundraiser was protected by the First Amendment. Nor is it disputed that plaintiffs termination was an adverse employment decision. The District Court nevertheless granted summary judgment to defendants because it found that plaintiff had not produced evidence sufficient to establish a causal link between her conduct and her termination. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">As plaintiff observes, causation \u201ccan be established indirectly by showing that the protected activity was closely followed in time by the adverse action.\u201d <em>Cifra v. G.E. Co., </em>252 F.3d 205, 217 (2d Cir.2001). However, neither the record in this case nor our case law supports plaintiffs contention that we may infer causation from the timing of her firing in this case. In <em>Dillon v. Morano, </em>we held that a First Amendment retaliation claim could not survive summary judgment where plaintiff suffered an adverse employment decision as part of an \u201coffice-wide reorganization\u201d and plaintiff failed to \u201cpresent[ ] evidence that this reallocation of resources was targeted at him, or any other evidence from which one could infer that [defendant] made these various decisions affecting numerous other people in order to retaliate against [plaintiff].\u201d 497 F.3d 247, 255 (2d Cir.2007). In <em>Dillon, </em>indicia of retaliation were considerably stronger than in this case. Plaintiff, an investigator in Connecticut\u2019s Office of the Chief State\u2019s Attorney, had sued defendant, the Chief State\u2019s Attorney in Connecticut, who allegedly told plaintiff, \u201c[T]his [suit] will affect the way I treat certain employees in the future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">In the instant case, plaintiff was fired, along with three other employees, during a well-documented period of office restruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>turing in the midst of a state-wide budget shortfall that accompanied the appointment of a new Inspector General (\u201cIG\u201d), and she has failed to demonstrate that the IG\u2019s decision to terminate her was in anyway motivated by her exercise of First Amendment rights. Rather, it is undisputed that plaintiff was specifically identified as part of group of employees who added the \u201cleast value\u201d at their respective positions. J.A. 80. In fact, plaintiff was considered by some to be one of the \u201cleast valuable\u201d OIG employees. J.A. 208. She had been demoted five years prior to her termination, and she had at times interacted with members of the public in an unprofessional manner, sometimes \u201cyelling loudly\u201d at complainants, J.A. 408. Further, the evidence shows that plaintiffs high salary made it difficult for the IG to justify moving her to a new position with less responsibility. The IG testified that on June 21, 2005 \u2014 the day <em>before </em>she learned of plaintiffs protected activity \u2014 she generated a list of four individuals to be terminated. Consistent with her prior determination that plaintiff added the \u201cleast value\u201d among the inspectors, the IG placed plaintiffs name on this list.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Plaintiff points to no evidence, aside from timing of her firing, from which we might infer that her exercise of First Amendment rights was a \u201csubstantial or motivating factor\u201d in the IG\u2019s decision to fire her. <em>See Beechwood Restorative Care Center v. Leeds, </em>436 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir.2006). We hold that the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Finally, we agree that dismissal of plaintiffs claims against the OIG and the State of New York was appropriate, as each is immune from suit in federal court absent the State\u2019s consent. <em>See Puerto Rico Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc., </em>506 U.S. 139, 144, 113 S.Ct. 684, 121 L.Ed.2d 605 (1993) (\u201cAbsent waiver, neither a State nor agencies acting under its control may be subject to suit federal court.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">For the reasons stated above, the August 15, 2007 order of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
