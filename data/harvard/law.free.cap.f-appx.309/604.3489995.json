The Probation Office properly calculated his advisory Sentencing Guidelines range to be 37-46 months. At the close of the sentencing hearing, the District Court sentenced Madison to a term of imprisonment of 60 months to commence after service of a state sentence he was serving for a different crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">In this appeal, Madison urges that the District Court erred as a matter of law by (1) \u201cdeparting upward\u201d from the Guidelines range; (2) failing to provide advance notice of its intent to so depart; and (3) denying his request to have his federal sentence run concurrently with his state one. We consider each in turn and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">The District Court followed the applicable precedent. It properly calculated the applicable Guidelines range, recognized them as advisory, considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and decided upon a sentence that it expressly found to be \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to reflect the seriousness of the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from [the defendant\u2019s] conduct and provide [him] with an opportunity for rehabilitation.\u201d App. at 57. The Court also explained on the record how it reached its decision, as well as why it was unpersuaded by the arguments it did not accept.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-17\">There was no departure under the Sentencing Guidelines. Rather, the District Court exercised its discretion to vary from the advisory range based upon \u00a7 3553(a) factors. As the Court explained, it was concerned about the fact that Madison was 57 years old, had a thirty-year criminal record including 10 prior convictions, and had not been at all deterred by the punishments previously imposed. Moreover, the Court explained that it was concerned about the nature and seriousness, as well as the frequency of Madison\u2019s offenses, stressing not only the duration and extent of the fraud, but also the harmful impact on the victims of his use of stolen identification and personal information. In short, it is apparent from the record that what Madison refers to as the \u201cunassociated concerns\u201d giving rise to the appropriate upward variance were precisely the concerns on which \u00a7 3553(a) required the Court to focus. Given that there was ample and reliable evidence to support those concerns, we find the District Court\u2019s variance to be well within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-19\">Madison insists that the failure of the Court to provide advance notice of an intent to impose a sentence above the applicable Guidelines range violated Fed. R. Crim.P. 32. Such notice is not required, however, in advance of discretionary variances based on \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Irizarry v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 2207, 171 L.Ed.2d 28 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584, multiple terms of imprisonment may be imposed either consecutively or concurrently, and the District Court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in making this determination. Similarly the policy statement in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c) provides that a sentence may be imposed concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to an undischarged sentence in order \u201cto achieve a reasonable punishment for the instant offense.\u201d This decision is entrusted to the sound discretion of the District Court. <em>United States v. Lloyd, </em>469 F.3d 319, 321 (3d Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Saintville, </em>218 F.3d 246, 249 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The District Court here made explicit reference to Guidelines \u00a7 5G1.3(c), thus recognizing its discretion to impose a consecutive or a concurrent sentence. While it did not expressly tie its decision on that matter to a separate statement of rationale, it is crystal clear from reading the record that its decision in favor of a consecutive sentence was based on the same \u00a7 3553(a) factors that caused it to sentence above the Guidelines range \u2014 Madison\u2019s criminal history and recidivism, the nature and seriousness of the offense, and the need for deterrence and punishment. Once again, we find no abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-9\">. Madison insists for the first time before us that his state conviction was based on \"relevant conduct\u201d under \u00a7 7B1.3 and should have been ordered to run concurrently under \u00a7 5G1.3(b). However, the record provides no basis for this contention and the presentence report reflects that the state conviction was not treated as a related case or relevant conduct in the calculation of the Guidelines range.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
