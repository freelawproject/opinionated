He completed his prison sentence and began serving his term of supervised release in January 2005, but in December of that year Mr. Hyche was involved in the murder of a rival gang member. After Mr. Hyche pleaded guilty to reckless homicide in state court and was sentenced to 15 years\u2019 imprisonment, his federal probation officer petitioned the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>trict court to revoke his supervised release. Mr. Hyche waived his right to contest the revocation, and in exchange the Government recommended that the term of reimprisonment run concurrently with his state sentence. The court revoked Mr. Hyche\u2019s supervised release and ordered him reimprisoned for 24 months, the statutory maximum. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(a)(2), 3559(a)(3), 3583(e)(3). Declining the Government\u2019s recommendation, however, the court ordered the prison term to run consecutively with his state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Mr. Hyche filed a notice of appeal, but his appointed attorney cannot identify any nonfrivolous argument and has moved to withdraw. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Mr. Hyche has declined our invitation to comment on counsel\u2019s submission, so our review is limited to the one potential issue considered in counsel\u2019s facially adequate brief. <em>See United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Counsel contemplates challenging the term of reimprisonment. We would uphold that term unless it is \u201cplainly unreasonable,\u201d one of the narrowest standards of judicial review available. <em>United States v. Kizeart, </em>505 F.3d 672, 674-75 (7th Cir. 2007). Before imposing a term of reimprisonment, a district court must consider the policy statements in the sentencing guidelines, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. ch. 7, pt. B, and the sentencing factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Neal, </em>512 F.3d 427, 438 (7th Cir.2008). In this case, the court acknowledged that Mr. Hyche\u2019s Grade A violation, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(l), combined with his criminal history category of VI, yielded a guidelines range of 33 to 41 months\u2019 reimprisonment. The court correctly noted, however, that by statute the term was capped at two years. The court then weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the nature of the crime underlying the revocation, Mr. Hyche\u2019s history and characteristics, and the need for the penalty to reflect the seriousness of Mr. Hyche\u2019s new criminal conduct. Finally, although the court commented that the guidelines provision uses \u201cthe imperative shall\u201d in its statement that any term of reimprisonment upon revocation be served consecutively and that this \u201cdictates\u201d a consecutive term, in light of the discussion as a whole, we are confident that the court understood \u2014 as it stated\u2014 that this provision is a recommendation only. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f); <em>United States v. Huusko, </em>275 F.3d 600, 603 (7th Cir.2001). Thus, the court\u2019s consideration of the guidelines and statutory factors was adequate, and we agree with counsel that any challenge to Mr. Hyche\u2019s term of re-imprisonment would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Accordingly, we GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
