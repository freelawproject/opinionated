This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-22\">Sirman\u2019s counsel has filed an <em>Anders </em>brief. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-24\">We have reviewed the record, and we agree with counsel for the government and Sirman that there are no non-frivolous issues presented by this appeal. Specifically, there are no non-frivolous issues with respect to the denial of Sirman\u2019s motion for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or with respect to the reasonableness of his sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-25\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-26\">We are satisfied that Sirman\u2019s counsel has adequately fulfilled the requirements of Rule 109.2, and his motion to withdraw will be granted. The issues presented in this appeal lack legal merit and thus do not require the filing of a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-27\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-28\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-18\">. We have no jurisdiction to review discretionary denials of departure motions in calculating Guidelines sentencing ranges. <em>United States v. Batista, </em>483 F.3d 193, 199 (3d Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>467 F.3d 834, 839 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b700-31\">. The record establishes that the sentence was procedurally reasonable, and the sentence imposed was the result of a nearly 15 month variance below the bottom of the Guidelines range.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
