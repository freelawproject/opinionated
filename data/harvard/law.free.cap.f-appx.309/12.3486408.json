Rossi pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine and received a below-guidelines sentence of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal he argues that he should have received a two-level reduction as a minor participant in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-23\">From approximately June 2003 to July 2006, codefendant Kenneth Rooksberry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>distributed methamphetamine in and around Terre Haute, Indiana. Rossi transported the methamphetamine from an unidentified source in Texas to Rooks-berry in Terre Haute. Rossi made at least eight trips between Texas and Indiana, receiving $1,800 each time. The government asserted that Rossi was responsible for distributing 93.5 kilograms of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">At sentencing the district court agreed that Rossi was responsible for 93.5 kilograms. Based upon that amount the court set a base offense level of 38, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l), and then subtracted two levels under the \u201csafety valve,\u201d <em>see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5C1.2, 2Dl.l(b)(ll), and three levels for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. The court refused to grant a further two-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 as a minor participant, reasoning that the number of times Rossi transported methamphetamine, the distances he traveled, and the amount of methamphetamine involved constituted more than a minor role. Rossi\u2019s total offense level of 33 and criminal history category of I yielded a guidelines imprisonment range of 135 to 168 months. Taking into account the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, the court sentenced Rossi to 120 months, which would have been the statutory minimum if not for the safety valve. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(viii).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">On appeal Rossi makes one argument: that the district court erred when it declined to give him a two-level reduction as a minor participant. This court reviews for clear error a district court\u2019s factual determination as to whether the defendant was a minor participant. <em>See United States v. Lopez, </em>545 F.3d 515, 516 (7th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Olivas-Ramirez, </em>487 F.3d 512, 516 (7th Cir.2007). For the reduction to apply, the defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was substantially less culpable than the average participant in the criminal enterprise. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), cmt. 3(A); <em>Lopez, </em>545 F.3d at 516; <em>United States v. Sorich, </em>523 F.3d 702, 717 (7th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Rossi argues that he played a minor role in the conspiracy when considering the scope of the conspiracy, the amount of methamphetamine involved in the overall conspiracy, the number of people involved, and the length of time the conspiracy existed. He states that his role was \u201cmerely to deliver methamphetamine to Rooksberry in Indiana and transport money to the cooperating individual in Texas.\u201d And to further minimize his involvement, Rossi adds that he transported the methamphetamine and money because he was \u201cdesperate\u201d for money after losing his job and suffering health problems and that he received a flat fee for his services with no additional benefits from the sale of the drugs. Rossi argues that he is less culpable than his codefendants because he did not know the other aspects of the conspiracy and because \u201cthe conspiracy thrived without him before his involvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">None of Rossi\u2019s arguments, however, demonstrate that he was substantially less culpable than his codefendants. Rossi engaged in transportation activities that were key to the success of the enterprise. <em>See Lopez, </em>545 F.3d at 517; <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>457 F.3d 726, 728-30 (7th Cir.2006). We have found defendants ineligible for the minor-participant reduction who played much smaller roles in the conspiracy than Rossi did in this case. <em>See Olivas-Ramirez, </em>487 F.3d at 515-16 (upholding district court\u2019s finding that defendant who only pretended to be methamphetamine cook for two days during the conspiracy was not a minor participant because his role was essential). Rossi traveled long distances, did so many times, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>and transported many kilograms of methamphetamine. Therefore, the district court did not clearly err when it held that Rossi was not a minor participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
