Eaton, Judge, United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b459-19\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b459-21\">Plaintiff-appellant Rita Litvack appeals from a January 31, 2007 order of the District Court dismissing, pursuant to Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), her diversity action against defendant-appellee Myrna Lehrer, alleging that defendant abused her position as a fiduciary of their father\u2019s estate. <em>See Litvack v. Lehrer, </em>No. 06-cv-00767 WWE, 2007 WL 322506 (D.Conn. Jan. 31, 2007). Specifically, the District Court determined that Section 52 of the Connecticut General Statutes, which permits the reinstatement of actions previously dismissed due to \u201caccidental failure,\u201d Conn. GemStat. \u00a7 52-592(a), did not permit the reinstatement of an action that the District Court (Ellen Bree Burns, Judge) dismissed in April 2004 after plaintiff failed to respond timely to defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss in light of their father\u2019s death. <em>See Kaplan v. Lehrer, </em>173 Fed. Appx. 934 (2d Cir.2006) (unpublished) (affirming the District Court\u2019s dismissal). In this appeal, plaintiff contends that (1) her action must be reinstated because her untimely motion to substitute a new plaintiff for her father did not amount to \u201cegregious\u201d neglect, (2) the District Court erred in not holding a hearing to consider the possibility of reinstating her action, and (3) defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was not the proper vehicle to challenge the applicability of section 52-592 in this case. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>the District Court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Staehr v. Hartford Fin. Serv. Group, Inc., </em>547 F.3d 406, 424 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Defendant did not ask for an evidentiary hearing before the District Court prior to moving for reconsideration, and we deem that argument forfeited. <em>See Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of Color Tile, Inc. v. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, LLP, </em>322 F.3d 147, 159 (2d Cir.2003) (\u201cGenerally, we will not consider an argument on appeal that was raised for the first time below in a motion for reconsideration.\u201d) Substantially for the reasons stated by the District Court in its opinion of January 31, 2007, <em>see Litvack, </em>2007 WL 322506 at <footnotemark>*</footnotemark>2-4, we conclude that the Court did not err in granting defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Accordingly, the January 31, 2007 order of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b460-6\"> Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 43(c)(2), Eric H. Holder, Jr. is substituted for Michael B. Mukasey as Respondent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
