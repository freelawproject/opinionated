He argues that the district court erred in determining that his prior state conviction for possession of a controlled substance was an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-15\">Rosales maintains that, for purposes of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a), the record did not sufficiently show that his first state drug-possession conviction was final before he committed the second drug-possession offense. Rosales is incorrect. At sentencing, the Government submitted a copy of a judgment showing that Rosales was convicted in Texas, pursuant to a guilty plea, in January 2002 for possession of a controlled substance (Xanax). There is no indication in the record that Rosales appealed this conviction or that he had received permission to do so. Thus, based on the evidence in the record, Rosales\u2019s January 2002 conviction became final in February 2002. <em>See </em>Tex.R.App. P. 26.2(a); <em>Jones v. State, </em>77 S.W.3d 819, 822-23 (Tex.Crim.App.2002). The charging instrument from Rosales\u2019s June 2005 Texas marijuana-possession conviction indicates that Rosales committed this later offense in March 2005, after his January 2002 conviction had become final.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-16\">Rosales also argues that because his state possession convictions were not subject to a state recidivist enhancement, they should not be considered aggravated felonies for sentencing purposes under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). He acknowledges our holding to the contrary in <em>United States v. Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d 333, 335-36 (5th Cir.2008), but argues that it did not address the notice issues presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-17\">In <em>Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d at 335-36, we held that <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), did not require that this court abandon its holding in <em>United States v. Sanchez-Villa</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number><em>lobos, </em>412 F.3d 572, 577 (5th Cir.2005), that a second conviction for simple possession qualified as an aggravated felony which supported the imposition of the eight-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). Because Rosales has two prior state convictions for possession of a controlled substance and the 2005 marijuana-possession conviction would have been punishable as a felony under \u00a7 844(a) if prosecuted in federal court, the district court did not err in treating Rosales\u2019s 2005 state drug-possession conviction as an aggravated felony for sentencing purposes under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). <em>See Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d at 335-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">We also rejected Cepeda-Rios\u2019s argument that the Government\u2019s failure to comply with the procedural requirements of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(a) prohibited the district court from enhancing his sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) and \u00a7 844(a) based on his first state possession conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 336 n. 11. This court noted that the relevant inquiry was whether the crime was punishable under \u00a7 844(a), rather than whether the Government actually sought to prosecute the defendant under \u00a7 844(a). <em>Id. </em>This court observed further that \u201cCepeda-Rios had the opportunity to object to the finality of his first state possession conviction at his federal sentencing hearing, but he did not do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Likewise, Rosales did not challenge the existence, validity, or finality of his prior drug possession convictions at his federal sentencing hearing or on appeal. Because the Government did not actually seek to prosecute Rosales under the Controlled Substances Act, and was not a party to Rosales\u2019s state court convictions, \u00a7 851(a) notice was not necessary. <em>See id. </em>Further, under <em>Lopez, </em>a federal sentencing court \u201cmust look only to whether [a defendant\u2019s] conviction would be considered as an \u2018aggravated felony* under federal law; whether the crime is classified as a felony or misdemeanor by the state of conviction is irrelevant.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 334. Similarly, the state notice requirements are also irrelevant to the determination of whether the \u00a7 2L1.2 enhancement is warranted. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b936-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
