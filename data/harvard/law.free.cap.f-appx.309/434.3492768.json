Nov. 7, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A97 908 375 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 3, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-15\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that an asylum applicant is not credible and emphasizes particular aspects of the IJ\u2019s decision, we review both the BIA\u2019s and the IJ\u2019s opinions. <em>See Ming Xia Chen v. BIA, </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d cir.2006) (citing <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394-95 (2d Cir.2005)). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-16\">We find that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. Here, the IJ relied on internal inconsistencies in Mendy\u2019s testimony as well as inconsistencies between his testimony and his supporting documentation concerning: (1) when Mendy began his military service, (2) whether he was incarcerated in 2001, (3) when he was arrested in 2003, and (4) when he sought medical treatment after his release from detention in 2003. Contrary to Mendy\u2019s argument, under the REAL ID Act, it was proper for the IJ to rely on these inconsistencies in making his adverse credibility finding, regardless of whether they were \u201cminor.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(in); <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008). We note, however, that these inconsistencies go to the heart of Mendy\u2019s claim because they cast doubt on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>whether he was ever arrested or mistreated.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The IJ also expressed concern about Mendy\u2019s failure to corroborate his claim that an attempted coup occurred in 2003\u2014 the event that allegedly resulted in his arrest. An applicant\u2019s failure to corroborate his testimony may bear on credibility because the absence of corroboration in general makes an applicant unable to rehabilitate testimony that has already been called into question. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.2006). Here, having called Mendy\u2019s credibility into question, the IJ acted well within his discretion in drawing an adverse inference from Mendy\u2019s failure to corroborate a central element of his claim, particularly where it should have been easily verifiable. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Together, this lack of corroboration and the inconsistencies in the record provide substantial evidence in support of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic, </em>519 F.3d at 95. Accordingly, the IJ properly denied Mendy\u2019s application for withholding of removal. Inasmuch as Mendy based his claim for CAT relief on the same factual predicate as his withholding of removal claim, and the IJ properly found that claim lacked credibility, his CAT claim necessarily fails. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
