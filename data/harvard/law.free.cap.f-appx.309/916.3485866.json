She argues that her sentence was unreasonable because, in light of the mitigating factors at issue in her case, the imposed term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>imprisonment was greater than necessary to achieve the objectives set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). As she argued in the district court prior to sentencing, Craft asserts on appeal that she merits leniency because she provided assistance to the authorities immediately upon her arrest and because her assistance led to the arrest of her codefendant/husband. The district court explicitly noted before imposing Craft\u2019s sentence that it had considered Craft\u2019s arguments as to mitigating factors, as well as the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">We consider Craft\u2019s argument as to the substantive reasonableness of her sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Also, because Craft\u2019s sentence was imposed within a properly calculated Guidelines range, it is entitled to a rebut-table presumption of reasonableness. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). After reviewing the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, we hold that Craft\u2019s appellate arguments fail to establish that her sentence was unreasonable. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b942-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
