Section 405(g) seeking reversal and remand of the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s determination that she is not entitled to disability insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act. Salmon claims that, as a result of a car accident, she suffers from mental and physical impairments that prevent her from working. She asserts that the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) failed properly to recognize and credit her mental impairment, improperly weighed the competing medical opinions in the record with regard to her physical impairments, and improperly rejected her pain testimony as not credible. We may set aside the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits when the ALJ\u2019s findings are based on legal error or are not supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>Gillett-Netting v. Barnhart, </em>371 F.3d 593, 595 (9th Cir.2004). We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision upholding the denial of benefits and reverse and remand. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-14\">In rejecting Salmon\u2019s claim of mental impairment, the ALJ failed to weigh the evidence properly. The ALJ rejected the evaluation of examining physician Dr. David H. Silverman, Ph.D. that Salmon suffered a mental impairment, instead adopting the evaluation of examining psychological assistant Jacklyn Chandler, approved by Dr. Laurie Weiss, Ph.D., without offering any specific, legitimate reasons. <em>See Carmickle v. Commissioner, Social Sec. Admin., </em>533 F.3d 1155, 1164 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201cWhere ... [a treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>ing or examining physician\u2019s] opinion is contradicted ... it may be rejected for \u2018specific and legitimate reasons that are supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u2019 \u201d (internal citation omitted)). The only rationale offered by the ALJ for rejecting Dr. Silverman\u2019s diagnosis in favor of Chandler\u2019s testimony is Salmon\u2019s failure to take psychotropic medication or seek therapy with a mental health professional. While a claimant\u2019s failure to seek medical assistance for a condition may provide a basis for a finding that they did not suffer from an impairment, <em>see, e.g. Bruton v. Massanari, </em>268 F.3d 824, 828 (9th Cir.2001), the ALJ should not have drawn such a conclusion here in light of Salmon\u2019s assertion, never rejected as not credible, that she lacked insurance and was unable to afford medical care during the relevant period. <em>See, e.g., Orn v. Astrue, </em>495 F.3d 625, 638 (9th Cir.2007); <em>Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 603 (9th Cir.1989). As a vocational expert provided testimony at Salmon\u2019s hearing indicating that the conditions diagnosed by Dr. Silverman would prevent Salmon from performing her past relevant work, the ALJ\u2019s failure to credit Dr. Silverman requires reversal and remand for redetermination of the ALJ\u2019s finding of no mental disability. <em>See, e.g., Embrey v. Bowen, </em>849 F.2d 418, 424 (9th Cir.1988).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">By contrast, the ALJ did not err in weighing the medical testimony concerning Salmon\u2019s asserted physical impairment. Salmon asserts that the ALJ failed to give proper weight to the opinion of her treating physician, Dr. Ronald Greenwald, M.D., with regard to her alleged physical impairment and its impact on her residual functional capacity. The opinion of a treating physician is entitled to controlling weight unless contradicted by substantial evidence or not well-supported. <em>See Lingenfelter v. Astrue, </em>504 F.3d 1028, 1038 n. 10 (9th Cir.2007); <em>Orn, </em>495 F.3d at 631-32; 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2). The ALJ properly determined that Dr. Greenwald\u2019s evaluation was not well-supported by examination findings and was contradicted by the independent examination findings of Lara A. Salamacha, M.D. Therefore, the ALJ was justified in not fully crediting Dr. Greenwald\u2019s evaluation in favor of Dr. Salamacha\u2019s evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Although the ALJ did not err in rejecting Dr. Greenwald\u2019s evaluation of Salmon\u2019s physical impairments, he did err in rejecting Salmon\u2019s own testimony concerning the severity of her physical pain. The ALJ found that Salmon suffered from at least mild objective findings of impairment that caused some degree of back pain and he found no evidence of malingering. As a result, the ALJ could not reject Salmon\u2019s testimony concerning the severity of her pain merely on the basis that it was not fully corroborated by the objective medical evidence. <em>See, e.g., Bruton, </em>268 F.3d at 828. Instead, the ALJ needed to offer \u201c \u2018specific, clear and convincing reasons\u2019 \u201d for rejecting Salmon\u2019s pain testimony. <em>Vasquez v. Astrue, </em>547 F.3d 1101, 1104-05 (9th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Lingenfelter, </em>504 F.3d at 1035-36).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">None of the reasons offered by the ALJ for rejecting Salmon\u2019s testimony are convincing. The ALJ\u2019s reference to the excellent results from Salmon\u2019s cervical fusion is irrelevant, as those results were limited to her neck and arm, unrelated to the back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>pain attested to by Salmon. The ALJ\u2019s only other offered rationale for not crediting her testimony was Salmon\u2019s failure to seek medical attention. However, as already discussed, Salmon\u2019s failure to seek medical attention was explained by her lack of funds and, in any case, the ALJ found that she took Vicodin for her pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">We reverse and remand for reconsideration of the determination of Salmon\u2019s mental capacity with instructions to accept Salmon\u2019s pain testimony as true. <em>See </em>Vas<em>quez, </em>547 F.3d at 1107. The level of her pain may have a bearing on her depression and overall mental problems and should be considered in that light by the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b140-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-6\">. Salmon also asserts that the ALJ failed properly to take into account the findings by Chandler that Salmon possessed low IQ and memory function, had a depressive affect, and was unable to \"endure\u201d the stress of the interview. However, as these arguments were not raised to the district court, they are waived. <em>Marbled Murrelet v. Babbitt, </em>83 F.3d 1060, 1063-64 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b142-6\">GORSUCH, J., Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AKK\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">I would affirm the district court\u2019s disposition of this case for substantially the same reasons Judge Fogel gave in his extensive and thoughtful opinion. The question before this court is a narrow one. It is not whether the Social Security Administration (SSA) failed to weigh the evidence properly, or whether we would credit the same evidence and reach the same outcome as the SSA did. It is only whether the SSA\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence. Substantial evidence means \u201cmore than a mere scintilla but less than a preponderance \u2014 it is such relevant evidence that reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the conclusion.\u201d <em>Moncada v. Chafer, </em>60 F.3d 521, 523 (9th Cir.1995) (per curiam). I respectfully submit that the district court correctly determined that the SSA\u2019s conclusions were within the bounds of reason, if not the only reasonable result that might be reached on this record.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
