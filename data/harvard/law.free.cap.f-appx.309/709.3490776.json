Quezada\u2019s attorney filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning the reasonableness of Quezada\u2019s sentence. Although advised of his right to do so, Quezada has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">We first conclude Quezada\u2019s sentence was reasonable. As determined by the Supreme Court, \u201c[r]egardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range, the appellate court must review the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Appellate courts are charged with reviewing sentences for reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 594, 597. Reasonableness review requires appellate consideration of both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of a sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">In determining whether a sentence is procedurally reasonable, we first assess whether the district court properly calculated the defendant\u2019s advisory Guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 596-97. We must then consider whether the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2006) factors and any arguments presented by the parties, selected a sentence based on \u201cclearly erroneous facts,\u201d or failed to sufficiently explain the selected sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 597; <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). Finally, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, \u201ctaking into account the \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). We afford sentences that fall within the properly calculated Guidelines range a presumption of reasonableness, <em>see id., </em>as permitted by the Supreme Court. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2459, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-20\">The district court properly calculated Quezada\u2019s sentencing range under the Guidelines <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and invited counsel to make any relevant argument pursuant to the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. After hearing counsel\u2019s arguments, permitting Quezada the opportunity to make a statement, and considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court sentenced Quezada to sixty-five months\u2019 imprisonment, in the middle of the applicable Guidelines range. As our review of the record reveals no procedural or substantive defect in Quezada\u2019s sentence, he cannot overcome the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his sentence. <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2459, 2462.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-21\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entirety of the record and found no meritorious issues. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We require that counsel inform Quezada, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Quezada requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Quezada. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately set forth in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b736-12\"> The district court calculated that Quezada\u2019s total adjusted offense level was twenty-one and that he had seven criminal history points. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\"USSG\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 2L1.2, 4A1.1 (2007). Thus, with a category IV criminal history, Quezada\u2019s advisory Guidelines range was fifty-seven to seventy-one months\u2019 imprisonment. USSG ch. 5, pt. A, sentencing table.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
