Shinseki,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Larry Gardner, and John Doe (collectively \u201cDefendants\u201d) in his Title VII case. Holloway argues that the district court erred in concluding that he failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). For the reasons explained below, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Holloway, an African-American male, is a former employee of the Michael E. De-Bakey Veterans Medical Center in Houston, Texas. Beginning in 1997, while employed as a computer specialist, Holloway filed various EEO complaints alleging racial discrimination and retaliation. On August 21, 2000, the VA terminated Holloway following his failure to complete paperwork necessary to obtain a required security clearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Holloway filed the instant Title VII suit in April 2004, alleging racial discrimination and retaliation relating to his termination, as well as twenty-two other acts of retaliation against him by the VA, including, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cdenying his leave of absence request; requiring him to work on light duty while other employees were not required to work; and subjecting him to harassment and assault by his supervisors.\u201d <em>Holloway v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>244 Fed.Appx. 566, 566-67 (5th Cir. 2007) (per curiam) (unpublished). Of particular relevance to this appeal, Holloway alleged that in 1998, his supervisor, Charles Warner (\u2018Warner\u201d), stated to two of Holloway\u2019s co-workers that Holloway was \u201ccreating problems by filing EEO complaints.\u201d Defendants moved for summary judgment, and the district court granted their motion and dismissed all of Holloway\u2019s claims. Holloway appealed only the dismissal of his \u201cnon-removal, non-termination retaliation claim.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">While Holloway\u2019s appeal was pending, the Supreme Court decided <em>Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006), in which it \u201crejected the approach taken by several circuits, including this one, for determining adverse employment actions in retaliation cases.\u201d <em>Holloway, </em>244 Fed.Appx. at 566-67. Accordingly, we vacated the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and remanded Holloway\u2019s case for consideration in light of <em>Burlington Northern. Id. </em>at 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">Following our remand, Defendants again moved for summary judgment. In response, Holloway abandoned all remaining allegations of retaliation except for that relating to Warner\u2019s 1998 statement that Holloway was \u201ccreating problems by filing EEO complaints.\u201d <em>See Holloway v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>Civil Action No. H-04-1395, 2008 WL 624708, at *1 (S.D.Tex. Mar. 5, 2008). Defendants asserted that Holloway failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation with regal\u2019d to this remaining allegation. Specifically, they argued that Holloway failed to establish the second element of his prima facie case: that Warner\u2019s statement constituted an \u201cadverse employment action.\u201d The district court granted Defendants\u2019 motion on this ground and dismissed the case with prejudice. Holloway timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b843-15\">We have jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s award of summary judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>We review de novo a district court\u2019s award of summary judgment. <em>Nichols v. Enterasys Networks, Inc., </em>495 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.2007). Summary judgment is proper when \u201cthe pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>see Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). \u201cA genuine issue of material fact exists when the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Gates v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Protective &amp; Regulatory Servs., </em>537 F.3d 404, 417 (5th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)). \u201cWhere the non-moving party fails to establish \u2018the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial,\u2019 no genuine issue of material fact can exist.\u201d <em>Nichols, </em>495 F.3d at 188 (quoting <em>Celotex Corp., </em>477 U.S. at 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548). In reviewing the motion, we \u201cmust view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor.\u201d <em>Coury v. Moss, </em>529 F.3d 579, 584 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Holloway contends on appeal that Warner\u2019s 1998 statement to two of Holloway\u2019s co-workers that Holloway was \u201ccreating problems by filing EEO complaints\u201d constitutes a retaliatory statement actionable under Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9n\">[i]t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees ... because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this sub-chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">Claims under Title VII are governed by the three-step test established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>See LeMaire v. La. Dep\u2019t of Transp. &amp; Dev., </em>480 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.2007). Under this test, an employee alleging a retaliation claim bears the initial burden of establishing a prima face case of retaliation. <em>LeMaire, </em>480 F.3d at 388; <em>see McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817. To establish her prima facie case, an employee must demonstrate that \u201c(1) she participated in an activity protected by Title VII; (2) her employer took an adverse employment action against her; and (3) a causal connection exists between the protected activity and the materially adverse action.\u201d <em>Aryain v. Wal-Mart Stores Tex. LP, </em>534 F.3d 473, 484 (5th Cir.2008); <em>accord Turner v. Baylor Richardson Med. Ctr., </em>476 F.3d 337, 348 (5th Cir.2007). Only the second element is at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">The Supreme Court recently clarified the requirements for the second element of an employee\u2019s prima facie case of retaliation. In <em>Burlington Northern, </em>the Court held that \u201ca plaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d 548 U.S. at 68, 126 S.Ct. 2405 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court explained that \u201c[t]he anti-retaliation provision protects an individual not from all retaliation, but from retaliation that produces an injury or harm,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 67, 126 S.Ct. 2405, and noted that it \u201cspeak[s] of <em>material </em>adversity because ... it is important to separate significant from trivial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>harms,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 68,126 S.Ct. 2405. In other words, it explained, \u201cTitle VII ... does not set forth \u2018a general civility code for the American workplace.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., </em>523 U.S. 75, 80, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998)). Notably, the Court cautioned that \u201c[a]n employee\u2019s decision to report discriminatory behavior cannot immunize that employee from those petty slights or minor annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees experience.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Holloway\u2019s sole remaining allegation is that Warner\u2019s statement to two of Holloway\u2019s co-workers that Holloway was \u201ccreating problems by filing EEO complaints\u201d rises to the level of an adverse employment action under the standard enunciated in <em>Burlington </em>Northern,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since <em>Burlington Northern, </em>this court and others have considered various factors that weigh against a finding of \u201cmaterial adversity.\u201d Among these, we have explained that when a supervisor makes a challenged comment not to the plaintiff-employee but to his coworkers, the comment\u2019s hearsay nature \u201cmilitates against a finding of materiality.\u201d <em>Smith v. Harvey, </em>265 Fed.Appx. 197, 201 (5th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (unpublished) (citing <em>Thomas v. iStar Fin., Inc., </em>438 F.Supp.2d 348, 366 (S.D.N.Y.2006)). The fact that the supervisor made the comment on only one occasion and that no adverse consequences followed therefrom further weighs against a finding of material adversity. <em>Id. </em>Although we recognize that this unpublished decision does not bind us, we find it instructive and agree with its reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Moreover, a supervisor\u2019s mention, or even criticism, of an employee\u2019s EEO complaints does not itself constitute such \u201cmaterial adversity\u201d that would \u201cdissuade a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>See Burlington Northern, </em>548 U.S. at 68, 126 S.Ct. 2405. For example, in <em>Jones v. Johanns, </em>264 Fed.Appx. 463 (6th Cir.2007), the Sixth Circuit held that a supervisor\u2019s letter to the plaintiff warning him to stop discussing his EEO complaints during business hours and threatening \u201cofficial disciplinary action\u201d if he failed to stop did not, \u201cas a matter of law, constitute materially adverse actions,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 469. Indeed, courts have even held that a supervisor\u2019s statements to a plaintiffs co-workers that he would \u201cget rid of\u2019 the plaintiff because he was \u201ccreating problems,\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>438 F.Supp.2d at 366, and \u201c[bjadmouthing or being mean to an employee within the workplace,\u201d <em>Roldan v. Chertoff, </em>No. 04CV2515, 2006 WL 4632503, at *12 (S.D.Cal. Oct. 19, 2006), are not materially adverse actions capable of sustaining a retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">In the instant case, Warner made only one reference to Holloway\u2019s EEO complaints, and he directed the comment not to Holloway, but to two of Holloway\u2019s coworkers. Warner did not threaten disciplinary action, did not evince hostility toward Holloway, and did not suggest that Holloway drop his complaints or refrain from filing further complaints. Contrary to Holloway\u2019s assertion, Warner\u2019s statement is entirely distinguishable from those at issue in <em>Fallon v. Potter, </em>277 Fed.Appx. 422 (5th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (unpublished), in which the plaintiffs supervisor directly threatened disciplinary action if the plaintiff did not withdraw his EEO complaint, <em>id. </em>at 428. The statements challenged in <em>Fallon </em>\u2014 \u2018You just keep filing those EEO complaints and I promise you one thing \u2014 there won\u2019t be a person in this post office to testify against me\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>\u201cYou need to call her [an EEOC officer] and talk to her so you can drop this EEO\u201d; \u201cYou need to tell her you don\u2019t need redress ... cause you\u2019re canceling the EEO complaint\u201d; and \u201cYou\u2019ll never have anyone in this post office stand up for you. If you continue to file these charges, I\u2019ll show you what you\u2019re up against,\u201d <em>id. </em>(alteration and omission in original) \u2014 bear no resemblance to Warner\u2019s comment here. Warner\u2019s single, non-threatening statement did not \u201ccreate[ ] a situation so unbearable or bleak that a reasonable employee would have been dissuaded from complaining about discrimination.\u201d <em>See Higgins v. Gonzales, </em>481 F.3d 578, 590 (8th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Accordingly, the district court correctly found that Warner\u2019s statement was insufficient to constitute a \u201cmaterially adverse\u201d employment action and that, therefore, Holloway failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s award of summary judgment to Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b842-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
