We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-23\">On April 25, 2007, an undercover police officer with the Harrisburg Bureau of Police made a controlled purchase of 1.1 grams of crack cocaine from Doe. On June 7, 2007, other officers pursued and detained Doe after he fled from them while carrying a bag containing 51.9 grams of crack cocaine. On June 29, 2007, an undercover police officer again made a controlled purchase from Doe of 1.1 grams of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-24\">Based on this evidence, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Doe with possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1). He pled guilty to the charge pursuant to a plea agreement. Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>cause he had 17 prior arrests and three prior convictions for drug offenses, the District Court designated Doe a career offender with a total offense level of 29 and a criminal history category of VI. This designation correlated with a Sentencing Guidelines range of 151-188 months. The Court, after considering evidence related to Doe\u2019s background and criminal history, imposed a sentence of 151 months. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). We review the District Court\u2019s sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Wise, </em>515 F.3d 207, 217-18 (3d Cir.2008). In this regard, \u201cour role is two-fold.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217. First, we must ensure that the Court \u201ccommitted no significant procedural error.\u201d <em>United States v. Sevilla, </em>541 F.3d 226, 230 (3d Cir.2008). This requires us to consider, among other things, whether the Court gave meaningful consideration to the relevant factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 230-32; <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 329 (3d Cir.2006). Second, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See Wise, </em>515 F.3d at 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">Reflecting the two-fold nature of our review, Doe argues that the District Court (1) committed procedural error by failing meaningfully to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and (2) entered a sentence that was substantively unreasonable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-14\">To satisfy the requirement that it meaningfully consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, a district court \u201cneed not discuss every argument made by a litigant,\u201d nor \u201cdiscuss and make findings as to each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,\u201d as only the relevant factors matter. <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 329. It must, however, provide more than \u201ca rote statement\u201d of the factors if the defendant or the prosecution properly raises a ground of recognized legal merit at sentencing. <em>Id. </em>Here, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-15\">Well, I\u2019m hearing about [Doe\u2019s] background and troubles that he\u2019s had in his family throughout his life. That\u2019s certainly very appealing. I also agreed with [the prosecutor]. When I looked at the record here, ... [Doe] had all kinds of opportunity to change his thinking, to change his outlook, and I noticed that even when he served the three to six year sentence ... his parole was revoked I believe on two occasions, so that he has not performed well at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-16\">.... I think that the guideline range is a reasonable one given the background <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>... in the presentence report. We\u2019re dealing here with a serious offense. The defendant\u2019s history has been mentioned here and was very poor. I think there\u2019s a need for deterrence and a need to promote respect for the law and provide a just punishment, so that I think the guideline is a reasonable one and I will not vary from it at this point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">App. at 49. The Court also noted that Doe was \u201cvery much in need of drug treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53. These remarks evidence sufficient consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and adequately establish that the Court did not commit procedural error in imposing Doe\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">With regard to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, the pertinent inquiry is \u201cwhether the final sentence, wherever it may lie within the permissible statutory range, was premised upon appropriate and judicious consideration of the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Schweitzer, </em>454 F.3d 197, 204 (3d Cir.2006). Considering Doe\u2019s recidivist tendencies, periods of failed parole, and multiple missed opportunities for reform, we conclude that the Court did not abuse its discretion by imposing the lowest sentence within the recommended range. Doe does have a troubled personal background, but his proclivity to engage in serious criminal conduct justifies the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">TV.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b597-14\">. As this case remains under seal, the identity of the appellant has been withheld.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b598-6\">.
