We conclude that plaintiff cannot circumvent the law of the case established in <em>Gilley v. Monsanto Co., Inc., </em>490 F.3d 848 (11th Cir.2007). Therefore, plaintiffs claims in Count I and V are foreclosed. With respect to his claim based upon new evidence, we conclude that the evidence is not new, and that plaintiff had ample opportunity to present that evidence in the hearing before the district court prior to the first appeal. Nor is there any other meritorious exception to the law of the case. With respect to plaintiffs claims in Counts II, III and IV, plaintiffs initial brief on appeal failed to preserve the claims, and in any event the claims are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
