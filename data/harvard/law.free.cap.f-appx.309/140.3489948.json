We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004), and review de novo due process claims, <em>Vasquez-Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 1105, 1107 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen as untimely because it was filed more than 22 months after the BIA\u2019s June 16, 2003 orders dismissing Petitioners\u2019 appeal, and Petitioners failed to demonstrate changed circumstances in Indonesia. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), (c)(3)(h); <em>see also Malty, </em>381 F.3d at 945 (\u201cThe critical question is ... whether circumstances have changed sufficiently that a petitioner who previously did not have a legitimate claim for asylum now has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">Petitioners\u2019 contention that the BIA violated due process because it did not allow them to present evidence at a hearing fails. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (motion to reopen must state new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted); <em>see also Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring error for a due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b167-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
