Kanne, Circuit Judge, DIANE P. WOOD, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b27-21\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b27-22\">In the belief that Amendment 706 to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines entitles him to a lower sentence, Kenneth Dowthard filed a motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) on May 8, 2008, seeking a reduction in his sentence. In 2006, Dowthard had been convicted following a guilty plea of possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute it and of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). When the time came for sentencing, the parties agreed that Dowthard was a career offender as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and thus that his offense level was 32 prior to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility and his criminal history was VI. The district court calculated an advisory sentencing range of 151 to 188 months and imposed a sentence of 156 months. Dowthard appealed on various grounds, but this court affirmed his conviction and sentence. See <em>United States v. Dowthard, </em>500 F.3d 567 (7th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>On November 1, 2007, Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines became effective. In general, it reduced the base offense level applicable to crack cocaine offenders. Later, on December 11, 2007, the Sentencing Commission added Amendment 706 to the list of amendments in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) that may be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">This is what prompted Dowthard\u2019s motion, but, as we held recently in <em>United States v. Forman, </em>553 F.3d 585 (7th Cir. 2009), the benefits of Amendment 706 are not available to people in Dowthard\u2019s position. The following passage explaining why Gregory Forman\u2019s motion under \u00a7 3583(c)(2) was properly rejected applies with equal force to Dowthard\u2019s situation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-5\">Forman challenges the denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and the denial of his motion to (again) appoint counsel. He cannot prevail in his pursuit of a lesser sentence because Amendment 706 provides no benefit to career offenders. See <em>United States v. Liddell, </em>543 F.3d 877, 882 n. 3 (7th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Sharkey, </em>543 F.3d 1236, 1239 (10th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>524 F.3d 889, 890 (8th Cir.2008); see also <em>Harris, </em>536 F.3d at 813 (\u201c[A] sentence entered under the career offender guideline, \u00a7 4B1.1, raises no <em>Kimbrough </em>problem because to the extent it treats crack cocaine differently from powder cocaine, the disparity arises from a statute, not from the advisory guidelines.\u201d). For-man\u2019s guidelines range was 262 to 327 months before Amendment 706, and it remains so. Here, \u201cthe amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline\u201d \u2014 namely the career-offender provision. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(A).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-8\"><em>Forman, </em>2009 WL 140502 at *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">Dowthard\u2019s guidelines range, like For-man\u2019s, resulted from the application of the career offender guideline, not the drug guidelines. Amendment 706 had nothing to say about career offenders, and so the district court properly denied Dowthard\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
