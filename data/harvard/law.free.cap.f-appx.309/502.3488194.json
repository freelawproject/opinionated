Chew, J.) (\u201cU\u201d), denying Khokhar\u2019s application for cancellation of removal. <em>In re Razaq Khokhar, </em>A 72 779 095 (B.I.A. May 1, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>A72 779 095 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City May 1, 2006). The question presented by this appeal is whether the BIA erred in concluding that Khokhar failed to establish that his daughter would face \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d following his deportation. <em>See </em>8 U. S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(D). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-24\">\u201cThis Court has held that the determination of whether exceptional and extremely unusual hardship is present for the purposes of cancellation of removal is committed to the discretion of the Attorney General, and that, accordingly, we have no jurisdiction to review such a determination. We are bound by past decisions of this Court.\u201d <em>Mendez v. Mukasey, </em>525 F.3d 216, 221 (2d Cir.2008) (citing <em>BarcoSandoval v. Gonzales, </em>516 F.3d 35, 38-39 (2d Cir.2008)). However, we are not without jurisdiction to consider \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-25\">Khokhar argues that the agency erred, as a matter of law, for two reasons. First, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>he argues that the IJ failed to consider all of the relevant factors or to evaluate those factors in the aggregate. But where, as here, the BIA does not adopt the decision of the IJ to any extent, this Court reviews only the decision of the BIA. <em>See Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). Second, Khokhar argues that the BIA engaged in impermissible fact finding. We conclude that the BIA\u2019s decision reflects that it emphasized certain aspects of Khokhar\u2019s evidence that were not discussed in the IJ\u2019s decision, not that it made any impermissible findings of fact. Such considerations are properly within the scope of the BIA\u2019s de novo review of a discretionary determination of the IJ. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(ii) (\u201cThe Board may review questions of law, discretion, and judgment ... de novo.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">We therefore DENY the petition for review. The previously granted stay of deportation is VACATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
