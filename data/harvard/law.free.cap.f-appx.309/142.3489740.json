We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>Lolong v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 1173, 1178 (9th Cir. 2007) (en banc), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-28\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of asylum because Padmasana has not provided sufficient evidence that he has been, or is likely to be, specifically targeted for persecution, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>his general fear of harassment, discrimination, and sporadic violence is insufficient to render him eligible for asylum. <em>See id. </em>at 1181. Substantial evidence further supports the agency\u2019s well-founded fear finding because Padmasana\u2019s two adult children remain in Indonesia unharmed. <em>See Aruta, v. INS, </em>80 F.3d 1389, 1395 (9th Cir.1996). Thus, Padmasana failed to establish eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Because Padmasana failed to demonstrate eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Padmasana failed to show it was more likely than not that he would be tortured in Indonesia. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1113 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b169-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
