This appeal raises two issues: (1) whether we have jurisdiction to hear Matehuala\u2019s constitutional and legal claim, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); and (2) whether Matehuala\u2019s right to equal protection was violated when he was denied eligibility for waiver under former \u00a7 212(c) because he is removable, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227, on grounds that have no analogue in the INA\u2019s inadmissability grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-19\">The REAL ID Act amended 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 to preclude judicial review of the removal orders of aliens who have been convicted of an aggravated felony offense. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). However, we retain jurisdiction to review \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). We have addressed equal protection challenges to \u00a7 212 applying the REAL ID Act. <em>See Camacho-Salinas v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>460 F.3d 1343 (11th Cir. 2006) (per curiam) (involving a \u00a7 212(h) waiver).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-20\">Accordingly, our jurisdiction to consider Matehuala\u2019s equal protection claim is not in doubt. Moreover, our jurisdiction over Matehuala\u2019s legal claim is not barred by INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(ii) because Matehuala\u2019s eligibility for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver is a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-21\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-22\">We review the BIA\u2019s determinations on questions of law <em>de novo, </em>with appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>deference to the BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretations of the INA. <em>Farquharson v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2001). <em>See also Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Additionally, \u201cwe review constitutional challenges <em>de novo.\u201d Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Matehuala argues that he is eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief because the offense rendering him removable, battery, qualifies as a crime of moral turpitude. Matehuala acknowledges that, as a lawful permanent resident of the United States, he was charged with removability on the basis of committing an aggravated felony crime of violence. However, he maintains that if he had been charged upon attempted reentry into the United States, he would have been charged with inadmissibility on the basis of having committed a crime of moral turpitude, and immigration officials would have discretion to readmit him. Matehuala specifically challenges that the test for comparability established by <em>In re Matter of Blake, </em>23 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 722, 728 (BIA2005), and contends that application of the Blake test violates his constitutional right to equal protection because it treats similarly situated people differently and fails to consider whether the facts create a crime-of-moral-turpitude ground of inadmissibility in addition to the charged ground of removability.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">A. Eligibility for INA \u00a7 212(c) Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Former INA \u00a7 212(c), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c), provided that an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeds abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation, and who is returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years, may be admitted to the United States at the discretion of the Attorney General without regard to certain specified grounds of exclusion enumerated in INA \u00a7 212(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (repealed 1996). The availability of \u00a7 212(c) relief was later extended to lawful permanent residents who never left the United States but who were subject to deportation on grounds analogous to the grounds of exclusion specified in INA \u00a7 212(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a). <em>See Rodriguez-Padron v. I.N.S., </em>13 F.3d 1455, 1460-61 (11th Cir.1994). While \u00a7 212(c) was repealed in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-208 \u00a7 304(b), 110 Stat. 3009-597 (1996), relief under \u00a7 212(c) remains available, pursuant to <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 2293, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), for aliens who have been found removable pursuant to guilty pleas entered prior to \u00a7 212(c)\u2019s repeal, and \u201cwho, notwithstanding those convictions would have been eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">The Third Circuit provides an instructive analysis of the relevant framework of deportation law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\">Section 237 of the INA, entitled \u201cDeportable Aliens,\u201d lists the grounds upon which the Attorney General may order an alien removed. It is in this context that courts look to an alien\u2019s <em>underlying criminal conviction </em>to determine whether it falls within one of \u00a7 237\u2019s statutory grounds for removal....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-10\">The statutory counterpart requirement under \u00a7 212(c), on the other hand, presents an entirely different question. In an application for \u00a7 212(c) <em>relief ..., </em>the alien\u2019s removability has already been established \u2014 i.e., it has already been determined that the underlying crime for which he has been convicted falls within one of INA \u00a7 237\u2019s grounds for removal. The relevant statutory counterpart in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>quiry then looks not to the underlying criminal conviction \u2014 but rather to the <em>statutory ground for removal contained in INA \u00a7 237 </em>and whether it has a counterpart in the <em>statutory ground for exclusion provisions of INA \u00a7 212(a). </em>Under this categorical analysis, [a comparison of] the removal and exclusion provisions of the INA [is undertaken] to determine whether they are substantially equivalent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-5\"><em>Caroleo v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 158, 164 (3d Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The BIA has adopted the statutory counterpart analysis. In <em>In re Matter of Brieva-Perez, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 766, 773 (BIA 2005), the BIA denied eligibility for waiver under former \u00a7 212(c) upon concluding that an aggravated felony-crime-of-violence ground for removal under INA \u00a7 237 is not substantially equivalent to INA \u00a7 212(a)\u2019s crime-involving-moral-turpitude ground for exclusion. The BIA concluded that the two cannot be considered statutory counterparts. <em>Id. </em>In reaching this conclusion, the BIA relied on its decision in <em>Blake, </em>in which it held that the sexual-abuse-of-a-minor aggravated-felony ground for removal, INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(A), is not a statutory counterpart of INA \u00a7 212(a)\u2019s crime-involving-moral-turpitude ground for exclusion. <em>Blake, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 729. The <em>Blake </em>court noted that, although some crimes constituting sexual abuse of a minor may well constitute moral turpitude, the mere overlap between crimes of violence, such as sexual abuse, and some crimes involving moral turpitude is insufficient to render the two statutory counterparts. <em>Id. </em>at 728. Rather, the BIA required a close textual link between a ground of deportation or removal and the provisions for exclusion or inadmissibility. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">We have followed the BIA\u2019s statutory counterpart analysis and focused the \u00a7 212(c) inquiry on whether the statutory ground for removal has a statutory counterpart ground for exclusion in \u00a7 212(a). In <em>Rodriguez-Padron, </em>petitioners, classified as deportable after having been convicted of firearms offenses, were denied relief under \u00a7 212(c) because they were deportable on a ground for which there was no statutory analogue for exclusion in \u00a7 212. <em>Rodriguez-Padron, </em>13 F.3d at 1456-57. We declined to extend \u00a7 212(c) relief to all aliens facing deportation, unless the ground was one specifically excluded in \u00a7 212(c). <em>Id. </em>at 1460. In doing so, we reasoned that the denial 212(c) relief to aliens removable on a ground with no analogue for exclusion in \u00a7 212(a) had a rational basis and thus, was not a violation of equal protection, and there was no indication of congressional intent to extend the availability of \u00a7 212(c) relief beyond the statutory language of \u00a7 212(c). <em>Id. </em>at 1459-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">Here, Matehuala was convicted of an aggravated felony crime of violence that has no statutory counterpart in \u00a7 212(a). Thus, he is ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief, and his petition of review as to this issue is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">B. Equal Protection</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">We have rejected the argument that the distinction between a deportable and an excludable aliens\u2019 ability to obtain \u00a7 212(c) relief violates equal protection guarantees. <em>Chuang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>382 F.3d 1299, 1304 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam). Even if deportable and excludable aliens could be considered similarly situated, there is a rational basis for distinguishing between the two.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">A rational and indeed sensible reason can readily be assigned to Congress\u2019s more lenient treatment of excludable as distinct from deportable aliens: it creates an incentive for deportable aliens to leave the country-which is after all the goal of deportation-without their having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>to be ordered to leave at the government\u2019s expense. To induce their voluntary departure, a little carrot is dangled before them, consisting of the opportunity to seek a waiver should they seek to return to the country and by doing so trigger exclusion proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1303-04 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Because there is a rational basis behind the different treatment of excludable and deportable aliens, we reject Matehuala\u2019s equal protection challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">We defer to the BIA\u2019s statutory counterpart analysis and find that denial of \u00a7 212(c) relief does not violate equal protection where an applicant is deportable on grounds that have no comparable statutory grounds for inadmissibilty. Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, the petitioner\u2019s petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
