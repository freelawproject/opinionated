Jankun denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Ru Huang Lin, </em>No. A 95 468 090 (B.I.A. Dec. 18, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 95 468 090 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 3, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-24\">When the BIA issues an opinion affirming the IJ\u2019s decision in part and modifying it in part, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA, confining our review to the rationale of the IJ on which the BIA relied. <em>See Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 125 (2d Cir.2007). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Dong Gao, </em>482 F.3d at 126. Here, because the BIA assumed Lin\u2019s credibility for the purposes of its analysis, we do the same. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271-72 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-25\">Assuming Lin\u2019s credibility, the BIA found that his \u201csparse account\u201d of his past experiences did not demonstrate persecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>tion. In support of its conclusion, the agency cited <em>Ai Feng Yuan v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 192, 198 (2d Cir.2005), which stands for the proposition that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive.\u201d However, we have also made clear that the BIA must be \u201ckeenly sensitive\u201d to the fact that a \u201cminor beating, or for that matter, any physical degradation designed to cause pain, humiliation, or other suffering, may rise to the level of persecution if it occurred in the context of an arrest or detention on the basis of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Beskovic v. Gonzales, </em>467 F.3d 223, 226 (2d Cir.2006). Here, taking his testimony as true, Lin was abused during an interrogation while detained for a week because of his involvement in an underground church in China. As in <em>Beskovic, </em>we are unable to discern what standard the BIA employed in concluding that this was not persecution. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Nevertheless, even assuming that the agency\u2019s past persecution finding was erroneous, and that the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution should have arisen, the BIA properly found that Lin failed to demonstrate an objectively reasonable fear of persecution upon returning to China. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b). As the agency observed: (1) after Lin fled China, his mother-who was also involved in the same underground church as Lin-remained there, and was not mistreated; and (2) after an initial departure from China, Lin re-entered the country using his own passport. While Lin offered explanations as to why, in light of these facts, his fear was objectively reasonable, the IJ properly considered and rejected them. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005). Thus, the agency properly found that Lin\u2019s fear of future persecution was not objectively reasonable. <em>See Melgar de Torres v. Reno, </em>191 F.3d 307, 313 (2d Cir.1999); <em>See Wensheng Yan v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 63, 68 n. 2. (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Despite any error in the agency\u2019s past persecution analysis, we can confidently predict that the agency\u2019s conclusion would not change on remand. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 335 (2d Cir.2006). Accordingly, the agency reasonably denied Lin\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, where all three claims were based upon the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Kyaw Zwar Tun v. INS, </em>445 F.3d 554, 567 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that torture is \u201csomething more severe than the kind of treatment that would suffice to prove persecution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
