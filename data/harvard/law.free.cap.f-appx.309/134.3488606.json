Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence. <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004). We dismiss in part, and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review the determination that Kuang\u2019s application for asylum was untimely because Kuang\u2019s arrival date is an issue of disputed fact. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>see also Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 657 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that even if Kuang\u2019s testimony is credible, the harm she experienced in China did not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See Gu v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1014, 1019-21 (9th Cir.2006). Furthermore, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Kuang failed to establish that it is more likely than not that she will be subject to persecution if she returns to China. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1185 (9th Cir.2003). We therefore deny the petition with respect to Kuang\u2019s withholding of removal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">We lack jurisdiction over Kuang\u2019s CAT claim because that issue was not exhausted before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b160-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
