(\u201cO\u2019Dwyer\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s grant of Rule 12(c) judgment on the pleadings in favor of Defendant-Appel- \u2022 lee Board of Commissioners of the Port of New Orleans (\u201cthe Port\u201d). O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s appeal is without merit because it attempts to argue (1) an issue that was not raised or ruled upon below; and (2) an issue that relates to an alternative ground not essential to the district court\u2019s decision. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-15\">On August 17, 2006, O\u2019Dwyer filed a class action lawsuit in the Eastern District of Louisiana seeking to recover damages for the levee breaches and flooding caused by Hurricane Katrina; the Port was among the many defendants named in this suit. O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s suit was consolidated within the <em>In re: Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation </em>umbrella, and the claims at issue here were assigned to the \u201cLevee\u201d category.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-16\">On March 1, 2007, the district court issued Case Management Order No. 4 pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16. This pre-trial order directed all class-action plaintiffs in the Levee category (\u201cLevee Plaintiffs\u201d) to file a single Master Consolidated Class Action Complaint (\u201cMaster Complaint\u201d). The order specifically stated that the Master Complaint \u201cshall supersede and replace all previously filed class action complaints.\u201d The Levee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>Plaintiffs complied with the order and filed a Master Complaint, which alleged that the Port held full responsibility and duty for the design, construction, and maintenance of certain levees in New Orleans and that the Port was therefore liable for any flood damage attributable to the failure of those levees.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">O\u2019Dwyer filed a \u201cNotice of Objection\u201d to the Master Complaint, asserting that the district court did not have the authority to supersede O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s pleadings and objecting to the Master Complaint\u2019s use of the word \u201csuperseding.\u201d O\u2019Dwyer offered no reasoning or authority in support of this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">The Port filed an answer to the Master Complaint on March 30, 2007, and subsequently moved for judgment on the pleadings, seeking to dismiss all the Master Complaint\u2019s claims against the Port for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. No party opposed the Port\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">On October 12, 2007, 2007 WL 3003001, the district court issued an order and reasons granting the Port\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings. The district court noted that the motion was unopposed and granted the motion on the ground that the Port had no duties or responsibilities under Louisiana law with respect to levee maintenance or flood control; rather, the court held that La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 38:307 vested such duties and responsibilities exclusively in another state agency, the Orleans Levee District. No party filed a motion for reconsideration or a new trial in response to the district court\u2019s grant of the Port\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, and on November 7, 2007, the Port filed a motion for entry of final judgment under Rule 54(b). Again, no party opposed the motion. Thus, on January 15, 2008, for the reasons stated in its order and reasons dated October 12, 2007, the district court entered judgment dismissing with prejudice the claims by O\u2019Dwyer and others against the Port. O\u2019Dwyer timely appealed, and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">O\u2019Dwyer argues that the district court erred in granting judgment on the pleadings because it failed to consider the arguments presented in O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s individual complaint but not presented in the Master Complaint. However, this argument lacks merit because the Master Complaint, filed pursuant to the district court\u2019s Rule 16 pre-trial order, superseded O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s individual complaint. It is well settled that \u201c[o]nce the pretrial order is entered, it controls the course and scope of the proceedings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16(e), and if a claim or issue is omitted from the order, it is waived, even if it appeared in the complaint.\u201d <em>Elvis Presley Enters., Inc. v. Capece, </em>141 F.3d 188, 206 (5th Cir.1998) (citing <em>Valley Ranch Dev. Co. v. FDIC, </em>960 F.2d 550, 554 (5th Cir.1992); <em>Flannery v. Carroll, </em>676 F.2d 126, 129-30 (5th Cir.1982)); <em>see also Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp. v. United States, </em>549 U.S. 457, 474, 127 S.Ct. 1397, 167 L.Ed.2d 190 (2007) (\u201cHere, we have not only an amended complaint, but a final pretrial order that superseded all pri- or pleadings and \u2018controlled] the subsequent course of the action\u2019 \u201d) (citing Fed. R.Civ.P. 16(e); <em>Wilson v. Muckala, </em>303 F.3d 1207, 1215 (10th Cir.2002) (\u201c[C]laims, issues, defenses, or theories of damages not included in the pretrial order are waived even if they appeared in the complaint. ...\u201d)). Here, the district court entered a Rule 16 pre-trial order stating that the Master Complaint \u201cshall supersede and replace all previously filed class action complaints.\u201d Thus, O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s individual complaint was superseded, and, contrary to O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s assertions, any arguments or claims that appear in O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s individual complaint but not in the Master Complaint were waived and cannot be considered on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Am. Rice, Inc. v. Producers Rice Mill, Inc., </em>518 F.3d 321, 335 (5th Cir.2008) (\u201cIf a claim or issue is omitted from the [pretrial] order, it is waived .... \u201d (alteration in original)); <em>Arsement v. Spinnaker Exploration Co., LLC, </em>400 F.3d 238, 245 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201cIt goes without saying that a pre-trial order controls the scope and course of trial; a claim or issue not included in the order is waived....\u201d); <em>Elvis Presley Enters., </em>141 F.3d at 206.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">We decline to address O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s argument that the district court erred in alternatively basing its decision upon La. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 9:2800(H). As an independent ground for granting the Port\u2019s motion, the district court relied on La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 38:307, which gives the Orleans Levee District, not the Port, \u201cfull and exclusive right, jurisdiction, power, and authority to locate, relocate, construct, maintain, extend, and improve levees, embankments, seawalls, jetties, breakwaters, water-basins, and other works in relation to such projects.\u201d La.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 38:307 (emphasis added). Based on \u00a7 38:307, the district court concluded that the Levee Plaintiffs could prove no set of facts showing, as the Master Complaint alleged, that the Port was responsible and hable for the design, construction, maintenance, or failure of <em>the </em>levees and floodgates. We agree, and we hold that because the district court properly granted the Port\u2019s motion under \u00a7 38:307, any error in its alternative reliance on \u00a7 9:2800(H) would be harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">Finally, O\u2019Dwyer argues that the district court and the attorneys primarily responsible for producing the Master Complaint were improperly motivated by conflicts of interest and personal bias. However, these issues are not properly presented in this appeal because O\u2019Dwyer did not include them in her notice of appeal. <em>Cf. In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., </em>\u2014 Fed.Appx. -, 2008 WL 5069808 at *1 (5th Cir.2008) (unpublished per curiam) (\u201cO\u2019Dwyer has filed, and the district court denied, two motions to recuse the district judge. Neither of the motions to recuse is part of this appeal. ... We will not address issues that are not relevant to this appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-12\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b863-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-6\">. Even if we were to consider the allegations in O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s individual complaint, we would still find that the district court properly granted judgment on the pleadings because the allegations in O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s individual complaint do not differ materially from those in the Master Complaint, which, as discussed <em>infra, </em>were properly dismissed in light of La.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 38:307.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b865-7\">. Alternatively, O\u2019Dwyer contends that the district court should have allowed amendment of O\u2019Dwyer\u2019s individual complaint before granting the Port\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings. However, this argument again fails to understand that the Master Complaint, rather than O\u2019Dwyer's individual complaint, was the relevant document for the district court to consider in evaluating whether judgment on the pleadings was proper. To the extent that O'Dwyer argues that the district court erred in not permitting amendment to the Master Complaint, such an argument is waived because neither O\u2019Dwyer nor any other plaintiff filed before the district court a motion to amend the Master Complaint or a motion for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s judgment on the pleadings. <em>See Nichols v. Enterasys Networks, Inc., </em>495 F.3d 185, 189 (5th Cir.2007) (\"As the issue has not been clearly raised in front of the district court, it cannot be considered on appeal.\u201d); <em>FDIC v. Mijalis, </em>15 F.3d 1314, 1327 (5th Cir.1994) (\u201d[I]f a litigant desires to preserve an argument for appeal, the litigant must press and not merely intimate the argument during the proceedings before the district court. If an argument is not raised to such a degree that the district court has an opportunity to rule on it, we will not address it on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
