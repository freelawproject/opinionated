Nov. 30, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-17\">In this case, we need not consider the merits of Chen\u2019s arguments because he waives any challenge to the BIA\u2019s dispositive determinations that: (1) he failed to rebut the underlying adverse credibility finding related to his family planning claim; and (2) he failed to demonstrate changed country conditions related to his illegal departure claim sufficient to excuse the untimeliness of his motion to reopen. Issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal in the absence of manifest injustice. <em>Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005); <em>LNC Invs., Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank, N.J., </em>308 F.3d 169, 176 n. 8 (2d Cir.2002) (\u201cWhile we no doubt have the power to address an argument despite its abandonment on appeal, we ordinarily will not do so \u2018unless manifest injustice otherwise would result.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Anderson v. Branen, </em>27 F.3d 29, 30 (2d Cir.1994))). Because Chen fails to challenge these dispositive findings, we deem any such arguments waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang, </em>426 F.3d at 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-18\">Moreover, our decision to decline consideration of such waived arguments will not result in a manifest injustice. <em>See LNC Invs., Inc., </em>308 F.3d at 176 n. 8. Indeed, the BIA does not abuse its discretion by denying a motion to reopen or rejecting the authenticity of an alien\u2019s documentary evidence submitted in support of such a motion where the alien does not rebut an IJ\u2019s underlying adverse credibility finding. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 234 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam) (finding that the BIA does not abuse its discretion in denying a motion to reopen where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>evidence submitted with that motion relates to the same claim the agency found not credible in the underlying proceeding); <em>see also Qin Wen Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 143, 147 (2d Cir.2007) (relying on the doctrine <em>falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus </em>to conclude that the agency may decline to credit documentary evidence submitted with a motion to reopen by an alien who was found not credible in the underlying proceeding) (citing <em>Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 170 (2d Cir.2007)). As to Chen\u2019s illegal departure claim, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that he failed to demonstrate changed country conditions excusing the untimeliness of his motion to reopen,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii), where the only evidence he submitted relating to this claim was a 1999 indictment of individuals accused of attempting to illegally depart China. This document alone does not indicate that country conditions related to the treatment of individuals who illegally depart China has materially changed since Chen\u2019s 1997 hearing before the IJ. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Accordingly, because no manifest injustice would result if we decline to review the BIA\u2019s finding that Chen failed to dispute the underlying adverse credibility determination and the BIA\u2019s determination that he failed to establish a change in conditions in China related to his illegal departure, we deem any such challenges waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang, </em>426 F.3d at 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7. Thus, these findings stand as a valid basis for the agency\u2019s denial of Chen\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b466-5\">. There is no dispute that Chen's August 2007 motion to reopen was untimely where the BIA entered a final administrative order dismissing his appeal in April 2002. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (requiring an alien seeking to reopen proceedings to file a motion to reopen no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
