Paladino, </em>401 F.3d 471 (7th Cir.2005). <em>See </em>481 F.3d 475. Upon the district court\u2019s request, the parties submitted briefs regarding resentencing and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). On August 26, 2008, the district court issued an order concluding that had it known it had the discretion to impose a sentence other than the Guidelines sentence for Armstead, it nevertheless would have imposed the same sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-22\">Armstead argues now that the district failed to consider his arguments in favor of a lower sentence. In particular, he points out that the district court\u2019s order makes no mention of his argument that his background (what he refers to as his \u201ccultural assimilation\u201d argument) entitled him to a lower sentence. It is true that the district court did not provide much of an explanation for its ruling. But we have held that \u201con a limited <em>Paladino </em>remand, a judge need not employ a full-fledged methodology for measuring the reasonableness of the Guidelines sentence against \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number><em>United States v. Johnson, </em>534 F.3d 690, 695 (7th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Spano, </em>447 F.3d 517, 519 (7th Cir.2006). The record demonstrates that Armstead had an opportunity to draw the court\u2019s attention to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and that the court was not persuaded to change its original within-guidelines sentence. Armstead makes no argument that convinces us that his within-guidelines sentence was unreasonable. We therefore AFFIRM Arm-stead\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
