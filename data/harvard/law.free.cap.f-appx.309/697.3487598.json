We have reviewed Flores\u2019 arguments and find no abuse of discretion in the Board\u2019s decisions denying her motions to reopen. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2008); <em>Afanwi v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 788 (4th Cir.2008). To the extent Flores challenges the underlying decision of the Immigration Judge that was previously affirmed by the Board, those orders have already been reviewed by this court and are otherwise not part of the instant con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>solidated petitions for review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(2) (2006); <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Accordingly, we deny in part and dismiss in part the petitions for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">\n<em>PETITIONS DENIED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
