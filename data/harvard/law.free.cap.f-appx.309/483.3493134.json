Kennedy International Airport, i.e., refusing to seat them because of a full aircraft even though they were ticketed and had confirmed reservations on the flight. El Al asked the Weisses to return to the airport on two subsequent days, but ultimately failed to provide them with seats on a later flight. The district court ruled that this claim was preempted by section 105 of the Airline Deregulation Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41713(b)(1). The Weisses appeal this determination. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-17\">\u201cThe district court\u2019s determination regarding preemption is a conclusion of law, and we therefore review it de novo.\u201d <em>Drake v. Laboratory Corp. of Am. Holdings, </em>458 F.3d 48, 56 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-18\">ADA section 105 provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that a state \u201cmay not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of an air carrier.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41713(b)(1). The parties agree that a common-law tort action is a \u201claw, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law\u201d within the meaning of the statute. <em>Cf. Morales v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><em>Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>504 U.S. 374, 386, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992)(common-law tort suits can be preempted by the ADA). The issue is therefore whether or not El Al\u2019s treatment of the Weisses related to El Al\u2019s \u201cservice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The plaintiffs base their claim on the rule adopted by the Ninth and Third Circuits to the effect that \u201cservice[s]\u201d under section 105 means only air transportation. <em>Charas v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>160 F.3d 1259, 1266 (9th Cir.1998)(en banelfinterpreting \u201cservice\u201d to refer only to \u201cthe provision of air transportation to and from various markets at various times\u201d); <em>Taj Mahal Travel, Inc. v. Delta Airlines Inc., </em>164 F.3d 186, 193-94 (3d Cir.1998) (similar). But in <em>Air Transport Association of America, Inc. v. Cuomo, </em>520 F.3d 218 (2d Cir.2008) <em>(\u201cATA\u201d), </em>we explicitly rejected that approach on the grounds that it was \u201cinconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Rowe [v. New Hampshire Motor Transp. Ass\u2019n, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 989, 169 L.Ed.2d 933 (2008), where] the Court necessarily defined \u2018service\u2019 to extend beyond prices, schedules, origins, and destinations.\u201d <em>ATA, </em>520 F.3d at 223. We therefore held \u201cthat requiring airlines to provide food, water, electricity, and restrooms to passengers during lengthy ground delays does relate to the service of an air carrier,\u201d noting that a majority of the circuits had found the term \u201cservice\u201d to \u201crefer[ ] to the provision or anticipated provision of labor from the airline to its passengers and [to] encompassf ] matters such as boarding procedures, baggage handling, and food and drink.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">The El A1 actions challenged by the plaintiffs related \u201cto the provision or anticipated provision of labor from the airline\u201d within the meaning of <em>ATA. </em>Though the plaintiffs were not ultimately seated on any El A1 flight, this circumstance was foreseen by the <em>ATA </em>court, as indicated by its use of the phrase <em>\u201canticipated </em>provision of labor\u201d (emphasis added). Moreover, this case falls squarely within the rationale of <em>ATA, </em>which, relying on <em>Rowe, </em>stressed Congress\u2019s \u201coverarching goal\u201d of \u201cas-surfing] that transportation rates, routes, and services reflected maximum reliance on competitive market forces, thereby stimulating ... efficiency, innovation, and low prices.\u201d <em>ATA </em>520 F.3d at 222-23 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Like an airline\u2019s failure to provide food or water to passengers stranded on the runway (which was at issue in <em>ATA, see ATA </em>520 F.3d at 220), the practice of \u201cbumping,\u201d although notoriously maddening to passengers, is a practice subject to competitive market forces. We therefore conclude that El Al\u2019s actions related to the airline\u2019s \u201cservice,\u201d and that the plaintiffs\u2019 tort claim is thus preempted by section 105 of the ADA so that any limitations on the practice of which the plaintiffs complain must be imposed by the federal government and not the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
