Finding no error, we AFFIRM.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-17\">1. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b257-18\">On August 14, 2001, Debtor filed a personal injury case in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas styled <em>McCaull v. New Prime Inc. (\u201cNew Prime </em>\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, on January 14, 2005, he filed a Chapter 7 petition. Appellee Susan Manchester was appointed trustee of McCaull\u2019s bankruptcy estate. The bankruptcy court also appointed Ms. Manchester attorney for the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-19\">In her capacity as the trustee\u2019s attorney, Ms. Manchester participated in the <em>New Prime </em>case as well as in two adversary proceedings filed in the McCaull Chapter 7 case. First, on March 8, 2005, she filed an adversary proceeding against Debtor to recover assets contained in various trusts controlled by him (the \u201cTurnover AP\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She prevailed in this case and the Debtor was ordered to turn over the corpus of each of the trusts. On May 22, 2006, St. Peters Catholic Church (\u201cSt. Peters\u201d) filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>a complaint against the trustee alleging it did not receive notice of the Turnover AP and asserting an interest in the assets of McCaull\u2019s trusts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> St. Peters and the trustee reached an agreed settlement of this adversary in August 2007. The part of the agreement relevant here provided that \u201c[e]ach party shall be solely responsible for that party\u2019s attorney fees associated with the adversary proceeding.\u201d After notice and a hearing, the bankruptcy court approved the trustee\u2019s motion for approval of settlement and compromise of the St. Peters adversary.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">In the interim, Ms. Manchester settled the <em>New Prime </em>action for $700,000.00, and obtained an Order Approving Compromise (the \u201cPI Order\u201d). That order authorized the trustee to pay the following claims and liens from the settlement proceeds: (1) a total of $245,929.62 in attorney\u2019s fees to McCaull\u2019s Kansas personal injury counsel (the \u201cPI attorneys\u201d); (2) the PI attorneys\u2019 costs, totaling $85,175.95; (3) all medical and hospital liens attaching to the settlement proceeds; and (4) $50,000 to Debtor on account of his Oklahoma law exemption in the proceeds of his personal injury claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">After making these disbursements and after having completed her work in the adversary proceedings, the trustee filed her Final Attorney Fee Application (\u201cFee App\u201d) on July 7, 2008, seeking $36,845.75 for her legal services and $547.66 for her actual and necessary expenses incurred in prosecuting and defending the <em>New Prime </em>case and the two adversary proceedings. Debtor McCaull objected to the Fee App on three grounds: (1) that he did not receive notice of the Fee App, (2) that the fee request was contrary to Ms. Manchester\u2019s agreement to pay her own attorney\u2019s fees in the compromise of the St. Peters adversary, and (3) that the fee request violated Oklahoma law limiting an attorney\u2019s fee recovery to fifty percent of a judgment or settlement in a personal injury case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After a hearing, the bankruptcy court found Debtor\u2019s objection untimely and deemed the application confessed pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 2002. In addition, the bankruptcy court found the fees and expenses reasonable and necessary under Bankruptcy Rule 2016. On August 8, 2008, the bankruptcy court issued an order authorizing the trustee\u2019s attorney to be paid $36,845.75 in attorney\u2019s fees and $547.66 in expenses (the \u201cFee Order\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-13\">On August 15, 2008, Debtor filed a motion for reconsideration of the Fee Order. On September 10, 2008, the bankruptcy court issued an order denying Debtor\u2019s motion to reconsider, holding that whether he received proper notice of the Fee App or not, his objections to it were without merit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> McCaull timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-14\">II. Appellate Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b258-15\">We have jurisdiction to hear timely filed appeals from \u201cfinal judgments, orders, and decrees\u201d of bankruptcy courts within the Tenth Circuit, unless one of the parties elects to have the district court hear the appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A decision is considered final if it \u201cends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>court\u2019s order denying the motion to reconsider was a final order for purposes of \u00a7 158(a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Debtor\u2019s notice of appeal was timely filed within ten days of entry of the appealed order. Neither party elected to have this appeal heard by the district court for the Western District of Oklahoma. Thus, this Court has jurisdiction to review the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">III. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">We review final orders denying motions to reconsider for an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A bankruptcy court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or erroneous application of the law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cHowever, any statutory interpretation or other legal analysis underlying the [trial] court\u2019s decision concerning attorney fees is reviewed de novo.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We do not disturb the bankruptcy court\u2019s exercise of discretion unless we have a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that the lower court made a clear error of judgment or exceeded the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">IV. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Since Debtor\u2019s motion to reconsider was filed nine days after the Fee Order was entered on the docket, this Court construes it as a motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) which applies in bankruptcy pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 9023. A Rule 59(e) motion is only appropriate where a court has misapprehended the facts, a party\u2019s position, or controlling law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-13\">As a preliminary matter, this Court notes that Debtor\u2019s motion to reconsider did not raise any new issues that would qualify as grounds for granting the motion. Thus, denial of Debtor\u2019s motion to reconsider on that basis would be proper and within the bankruptcy court\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-14\">Because Debtor\u2019s motion to reconsider was a timely Rule 59 motion, this Court may review the merits of the underlying judgment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Indeed, by revisiting the merits of the Fee App and the Debt- or\u2019s objections to it, the bankruptcy court implicitly granted Debtor\u2019s request for reconsideration. In the end, the bankruptcy court reaffirmed the conclusions it reached in the Fee Order and denied relief from that order. As a brief consideration of both orders on their merits will demonstrate, nothing the bankruptcy court did here approaches an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>We first consider the bankruptcy court\u2019s Fee Order as it relates to Ms. Manchester\u2019s work on the adversary proceedings. Debtor argues the settlement agreement between St. Peters and the trustee plainly obligated her to pay her own attorney\u2019s fees and that the bankruptcy 00104; erred when it authorized the trustee to use estate funds to pay her attorney\u2019s fees. This argument fails. As Trustee, Ms. Manchester was appointed to administer the assets of the bankruptcy estate. The Code makes clear that the trustee is the representative of the bankruptcy estate<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and that suits brought on behalf of or against the bankruptcy estate must be brought in the trustee\u2019s name.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The bankruptcy judge properly concluded that the \u201cpay ... own attorney\u2019s fees\u201d agreement contained in the settlement agreement between St. Peters and the trustee constituted an agreement between St. Peters and the estate.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The attorney\u2019s fees incurred by the trustee\u2019s lawyer in defending the St. Peters\u2019 action were incurred on behalf of the estate. While the agreement plainly required the estate to bear its own legal fees and expenses, it in no way precluded the estate\u2019s attorney from being paid by the estate for her services.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Debtor\u2019s second argument challenges the further award of attorney\u2019s fees to the trustee in connection with her work on the <em>New Prime </em>settlement. He argues that because that award increases the amount of money received by lawyers on account of their work on that case above fifty percent of the estate\u2019s recovery, it violates Oklahoma\u2019s fifty percent fee rule. Debtor contends that the bankruptcy court failed to follow the rule enunciated by the Oklahoma Supreme Court in <em>State ex rel. Oklahoma Bar Ass\u2019n v. </em>Weeks<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and incorrectly calculated the attorney\u2019s fees allowance in the personal injury case. Debtor argues <em>Weeks </em>mandates that attorney\u2019s fees in a personal injury case cannot be more than fifty (50%) of the net recovery, which requires first deducting medical liens and costs from the total settlement proceeds. Unfortunately, nowhere in the <em>Weeks </em>opinion is this concept referenced in any fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\"><em>Weeks </em>involved an Oklahoma Bar Association complaint against two lawyers who, after entering into a contingent fee agreement with their civil rights client, obtaining a $50,000 settlement, and collecting their 40 percent fee of $20,000, also collected and retained a statutory attorney\u2019s fee from the defendant under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. The Oklahoma Supreme Court held that when the attorneys received not only the contingency fee from their client but also the court-awarded fees from their client\u2019s adversary, they received duplicate fees for the same services and that receipt of those duplicate fees constituted a violation of Oklahoma\u2019s version of Rule of Professional Conduct 1.5(a).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>Weeks </em>does not purport to interpret or enforce the Oklahoma fifty percent fee statute. Nor is there any reference in the opinion to \u201cnet recovery\u201d in the context of applying the fifty percent fee limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">The source of the fifty percent rule is statutory. The Oklahoma fee limitation statute states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>It shall be lawful for an attorney to contract for a percentage or portion of the proceeds of a client\u2019s cause of action or claim not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of the <em>net amount of such judgment </em>as <em>may be recovered, or such compromise as may be made, </em>whether the same arises ex contractu or ex delicto, and no compromise or settlement entered into by a client without such attorney\u2019s consent shall affect or abrogate the lien provided for in this chapter.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACN7\">This statute makes no reference to the deduction of medical liens and costs, but does state that the fifty percent limitation must be applied to the \u201cnet amount\u201d of the settlement. Debtor cites no authority to support the proposition that medical liens and costs must first be deducted and this Court has found none. Medical liens attach to personal injury settlements to assure healthcare providers of payment for services rendered to plaintiffs. Amounts paid with respect to medical liens are amounts paid for the injured party\u2019s benefit. If they are not paid from the settlement, presumably the injured party remains liable for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">In his objection to the Fee App,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Debt- or cited <em>Weeks </em>for the proposition that \u201cthe Personal Injury attorney fee can not [sic] be more than fifty percent (50%) of the total settlement.\u201d He alleged that \u201c[t]he personal injury attorney\u2019s fees if added up between all attorneys involved on the Debtor/Plaintiffs side of the matter comes to [$354,059.55],\u201d thereby exceeding the allowable $350,000 cap.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This calculation oversimplifies matters by ignoring the \u201cnet amount\u201d provision in the fee statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">The bankruptcy court properly applied the fifty percent rule when it deducted the personal injury attorneys\u2019 expenses before applying the contingency percentage, as is required by Oklahoma law.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Doing so effectuated the \u201cnet amount\u201d referenced in the fee statute. Here, the total or gross settlement of the personal injury action was $700,000. After deducting the litigation costs (approved in the PI Order) of $85,175.95, the remaining \u201cnet amount\u201d was $614,824.05. Fifty percent of the gross settlement is $350,000. Fifty percent of the \u201cnet amount\u201d is $307,412. If the PI attorneys\u2019 fees and the trustee\u2019s fees relating to the <em>New Prime </em>case were less than $307,412, the fees awarded would be consistent with the fee statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">The bankruptcy court found the total amount of attorney\u2019s fees requested was $282,775.37, not $354,059.55 as alleged by Debtor. The PI attorneys were awarded $245,929.62 in attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to the PI Order. The Trustee sought $36,845.75 in attorney\u2019s fees. Erring on the side of caution, the bankruptcy court attributed all of the Trustee\u2019s fee request to the personal injury case even though it was clear that not all of the fees were expended on the <em>New Prime </em>matter. Combined, those figures equal $282,775.37, which is less than $307,412, fifty percent of the net settlement amount. Accordingly, we conclude that the bankruptcy court did not err in its judgment or exceed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>bounds of permissible choice in denying Debtor\u2019s motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in this case. We AFFIRM its order denying Debtor\u2019s motion to reconsider.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b257-11\"> This unpublished opinion is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. 10th Cir.
