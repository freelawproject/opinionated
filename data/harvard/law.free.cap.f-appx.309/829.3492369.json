For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-15\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b856-16\">Petitioners claimed flow-through loss deductions on their federal income tax returns for the 1981 and 1982 fiscal years based on their investment in Vulcan Oil Technology Partners (\u201cVulcan\u201d). Vulcan was one of several Denver limited partnerships that invested in enhanced oil recovery (\u201cEOR\u201d) technology. The limited partnerships were comprised of several individual partners with Louis Coppage serving as general partner. In 1988, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) issued notices of deficiency to taxpayers whose flow-through losses it disallowed from the Vulcan investment for 1981 and 1982. On April 7, 1988, Petitioners, along with five other taxpayers who had claimed similar losses, filed a petition in tax court challenging the disallowance of these losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-17\">During the pendency of that action, the tax court decided two cases relating to EOR technology that affect Petitioners\u2019 suit. In <em>Krause v. Commissioner, </em>99 T.C. 132, 1992 WL 178601 (1992), <em>aff'd, Hilde</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number><em>brand v. Comm\u2019r, </em>28 F.3d 1024 (10th Cir. 1994), the tax court heard consolidated matters which were test cases for over 2,000 related suits challenging the IRS\u2019s decision with respect to the EOR losses. The tax court disallowed the tax deductions, finding that the \u201ctransactions did not, and do not, constitute legitimate for-profit business transactions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176. In <em>Ademo v. Commissioner, </em>74 T.C.M. 738, 1997 WL 593874, *9 (1997), <em>aff'd, </em>185 F.3d 861 (3rd. Cir.1999), the tax court held that the <em>Krause </em>decision was controlling on another Denver limited partnership whose general partner was Coppage, finding that the EOR investments there were also tax-motivated transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">After the tax court\u2019s decisions in <em>Krause </em>and <em>Ademo, </em>Petitioners stipulated to the tax deficiency claimed by the IRS. The tax court entered an order reflecting these stipulations. Petitioners made no payments on the debts and, in 2005, the IRS sent Petitioners notice that it intended to levy to collect the unpaid liability. Petitioners sought a collection-due-process (\u201cCDP\u201d) hearing before the IRS Appeals Office, arguing that there was doubt as to liability, collectibility, and effective tax administration. Petitioners also made an offer-in-compromise to settle the debt and sought to enter into an installment agreement. The IRS officer refused Petitioners\u2019 settlement offer as it did not include the interest due on the tax debt. For the first time, Petitioners then asserted that their tax liability should be permanently abated, alleging that the IRS had committed fraud on the court by entering into a secret settlement with Coppage in return for his testimony in <em>Krause. </em>Specifically, Petitioners asserted that the IRS agreed to categorize Coppage\u2019s tax liabilities as non-collectible in exchange for his testimony that the EOR transactions lacked economic viability. Based on these assertions, Petitioners claimed entitlement to the same abatement purportedly received by Coppage. The IRS Appeals Office rejected Petitioners\u2019 arguments and upheld the proposed levy action. Petitioners thereafter filed a petition in the tax court challenging this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">The tax court, determining that the offer-in-compromise had been rejected without adequate analysis, remanded the case for a supplemental CDP hearing. The tax court retained jurisdiction over the case. In this second hearing, the CDP officer determined that Petitioners\u2019 offer-in-compromise should be rejected, partly because Petitioners failed to file the required revised installment agreement offer. The findings from the CDP hearing were filed with the tax court.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">The IRS then moved for summary judgment arguing that: (1) Petitioners\u2019 fraud on the court argument was an impermissible collateral attack on <em>Krause </em>which could not be raised in a CDP hearing, and (2) Petitioners were precluded from challenging the underlying liability because they had received a statutory notice of deficiency. The tax court held that the supplemental CDP hearing properly considered all statutory elements of Petitioners\u2019 claim and granted summary judgment on both grounds and determined that the appropriate mechanism for raising the fraud on the court allegation was a motion to vacate <em>Krause. </em>Petitioners timely appealed only the fi-aud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">We review a tax court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Staff IT, Inc. v. United States, </em>482 F.3d 792, 797 (5th Cir.2007). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In collection due process cases in which underlying tax liabilities are at issue, we review the underlying tax liability <em>de novo </em>and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>administrative decisions for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 797-98 (footnotes omitted). Where the underlying tax liability is not at issue, we review for abuse of discretion. <em>Christopher Cross, Inc. v. United States, </em>461 F.3d 610, 612 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Petitioners challenge the tax court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the IRS based on its determination that a CDP hearing is not the appropriate vehicle through which to bring a claim of fraud on the court. Petitioners argue that they do not challenge the underlying debt the IRS seeks to collect and do not wish to set aside the <em>Krause </em>decision. Rather, relying on <em>Dixon v. Commissioner, </em>316 F.3d 1041 (9th Cir.2003), they argue that, because <em>Krause </em>was tainted by fraud on the court, they are entitled to the same treatment Coppage may have received<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in perpetrating the alleged fraud by entering into a secret abatement agreement with the IRS. Petitioners ask this court to remand the case to the tax court for an investigation into whether the <em>Krause </em>decision was tainted by fraud while retaining jurisdiction to ensure a proper remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">While Petitioners claim no attempt to set aside the underlying obligation, their fraud on the court challenge goes to the very validity of the <em>Krause </em>decision and, as discussed below, must be brought in the court on which the fraud was perpetrated. The proper forum is either Petitioners\u2019 own case in which they stipulated to liability based on <em>Krause </em>or the <em>Krause </em>decision itself. The attempt to challenge the IRS\u2019s collection action in a CDP hearing by alleging fraud on the court in the underlying liability suit is impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">Parties seeking to overturn a judgment must bring such a motion \u201cno more than a year after the entry of the judgment or order or the date of the proceeding.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(c)(1). Nevertheless, when litigants seek \u201cto protect the fairness and integrity of litigation in the federal courts,\u201d courts may exercise discretion in entertaining such challenges even after the one year period. <em>Rozier v. Ford Motor Co., </em>573 F.2d 1332, 1338-39 (5th Cir.1978). Thus, while \u201c[fjederal courts ... long ago established the general rule that they would not alter or set aside their judgments after the expiration of the term at which the judgments were finally entered[,] ... under certain circumstances, one of which is after-discovered fraud, relief will be granted against judgments regardless of the term of their entry.\u201d <em>Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., </em>322 U.S. 238, 244, 64 S.Ct. 997, 88 L.Ed. 1250 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">Parties seeking relief, \u201chave done so by bills of review or bills in the nature of bills of review, or by original proceedings to enjoin enforcement of a judgment.\u201d <em>Hazel-Atlas, </em>322 U.S. at 245, 64 S.Ct. 997. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) \u201cprovides that a party to an action may <em>by motion </em>seek to vacate a judgment on the grounds of ... fraud.... Relief from a final judgment may also be obtained at any time by way of an <em>independent action </em>to set aside a judgment for \u2018fraud upon the court. \u2019\u201d <em>Gleason v. Jandrucko, </em>860 F.2d 556, 558 (2nd Cir.1988); <em>see also </em>Fed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>R.Civ.P. 60(b). \u201c[T]he proper forum in which to assert that a party has perpetrated a \u2018fraud on the court\u2019 is the court which allegedly was a victim of that fraud.\u201d <em>Chewning v. Ford Motor Co., </em>35 F.Supp.2d 487, 491 (D.S.C.1998); <em>Universal Oil Prods. Co. v. Root Refining Co., </em>328 U.S. 575, 580-81, 66 S.Ct. 1176, 90 L.Ed. 1447 (1946); <em>Weisman v. Charles E. Smith Mgmt., Inc., </em>829 F.2d 511, 514 (4th Cir. 1987). Thus, a motion to vacate or an equity action seeking to set aside a verdict may only be heard in the court whose judgment is being challenged. <em>Chewning, </em>35 F.Supp.2d at 491; <em>see also Sennett v. Comm\u2019r, </em>69 T.C. 694, 696-697, 1978 WL 3382 (1978) (granting summary judgment based on taxpayer\u2019s stipulation to be bound by the test case despite taxpayer\u2019s claim of fraud on the court because taxpayer made no motion to overturn that decision); <em>Tashjian v. Comm\u2019r, </em>93 T.C.M. 998, 2007 WL 738137, *5 (2007) (noting that raising the substance of a motion to vacate in a collateral review proceeding constitutes an impermissible collateral attack on the prior judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Petitioners\u2019 reliance on <em>Dixon </em>is misplaced. In <em>Dixon, </em>the Ninth Circuit, sanctioned the IRS for entering into a secret agreement with certain taxpayers by instructing the tax court to enter judgment in favor of all taxpayers in the suit on terms equivalent to those of the secret agreement. <em>Dixon, </em>316 F.3d at 1047-48. The tax court, on reconsideration, extended these terms to all other taxpayers challenging the tax-shelter, including those who had not participated in the underlying case. <em>Hartman v. Comm\u2019r, </em>95 T.C.M. 1448, *52 (2008). Significantly, the taxpayers in <em>Dixon </em>brought their fraud on the court challenge through motions in the underlying case or in one of the deficiency cases entered into by the taxpayers; none of the litigants sought relief through a fraud claim in an administrative hearing. <em>Dixon </em>did not create the right of collateral attack sought by Petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">Petitioners further fail to show any inability to challenge either <em>Krause </em>itself or their own deficiency stipulation. Thus, there is no concern that Petitioners will be left without a forum in which to bring their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">IY. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">The judgment of the tax court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b856-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b858-7\">. Petitioners speculate that, based on certain valuable pictures discovered by counsel in 2006 which \u201ctriggered memory of facts relevant hereto,\u201d Coppage \"made a deal to get \u2018non-collectible\u2019 status at the IRS in return for his testimony\u201d in <em>Krause. </em>Petitioners state that they are unsure whether a secret agreement was reached with the IRS or whether Coppage has in fact paid any debt due to the IRS. Petitioners have filed a FOIA request in an attempt to obtain such evidence. Petitioners note that \"[i]f Mr. Coppage has paid his IRS assessment plus interest and penalties, or any substantial part thereof, Petitioners may stand corrected and agree to reconsider.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
