Jones was one of Clark\u2019s subordinates. Throughout 2004 a confidential source working with the Drug Enforcement Administration made several purchases of crack from Jones. Jones pleaded guilty to one count of distributing crack and was sentenced to 10 years, the mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Jones filed a notice of appeal, but his appointed counsel represents that the case is frivolous and seeks leave to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Jones has not accepted this court\u2019s invitation to comment on counsel\u2019s brief. <em>See </em>Cir. R. 51(b). This court\u2019s review is limited to the potential issues identified in counsel\u2019s facially adequate brief. <em>See United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002). Because Jones does not want his guilty plea set aside, counsel correctly bypasses discussion of potential issues concerning the voluntariness of Jones\u2019s plea or the adequacy of the plea colloquy. <em>See United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 670-71 (7th Cir.2002). The only potential issue counsel considers is whether the district court erred when it overruled Jones\u2019s objection to his criminal history calculation and found Jones ineligible for safety-valve relief from the 10-year mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">To qualify for safety-valve relief from a mandatory minimum sentence, a defendant cannot have more than one criminal history point. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(1); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)(1). Jones has four prior convictions: two convictions in 1994 for possession of marijuana, one conviction in 1995 for manufacturing and delivering cannabis, and one conviction in 2005 for possession of heroin. Counsel for Jones contemplates, but rejects as frivolous, an argument that the 1995 conviction should have counted for one point and the other three convictions should have been excluded altogether from his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">At sentencing, Jones argued that his two prior convictions for possession of marijuana should not count for criminal history points because, he insisted, these were part of the relevant conduct for the present offense. Alternatively, Jones argued, the two marijuana possessions should not count because, in his view, they are analogous to the crimes excluded under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e). Jones also argued that his conviction for possession of heroin should be excluded both because the offense occurred after the transaction in this case and because, he contradictorily asserted, it too was part of the relevant conduct in the present offense. The district court disagreed with Jones and counted all four convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-13\">Counsel correctly concludes that Jones\u2019s argument that he has only one criminal history point and thus qualified for safety-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>valve relief is frivolous. The Guidelines define a prior sentence, which is included in a defendant\u2019s criminal history, as <em>\u201ca </em>sentence imposed prior to sentencing in the instant offense, other than a sentence for conduct that is part of the instant offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 cmt. 1; <em>United States v. Liddell, </em>492 F.3d 920, 922 (7th Cir.2007). Conduct that is part of the instant offense is defined as relevant conduct under \u00a7 1B1.3, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 cmt. n. 1, which states that a criminal offense constitutes relevant conduct to another offense if the two offenses are part of a common scheme or plan, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 cmt. n. 9; <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>330 F.3d 964, 986-87 (7th Cir.2003). To determine a common scheme or plan, courts consider significant similarity, regularity, temporal proximity, as well as common victims, accomplices, purpose, or <em>modus operandi. United States v. Farmer, 543 </em>F.3d 363, 373 (7th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">According to Jones, his three prior convictions were relevant conduct to this case and this should have been excluded from his criminal history for failing to satisfy the definition of prior sentence. The one similarity between Jones\u2019s marijuana convictions and his conviction here for distributing crack \u2014 that all three crimes involved drugs \u2014 is not enough to show a common plan or scheme. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>209 F.3d 1020, 1024 (7th Cir.2000). In fact, at sentencing Jones did not even argue that his marijuana convictions met any of the criteria that might evidence a common scheme or plan. Jones\u2019s convictions for marijuana possession occurred a full 10 years before his conviction in this case and did not involve common victims, accomplices, purpose, or <em>modus operandi. </em>Thus, the two prior convictions were correctly included in his criminal history calculation because the convictions constitute prior sentences under \u00a7 4A1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Jones\u2019s alternative argument for excluding his two prior convictions for marijuana possession is likewise frivolous. Section 4A1.2(e) does not list any offense similar to drug possession, and no court has held that a prior sentence for marijuana possession can be excluded from criminal history calculation on the basis of a perceived similarity to an offense listed in \u00a7 4A1.2(c). <em>See United States v. Jenkins, </em>989 F.2d 979, 979-80 (8th Cir.1993) (holding that possession of marijuana is not similar to the offenses enumerated in \u00a7 4A1.2(c)). Because the inclusion of Jones\u2019s two prior convictions for marijuana possession brings him above the one criminal history point required for safety-valve relief, the court need not consider his conviction for possession of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Even supposing, however, that Jones had only one criminal history point, he would nonetheless be ineligible for safety-valve relief because the district court found that he did not provide the government with full and truthful information regarding the crack cocaine distribution offense and all relevant conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)(5). That finding is reviewed for clear error, <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>301 F.3d 860, 866 (7th Cir.2002), and it would be frivolous to argue that the district court clearly erred where Jones did not even meet with the government to make a proffer of information.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
