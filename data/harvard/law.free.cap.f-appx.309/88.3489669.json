Mantle appeals the sentence imposed on him by the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>he pleaded guilty to transporting child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(l), and possessing child pornography, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Mantle e-mailed over 100 files containing images of child pornography to a police detective who was posing as a 14-year-old boy, and who mentioned his assumed age of 14 numerous times during the course of his communications with Mantle. Seizure of Mantle\u2019s desktop and laptop computers revealed thousands of image files and over 100 movie files containing child pornography-</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">On appeal, Mantle\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw, and in a brief filed under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), he argues that the district court erred in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(C) (5-level increase if offense involved distribution to minor), because classifying the undercover officer as a \u201cminor\u201d violated Mantle\u2019s due process rights. Counsel further argues that the court\u2019s application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(a)(2) (base offense level for transporting or possessing child pornography) and section 2G2.2(b)(3)(C) amounts to impermissible double-counting.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">Under relevant commentary, the district court properly applied section 2G2.2(b)(3)(C) because Mantle distributed child pornography to a detective who told Mantle that he was 14 years old. <em>See United States v. Rouillard, </em>474 F.3d 551, 555 (8th Cir.2007) (interpretation and application of Guidelines is reviewed de novo); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2, comment, (n.l) (\u201c \u2018Minor\u2019 means ... an undercover law enforcement officer who represented to a participant that the officer had not attained the age of 18 years.\u201d); <em>see also Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993) (\u201c[Cjommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\u201d). We find no basis to conclude that the foregoing commentary violates Mantle\u2019s due process rights, and counsel directs us to no authority indicating that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">Because the double-counting argument was not raised below, we review only for plain error, <em>see United States v. Pirani, </em>406 F.3d 543, 549 (8th Cir.2005) (en banc), and we find none. Sections 2G2.2(a)(2) and 2G2.2(b)(3)(C) address conceptually separate sentencing notions\u2014 transportation of child pornography versus distribution of that pornography to a minor \u2014 and counsel makes no showing that the Sentencing Commission intended a different result. <em>See United States v. Rohwedder, </em>243 F.3d 423, 427 (8th Cir.2001) (\u201cDouble counting is permissible if the Sentencing Commission intended that result and each section concerns conceptually separate notions relating to sentencing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw on condition that counsel inform appellant about the procedures for filing petitions for rehearing and for certiorari.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-18\">.
