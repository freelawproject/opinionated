We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comment during his opening statement that Cochran was not sitting in the courtroom by his own choice did not deny Cochran a fair trial. Cochran had refused to assure the court he would not disrupt the trial, and the prosecutor\u2019s comment did not suggest that Cochran\u2019s absence evidenced his guilt. Next, the district court did not err when it denied Cochran\u2019s motion to suppress. His traffic infractions provided a valid reason to stop him and to order him out of the car, and the baggie of crack cocaine that then fell from Cochran\u2019s pants justified the search of his vehicle. We therefore affirm Cochran\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">I.BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">The Hammond, Indiana police received a tip on April 17, 2006 that an African-American male named \u201cLarry\u201d who lived at 833 Gostlin Street and drove a maroon Ford Taurus was driving around to different locations selling crack cocaine. Four days later, Officer Joseph Martinez saw an African-American male in a maroon Ford Taurus at 833 Gostlin Street. The next day, Officer Martinez saw the same person, later identified as Larry Cochran, leave in a silver Mercury Cougar that had been parked next to the Taurus. Officer Martinez followed the Cougar to a car dealership and watched. He saw Cochran, and then another male, get into a car on the dealership lot. Another officer, Officer Nicole Duncanson, also arrived and watched, and both suspected that a drug deal had taken place between Cochran and the unidentified male.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-12\">Cochran then went back into the Cougar and drove out of the dealership. Officer Duncanson followed. Shortly thereafter, she pulled Cochran over for making an improper lane change and driving without a proper registration tag. After backup officers arrived on the scene, the officers ordered Cochran out of the car. When he got out, a baggie of crack cocaine fell from his pants leg. The officers then placed Cochran under arrest, and five more baggies of crack cocaine soon fell from his pants leg. The officers searched his car, and, eventually, his trunk, finding additional crack cocaine and a digital scale. Cochran was charged with possessing with the intent to distribute more than five grams of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-13\">Before the trial began, Cochran refused to assure the court he would not disrupt the trial. The judge therefore removed him from the courtroom, and Cochran observed the proceedings from his cell via live audio and video. The judge told prospective jurors during voir dire that Cochran had an absolute right not to be present in the courtroom during his trial, that Cochran\u2019s absence from the courtroom was not to be considered as evidence against him, and that his absence did not create any inference of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-14\">During the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, the prosecutor said to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-15\">You will hear that on April 22, 2006, Officer Joseph Martinez, who is a uni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>form police officer with the Hammond Police, is acting on a citizen\u2019s tip, and based on that tip, he\u2019s watching a man who turns out to be the defendant, Larry Cochran. He\u2019s watching the man drive a silver Mercury Cougar. Officer Martinez will testify that he follows that silver Mercury Cougar based upon the tip. He sees a man, who turns out to be Larry Cochran, <em>who is not sitting before you today, by his own choice.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">(Emphasis added.) Cochran\u2019s attorney objected and asked that the comment on Cochran\u2019s absence be stricken. The judge denied the request. In a discussion with the attorneys before closing argument, the judge told the prosecutor not to mention Cochran\u2019s absence diming the government\u2019s closing argument. The judge also reminded the jury during its final instructions that the defendant had an absolute right to waive his right to be present in the courtroom during trial and that the defendant\u2019s absence was not evidence against him and did not create any inference of guilt. The jury found Cochran guilty, and he appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">A. Prosecutor\u2019s Opening Statement</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">The first question on appeal is whether the prosecutor\u2019s comment during his opening statement that Cochran was not sitting before the jury by his own choice infringes on Cochran\u2019s Fifth or Sixth Amendment rights. A prosecutor may not offer a defendant\u2019s failure to testify or a defendant\u2019s exercise of his Sixth Amendment rights as substantive evidence of his guilt. <em>United States v. Willis, </em>523 F.3d 762, 773 (7th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Ochoa-Zarate, </em>540 F.3d 613, 617-18 (7th Cir.2008). A prosecutor\u2019s comments infringe on a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights when: (1) it was the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cmanifest intention\u201d to use the defendant\u2019s silence or exercise of his Sixth Amendment rights as evidence of guilt; or (2) the remark was of such a character that the jury would \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d treat it as such. <em>Willis, </em>523 F.3d at 773; <em>Ochoa-Zarate, </em>540 F.3d at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">In this case, the prosecutor\u2019s comment that Cochran was not sitting before the jury by his own choice does not suggest a manifest intention to use the exercise of any constitutional right as evidence of Cochran\u2019s guilt, nor would a jury \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d take the comment as such. The prosecutor did not mention Cochran\u2019s silence, and the comment essentially repeated what the jury had already heard from the judge. The prosecutor also did not say \u201cWhy isn\u2019t Cochran here?\u201d or anything that might have suggested there was something improper about Cochran\u2019s absence from the trial. In fact, we have already declined to find error in a prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding a defendant\u2019s refusal to be present in the courtroom. In <em>Resnover v. Pearson, </em>965 F.2d 1453,1465 (7th Cir.1992), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-11\">[T]he prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding Resnover\u2019s refusal to be present in the courtroom during the penalty phase of the trial do not amount to error. Indeed, the excerpts are not comments on Resnover\u2019s refusal to testify.... The prosecutor\u2019s statements merely pointed out that the defendants were absent from the courtroom; they did not comment on either defendant\u2019s exercise of his privilege against self-incrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AR\">Consistent with our decision in <em>Resnover, </em>we conclude that the remarks here did not comment on Cochran\u2019s constitutional rights. We note, though, that it did not seem necessary for the prosecutor to say during opening statement that Cochran was not sitting before the jury \u201cby his own choice.\u201d It seems the prosecutor could have just as easily said that Officer Mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>tinez \u201csees a man, who turns out to be Larry Cochran, the defendant in the case today\u201d and left it at that. The judge had informed the jurors that Cochran would not be present in the courtroom dining trial, so the jurors already knew he would not be there.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">In any event, even if there was any error, it was harmless. The evidence against Cochran was overwhelming. After officers pulled over Cochran, multiple baggies of crack cocaine fell out of his pants leg. They found additional crack cocaine in the car, along with a digital scale in the trunk. And after waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Cochran admitted he was transporting cocaine twice a week, and that he had nineteen kilos to deliver that night. Finally, the district court judge gave multiple reminders to the jury that it should not consider Cochran\u2019s absence as evidence against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">B. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Cochran also argues that the district court should have granted his motion to suppress the crack cocaine found during the traffic stop. In doing so, he first contends that the stop of the car he was driving was unreasonable and violated the Fourth Amendment. Officer Duncanson stopped Cochran\u2019s car because, in violation of Indiana state law, Cochran made an improper lane change and did not have a proper registration tag. Cochran does not dispute that he committed the two traffic infractions, and those were legal bases to stop his car. <em>See Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 809-10, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996) (officers can stop a vehicle when they have probable cause to believe a traffic violation has occurred). In addition, although Cochran argues that Officer Duncanson followed his car after he left the car dealership with the intent of stopping and searching it, \u201c[ujlterior motives do not invalidate a police stop for a traffic violation, no matter how minor, if a motor vehicle law infraction is detected.\u201d <em>United States v. Murray, </em>89 F.3d 459, 461(7th Cir.1996); <em>see also United States v. Bass, </em>325 F.3d 847, 850 (7th Cir.2003) (\u201cAny ulterior motive an officer may have for making the stop is irrelevant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">Cochran next argues that even if there was a legal basis to stop his vehicle, the officers did not have probable cause to search him and his car. Unfortunately for Cochran, this argument fails as well. First, an officer may order a driver out of a car during a valid traffic stop for officer safety reasons, and the officer need not first make any showing that the driver posed a threat to officer safety. <em>See Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 112 n. 6, 98 S.Ct. 330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977) (\u201c[Ojnce a motor vehicle has been lawfully detained for a traffic violation, the police officers may order the driver to get out of the vehicle without violating the Fourth Amendment\u2019s proscription of unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d); <em>see also Maryland v. Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 412, 117 S.Ct. 882, 137 L.Ed.2d 41 (1997). The officers were therefore justified in ordering Cochran out of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">After Cochran got out of his car, a baggie containing what the officers thought to be (and what was later confirmed to be) crack cocaine fell out of his pants leg. That entitled the officers to seize the baggie under the plain view doctrine and gave them reason to place him under arrest for drug possession, which they did. <em>See United States v. Bruce, </em>109 F.3d 323, 328 (7th Cir.1997). Then, because Cochran was lawfully under arrest, the officers could search him and the passenger section of his vehicle as a search incident to the lawful arrest. <em>See, e.g., Ochana v. Flores, </em>347 F.3d 266, 271 (7th Cir.2003). And when they found drugs in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>the console, they were entitled to search the rest of the car, including the trunk. <em>United States v. Thornton, </em>197 F.3d 241, 248-49 (7th Cir.1999). The stop and subsequent searches were all lawful under the Fourth Amendment, and the district court properly denied Cochran\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
