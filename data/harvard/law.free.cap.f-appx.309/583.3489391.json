We will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">Calderon, a native and citizen of Colombia entered the United States as a lawful permanent resident in January 1988. In 1992, Calderon\u2019s son, Christian, was born. Calderon was arrested ten months later, and in 1995, he pleaded guilty to the offense of conspiracy to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 and was sentenced to time served (about two years in prison), and three years of supervised release. A.R. 441-42. Calderon was arrested once again in March 2000 and was charged with first degree murder. He was placed in pretrial detention in Florida. His public defender withdrew due to a conflict of interest about one month before trial was to commence. The State provided a private attorney, but that attorney agreed to take the case only if Calderon agreed to waive his right to a speedy trial. After about years in pretrial detention, Calderon was acquitted of the charges in September 2005. He was then in immigration detention until February 2006 when he was released on bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">Calderon was served with a Notice to Appear in December 2005, charging him with being removable because of his controlled substance violation. Calderon admitted he was removable, but he applied for a waiver of inadmissibility under former \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). A.R. 437-39. At a hearing on the merits of his application, Calderon testified, and presented the testimony of three individuals as well as exhibits in support of granting him a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-14\">The IJ determined that due to the seriousness of Calderon\u2019s controlled substance violation, he would need to show unusual or outstanding equities in order to be eligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver. A.R. 139. The IJ considered that Calderon had spent over one-third of his time in the United States in prison, and noted that Calderon\u2019s conviction involved almost 6000 grams of cocaine. A.R. 140. The IJ stated that although Calderon appeared to have turned his life around, and although he tried to make time for his son, those equities did not outweigh the negative factors. A.R. 137, 140. The IJ also noted that the mother of Calderon\u2019s son did not appear at the hearing or provide an affidavit, even though she lived in Newark, where the hearing was held. A.R. 136. The IJ denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-15\">Calderon filed a notice of appeal to the BIA, and also a motion to supplement the record and for remand; attaching an affidavit from his son\u2019s mother, who was unable to attend the hearing due to a medical emergency. A.R. 4-5, 12-20. The BIA dismissed the appeal and denied the motion for remand. The BIA rejected Calderon\u2019s argument that pursuant to <em>Giambanco v. INS, </em>531 F.2d 141 (3d Cir.1976), the IJ had erred in considering his arrest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>and time in pretrial detention for first degree murder. The BIA held that <em>Giambanco </em>was inapposite, as it involved consideration of a conviction for which a Judicial Recommendation Against Deportation (JRAD) had been made. A.R. 3. The BIA noted that no issue involving a JRAD was present in Calderon\u2019s case, and that instead, the IJ simply considered the entirety of Calderon\u2019s criminal record, including the fact that during much of his time in the United States he had been incarcerated. The BIA also found no error in the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Calderon had failed to show sufficient equities to merit a \u00a7 212(c) waiver. The BIA noted that the IJ did not find the equities Calderon presented overcame his 1995 drug conviction and \u201crelatively recent arrest for first degree murder.\u201d A.R. 3. The BIA also found that Calderon had failed to meet his burden of showing that a remand was necessary, as his son\u2019s mother\u2019s affidavit was unlikely to change the outcome of the proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Calderon, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed a timely petition for review. We have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). When the Board issues a decision on the merits, we generally review only the Board\u2019s order. <em>See Li v. Attorney General, </em>400 F.3d 157, 162 (3d Cir.2005); <em>Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 548-49 (3d Cir.2001). Where the Board adopts the reasoning of the IJ with some discussion of the bases for the IJ\u2019s decision, we also review the order of the IJ. <em>Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 215, 222 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">We lack jurisdiction to review \u201cany final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed,\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>a controlled substance violation covered in \u00a7 212(a)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). However, the REAL ID Act of 2005 restored direct review of constitutional claims and questions of law presented by such aliens in petitions for review of final removal orders. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Papageorgiou v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 356, 358 (3d Cir.2005). Because Calderon has been convicted of a controlled substance violation, in our review we may consider only constitutional issues, pure questions of law, and issues of application of law to uncontested facts. See <em>Kamara v. Attorney General, </em>420 F.3d 202, 211 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Calderon raises essentially two questions: first, he argues that the IJ and BIA erred, as a matter of law, in considering his arrest and pretrial detention for the first degree murder charge; second, he argues that the Board violated his right to due process by denying his motion for a remand and by making errors of fact and failing to consider certain factors. We will consider the latter argument first.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">We agree with the Government that we lack jurisdiction to consider Calderon\u2019s due process claim. Although an alien in the United States may not be deprived of liberty or property without due process, an alien, like anyone else, must first possess a liberty or property interest to raise a due process claim. <em>Hernandez v. Gonzales, </em>437 F.3d 341, 345-46 (3d Cir.2006). Because an alien is not entitled to a waiver of deportation under former INA \u00a7 212(c), an alien has no protected liberty or property interest in discretionary \u00a7 212(c) relief. <em>Smith v. Ashcroft, </em>295 F.3d 425, 429-30 (4th Cir.2002). We therefore lack jurisdiction to consider Calderon\u2019s due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">The Government also claims that we lack jurisdiction to consider Calderon\u2019s issue of the consideration of his arrest and pretrial detention. However, Calderon raises a question of law, which we clearly have jurisdiction to review. 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Calderon\u2019s main argument is that the Board departed from its decision in <em>Matter of Catalina Arreguin, </em>21 I <em>&amp; </em>N Dec. 38 (BIA 1995). In <em>Matter of Arreguin, </em>the Board considered the case of a woman who was serving a term of imprisonment for importing marijuana. The Board noted that this was her only conviction, and noted that it would give \u201clittle weight\u201d to a previous arrest on suspicion of smuggling aliens, where prosecution was declined and there was no conviction or corroborating evidence of the allegations. <em>Id. </em>at 42. Calderon argues that if an arrest that results in no conviction after charges were dropped is given little weight, then it is \u201caxiomatic\u201d that a charge resulting in a \u201cnot guilty\u201d determination must be given no weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">We do not agree with Calderon\u2019s logic. It is quite possible that an IJ might give more weight to an arrest that resulted in a prosecution, as it suggests that there was sufficient evidence of wrongdoing to prevent authorities from dropping the charges. However, we need not reach the issue, as the IJ here did not use the fact of Calderon\u2019s prosecution for murder as an indication of wrongdoing; rather, the IJ simply considered the fact that Calderon had been incarcerated (rightly or wrongly) for a good deal of his time in the United States. This incarceration prevented him from forming a closer relationship with his son and developing other positive equities.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The IJ, taking into account the length of time Calderon spent in the criminal penal system, and the seriousness of his drug conviction, found that the positive equities did not outweigh the negative considerations. We hold that the IJ could, as a matter of law, consider the time Calderon spent in pretrial detention as one of the factors in determining whether Calderon warranted a waiver of removal. We therefore will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-6\">. The Government also claims we lack jurisdiction because the IJ alternatively denied relief as a matter of discretion. <em>See </em>A.R. 139 (\u2018\u2018In addition, as a matter of discretion, I also find that I would not unfortunately [sic] in this respondent\u2019s favor.\u201d). However, although the BIA mentioned this in its decision, it did not expressly affirm or adopt that alternative holding. Rather, it discussed the IJ\u2019s balancing of the equities in determining that the IJ properly denied relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
