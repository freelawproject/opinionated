Castro-Orpineda appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-22\">We review for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Washington, </em>480 F.3d 309, 316 (5th Cir.2007). Because the district court accepted Castro-Orpineda\u2019s guilty plea, Castro-Orpineda could withdraw it only if he could \u201cshow a fair and just reason for requesting the withdraw.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B); <em>United States v. Still, </em>102 F.3d 118, 124 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-23\">Castro-Orpineda argues that the district court erred by denying his motion solely on the ground that his guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. He reviews each of the factors set out in <em>United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 343-44 (5th Cir.1984), and argues that all but one (close assistance of counsel) weigh in favor of the grant of his motion to withdraw his guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>plea. However, in support of his motion, Castro-Orpineda raised, at most, only the innocence factor. \u201c[A] defendant cannot fail to invoke any of the <em>Carr </em>factors in support of his motion and then argue that the district court abused its discretion by failing to consider arguments that he had the burden to raise.\u201d <em>Washington, </em>480 F.3d at 317 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Moreover, the district court was not required to make specific findings on every Carr factor. Id Under the facts of this case, Castro-Orpineda failed to demonstrate a fair and just reason for the withdrawal of his guilty plea, and the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion. <em>See id</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b866-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
