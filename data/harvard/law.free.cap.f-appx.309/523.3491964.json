DENISE COTE, District Judge.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b549-16\"> The Honorable Denise Cote, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b549-23\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b549-24\">Defendant-Appellant Daniel Marino pled guilty for his involvement in a massive financial fraud to four counts of an indictment against him: conspiring to commit investment adviser fraud, mail fraud and wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, substantive investment adviser fraud, in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 80b-6 and 80b-17, mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, and wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. He was sentenced to 240 months imprisonment, three years of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>supervised release and a mandatory $ 400 special assessment. He appeals from the judgment imposing this sentence asserting that the sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case, and the issues presented on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">We review a district court\u2019s sentence under a \u201c \u2018deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Cavera, 550 </em>F.3d 180, 189 (2d Cir.2008) (en banc) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Our review has two components: procedural and substantive review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">We first review whether the district court\u2019s sentencing was procedurally proper. District courts have discretion to select an appropriate sentence, which is done by considering the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>at 187-88. The district court is required to conduct \u201cits own independent review of the sentencing factors, aided by the arguments of the prosecution and defense,\u201d in order to reach \u201can informed and individualized judgment ... as to what is \u2018sufficient, but not greater than necessary\u2019 to fulfill the purposes of sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). In explaining its sentence, the district court \u201cmust satisfy us that it has \u2018considered the parties\u2019 arguments\u2019 and that it has a \u2018reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decision making authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cavera, </em>550 F.3d at 193 (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, 551 </em>U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (alteration in the original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">In examining whether a sentence was substantively reasonable, we \u201ctake into account the totality of the circumstances, giving due deference to the sentencing judge\u2019s exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190. \u201c[W]e do not consider what weight we would ourselves have given a particular factor,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 191, and, we \u201cwill not substitute our own judgment for the district court\u2019s on the question of what is sufficient to meet the \u00a7 3553(a) considerations in any particular case. We will instead set aside a district court\u2019s <em>substantive </em>determination only in exceptional cases where the trial court\u2019s decision \u2018cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189 (citations omitted; emphasis in original). Thus, we \u201cpatrol the boundaries of reasonableness, while heeding the Supreme Court\u2019s renewed message that responsibility for sentencing is placed largely in the precincts of the district courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Under our deferential standard of review, the district court\u2019s sentence was not procedurally or substantively unreasonable. The court properly followed the procedure for sentencing. It began with the Guidelines, which it properly did not treat as mandatory. It considered the section 3553(a) factors in some detail, and gave an explicit and reasonable analysis of the factors, and the reasons it chose Marino\u2019s sentence. It explicitly considered his arguments pertaining to his personal difficulties, but did not find them sufficiently compelling to alter the sentence downward. It also explicitly considered the government\u2019s motion for a reduction based on Marino\u2019s substantial assistance to the government, finding that it warranted some but not all of the downward departure that Marino sought. While Marino argues that district court failed to consider, or erroneously considered, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) by sentencing him to the same sentence as his co-conspirator, Samuel Israel, the court did not find Marino less culpable than Israel. Nor has Marino established that allegedly similarly situated CFO\u2019s convicted of similar or more serious financial frauds were defendants with \u201csimilar records\u201d found guilty of \u201csimilar conduct\u201d such that we must be wary of \u201cunwarrant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>ed sentence disparities.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The district court eventually found that the bottom of the suggested Guidelines range, fifty years\u2019 imprisonment, was excessive. It sentenced Marino to twenty years. In short, the district court has shown that it \u201chas \u2018considered the parties\u2019 arguments\u2019 and that it has a \u201creasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority,\u201d <em>Cavern, </em>550 F.3d at 193 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted) and the sentence was not procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">We pause to note that we might ourselves have given greater weight than apparently did the district court to Marino\u2019s plight \u2014 his almost complete deafness and accompanying sense of loneliness, his lack of self-esteem, his bouts with cancer, his apparent fear of and deference to Israel\u2014 and his assistance to the government detailed in its \u201c5K1 Letter\u201d (noting his aid to the government in understanding the fraud, his immediate contrition and taking of responsibility upon discovery, and his contribution to the guilty pleas of his co-conspirators). But it is not for us to substitute our judgment for that of the district court, whose sentence was proeedurally and substantively proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
