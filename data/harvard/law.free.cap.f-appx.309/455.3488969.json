Rakoff, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b482-9\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">Appellant Ad Hoc Committee of Kenton County Bondholders appeals from an August 28, 2007 judgment of the District Court, affirming a Settlement Order entered by the Bankruptcy Court on April 24, 2007. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying factual and procedural history of the case, though we revisit key portions of that history here.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">Appellant is a group of Bondholders, who hold approximately $50 million in face amount of the approximately $400 million in bonds issued by the Kenton Country Airport Board (\u201cKCAB\u201d), pursuant to a 1992 Trust Indenture, between KCAB and Star Bank, N.A., the predecessor-in-interest to UMB Bank, N.A. (the \u201cTrustee\u201d), and guaranteed by Delta Air Lines, Inc. (\u201cDelta\u201d). On September 14, 2005, Delta filed a petition for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On March 8, 2007, Delta filed a motion, pursuant to Rule 9019 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, seeking approval from the Bankruptcy Court of a settlement agreement, entered into by Delta, KCAB, and the Trustee. Appellant filed timely objections to the motion. On April 24, 2007, the Bankruptcy Court approved the settlement agreement. Appellant filed an appeal, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) that the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction to impose a settlement that released claims against KCAB, Delta, the Trustee, and other Bondholders; and (2) that, in the first instance, the Trustee lacked authority to bind dissenting Bondholders to a settlement, which reduced the principal and interest that would be repaid under the KCAB Bonds. Appellant also sought a stay pending appeal, which was denied by the Bankruptcy Court on April 26, 2007, and by the District Court on May 2, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-16\">On August 27, 2007, the District Court affirmed the Settlement Order. First, the District Court determined that appellant\u2019s claims were \u201cequitably moot.\u201d Specifically, it determined that in light of the fact that \u201cirreversible financial transactions ... ha[d] occurred, and because Delta has entered into a whole new set of agreements,\u201d appellant could not show how vacating the Settlement Order, even if it were possible, would not create an unmanageable situation for the Bankruptcy Court. J.A. at 69. The District Court then noted that even if it were to consider the merits of appellant\u2019s arguments, contrary to appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>assertions, (1) the Bankruptcy Court did have jurisdiction to impose a settlement that released claims against KGAB, Delta, the Trustee, and other Bondholders, and (2) the Trustee did have authority to bind dissenting Bondholders to a settlement reducing the principal and interest that would be repaid under the KCAB Bonds. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal. Before this Court, appellant argues that its appeal is not equitably moot, and renews the arguments made before the District Court and Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">We note that \u201c[i]n an appeal from a district court\u2019s review of a bankruptcy court\u2019s decision, we conduct an independent examination of the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>In re Flanagan, </em>503 F.3d 171, 179 (2d Cir.2007) (citing <em>In re Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>479 F.3d 167, 172 (2d Cir.2007)). We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. Id. </em>Additionally, a district court\u2019s determination that an appeal is \u201cequitably moot\u201d is (by definition) an equitable decision, and we review a district court\u2019s fashioning of equitable relief for abuse of discretion. <em>See Onwubiko v. United States, </em>969 F.2d 1392, 1397 (2d Cir.1992), <em>implicit overruling on other grounds recognized by Polanco v. U.S. Drug Enforcement Admin., </em>158 F.3d 647, 651 (2d Cir.1998). <em>See generally Abrahamson v. Bd. of Educ. of Wappingers Falls Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>374 F.3d 66, 76 (2d Cir.2004). Approvals of Bankruptcy Rule 9019 settlements are also reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Iridium Operating, LLC, </em>478 F.3d 452, 461 n. 13 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Upon a review of the relevant case law and the record in this case, we conclude that the District Court did not err \u2014 much less abuse its discretion \u2014 in determining that appellant\u2019s claim is equitably moot. In particular, we agree fully with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">[bjecause of the irreversible financial transactions that have occurred, and because Delta has entered into a whole new set of agreements relating to its use of the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport as a hub of its operations, the appellants cannot show that a vacatur of the Settlement Order, even if it were possible, would not knock the props out from under the authorization for every transaction that has taken place and create an unmanageable, uncontrollable situation for the Bankruptcy Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">J.A. at 69 (internal quotation marks omitted). However, we note that even if we were to consider the merits of appellant\u2019s arguments, for substantially the reasons stated in the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned decision of April 25, 2007, we would affirm the Settlement Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">We have considered all of appellant\u2019s claims on appeal and found them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
