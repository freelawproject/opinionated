Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1149 (9th Cir.1999), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because it is based on the omission from Abbas\u2019 asylum application and asylum officer interview of the two most significant instances of harm he testified he suffered in Pakistan, <em>see Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962-63 (9th Cir.2004), and on the inconsistencies between Abbas\u2019 testimony and the testimony and affidavit of the Mohajir Quami Movement (\u201cMQM\u201d) official concerning Abbas\u2019 activities in support of the MQM, <em>see Kohli v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 1061, 1071 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Because Abbas failed to demonstrate eligibility for asylum, it follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Because Abbas\u2019 CAT claim is based on the same testimony the IJ determined was not credible, and Abbas points to no other evidence that IJ should have considered, he has failed to establish eligibility for CAT relief. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Abbas\u2019 claim that the IJ denied him due process because Abbas failed to exhaust this claim before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (generally requiring exhaustion of due process claims before the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b152-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
