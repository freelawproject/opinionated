Joseph\u2019s Title VII discrimination claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) because he failed to timely exhaust his administrative remedies. In order to preserve his claim under Title VII, Joseph was required to file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) within 300 days of the last challenged act by his employer, Pennsylvania\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection. Joseph submitted an intake questionnaire to the EEOC within the 300 day period but did not file his EEOC charge until the statutory period had expired. After the District Court dismissed his case and denied his motion for reconsideration, Joseph filed this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Following the dismissal, the Supreme Court decided <em>Federal Express Corp. v. Holowecki, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1147, 170 L.Ed.2d 10 (2008), in which it concluded that, in some instances, an intake questionnaire may constitute a charge under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">On Appeal, Joseph claims that the intake questionnaire that he submitted to the EEOC within the statutory period, and which is not a part of the District Court record, constitutes a charge pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Holowecki </em>In light of these developments, we will vacate the portion of the District Court\u2019s order dismissing Joseph\u2019s Title VII claim, as well as the order denying reconsideration of that dismissal, and remand this action for the District Court to examine Joseph\u2019s intake questionnaire and determine in the first instance what impact, if any, <em>Holowecki </em>has on the Title VII claim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-23\">. The District Court dismissed other claims advanced by Joseph, but Joseph has only appealed the dismissal of his Title VII claim,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
