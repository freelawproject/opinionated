The tax court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted summary judgment for the Commissioner. This appeal followed, in which Goodman argues that the tax court erred in considering the declaration of the appeals officer, with its attached exhibits, in granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-17\">After careful de novo review, <em>see Cox v. Comm\u2019r, </em>121 F.3d 390, 391 (8th Cir.1997) (standard of review), we conclude that the tax court did not err. The declaration was a statement by the appeals officer that she had considered the attached exhibits<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in making her determination that collection should proceed, and thus the material was properly deemed part of the administrative record. <em>See Fifty Below Sales &amp; Mktg., Inc. v. United States, </em>497 F.3d 828, 829-30 (8th Cir.2007) (review of Collection Due Process decision rendered by appeals officer under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330 is limited to administrative record before appeals officer); <em>Robinette v. Comm\u2019r, </em>439 F.3d 455, 459, 461-62 (8th Cir.2006) (review of administrative agency decisions is ordinarily limited to consideration of decision of agency and evidence on which it was based; finding record created by appeals officer adequate where officer considered taxpayer\u2019s file, correspondence from IRS, and officer\u2019s notes detailing contacts with taxpayer\u2019s representative).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-18\">The judgment is affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-14\">. The Honorable Mark V. Holmes, United States Tax Court Judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-20\">.
