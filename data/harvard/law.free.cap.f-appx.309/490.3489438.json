Campbell (\u201cCampbell\u201d) appeals from an April 1, 2008 judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of New York (Larimer, J.) sentencing him, <em>inter alia, </em>to fifteen months\u2019 imprisonment in connection with a Revocation of Supervised Release. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-24\">Campbell argues that it was plain error for the district court to allow his wife to testify at sentencing because she was not a \u201ccrime victim\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771(e). Under \u00a7 3771, however, whether a witness qualifies as a \u201ccrime victim\u201d bears only on the witness\u2019s rights under the statute, not the \u201cjudge\u2019s discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>tion\u201d to consider relevant material at sentencing, which is \u201clargely unlimited either as to the kind of information he [or she] may consider, or the source from which it may come.\u201d <em>Hili v. Sciarrotta, </em>140 F.3d 210, 215 (2d Cir.1998) (quoting <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>404 U.S. 443, 446, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972)). As such, the court had \u201cwide latitude\u201d to introduce \u201call matters bearing upon [Campbell\u2019s] personal history and behavior,\u201d and was not \u201cconfined to [Campbell\u2019s] conduct in connection with\u201d his offense. <em>Billiteri v. United States Bd. of Parole, </em>541 F.2d 938, 944 (2d Cir.1976). As Campbell\u2019s supervised release was revoked pursuant to state harassment charges arising out of domestic disputes with his wife, the district court was clearly not in error to allow his wife to testify to Campbell\u2019s history of abusive acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Campbell alternatively contends that even if his wife\u2019s testimony was appropriate, due process required the district court to have given him notice and an opportunity to respond \u201cto information to be considered by the sentencing court.\u201d <em>United States v. Copeland, </em>902 F.2d 1046, 1050 (2d Cir.1990). At sentencing, Campbell objected to his wife\u2019s testimony on notice grounds, but he later withdrew the objection, even after the government consented to adjourning the hearing if he desired. Campbell did not renew the objection or ask for a continuance during or after his wife\u2019s testimony. In fact, at the hearing he spoke at length in rebuttal. Any notice error by the district court was thus waived by Campbell\u2019s failure to renew his initial notice request despite numerous opportunities to do so. <em>Cf. United States v. Eberhard, </em>525 F.3d 175, 178 (2d Cir.2008) (stating that, under \u00a7 3771, when a defendant fails to object to a victim statement or to \u201crequest[] additional time to prepare a more thorough response,\u201d it is \u201cnot plain error for the district court to impose sentence immediately thereafter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
