No. 109-145, 119 Stat. 2664, codified at 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5112(n) (\u201cthe Coin Act\u201d), includes the ten men who served under the Articles of Confederation as the President of the United States in Congress Assembled. Pursuant to the Mandamus Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, Klos\u2019s complaint also sought an order directing the Secretary of the Treasury to issue one dollar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>coins bearing the names and likenesses of these ten men.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The district court granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The district court concluded that the Coin Act does not require the Secretary to issue such one dollar coins and, thus, Klos had no cognizable right to relief under \u00a7 1361 or \u00a7 2201.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">We agree with the government that the allegations in Klos\u2019s complaint, taken as true, do not establish Article III standing. <em>See Stalley ex rel. United States v. Orlando Reg\u2019l Healthcare Sys., Inc., 524 </em>F.3d 1229, 1232 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining that plaintiffs complaint must allege, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201can injury in fact \u2014 a harm suffered by the plaintiff that is concrete and actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical\u201d to establish Article III standing).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we do not address the merits of Klos\u2019s claims. We vacate the district court\u2019s July 14, 2008 dismissal order, however, with instructions to dismiss Klos\u2019s complaint without prejudice. <em>See id. </em>(explaining that a dismissal for lack of standing has the same effect as a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) and thus is entered without prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-9\">. Because standing is a jurisdictional requirement we must address <em>sua sponte, </em>the government's failure to raise the standing issue in the district court does not impede our ability to consider the issue for the first time on appeal. <em>See Region 8 Forest Serv. Timber Purchasers Council v. Alcock, 993 F.2d </em>800, 807 n. 9 (11th Cir. 1993). \"[Wjhen standing is questioned for the first time by an appellate court, standing must affirmatively appear in. the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 806 (quotation marks omitted). In response to the government\u2019s standing argument, Klos did not move to supplement the record or amend his complaint (or even contend that he has standing). Thus, the only allegations of standing in the record are found in Klos\u2019s complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
