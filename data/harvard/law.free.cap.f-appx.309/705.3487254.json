We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">In cases in which the United States is not a party, parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the distinct court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). If the district court\u2019s final judgment or order is not set forth in a separate document, the notice of appeal must be filed within 150 days of the judgment or order. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(7)(A)(ii). The appeal periods are \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-16\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the district court\u2019s docket on July 20, 2006. Because there was no separate entry of judgment, Head\u2019s notice of appeal was due within 150 days. The notice of appeal was not filed, however, until March 17, 2008. Because Head failed to file a timely notice of appeal <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis and deny the \u201cMotion to Allow Cost of Filing Fees to be Legally Paid by Appellant from his Veteran Benefits.\u201d We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-17\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b732-13\"> Head claims that he did not receive a copy of the district court\u2019s order until February 2008. This does not affect the running of the appeal period. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 77(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
