Damplo, attorney for defendant-appellant Craig Moye, filed a motion to withdraw as counsel, pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), on the ground that there were no non-frivolous issues to raise on appeal. The government filed a cross-motion for summary affirmance on the same ground. Following oral argument, we issued a Summary Order dated September 18, 2008, remanding the case with respect to Moye and requesting clarification as to whether Moye was sentenced pursuant to Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1 or \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>293 Fed.Appx. 63 (2d Cir.2008). The district court has clarified that it relied on Guidelines \u00a7 4B1.1 when it sentenced Moye. <em>See </em>Response to Remand, Jan. 13, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">We have reviewed Moye\u2019s attorney\u2019s <em>Anders </em>motion, her brief in support of it, and the government\u2019s cross-motion for summary affirmance. In light of the district court\u2019s clarification of the record, we agree with Moye\u2019s counsel and the government that there are no non-frivolous issues that could be raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-14\">Accordingly, the motion of Susan M. Damplo to withdraw as counsel is GRANTED. The government\u2019s cross-motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED. Consequently, the judgment of conviction of Craig Moye is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
