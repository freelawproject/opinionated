Thumb guaranteed the Note in an accompanying security agreement. When Thumb and TOPC Texas failed to pay on the Note, Nutrasep sued them. Claiming that Nutrasep misled them about its technological know-how, which they insist never worked, Thumb and TOPC Texas filed a counter-claim against Nutrasep. A jury found that all three parties \u2014 Thumb and TOPC Texas on one side, and Nutrasep on the opposite side \u2014 breached one of the four contracts, awarding $67,500 in damages to Thumb and nothing to the other parties. Neither Thumb nor TOPC Texas appealed, but Nutrasep appealed the denial of its motion for a judgment as a matter of law (\u201cjmol\u201d). We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">I. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">A. Applicable Law</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">In diversity cases like this one, we apply state substantive law and federal procedural law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this case, the applicable law is that of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">B. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">A district court must deny a motion for jmol \u201cunless the facts and inferences point \u2018so strongly and overwhelmingly in the movant\u2019s favor that reasonable jurors could not reach a contrary conclusion.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We review denials of motions for jmol <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standard as the district court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We consider all of the evidence, drawing all reasonable inferences and resolving all credibility determinations in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. \u201cAlthough we review denial of a motion for [jmol], we note that our standard of review with respect to a jury verdict is especially deferential.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-16\">C. Breach of Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b816-17\">Four contracts signed by the parties were at issue in this dispute: the Note, the Security Agreement, the Technology License Agreement (the \u201cTLA\u201d), and the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement. These contracts obligated Nutrasep to provide the contemplated technology and obligated TOPC Texas, with Thumb as its guarantor, to pay Nutrasep $350,000 as an initial licensing fee, followed by continuing licensing fees and royalties. The total value to Nutrasep over the life of the contracts was $3.35 million, including the initial licensing payment and ongoing licensing and royalty payments for 20 years. The Note was due on February 14, 2005; neither TOPC Texas nor Thumb paid, claiming Nutrasep\u2019s technology was not \u201cunique\u201d and was incapable of producing marketable soy lecithin. The jury found that all three entities breached the TLA, and Nutrasep filed a motion for jmol. It sought reversal of the jury finding that it had breached the TLA and the award of damages to Thumb.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-18\">The district court may grant jmol only if \u201cthere is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to have found for that party with respect to that issue.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Our review of the record convinces us that there was substantial evidence on both sides of the controversy for a rational trier of fact to find that all three failed to perform under the contract.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>tion was one of fact for the jury, and the district court properly denied Nutrasep\u2019s jmol motion. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">D. Damages</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The jury awarded Thumb $67,500 in damages suffered as a result of Nutrasep\u2019s breach. On appeal, Nutrasep asserts that the evidence was insufficient to support the award, so that the district court erred when it denied Nutrasep\u2019s motion for jmol on this issue. We agree with Nutrasep.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">To win compensatory damages in a breach of contract case under Texas law, a plaintiff must show that he suffered a pecuniary loss as a result of the breach.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He must prove those damages with \u201creasonable certainty.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cThe causation or causal connection between the event sued upon and the plaintiffs injuries or damages must be demonstrated by evidence of probative value.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Thumb sought to recover the money that it had laid out in reliance on its deal with Nutrasep. Thumb supported its claim with testimony by its executives that the co-op had paid to hook up the processing machines that Nutrasep leased, paid electrical bills, and leased trailers in which to store barrels of wet gums, the byproduct of soybean refining that was to be turned into marketable lecithin. Standing alone, this testimony is meager: The entirety of the Thumb executives\u2019 speculation of the amounts spent and for what is contained in but a few of the roughly 800 pages of trial testimony and mentions few specifics.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-13\">The testimony might have been successfully bolstered by invoices or other supporting documentation, which Thumb did provide; but Thumb did nothing more than hand the jury hundreds of invoices and receipts with no explanations, summaries, compilations or the like. Thumb executives testified that the co-op spent $80,000 to $100,000 in the expectation that the project would go forward, yet none of that testimony attempted to connect this to the raw stack of receipts and invoices that they tendered. For example, we have located no receipt for electrical bills, other than Thumb\u2019s unsubstantiated invoices to TOPC Texas, despite both Thumb witnesses testifying that this was a large part of the co-op\u2019s expense.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In fact, the sums represented in the financial documents handed to the jury total vastly more than the damages Thumb claimed. And, many of the invoices are duplicative. For example, there are more than a dozen copies of receipts for a single expenditure.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>tionally, the expenditures span at least a year, bracketing the time when Nutrasep demanded payment on the Note. Some expenditures even post-date Nutrasep\u2019s filing of the lawsuit, unquestionably after the parties ceased (or should have ceased) to rely on the contract.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Although it is possible that the non-duplicative receipts represent valid expenditures, Thumb made no effort to demonstrate this.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">To prove its damages with \u201creasonable certainty,\u201d a party must do more than guess at its expenses then dump a ream of unexplained receipts in the jury\u2019s lap. The jury is not required to construct a party\u2019s case from the raw data when the party fails to do so. We conclude that Thumb did not provide legally sufficient evidence on the basis of which a reasonable juror could determine that Thumb suffered damages in the amount of $67,500 \u2014 or any other amount, for that matter. Consequently, the district court erred in denying Nutrasep\u2019s motion for jmol on the jury\u2019s award of damages to Thumb. We reverse this award and render judgment that Thumb take nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">AFFIRMED in part; REVERSED and RENDERED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b815-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
