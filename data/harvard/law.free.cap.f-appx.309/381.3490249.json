The Purchasers allege that Santa Barbara violated the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act (\u201cILSFDA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701 <em>et. seq., </em>by failing to file a statement of record with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and by omitting several provisions required by ILSFDA from their purchase contracts. Santa Barbara contends that the purchase agreements are exempt from ILSFDA pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Section 1702(a)(2) provides that ILSFDA \u201cshall not apply to ... the sale or lease of land under a contract obligating the seller or lessor to erect such a building thereon within a period of two years____\u201d Santa Barbara\u2019s contracts with the Purchasers provide that Santa Barbara \u201cis required to complete and does agree that the construction of the Home will be completed within a period of two (2) years from Purchaser\u2019s execution of this Agreement.\u201d The contracts further provide that \u201c[i]t is the express intent of the parties that the parties\u2019 rights and obligations under this Agreement be construed in the manner necessary to exempt this Agreement and the sale of the Home from registration under the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act, and both Purchaser and Seller hereby expressly waive ay right or provision of this Agreement that would otherwise preclude exemption.\u201d Thus, Santa Barbara\u2019s contracts with the Purchasers are exempt from ILSFDA because the contracts provide that Santa Barbara \u201cis required\u201d to complete construction on each home \u201cwithin a period of two (2) years.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">In <em>Samara Development Corp. v. Marlow, </em>556 So.2d 1097, 1101 (Fla.1990), the Supreme Court of Florida held \u201cthat without the availability of at least both specific performance and damages the obligation to complete the construction within two years is illusory.\u201d Relying on <em>Samara, </em>the Purchasers contend that their contracts do not actually obligate Santa Barbara to complete construction within two years because the contracts limit their ability to seek specific performance or damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">Both specific performance and damages are available to the Purchasers under their contract with Santa Barbara. Although, in Section 16, the contract generally limits the Purchasers\u2019 remedy for Santa Barbara\u2019s breach to a return of their deposit and liquidated damages, the contract specifically provides that \u201c[njotwithstanding anything contained in this Section 16 to the contrary, in the event of Seller\u2019s default under Section 9 [requiring completion within two years] of this Agreement, the Cure Period shall not apply and Purchaser shall have all remedies available at law and in equity without limitation or restriction.\u201d A provision providing for \u201call remedies available at law and in equity without limitation or restriction\u201d more than satisfies the standard for obligation set out in <em>Samara. </em>Additionally, we agree with the district court that the contracts\u2019 prohibition on the filing of a lis pendens does not foreclose the Purchasers\u2019 equitable remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b408-14\">Upon review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we discern no reversible error. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s well reasoned order.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
