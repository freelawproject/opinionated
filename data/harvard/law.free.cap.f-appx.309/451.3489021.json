A96 427 387, A98 477 577 (B.I.A. Apr. 10, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>Nos. A96 427 387, A98 477 577 (Immigr. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 2, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">As an initial matter, because the Petitioners do not address the IJ\u2019s pretermission of their untimely asylum applications or the agency\u2019s denial of their CAT claim, we deem any such arguments to have been waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Thus, we review only the Petitioners\u2019 challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of their applications for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements that decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See, e.g., Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See Salimatou Bah v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 99, 110 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">We conclude that the record supports the agency\u2019s determination that the Petitioners failed to demonstrate past persecution. The Petitioners\u2019 claims that they received little compensation for the Indonesian government\u2019s possessing their land, that they had been forced to adopt Indonesian names, and that they had to pay higher fees for government documents, although unfortunate, do not rise to the level of \u201cpersecution.\u201d <em>See Ci Pan v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>449 F.3d 408, 413 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[Persecution is an extreme concept that does not encompass all treatment that our society regards as unfair, unjust, or even unlawful or unconstitutional.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). And in any event, the Petitioners here fail to challenge this aspect of the agency\u2019s decision and have therefore waived any arguments on the issue. <em>See Yueqing Zhang, </em>426 F.3d at 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (stating that arguments not made on appeal are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">The Petitioners argue to this Court that the agency erred in not considering two incidents that demonstrate past persecution: (1) when \u201cMs. Tjan was strangled with a string [by a soldier] while Mr. Tjan was held at gunpoint and forced to watch his wife\u2019s attack in a state of abject terror\u201d; and (2) when their car was \u201csmashed open and looted,\u201d while they were riding in it. However, the Petitioners only described these two incidents in the statements they attached to their asylum applications. They did not describe these incidents either at their merits hearing before the IJ or in their submissions to the the BIA. The Petitioners cannot now place these incidents at the forefront of their brief to this Court where neither the IJ nor the BIA was asked in any meaningful sense to consider them. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20 (2d Cir.2007) (stating that, while not jurisdictional, this judicially imposed exhaustion requirement is mandatory).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Furthermore, we find no error in the agency\u2019s conclusion that the Petitioners failed to demonstrate a pattern or practice of persecution against Chinese Christians in Indonesia. Contrary to the Petitioners\u2019 argument, the BIA did not ignore their pattern or practice claim. The BIA reviewed the country condition report in the record, and its order was directly responsive to the Petitioners\u2019 pattern or practice claim. In particular, the BIA considered the evidence of country conditions to determine whether the evidence reflected \u201cwidespread mistreatment of Christians\u201d and \u201cviolence perpetrated against [ethnic Chinese in Indonesia]\u201d\u2014 <em>i.e., </em>whether the record reveals systemic persecution against a group of persons, rather than whether the Petitioners had shown that they would be singled out for persecution. <em>Cf. Mufied v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 88, 91 (2d Cir.2007) (concluding that the agency erred in ignoring petitioner\u2019s pattern or practice claim). Having conducted that inquiry, the BIA determined that religious violence was \u201csporadic and limited to specific parts of Indonesia\u201d and that the \u201congoing harassment and discrimination\u201d against ethnic Chinese did not \u201csupport a finding that there [was] violence.\u201d Because we find that conclusion to be supported by substantial evidence, we must deny the petition for review. <em>See Corovic, </em>519 F.3d at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-8\">. We are particularly disinclined to consider the Petitioners\u2019 unexhausted arguments where they concede that at least one of the incidents arguably had no nexus to a protected ground. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
