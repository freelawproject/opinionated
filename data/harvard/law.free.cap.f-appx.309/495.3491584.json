We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the factual and procedural history of the case, though we revisit key portions of that history here.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-19\">In April 2006, plaintiffs brought the consolidated putative class action against American International Group, Inc. (\u201cAIG\u201d) and certain of its broker-dealer subsidiaries (\u201cthe AIG Brokers\u201d). Plaintiffs alleged that they all purchased shares or like interests in certain mutual funds, referred to as \u201cShelf-Space Funds,\u201d from the AIG Brokers. Plaintiffs alleged also that \u201c[djefendants failed to properly disclose that they had been aggressively pushing the AIG financial advisors to sell the Shelf-Space Funds that provided undisclosed payments, financial incentives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>and rewards to AIG or its affiliates in exchange for kickbacks.\u201d J.A. at 46. The complaint asserted several claims of securities fraud, including claims under \u00a7 10(b), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and \u00a7 20(a), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which remain the claims at issue here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Following oral argument, the District Court granted defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the action in an April 25, 2007 Memorandum and Order. <em>See In re AIG Advisor Group Sec. Litig., </em>No. 06-cv-1625 (JG), 2007 WL 1213395 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 25, 2007). Specifically, the District Court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) and Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, insofar as the complaint related to funds other than the ones in which plaintiffs alleged they owned shares. The District Court also granted defendants\u2019 motion for dismissal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted with respect to certain claims that it found were time-barred by the relevant statute of limitations, but denied the motion in all other respects. Finally, the District Court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(l), (\u201cPSLRA\u201d), for failure to adequately plead fraud by the AIG Brokers because of a want of sufficient particularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">On May 31, 2007, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint designed to cure the pleading deficiency identified by the District Court in its ruling of April 25, 2007. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on June 22, 2007. Following oral argument, the District Court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss in a September 20, 2007 Memorandum and Order. <em>See In re AIG Advisor Group Sec. Litig., </em>No. 06-cv-1625 (JG), 2007 WL 2750676 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 20, 2007). Specifically, the District Court concluded that most of the complaint\u2019s description of what the AIG Brokers stood to gain from selling the Shelf-Space Funds was still \u201ctoo generalized.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *1. To the extent that the plaintiffs had included specific sums that the AIG Brokers would gain by each transaction with the plaintiffs, including $25 for a \u201cstandard\u201d $10,000 transaction, the District Court determined that those sums were \u201ctoo small to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Based upon these two flaws of the complaint, the District Court concluded that \u201can inference of bias cannot properly be drawn from the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations,\u201d and dismissed the complaint. <em>Id. </em>at *5. Plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the dismissal of a complaint under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). <em>See Jaghory v. N.Y. State Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>131 F.3d 326, 329 (2d Cir.1997). We \u201cmust accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and draw inferences from those allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u201c[securities fraud claims are subject to heightened pleading requirements that [a] plaintiff must meet to survive a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>ATSI Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Shaar Fund, Ltd., </em>493 F.3d 87, 99 (2d Cir.2007). Specifically, under Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA, a plaintiff \u201cmust state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>We conclude, albeit for different reasons than those stated by the District Court, that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were properly dismissed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Ferran v. Town of Nassau, </em>471 F.3d 363, 365 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[W]e may affirm on any basis for which there is sufficient support in the record, including grounds not relied on by the District Court....\u201d). In their complaint, plaintiffs incorporated by reference website disclosures made by the AIG Brokers that detailed the allegedly undisclosed shelf-space arrangements. At oral argument, plaintiffs were unable to dispute that these website disclosures, assuming their adequacy, would foreclose their claims \u2014 either because the timing of the disclosures, with a single exception, would have triggered the applicable statute of limitations, or because their content rendered inactionable the alleged misrepresentations or omissions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658(b)(1) (establishing two-year statute of limitations for claims filed after the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act); <em>Shah v. Meeker, </em>435 F.3d 244, 249 (2d Cir.2006) (explaining that \u201climitations period begins to run when the plaintiff obtains actual knowledge of the facts giving rise to the action or notice of the facts, which in the exercise of reasonable diligence, would have led to actual knowledge\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also id. </em>at 252 (holding that plaintiff on inquiry notice could not succeed with a separate fraud claim for purchases made after the notice date). Instead, plaintiffs claimed that the website disclosures were themselves misleading because, while they disclosed the existence of \u201cshelf space\u201d payments made by the mutual funds\u2019 distributor and/or investment advisor, they failed to disclose that those payments were ultimately borne by fund shareholders. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, however, draws no such distinction about the payment source: It alleges that the AIG Brokers had an undisclosed conflict of interest based on their <em>receipt </em>of \u201csecret payments\u201d or \u201cundisclosed kickbacks.\u201d Amended Cplt. H H 38, 50. The websites therefore disclosed the existence of the very \u201cconflict of interest\u201d at the heart of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, barring any claim based thereon. See <em>Shah, </em>435 F.3d at 251 (analyzing impact of conflict-of-interest disclosure that went to \u201cthe heart of [plaintiffs] complaint\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\">. Plaintiffs originally brought additional claims pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, which they omitted in their amended complaint of May 31, 2007 \u2014 the operative pleading at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b523-10\">. The District Court noted that the \"standard\u201d $10,000 transaction figure is supplied by the plaintiffs' brief \u2014 rather than the complaint. <em>In re AIG Advisor Group Sec. Litig., </em>2007 WL 2750676, at *4 n. 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b524-4\">. Because we affirm on these grounds, we express no view on the District Court\u2019s materiality and standing rulings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b524-5\">. The single exception is the website of Sun-America Securities, Inc. (\"SunAmerica\"), which may have posted its disclosure as late as April 13, 2004 \u2014 approximately one week shy of two years before plaintiffs filed their complaint. Even assuming that the timing of the disclosure were resolved in plaintiffs' favor, the complaint would still fail to state a claim. That is because, given the unique circumstances of the roughly contemporaneous posting of nearly identical website disclosures by the other AIG Brokers, combined with preexisting disclosures contained in the Shelf-Space Funds' prospectuses and accompanying SAIs, sufficient knowledge existed to place plaintiffs on inquiry notice of SunAmerica\u2019s alleged fraud at least as of April 6, 2004. <em>See Shah v. Meeker, </em>435 F.3d 244, 249, 252 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
