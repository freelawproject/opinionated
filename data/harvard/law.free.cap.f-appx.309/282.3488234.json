EBEL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b308-21\">Robert Eskridge (\u201cEskridge\u201d), a federal prisoner appearing <em>pro se, </em>applies for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) in order to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, we deny a COA and dismiss Eskridge\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>I. <em>Procedural background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">On September 21, 1999, a federal jury convicted Eskridge of conspiracy to distribute various controlled substances, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and of continuing criminal enterprise (\u201cCCE\u201d), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848. Eskridge was sentenced to 420 months\u2019 imprisonment on the conspiracy count and 30 years\u2019 imprisonment on the CCE count, with those sentences to run concurrently. On direct appeal to this Court, Eskridge argued that the district court had erred in admitting certain testimony that Eskridge believed was hearsay, and by admitting certain expert testimony. We affirmed Eskridge\u2019s conviction on July 3, 2001, but later granted Eskridge\u2019s petition for rehearing as to the conspiracy conviction. On remand, the district court vacated the conspiracy conviction and sentence and dismissed the conspiracy charge against Eskridge, leaving the CCE conviction and sentence untouched.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The Supreme Court denied Eskridge\u2019s petition for certiorari on June 2, 2003, and Eskridge filed his \u00a7 2255 motion on March 1, 2004. In that motion, Eskridge raised four claims: (1) that he was broadly denied effective assistance of counsel at trial, at sentencing, and on appeal; (2) that the Government committed a variance by allowing into evidence facts about a trip from California to Oklahoma; (3) that the evidence showed several conspiracies rather than the single broad conspiracy charged in the indictment; and (4) that the district court erred when it told the jury not to guess or speculate as to the disposition of the conspiracy charge against Eskridge\u2019s co-defendant Sidney Iiland. (R. doc. # 614 at 4-5.) In a thorough and well-reasoned opinion and order, the district court denied Eskridge\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion on August 21, 2008. The district court later granted Eskridge\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pawperis </em>on appeal, but denied his application for COA. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">II. <em>Standard for issuance of COA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">\u201cA COA is a jurisdictional prerequisite to our review.\u201d <em>Clark v. Oklahoma, </em>468 F.3d 711, 713 (10th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003)). We will issue a COA \u201conly \u2018if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Silva, </em>430 F.3d 1096, 1100 (10th Cir.2005) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2)). \u201cTo make this showing, [Eskridge] must establish that \u2018reasonable jurists could debate whether ... the petition should have been resolved by the district court in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clark, </em>468 F.3d at 713 (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (alteration omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">III. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">Because Eskridge\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion and application for COA are <em>pro se, </em>we construe them liberally. <em>See Hall v. Scott, </em>292 F.3d 1264, 1266 (10th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972)).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">Before this Court, Eskridge requests COAs on a variety of issues introduced under his claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel and appellate counsel. (Aplt. Br. at 1.) After a careful review of the record and the relevant caselaw, and for substantially the reasons given in the district court\u2019s excellent opinion and order, we conclude that those claims lack merit, and that Eskridge has not made a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of [the] con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>stitutional right,\u201d <em>Silva, </em>430 F.3d at 1100, to effective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY Eskridge\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS his appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-8\">This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-16\">. The district court also held that a number of issues raised in Eskridge\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion were procedurally barred because they were not raised on direct appeal, and Eskridge has not requested a COA as to that holding. (See Dist. Ct. Op. at 15-17, citing <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 166-69 &amp; n. 15, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982); <em>United States v. Warner, </em>23 F.3d 287, 291 (10th Cir. 1994); <em>United States v. Cook, </em>45 F.3d 388, 392 (10th Cir. 1995).)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
