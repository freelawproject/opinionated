Sifford had contended that he was entitled to a 151-month sentence pursuant to Amendment 706 of the <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d), which lowered the base offense levels for drug offenses involving cocaine base. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) (2008); USSG App. C Amend. 706. We have reviewed the record and Sifford\u2019s contentions on appeal and find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant a further reduction in Sifford\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Goines, </em>357 F.3d 469, 478 (4th Cir.2004). Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Sifford, </em>No. 3:96-cr-00134-FDW-2 (W.D.N.C. May 13, 2008). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
