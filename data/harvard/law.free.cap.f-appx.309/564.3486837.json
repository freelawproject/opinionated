The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania sentenced Lizardo to a mandatory minimum sentence of 240 months. Lizardo\u2019s direct appeal was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>On May 11, 2005, Lizardo filed a motion to vacate and set aside his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Relying on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Lizardo claimed that his Sixth Amendment rights had been violated because the District Court\u2019s sentence was not based on facts, particularly the quantity of the cocaine and cocaine base, found beyond a reasonable doubt. The District Court denied Lizardo\u2019s motion. Lizardo\u2019s appeal of the District Court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 petition fared no better than his direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">More than a year later, in September of 2007, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Lizardo filed a motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4). Lizardo asserted that the District Court lacked the authority to impose his sentence because the District Court\u2019s finding as to the quantity of drugs was not \u201cpleaded and proved to a jury.\u201d After considering the government\u2019s response to the motion, the District Court entered a one sentence order denying the motion. This appeal followed. We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">On appeal, counsel was appointed for Lizardo under the Civil Justice Reform Act. Counsel moved to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). He asserts that Lizardo\u2019s motion for reduction constituted an unauthorized second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">After consideration of Lizardo\u2019s initial \u00a7 2255 motion and his subsequent Rule 60(b) motion, we conclude that they present the same substantive claim for relief; that is, the motions challenge the viability of the District Court\u2019s sentence in the wake of <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker. </em>As a result, the subsequent Rule 60(b) motion constitutes a second or successive habeas petition. <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 531, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005); <em>Pridgen v. Shannon, </em>380 F.3d 721, 727 (3d Cir.2004). As such, Lizardo\u2019s motion \u201cmust be certified as provided in section 2244 by a panel of the appropriate court of appeals....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h). Inasmuch as Lizardo\u2019s motion had not been certified, the District Court did not have jurisdiction to entertain it. <em>Burton v. Stewart, </em>549 U.S. 147, 149, 127 S.Ct. 793, 166 L.Ed.2d 628 (2007). For that reason, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying Lizardo\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">Although Lizardo did not ask us to construe his appeal of the District Court\u2019s order as an application for authorization to file a second or successive habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A), we wfil do so. We will deny the application as we have determined that <em>Booker </em>does not apply retroactively to \u00a7 2255 motions. <em>Lloyd v. United States, </em>407 F.3d 608, 616 (3d Cir.2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\">. In light of our disposition of Lizardo's appeal, we will grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. We certify that the issues presented in the appeal lack legal merit and thus do not require the filing of a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court.3d Cir. LAR 109.2(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
