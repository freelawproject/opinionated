We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to remand, <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003), and dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that Rios Olea failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Rios Olea\u2019s motion to remand to consider his wife\u2019s eligibility for cancellation of removal based on <em>Tapia v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 997 (9th Cir.2005), because the BIA concluded his wife was not in removal proceedings, and her ability to obtain cancellation of removal was not determinative of Rios Olea\u2019s cancellation application.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b197-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
