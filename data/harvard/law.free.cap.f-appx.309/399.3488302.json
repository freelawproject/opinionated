Cole appeals the final decision of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d) which affirmed the January 19, 2006 decision of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) that denied his claim for service connection for hypertension, secondary to his service-connected post-traumatic stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d). <em>Cole v. Peake, </em>No. 06-1431, 2008 WL 852634 (Vet.App. Mar. 10, 2008). We <em>dismiss </em>for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-13\">Mr. Cole served on active duty in the U.S. Army from October 1967 to September 1969. In September 1997, the Board granted Mr. Cole service-connected benefits for PTSD. In February 2004, Mr. Cole filed a claim for service connection for hypertension, secondary to his service-connected PTSD. In support of his claim, he submitted several Internet articles and excerpts from medical treatises, generally discussing the relationship between PTSD and the development of heart problems. In June 2004, the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 (\u201cVA\u201d) regional office (\u201cRO\u201d) denied his claim and Mr. Cole subsequently appealed to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-14\">In December 2004, at the request of the Board, a VA medical examiner reviewed Mr. Cole\u2019s entire claims file, which spanned two volumes and included his medical records and the articles he had submitted. In due course, the examiner concluded that Mr. Cole\u2019s \u201chypertension [was] essential in etiology\u201d \u2014 meaning that \u201cstress and other psychiatric disorders [were] not the cause of\u2019 his hypertension. In January 2006, the Board denied Mr. Cole\u2019s claim. <em>Cole v. Peake, </em>No. 00-11394 (Bd.Vet.App. Jan. 19, 2006). Specifically, the Board found significant the VA medical examiner\u2019s opinion, which included a thorough review of the claims file and the medical literature about the relationship between PTSD and hypertension. In contrast, the Board found the articles Mr. Cole submitted to be of little probative value because they did not address his own specific medical history. Rather, the articles generally discussed the possibility of a relationship between heart and psychiatric disabilities. Moreover, the Board noted that \u201cnone of the doctors who have seen or treated [him] for either hypertension or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>PTSD have opined or insinuated that there is some type of relationship between the two disorders.\u201d <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Mr. Cole appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the Veterans Court, arguing that the Board erred by not ensuring that the VA complied with the duty to assist, 88 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A (2000).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, he contended that the VA medical examiner\u2019s opinion was inadequate under \u00a7 5103A and, thus, because the Board relied on that medical opinion, it erred in denying his claim. On March 10, 2008, the Veterans Court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. The Veterans Court ruled that, because the VA medical examiner\u2019s opinion contained a comprehensive review of Mr. Cole\u2019s medical history as well as the relevant medical literature, it was adequate for ratings purposes and therefore the Board did not err in relying on it. The Veterans Court also noted that the Board adequately explained why it found the 2004 VA medical examiner\u2019s opinion more probative than the articles submitted by Mr. Cole. In particular, according to the Veterans Court, the Board adequately explained that, because the general Internet and treatise material did not address Mr. Cole\u2019s own medical history and records, they were of limited probative value. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Our authority to review decisions of the Veterans Court is governed by statute. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(c) (2002), we have \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to review and decide any challenge to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof brought under [that] section, and to interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, to the extent presented and necessary to a decision.\u201d However, \u201c[except to the extent that an appeal under ... chapter [72] presents a constitutional issue, [we] may not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">Mr. Cole argues on appeal, as he did before the Veterans Court, that the 2004 VA medical examiner\u2019s opinion was conclusory and was not supported by \u201cfactual predicate in the record\u201d or clinical data. Thus, Mr. Cole argues that, in denying his appeal, the Veterans Court interpreted \u00a7 5103A and erroneously held that the duty to assist could be satisfied by a conclusory medical opinion without factual support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-14\">Because Mr. Cole challenges a factual determination, or at most the application of law to the facts, we hold that we lack jurisdiction over his appeal. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). Mr. Cole attempts to frame <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>the issue on appeal as involving either a legal determination or a statutory interpretation. However, the Veterans Court did not interpret \u00a7 5103A or hold that the duty to assist could be satisfied merely by a conclusory medical opinion unsupported by record facts. Rather, the Veterans Court reviewed the facts supporting that the VA medical examiner\u2019s opinion and found that it was adequate for ratings purposes. Importantly, the Veterans Court considered that the VA examiner had comprehensively reviewed Mr. Cole\u2019s two-volume claims file, including his medical history, relevant medical literature, and even his submitted articles suggesting that there was service connection. It then explained why the Board properly found the medical opinion more probative than Mr. Cole\u2019s submitted Internet and treatise materials \u2014 namely, in contrast to the VA medical examiner\u2019s opinion, his submitted materials were not based on his own medical conditions or history. Thus, regardless of how Mr. Cole characterizes his claim, the Veterans Court\u2019s determinations plainly do not involve interpretation of \u00a7 5103A. Instead, Mr. Cole\u2019s contentions \u2014 that the VA medical examiner\u2019s opinion is \u201cconclusory\u201d and is \u201cwithout a factual predicate\u201d \u2014 clearly attack the factual sufficiency of the evidence relied upon in denying his service connection claim. The contentions therefore are outside of this court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2); <em>Emenaker v. Peake, </em>No.2008-7051, 2008 WL 5412465, *6 (Fed.Cir. Dec. 31, 2008); <em>Waltzer v. Nicholson, </em>447 F.3d 1378, 1380 (Fed.Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we must dismiss Mr. Cole\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-20\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-8\">.
