Rakoff, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b491-6\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Defendants-appellants Nana Sarpong and Attah Evans Kawesi appeal judgments of conviction entered, respectively, on March 13, 2007 and September 4, 2007, following their pleas of guilty to offenses arising from their participation in interrelated heroin conspiracies. The District Court sentenced Sarpong principally to a 292-month term of imprisonment and Kawesi principally to a 262-month term of imprisonment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Sarpong argues that his sentence should be vacated because the District Court erroneously applied sentencing enhancements for (1) his role in the offense, as authorized by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, and (2) obstruction of justice, as authorized by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. We see no basis to disturb the District Court\u2019s determination that these enhancements were warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">First, the enhancement arising from Sarpong\u2019s leadership role in the conspiracy is amply supported by evidence showing that Sarpong (1) recruited and directed several drug couriers, J.A. 37; and (2) instructed his co-conspirators to (i) pick-up drug couriers at airports, Tr. 223-24, (ii) distribute heroin, <em>id. </em>at. 230-31, and (iii) collect narcotics proceeds, <em>id. </em>at 227. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Paccione, </em>202 F.3d 622, 624 (2d Cir.2000) (not clear error to impose leadership enhancement on defendants who \u201cplayed a crucial role in the planning, coordination, and implementation of a criminal scheme\u201d). It is further supported by the factual finding of the District Court that Sarpong moved to the United States in order to \u201cfacilitate ... his leadership function in the enterprise.\u201d J.A. 38. Accordingly, we reject Sarpong\u2019s challenge to the District Court\u2019s application, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, of an enhancement for his leadership role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">Second, the District Court\u2019s application of an enhancement for obstruction of justice also finds adequate support in the record. Even if we were to agree with Sarpong\u2019s argument that it was clearly erroneous for the District Court to construe as a threat Sarpong\u2019s statement that witnesses for the government \u201cwill not have legs to stand on,\u201d we would still reject his challenge because record evidence showed that Sarpong attempted to bribe a witness. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2 cmt. n. 5 (\u201cIf ... [a] bribe was given for the purpose of hampering a criminal investigation into the offense, it would constitute obstruction ... under \u00a7 3C1.1.... \u201d). A witness testified that Sarpong promised him that, in return for the witness\u2019s silence, Sarpong would help him and his wife obtain British visas. Tr. 270. The District Court credited this testimony, and we see no basis to question that determination. Accordingly, the District Court did not err in sentencing Sarpong by applying the obstruction of justice enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">Kawesi contends that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the District Court did not make an explicit finding that Kawesi had breached his plea agreement with the government. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>this objection was not raised in the District Court, we review it for plain error, <em>United States v. Espinoza, </em>514 F.3d 209, 212 (2d Cir.2008), and we find none. Under the plea agreement, the government could \u201cseek denial of the adjustment for acceptance of responsibility\u201d and the \u201cimposition of an adjustment for obstruction of justice\u201d if \u201cthe defendant ... engaged in conduct, unknown to the [government at the time of the signing of this Agreement, that constitutes obstruction of justice.\u201d Kawesi App. 13. The District Court found that Kawesi obstructed justice and that a \u201csignificant portion of the obstructive conduct ... occurred after the plea agreement was entered into.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116. Pursuant to the plea agreement, therefore, the government was permitted to urge the imposition of an obstruction of justice enhancement and the denial of an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. The District Court thus had no obligation to determine whether Kawesi had breached the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Having considered all of appellants\u2019 arguments on appeal, and concluded that they are all without merit, we AFFIRM the judgments of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
