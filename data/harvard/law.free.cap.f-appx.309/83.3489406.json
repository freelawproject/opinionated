The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> calculated an advisory Guidelines range of 108-135 months; granted the government\u2019s motion under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and reduced Rosario\u2019s total offense level by 2, making his Guidelines range 87-108 months; and sentenced Rosario to 96 months in prison and 5 years of supervised release. On appeal, Rosario\u2019s counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), seeking to withdraw and arguing that Rosario should not have been assessed a sentencing enhancement for reckless conduct in the course of fleeing, and that Rosario\u2019s sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">We conclude that Rosario waived any challenge to the Guidelines calculations when he withdrew his objections to the presentence report at the sentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>289 F.3d 524, 526-27 (8th Cir.2002) (declining to review findings related to sentencing enhancement, even for plain error, where defendant\u2019s counsel withdrew objections at sentencing). We also conclude that Rosario\u2019s sentence is not unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States</em>, \u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (appellate court must review sentence under abuse-of-discretion standard whether sentence imposed is inside or outside Guidelines range); <em>United States v. Watson, </em>480 F.3d 1175, 1177 (8th Cir.) (listing circumstances where sentencing court abuses its discretion, resulting in unreasonable sentence), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 305, 169 L.Ed.2d 219 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Berni, </em>439 F.3d 990, 992-93 (8th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (concluding that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 departure does not shield overall sentence from reasonableness review under advisory Guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-16\">Finally, after reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel leave to withdraw, and we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-10\">.
