Counsel has moved to withdraw and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he argues that Tallon\u2019s sentence is unreasonable. In a pro se supplemental brief, Tall\u00f3n complains that counsel failed to inform him that his acquiescence to a bank teller\u2019s description of Tallon\u2019s conduct during the robbery would negatively impact his offense level in the form of dangerous-weapon and physical-restraint enhancements. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-25\">Tallon\u2019s sentence, which was within the advisory Guidelines range, is not unreasonable. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Lincoln, </em>413 F.3d 716, 717-18 (8th Cir.2005). The district court expressly considered relevant factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and nothing in the record suggests that the court misapplied those factors. <em>See United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1004 (8th Cir.2005). Tallon\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not properly raised in this direct criminal appeal. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>330 F.3d 1068, 1069 (8th Cir. 2003). To the extent Tall\u00f3n challenges the district court\u2019s reliance on the teller\u2019s version of the robbery, as detailed in the presentence investigation report, to support the sentencing enhancements, the district court was entitled to rely on those facts because Tallon withdrew his objections to the teller\u2019s version of events and to the related specific offense characteristics. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>289 F.3d 524, 526-27 (8th Cir.2002) (declining to review findings related to sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>enhancement, even for plain error, where defendant\u2019s counsel withdrew objections at sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Finally, after reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we conclude there are no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-23\">. The Honorable John A. Jarvey, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
