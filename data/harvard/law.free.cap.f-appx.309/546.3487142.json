(\u201cSpencer Bank\u201d) appeals the decision of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey granting appellees Lawrence B. Seidman (\u201cSeidman\u201d), Seidman &amp; Associates, LLC, Veteri Place Corporation, and Menlo Acquisition Corporation\u2019s (collectively \u201cAppellees\u201d) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The District Court determined that there was no private right of action under the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1467a (\u201cSLHCA\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-15\">BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b573-16\">Spencer Bank, a state-chartered mutual savings and loan association, alleges that Seidman, a private investor and one of Spencer Bank\u2019s depositors, along with the other Appellees and their interested associates, have repeatedly engaged in unlawful activity by targeting and acquiring ownership in certain savings institutions in order to gain control of the board of directors and force the sale of the institutions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to Spencer Bank, Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>lees and their associates were one of the largest holders of the voting shares for the targeted institutions, and sixteen of the seventeen acquired savings institutions merged or were acquired by another institution within two years of Appellees\u2019 involvement, with Appellees gaming significant profits as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Spencer Bank alleges that Appellees are now trying to gain control through placement of Seidman or his associates on the board of directors of Spencer Bank. Specifically, Spencer Bank alleges that Appellees have engaged in the following tactics: (1) opened deposit accounts to increase voting rights; (2) placed mail and phone complaints to Spencer Bank\u2019s president and CEO concerning recent business decisions; (3) mailed a letter to the CEO nominating Seidman and other associates to the board and requesting a list of depositor members and a letter to depositor members condemning the board and seeking the nomination of Seidman and his associates; (4) engaged in proxy solicitation outside one of Spencer Bank\u2019s branches; and (5) filed a lawsuit against Spencer Bank and the board alleging breaches of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Spencer Bank filed a complaint in March 2007, alleging that Appellees\u2019 attempts to control Spencer Bank violated the SLHCA. Spencer Bank sought an injunction or other equitable remedies to prevent Appellees from acquiring control in violation of \u00a7 1467a(h)(l), as well as other statutory damages under the SLHCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Appellees filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in April 2007, alleging that there was no private right of action under \u00a7 1467a(h)(l) and that the complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to state a claim under the SLHCA. In an opinion and order entered January 4, 2008, the District Court granted Appellees\u2019 motion, finding that \u00a7 1467a(h)(l) does not provide for a private right of action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Spencer Bank now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review <em>de novo </em>the District Court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim. <em>Three Rivers Ctr. for Indep. Living, Inc. v. Hous. Auth. of Pittsburgh, </em>382 F.3d 412, 419 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">Spencer Bank concedes that no express private right of action exists under the terms of the SLHCA, but alleges that a private right of action can be implied from the SLHCA. Private rights of action may be implied in statutes that \u201cdo not contain provisions addressing either whether private parties may maintain a right of action or the scope of a right of action a private party may maintain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">Whether an implied private right of action exists under a statute is a question of congressional intent, <em>Alexander v. Sandoval, </em>532 U.S. 275, 286, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001), and may be implied by a court only when \u201cit can <em>confidently conclude </em>Congress so intended,\u201d <em>Am. Trucking Ass\u2019ns v. Del. River Joint Toll Bridge Comm\u2019n, </em>458 F.3d 291, 303 (3d Cir.2006) (internal quotation and citation omitted). We have held that in order \u201cfor an implied right of action to exist, a statute must manifest Congress\u2019s intent to create (1) a personal right, and (2) a private remedy.\u201d <em>Three Rivers, </em>382 F.3d at 421 (citing <em>Sandoval, </em>532 U.S. at 286, 121 S.Ct. 1511).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>A. There is no indication of legislative intent to create a federal right for mutual associations under \u00a7 1467a</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Section 1467a(h)(l) makes it unlawful for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">any savings and loan holding company or subsidiary thereof, or any director, officer, employee, or person owning, controlling, or holding with power to vote, or holding proxies representing, more than 25 percent of the voting shares, of such holding company or subsidiary, to hold, solicit, or exercise any proxies in respect of any voting rights in a savings association which is a mutual association!;.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1467a(h)(l) (2006). The District Court determined that while \u201c\u00a7 1467a(h)(l) benefits savings associations which are mutual associations,\u201d ultimately \u201cthe direct, unmistakable focus of \u00a7 1467a(h)(l) is upon savings and loan holding companies, <em>not </em>... mutual associations.\u201d (J.A. 12.) The District Court held, therefore, that \u201c[t]he statute provides no indication that Congress intended to confer a federal right upon Plaintiff.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">The first inquiry is into legislative intent, that is \u201c \u2018[t]he question is not simply who would benefit from the Act, but whether Congress intended to confer federal rights upon those beneficiaries.\u2019 \u201d <em>Am. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, </em>458 F.3d at 297 (quoting <em>California v. Sierra Club, </em>451 U.S. 287, 294, 101 S.Ct. 1775, 68 L.Ed.2d 101 (1981)). In examining whether \u00a7 1467a(h)(l) creates a federal right in favor of mutual associations, we \u201creview[ ] the \u2018text and structure\u2019 of the statute to determine whether the statute contained \u2018rights-creating\u2019 language that focuses on the \u2018individual protected\u2019 rather than \u2018the person regulated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wisniewski v. Rodale, Inc., </em>510 F.3d 294, 301-02 (3d Cir.2007) (citing <em>Sandoval, </em>532 U.S. at 288-89, 121 S.Ct. 1511). When \u201cright-or duty-creating language\u201d is not explicitly included in a statute, a court will rarely imply congressional intent to create a private right of action. <em>Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, </em>536 U.S. 273, 284 n. 3, 122 S.Ct. 2268, 153 L.Ed.2d 309 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">Section 1467a(h)(l) does not include rights-creating language that focuses on mutual associations. Rather, the focus of the provision is on the regulation of savings and loan holding companies, and while this may incidentally affect savings associations which are mutual associations, it does not necessarily follow that the SLHCA was enacted for the \u201cespecial benefit\u201d of mutual associations. \u201cStatutes that focus on the person regulated rather than the individuals protected create \u2018no implication of an intent to confer rights on a particular class of persons.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sandoval, </em>532 U.S. at 289, 121 S.Ct. 1511 (quoting <em>Sierra Club, </em>451 U.S. at 294, 101 S.Ct. 1775). We find no indication that Congress intended to provide a federal right under \u00a7 1467a(h)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">B. There is no indication of legislative intent to create a private remedy under \u00a7 1467a</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">Appellees argue that the administrative enforcement scheme of the SLHCA demonstrates that Congress intended to entrust the Office of Thrift Supervision (\u201cOTS\u201d) with the sole power to enforce the Act. Spencer Bank maintains that implying a private right of action would not be inconsistent with the agency\u2019s enforcement of the Act. We agree with the District Court, which concluded that the text and legislative history of the statute reveal no congressional intent to create a private remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-14\">The OTS is the administrative agency charged with ensuring compliance with the SLHCA. The director of the agency is authorized to issue regulations and orders, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>conduct formal investigations to determine compliance, bring an action seeking an injunction, decree, restraining order, order of divestiture, or other appropriate orders to enjoin violations, and issue cease and desist orders after due notice and the opportunity for hearing. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1467a(g). The Act further provides for criminal and civil penalties for violations. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1467a(i). The existence of this comprehensive regulatory scheme indicates a congressional intent to place enforcement of the Act solely in the hands of the OTS, rather than a private party.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">As the relevant legislative history has been thoroughly explained by the District Court, we repeat here only the latest iteration of congressional intent. Although derived from earlier statutes, the current SLHCA was enacted as part of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (\u201cFIRREA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 101-73, \u00a7 301, 103 Stat. 183, 277-343. FIRREA repealed Title 4 of the National Housing Act in part, and the remaining sections of Title 4 were transferred to other statutes. \u00a7 407,103 Stat. at 363. FIRREA was enacted in part \u201cto enhance the regulatory and enforcement powers of Federal financial institutions regulatory agencies,\u201d 103 Stat. at 183, and established the OTS as the entity responsible for supervising and regulating savings institution holding companies, <em>see </em>\u00a7 201(b), 103 Stat. at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Spencer Bank further alleges, however, that because disclosure and reporting requirements relating to the acquisition of proxies by the holding company is not required, mutual associations cannot solely rely on the OTS to receive this critical information and enforce compliance. Spencer Bank contends that bank privacy restrictions placed on mutual associations provide that \u201cno Government authority may have access to or obtain copies of, or the information contained in the financial records of any customer from a financial institution\u201d and therefore mutual associations are prevented from being able to reveal this critical information to the OTS. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3402.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Spencer Bank\u2019s argument is unpersuasive, however, as the statute provides exceptions to this prohibition, a number of which are applicable here. Section 3413(b) expressly states that the statute \u201cshall not apply to the examination by or disclosure to any supervisory agency of financial records or information in the exercise of its supervisory, regulatory, or monetary functions.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3413(b). The statute further provides that a financial institution and its officers, employees, or agents are not precluded from notifying the government concerning \u201cinformation which may be relevant to a possible violation of any statute or regulation\u201d and that the institution or person will not be liable to the customer for such disclosure. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3403(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, Spencer Bank\u2019s assertion that the regulation by the OTS of mutual associations is impossible absent an implied private right of action is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">There is no indication that Congress intended to create a private remedy, but rather, the text and legislative history of the SLHCA indicate an intent to provide a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>framework for the regulation of savings and loan holding companies to be enforced by the OTS. Consequently, as congressional intent to create a personal right and a private remedy has not been established, we find no implied right of action for mutual associations under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1467a.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-10\">. Spencer Bank alleges that Appellees engaged in \u201cwolf-pack\u201d tactics, threatened and engaged in proxy contests, initiated lawsuits, forced \"greenmail,\u201d and induced tender offers to influence the boards of directors of the savings institutions into merging with or being acquired by another institution. Spencer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Bank further contends that Appellees engaged in publicity campaigns in furtherance of these schemes, including letter writing, phone calls, and public securities filings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b574-14\">. The District Court made no findings on Appellees\u2019 additional arguments and declined to consider Spencer Bank\u2019s request for equitable relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b576-6\">. \"Financial institutions\" include \"any office of a bank, savings bank ... [or] savings association,\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401(1); a \"financial record\u201d is defined as \"an original of, a copy of, or information known to have been derived from, any record held by a financial institution pertaining to a customer\u2019s relationship with the financial institution,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3401(2); \u201ccustomer\u201d includes \u201cany person or authorized representative of that person who utilized or is utilizing any service of a financial institution,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3401(5); and \"supervisory agency\u201d explicitly includes \"Director, Office of Thrift Supervision,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3401(7)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b577-26\">. As the text and legislative history of the SLHCA reveal that Congress intended to provide for the enforcement of the SLHCA through the OTS, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in declining to exercise its powers of equitable relief, as requested by Spencer Bank. <em>See Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n v. Am. Metals Exch. Corp., </em>991 F.2d 71, 76 (3d Cir.1993) (reviewing a district court's exercise of its equitable power for abuse of discretion).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
