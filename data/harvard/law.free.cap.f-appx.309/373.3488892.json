He filed a motion to suppress cocaine and cash seized by law enforcement from the car in which he was a passenger. The district court denied the motion to suppress, finding there was probable cause to stop and search the car. On appeal, Nelson argues the court erred in denying the motion to suppress because the Government failed to establish the reliability of the drug-sniffing dog used by the officers who stopped and searched the car. He contends the dog lacked proper certification and training and law enforcement\u2019s handling of the dog was flawed. Thus, he asserts, the officers lacked probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-15\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress under a mixed standard of review, reviewing the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and the district court\u2019s application of law to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Ramirez, </em>476 F.3d 1231, 1235 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2924, 168 L.Ed.2d 253 (2007). The district court\u2019s factual findings are construed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>459 F.3d 1276, 1290 (11th Cir.2006). Additionally, the district court\u2019s credibility determinations are given great deference by this Court. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>376 F.3d 1296, 1302 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-18\">The Fourth Amendment provides \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. It additionally provides \u201cno <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court has held a canine sniff of luggage in a public place by a \u201cwell-trained narcotics detection dog\u201d is not considered a \u201csearch\u201d under the Fourth Amendment. <em>United States v. Place, </em>462 U.S. 696, 103 S.Ct. 2637, 2644-45, 77 L.Ed.2d 110 (1983). Because an individual\u2019s privacy interest in a car on a public road is reduced, the use of drug-sniffing dogs on the exterior of a car also is not a search. <em>Merrett v. Moore, </em>58 F.3d 1547, 1553 n. 11 (11th Cir.1995). A warrantless search and seizure of a car is permissible when the police have probable cause to believe the car contains contraband. <em>United States v. Virden, </em>488 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2007). In the case of dog sniffs, \u201cprobable cause arises when a drug-trained canine alerts to drugs.\u201d <em>United States v. Banks, </em>3 F.3d 399, 402 (11th Cir.1993) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">A dog sniff must be sufficiently reliable in order to establish probable cause, and this reliability is generally present if the dog is \u201cwell-trained.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Caballes, </em>543 U.S. 405, 125 S.Ct. 834, 838, 160 L.Ed.2d 842 (2005); <em>United States v. Sentovich, </em>677 F.2d 834, 838 n. 8 (11th Cir. 1982). Evidence of a dog\u2019s training is sufficient proof of reliability. <em>Sentovich, </em>677 F.2d at 838 n. 8. In <em>Sentovich, </em>we rejected the appellant\u2019s argument that \u201ca mere statement that the dog had been trained in drug detection was not enough without an accompanying statement that the dog had proved reliable in the past and that an experienced handler was with the dog,\u201d and approved the reasoning of the First and Tenth Circuits that evidence of a dog\u2019s training is sufficient. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">In this case, the evidence regarding the dog\u2019s training went beyond a \u201cmere statement\u201d and included certification from a training school, an officer\u2019s testimony about subsequent training and his records of the dog\u2019s performance, and the testimony of the officer that he was familiar with the dog\u2019s reactions because of their prior training together. <em>See Sentovich, </em>677 F.2d at 838 n. 8. The district court found the officer\u2019s testimony and records about his training credible, and this Court gives great deference to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>Clay, </em>376 F.3d at 1302. Based on the evidence presented during the hearing, the district court did not err when it denied Nelson\u2019s motion to suppress on the ground the dog was reliable and its response provided the officers with probable cause to search the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Turning to Nelson\u2019s argument that the officer\u2019s handling of the dog was flawed, the district court did not err when it accepted the officer\u2019s testimony that the dog\u2019s change in breathing and body posture indicated the presence of narcotics. The officer testified he had received more than 200 hours of training with drug-sniffing dogs, had been working with the dog in the instant case for nearly a month, and had been a canine handler for five years. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, <em>Smith, </em>459 F.3d at 1290, and considering the great deference this Court gives to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations, <em>Clay, </em>376 F.3d at 1302, it was not erroneous for the district court to conclude the officer\u2019s testimony about drug-dog handling and the dog\u2019s indications was credible, based on his experience with this and other drug-sniffing dogs.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government and considering our previous decision that evidence of a dog\u2019s training is sufficient proof of reliability, the district court did not err in the present case in concluding the testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>an officer about his dog\u2019s training, certification, and performance was sufficient proof of the dog\u2019s reliability. Thus, because the officers had probable cause to search the car based on the response of a trained drug-sniffing dog, suppression of the evidence was unwarranted. Based upon the foregoing, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
