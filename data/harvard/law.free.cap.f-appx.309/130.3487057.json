We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Singhr-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1149 (9th Cir.1999), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding because Fu did not explain adequately why she omitted from her declaration that she was deprived of food and water during her claimed three-day detention, Fu did not explain adequately the religious terms in her asylum declaration, and Fu\u2019s testimony lacked sufficient detail about how and why she was apprehended for practicing Xiang Gong in her home and why she fears future religious persecution. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962-64 (9th Cir.2004). Thus, Fu\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-14\">Because Fu failed to demonstrate eligibility for asylum, it follows that she did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-15\">Because Fu\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony the IJ found to be not credible, and Fu points to no other evidence the IJ should have considered, she has failed to establish eligibility for CAT relief. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b157-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
