The Petitioners also seek review of the BIA\u2019s May 6, 2008, order denying their motion for reconsideration of the BIA\u2019s removal order. As to our review of the removal order, the Government asserts we lack jurisdiction because the petition for review is untimely as to that order. As to the denial of the motion for reconsideration, the Petitioners argue that the BIA failed to address the errors of fact and law they pointed out in their motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-12\">\u201cWe review questions of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.\u201d Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir. 2002). While we generally have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal, the petition for review must be filed within 30 days of the date of the final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1). \u201cSince the statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)). A motion to reconsider filed with the BIA does not suspend the finality of the underlying BIA order and does not toll the review period. <em>Stone, </em>115 S.Ct. at 1549 (construing the former 90-day period for filing a petition for review under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">The final order of removal in this case was issued on March 17, 2008. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(a) (providing \u201c[a]n order of removal made by the immigration judge at the conclusion of proceedings under section 240 of the Act shall become final ... [u]pon dismissal of an appeal by the Board of Immigration Appeals\u201d). Although the Petitioners filed a timely motion to reconsider the BIA\u2019s dismissal of their appeal on April 10, 2008, the filing did not toll the limitations period for filing a petition for review in this Court. <em>See Dakane, </em>399 F.3d at 1272 n. 3; <em>Stone, </em>115 S.Ct. at 1549. Because the Petitioners did not file their petition for review until May 29, 2008, more than 30 days after the BIA\u2019s initial order dated March 17, 2008, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the March 17, 2008, order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review to the extent the Petitioners are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>seeking review of the BIA\u2019s final removal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Calle v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007). We have recognized the BIA\u2019s \u201cdiscretion is very broad.\u201d <em>Scheerer v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir.) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 146, 172 L.Ed.2d 40 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">\u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C). A motion to reconsider that merely restates the arguments the BIA previously rejected provides no reason for the BIA to change its prior decision. <em>Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1329. \u201cTherefore, merely reiterating arguments previously presented to the BIA does not constitute \u2018specifying ... errors of fact or law' as required for a successful motion to reconsider.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in not addressing the errors of law the Petitioners assert because the BIA did not make an error of law. As for any errors of fact, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider because the BIA acknowledged the evidence the Petitioners claimed was ignored and the remainder of the Petitioners\u2019 arguments were reiterations of previous arguments. Accordingly, we deny the petition as to the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
