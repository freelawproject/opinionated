He was sentenced to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release, and he now appeals. We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">In January 2006, government agents received information that Serino was attempting to sell stolen traveler\u2019s checks. A confidential informant then contacted Serino in order to purchase the checks. According to the informant, Serino possessed $885,000 in stolen traveler\u2019s checks that he offered to sell for 20 percent of their face value. The two agreed to a transaction and scheduled a meeting at which government agents conducted surveillance. They observed Serino sell the informant $10,000 worth of stolen checks for $2,500 in cash. Approximately two weeks later, the informant again met with Serino and attempted to negotiate the purchase of the remaining checks. During this meeting, Serino indicated that there were approximately $880,000 worth of traveler\u2019s checks available for sale. Authorities ultimately recovered $378,500 worth of stolen traveler\u2019s checks from other individuals involved in the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Serino\u2019s advisory Guidelines sentencing range was calculated at 18-24 months, based on a criminal history category of I and an offense level of 15. He was sentenced to an 18-month term of imprisonment \u2014 the bottom end of the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">Serino challenges his sentence on three grounds. First, he challenges the district court\u2019s calculation of \u201closs\u201d under U.S.S.G \u00a7 2B1.1. Second, he argues that the district court failed properly to consider the mitigating facts and arguments, as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Finally, Serino contends that the district court did not adequately state its reasons for the sentence, as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-3\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">We review the factual determinations underlying a district court\u2019s loss calculation for clear error. <em>United States v. Himler, </em>355 F.3d 735, 740 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, \u201closs\u201d is a specific offense characteristic and is defined as \u201cthe greater of actual loss or intended loss.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. 3(A). The comments define \u201cintended loss,\u201d the relevant form of loss in this case, as \u201cthe pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at cmt. 3(A)(ii). Further, under the Guidelines, the defendant is responsible for:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-12\">(1)(A) all acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-13\">(B) in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity (a criminal plan, scheme, endeavor, or enterprise <em>undertaken by the defendant in concert with others, whether or not charged as a conspiracy), </em>all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-14\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-15\">Serino argues that the district court improperly linked him to the $378,500 of traveler\u2019s checks recovered from others, contending that the loss chargeable to him should be limited to the value of the checks he transferred to the informant. According to Serino, the recorded conversation between him and the informant does not support the conclusion that he possessed the checks. He argues that the conversation proves only that \u201che knew of these remaining checks and [in] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>whose possession they remained.\u201d This evidence, however, is sufficient to link Serino to the remaining traveler\u2019s checks on the basis of a jointly undertaken criminal activity. In other words, the evidence supports an inference that Serino was a member of a jointly undertaken criminal activity, and thus was responsible for the remaining traveler\u2019s checks under \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). The district court\u2019s loss calculation findings, therefore, were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Serino also argues that the face value of the outstanding traveler\u2019s checks should not have been charged to him as loss, citing <em>United States v. Geevers, </em>226 F.3d 186, 194 (3d Cir.2000), in support. <em>Geevers </em>holds, however, that a district court may consider the face value of a check as part of a reasonable estimate of the intended loss. <em>Id. </em>Here, unlike in <em>Geevers, </em>there is little doubt that Serino intended and realized that the traveler\u2019s checks would be redeemed for their full face value. The district court thus did not clearly err in basing its intended loss determination on the face value of the traveler\u2019s checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">We review sentencing decisions for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cAn abuse of discretion is a clear error of judgment, and not simply a different result which can arguably be obtained when applying the law to the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Tracinda Corp. v. DaimlerChrysler AG, </em>502 F.3d 212, 240 (3d Cir.2007) (quoting <em>SEC v. Infinity Group Co., </em>212 F.3d 180, 195 (3d Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Serino argues that the district court erred because it did not adequately consider mitigating factors such as health, general good character, and family responsibilities. \u201cTo determine if the court acted reasonably in imposing the resulting sentence, we must first be satisfied the court exercised its discretion by considering the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Sevilla, </em>541 F.3d 226, 231-32 (3d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 329 (3d Cir.2006)). The record indicates, however, that the district court adequately considered Serino\u2019s mitigating arguments. The district judge heard all the arguments presented by Serino and clearly indicated during the sentencing hearing that he took them into consideration. Because we conclude that the district court adequately considered the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), we further conclude that Serino\u2019s sentence \u2014 at the bottom of the Guidelines range \u2014 was reasonable and not an abuse of discretion. <em>See also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (noting that a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range will probably be reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-12\">The final argument raised by Serino is that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed adequately to state its reasons for imposition of the sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c). In <em>Rita, </em>the Supreme Court explained that a district court need not always explain in detail its reasoning in imposing a sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar1\">[W]e cannot read the statute (or our precedent) as insisting upon a full opinion in every case. The appropriateness of brevity or length, conciseness or detail, when to write, what to say, depends upon circumstances. Sometimes a judicial opinion responds to every argument; sometimes it does not; sometimes a judge simply writes the word \u201cgranted,\u201d or \u201cdenied\u201d on the face of a motion while relying upon context and the parties\u2019 prior arguments to make the reasons clear. The law leaves much, in this re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>spect, to the judge\u2019s own professional judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">127 S.Ct. at 2468. What the Court stated in <em>Rita </em>applies equally to this case: \u201cIn our view, given the straightforward, conceptually simple arguments before the judge, the judge\u2019s statement of reasons here, though brief, was legally sufficient.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment and sentence will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
