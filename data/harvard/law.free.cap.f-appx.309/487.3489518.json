We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-16\">Lynch contends that the district court wrongly concluded that his plea was knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Renaud, </em>999 F.2d 622, 624 (2d Cir.1993) (noting that, to be valid, a guilty plea must be a \u201cvoluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). During the allocution, Lynch swore that he had received a copy of the superceding indictment, reviewed it with his lawyer, was satisfied with his lawyer\u2019s representation, understood the potential penalties and other consequences of pleading guilty, and was not under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or medicine. Lynch also denied that he had received any promise or assurance that was not contained in the plea agreement, or that anyone had forced or attempted to force him to plead guilty. Although Lynch\u2019s counsel intervened in the allocution several times, and after the interruptions Lynch altered some of his previous responses, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>the district court found, there is nothing in the record to indicate that counsel \u201cwas advising or coercing [Lynch] to be anything but truthful.\u201d Lynch\u2019s open court declarations \u201ccarry a strong presumption of verity,\u201d <em>United States v. Maher, </em>108 F.3d 1513, 1530 (2d Cir.1997) (citation omitted), and Lynch does not show that his plea was \u201cthe product of actual or threatened physical harm, mental coercion ... or [Lynch\u2019s] sheer inability to weigh his options rationally.\u201d <em>Miller v. Angliker, </em>848 F.2d 1312, 1320 (2d Cir.1988) The district court was thus not in error to deem the plea knowing and voluntary. <em>See Harris v. United States, </em>367 F.3d 74, 79 (2d Cir.2004) (stating that \u00a7 2255 appeals require us to review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Lynch also argues that the district court abused its discretion in finding the plea supported by a sufficient factual basis. <em>See United States v. DeJesus-Abad, </em>263 F.3d 5, 9 (2d Cir.2001) (\u201cWe review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s finding that the record furnishes a factual basis sufficient to support the plea.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Lynch, however, stated during the hearing that he intended to \u201cgive away some\u201d of the twenty-two bags of crack cocaine. This statement satisfied the distribution element Lynch claims was unsupported under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812, 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(c). Moreover, assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Lynch\u2019s statements that he \u201ccould search and find\u201d and \u201ccould have taken\u201d the firearm in his cousin\u2019s apartment \u201cif he wanted to\u201d did not satisfy the constructive possession element of intent required under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), (k), (g)(5) and 924(e), the court was free to \u201crely on any facts at its disposal \u2014 not just the admissions of the defendant.\u201d <em>Maher, </em>108 F.3d at 1524-25 (quoting <em>Irizarry v. United States, </em>508 F.2d 960, 967 (2d Cir. 1974)). Here, the district court could have additionally relied on the government\u2019s evidence of Lynch\u2019s own statements \u201cadmitting that the firearm belonged to him and that he possessed it in connection with his drug dealing activities.\u201d The court could have also considered Lynch\u2019s signed plea agreement, which acknowledged his guilt and contained a four-level enhancement related to Lynch\u2019s possession of a firearm. The district court\u2019s conclusion that the plea was supported by a sufficient factual basis was thus not outside \u201cthe range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>Zervos v. Verizon New York, Inc., </em>252 F.3d 163, 169 (2d Cir.2001) (discussing the abuse of discretion standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing. <em>See United States v. Amico, </em>486 F.3d 764, 779 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201cA determination not to hold an evidentiary hearing is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d). Though Lynch now argues that his plea was based on \u201cfacts fabricated by his counsel which he mimicked to the [c]ourt,\u201d he is required to \u201cpresent some significant questions concerning the ... validity of the plea to justify an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>970 F.2d 1095, 1100 (2d Cir.1992). Lynch presents no such questions, and \u201c[n]o hearing need be granted when the allegations ... merely contradict the record ... or are simply conclusory.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the Order of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
