Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court, rather than the jury, made the factual finding regarding the amount of loss.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, contrary to his assertion, \u201cdistrict courts are free to make factual determinations not made by the jury and may base their ultimate decisions regarding the length of a convicted criminal\u2019s sentence on those determinations.\u201d <em>United States v. Staten, </em>466 F.3d 708, 719 (9th Cir.2006). The record provides sufficient evidence to support the trial judge\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Bond also argues that the district court erred in requiring him to pay restitution due to his financial condition. Under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (\u201cMVRA\u201d), imposition of restitution is mandatory, \u201cwithout regard to a defendant\u2019s economic situation.\u201d <em>United States v. Dubose, </em>146 F.3d 1141, 1143 (9th Cir. 1998); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(1)(A). The case relied on by Bond stating the contrary, <em>United States v. Ramilo, </em>986 F.2d 333 (9th Cir.1993), was decided prior to the MVRA\u2019s passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b231-33\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>by 9th Cir.
