R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Petitioner-Appellant Jon Harold Royal, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He challenges the Bureau of Prison\u2019s (\u201cBOP\u201d) determination that he is ineligible for early release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B). We take jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Mr. Royal is currently serving a thirty-year sentence for conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and 846. <em>See United States v. Royal, </em>972 F.2d 643 (5th Cir.1992). His sentence includes a two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm during his commission of the offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>U.S. S.G. \u00a7 201.1(b)(1). From 1993 to 1994, while Mr. Royal was incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution (\u201cFCI\u201d) in Terre Haute, Indiana, he successfully completed the BOP\u2019s 500-hour Residential Drag Abuse Treatment Program (\u201cRDAP\u201d). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e), the BOP has discretion to release inmates \u201cconvicted of a nonviolent offense\u201d up to one year early upon their successful completion of the RDAP.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B). However, \u00a7 3621(e) does not define \u201ca nonviolent offense,\u201d nor does it establish any additional criteria for determining an inmate\u2019s eligibility for a reduced sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">To implement \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B), the BOP published a regulation in June 1995. The regulation provided, in relevant part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-15\">An inmate who completes a residential drug abuse treatment program during his or her current commitment may be eligible for early release by a period not to exceed 12 months, ... unless the inmate\u2019s current offense is determined to be a crime of violence as defined in 18 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 924(c)(3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-16\">28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.58. In July 1995, the BOP issued a Program Statement to explain its interpretation of the term \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Bureau of Prisons Program Statement No. 5162.02 (July 24, 1995). The Program Statement identified 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) as an offense constituting a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d if the offender received a two-level sentence enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 for possessing a deadly weapon during the commission of the offense. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 9. Prison officials therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>determined Mr. Royal had committed a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d and was ineligible for early release consideration, even though he had completed the RDAP.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Following the publication of Program Statement 5162.02, federal courts of appeals divided over the validity of the BOP\u2019s definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d to include drug offenses involving a sentence enhancement for possession of a deadly weapon. <em>See, e.g., Martin v. Gerlinski, </em>133 F.3d 1076, 1079 (8th Cir.1998); <em>Byrd v. Hasty, </em>142 F.3d 1395, 1398 (11th Cir. 1998); <em>Pelissero v. Thompson, </em>170 F.3d 442, 447 (4th Cir.1999). We held that the BOP had exceeded its statutory authority and was required to ignore sentencing factors in determining whether the offender had been convicted of a \u201cnonviolent offense\u201d under \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B). <em>Fristoe v. Thompson, </em>144 F.3d 627, 631 (10th Cir. 1998). Conversely and relevant to Mr. Royal\u2019s appeal, the Fifth Circuit held that the BOP did not exceed its statutory authority and upheld the BOP\u2019s definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d to include a sentence enhancement for possession of a firearm. <em>See Venegas v. Henman, </em>126 F.3d 760, 765 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">In 2001, Mr. Royal was transferred to the FCI in El Reno, Oklahoma (\u201cFCI-E1 Reno\u201d). Pursuant to Mr. Royal\u2019s request for a review of his early release status, BOP staff advised him that \u201cdue to the <em>Fristoe v. Thompson </em>case in the [T]enth [C]ircuit,\u201d he would \u201cbe provisionally eligible for early release.\u201d The staff also advised that his provisional eligibility could change if he were transferred out of the Tenth Circuit. Mr. Royal acknowledged in writing that he understood his \u201cearly release ... is always provisional and may change.\u201d He claims that the BOP thereafter reduced his \u201cprobable release date\u201d by one year and registered the new date of \u201cprobable release\u201d in its electronic records.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">In 2007 the BOP notified Mr. Royal that he would be transferred to an FCI in Beaumont, Texas (\u201cFCI-Beaumont Low\u201d). He was also advised that he would lose his provisional eligibility for early release because he was being transferred out of an FCI in the Tenth Circuit and into one in the Fifth Circuit. He filed this \u00a7 2241 petition in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma shortly before he arrived at FCI-Beaumont Low. Thereafter, BOP staff deemed him ineligible for early release pursuant to \u00a7 3621(e). The magistrate judge recommended that Mr. Royal\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition be denied and the district court subsequently adopted the recommendation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">In habeas proceedings under \u00a7 2241, we review legal questions de novo and factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Eccleston, </em>521 F.3d 1249, 1253 (10th Cir.2008). We have held that a prisoner does not possess a constitutional right to a reduction of a valid sentence, and that \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B) does not confer upon a prisoner a constitutionally-protected liberty interest. <em>See Fristoe, </em>144 F.3d at 630. Subsection 3621(e)(2)(B) states only that a prisoner\u2019s sentence <em>\u201cmay </em>be reduced by the Bureau of Prisons.\u201d (emphasis added). Once a prisoner completes the RDAP, the BOP \u201chas the authority, but not the duty, ... to reduce [the prisoner\u2019s] term of imprisonment.\u201d <em>Lopez v. Davis, </em>531 U.S. 230, 241, 121 S.Ct. 714, 148 L.Ed.2d 635 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Mr. Royal does not challenge the BOP\u2019s authority to deem him ineligible for early release nor claim that his current sentence is invalid. Instead, he asserts that once the BOP notified him of the provisional early release date, he acquired a constitutionally protected liberty interest in that \u201caward\u201d because it had \u201cvested.\u201d He argues that the BOP denied him due process in denying him early release without first affording him due process. <em>See Steffey v. Orman, </em>461 F.3d 1218, 1221 (10th Cir. 2006) (\u201cA due process claim ... can only be maintained where there exists a constitutionally cognizable liberty or property interest with which the state has interfered.\u201d). We disagree. Just as a prisoner does not possess a constitutional right to a reduction of a valid sentence, <em>Fristoe, </em>144 F.3d at 630, a prisoner does not possess a constitutional right to retain <em>provisional </em>eligibility for the reduction of a valid sentence. Moreover, Mr. Royal fails to explain why any \u201caward\u201d he received had \u201cvested.\u201d The BOP notified Mr. Royal in writing that he was provisionally eligible for \u2014 but not entitled to \u2014 an early release. It also notified him that the status of his provisional eligibility could change if he were transferred to a prison facility outside the Tenth Circuit. In response, he signed a statement affirming his understanding that \u201cearly release is always provisional ... and may change.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mr. Royal has failed to demonstrate that he nonetheless suffered a violation of a constitutionally-protected interest. His procedural due process claim thus fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Mr. Royal also argues that once the BOP grants a provisional release date to someone convicted of a nonviolent offense and who received a sentence enhancement for being in possession of a firearm, the equal protection clause requires every BOP facility to grant a provisional early release to all similarly situated inmates. Again, we disagree. The BOP determined that Mr. Royal was provisionally eligible for early release because of our holding in <em>Fristoe. </em>That holding prevented BOP facilities within the Tenth Circuit from, inter alia, categorically denying a prisoner eligibility for early release under \u00a7 3621(e) based on the prisoner\u2019s enhanced sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. We also observed in <em>Fristoe </em>that \u201cthe BOP is not compelled by equal protection principles to acquiesce nationwide in [one][c]ircuit\u2019s decision.\u201d 144 F.3d at 630. \u201cIt is elementary that decisions of one Court of Appeals cannot bind another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). Consequently, Mr. Royal\u2019s equal protection claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM. Mr. Royal\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b310-28\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive val<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>ue consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-9\">. Because Mr. Royal is a federal prisoner proceeding under \u00a7 2241, a certificate of appealability is not a prerequisite to an appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c); <em>McIntosh v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>115 F.3d 809, 810 n. 1 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b311-10\">. This fact is not clear from the record but is apparent from the parties' argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b311-11\">. Subsection \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B) provides that \u2018\u2018[t]he period a prisoner convicted of a nonviolent offense remains in custody after successfully completing a treatment program may be reduced by the Bureau of Prisons, but such reduction may not be more than one year from the term the prisoner must otherwise serve.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b311-18\">. Under \u00a7 924(c)(3), \u201cthe term 'crime of violence\u2019 means an offense that is a felony and (A) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or (B) that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b312-6\">. As the district court noted, \"[i]t is well established that jurisdiction attaches on the initial filing of a habeas corpus relief, and it is not destroyed by a transfer of the petitioner and the accompanying custodial change.\u201d <em>Santillanes v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>754 F.2d 887, 888 (10th Cir.1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b313-5\">. Although Mr. Royal claims the BOP staff promised that his sentence would be reduced by one year if he successfully completed the RDAP, he has presented no evidence to support his claim. Moreover, his claim is itself contravened by Mr. Royal\u2019s signature affirming he understood the provisional nature of his eligibility for early release.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
