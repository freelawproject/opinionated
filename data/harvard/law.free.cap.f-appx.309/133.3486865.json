We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1015 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the events that occurred to Marabyan in Armenia do not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1016\u2014 17. In addition, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Marabyan failed to establish he has a well-founded fear of persecution because, even under a disfavored group analysis, he did not demonstrate the requisite individualized risk of persecution. <em>Cf. Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927-29 (9th Cir.2004). Lastly, the record does not establish that Marabyan demonstrated a pattern or practice of persecution. <em>See Kotasz v. INS, </em>31 F.3d 847, 852-53 (9th Cir.1994). Accordingly, Marabyan failed to establish eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">In his opening brief, Marabyan has not \u201cspecifically and distinctly argued and raised\u201d any challenge to the denial of withholding of removal or CAT protection. <em>See Castro-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 1069, 1072 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b159-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
