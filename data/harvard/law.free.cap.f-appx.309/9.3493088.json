We previously affirmed his conviction on drug-conspiracy charges, <em>United States v. Gougis, </em>432 F.3d 735 (7th Cir.2005), and affirmed his sentence following a limited remand pursuant to <em>United States v. Paladino, </em>401 F.3d 471 (7th Cir.2005). <em>United States v. Coleman, </em>175 Fed.Appx. 756 (7th Cir.2006). He now argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to review the contents of the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) with him. He alleges that certain information in the PSR \u2014 specifically an account of an incident in the jail in which he was reported to have made a throat-slashing gesture at one of his codefendants\u2014 was inaccurate. He claims he would have contested this aspect of the PSR if his attorney had in fact reviewed it with him and that his attorney\u2019s failure to do so amounted to constitutional ineffectiveness under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-15\">The government submitted an affidavit from Coleman\u2019s trial attorney disputing Coleman\u2019s claim that counsel did not review the PSR with him. The district court did not conduct a hearing to resolve the conflict, skipping instead to the prejudice inquiry under <em>Strickland </em>and finding none. Indeed, Coleman does not argue that the PSR\u2019s reference to the throat-slashing gesture had any effect on his sentence; there was no mention of it at sentencing by the parties or the district court. He argues, rather, that the PSR\u2019s inaccurate reference to the throat-slashing gesture might have a negative effect on his \u201csubsequent life in the Bureau of Prisons and prospects in any subsequent judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>proceeding.\u201d This sort of claim is not the proper subject of a \u00a7 2255 motion; it is not a collateral attack on his conviction or sentence but merely a challenge to an item in the defendant\u2019s court file. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>805 F.2d 1284, 1288-90 (7th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Moreover, even accepting that Coleman\u2019s attorney did not review the PSR with him (and we must accept Coleman\u2019s version because the district court did not resolve the conflict between attorney and client), under <em>Strickland </em>counsel\u2019s performance is evaluated in its totality. A single omission can be the basis of relief only \u201cif that error is sufficiently egregious and prejudicial.\u201d <em>Murray v. Carrier, </em>477 U.S. 478, 496, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986). Coleman does not contend that his attorney\u2019s error was egregious when considered in the context of the whole case; nor could he, since the alleged throat-slashing gesture had no effect whatsoever on his conviction or sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
