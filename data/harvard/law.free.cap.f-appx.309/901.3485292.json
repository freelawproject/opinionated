That decision denied as untimely his motion to reopen his immigration proceedings. His motion was filed almost four years after the BIA\u2019s final administrative order affirming a finding that Danaj was removable and denying his requested relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-23\">Given the time gap, Danaj does not claim that his motion was filed within the ninety-day period provided by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). Instead, he argues that the BIA\u2019s findings regarding his claim of changed circumstances in his home country of Albania are \u201carbitrary.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ninety-day time limit does not apply to such changed circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1229a(e) (7) (C) (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-24\">Danaj contends that the \u201cchanged circumstance\u201d is that his brother-in-law, who lives in Albania, is a federal fugitive who has threatened Danaj\u2019s life. The BIA found that \u201cthe harm [Danaj] fears lacks a nexus to a protected ground.\u201d We agree. Accordingly, we conclude that Danaj has failed to establish that the BIA abused its discretion in denying the motion to reopen. <em>Zhao v.
