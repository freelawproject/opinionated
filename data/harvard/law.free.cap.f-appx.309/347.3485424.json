On appeal, he argues that: (1) the district court improperly applied the sentencing guidelines; and (2) his constitutional rights were violated because a judge, not a jury, made findings regarding the \u201cnature\u201d of his prior conviction. After thorough review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Cha</em>varriyar-Mejia, 367 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.2004). The district court\u2019s determination that a prior conviction qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines is also reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 961 (11th Cir.2005). The district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, which we do not find unless we are \u201cleft with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations omitted). Where, as here, the defendant fails to make a constitutional objection before the district court, the issue is subject to plain error review. <em>United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1308-09 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">First, we are unpersuaded by Barrett\u2019s claim that the district court erred in determining that Barrett\u2019s prior conviction for attempted sexual battery was a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. In calculating the proper offense level for a defendant convicted of illegal reentry, the Sentencing Guidelines provide for a 16-level enhancement for a defendant who was previously deported after a conviction for a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The Application Notes to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l) define a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as an offense \u201cthat has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iii)). The Application Notes enumerate several offenses which are \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1), including \u201cforcible sex offenses,\u201d \u201cstatutory rape,\u201d and \u201csexual abuse of a minor.\u201d Even though \u201csexual battery\u201d is not specifically mentioned, we have held that Section 2L1.2\u2019s crime of violence category \u201cembraces any sexual abuse of a minor.\u201d <em>Chavarriya-Mejia, </em>367 F.3d at 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">When determining if a defendant\u2019s offense is a crime of violence, a court should \u201clook only to the elements of the convicted offense, and not to the conduct underlying the conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Rutherford, </em>175 F.3d 899, 905 (11th Cir.1999). In limited circumstances, the district court may examine the conduct surrounding a conviction, but only if \u201cambiguities in the judgment make the crime of violence determination impossible from the face of the judgment itself.\u201d <em>United States v. Spell, </em>44 F.3d 936, 939 (11th Cir.1995). In these kinds of cases, the district court \u201cmay rely only on the \u2018charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual findings by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>450 F.3d 1271, 1274 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)). For purposes of sentencing, the district court may also base its factual findings on undisputed statements in the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d). <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 832 (11th Cir.2006). Facts contained in a PSI are considered undisputed unless the defendant makes a challenge to those facts \u201cwith specificity and clarity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 832-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>In a case involving the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), we affirmed a sentence enhancement where the PSI established that the defendant\u2019s prior conviction for attempted burglary involved the burglary of a residence. <em>United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273 (11th Cir.2006). In Wade, the PSI provided that, \u201caccording to \u2018[cjourt documents,\u201d\u2019 the defendant\u2019s attempted burglary conviction resulted from him \u201cattempt[ing] to kick in the door of a residence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1275. Wade objected, but his \u201cobjection focused on attempted burglary as a category of crime; it did not dispute the PSI\u2019s allegation that state \u2018[cjourt documents\u2019 established that Wade had been convicted of the crime as a result of attempting to kick in the door of a residence and commit a theft inside.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we determined that he admitted those facts for sentencing purposes, and treated his conviction \u201cas one for attempted burglary of a dwelling, which is how it was treated in the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In this case, it was impossible to determine from the face of Barrett\u2019s judgment whether his previous conviction was for a crime of violence, so the district court was entitled to inquire into the conduct surrounding his conviction. Because the charge Barrett had previously pled to was different than the one that was in the Information, we agree that the district court erroneously consulted the Information in determining whether that conviction was for a crime of violence. However, the Information was not the only document that described the facts underlying Barrett\u2019s conviction. Here, the PSI also described the offense, indicating that Barrett\u2019s previous offense involved a minor victim, and Barrett never disputed this description of the facts underlying his conviction. The undisputed facts therefore supported the district court\u2019s finding that Barrett\u2019s offense involved a minor victim, and the district court did not err in determining that Barrett\u2019s attempted sexual battery conviction constituted a crime of violence. <em>See Bonanni Ship Supply, Inc. v. United States, </em>959 F.2d 1558, 1561 (11th Cir.1992) (noting that we may affirm on any supported ground).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">We also reject Barrett\u2019s claim that his constitutional rights were violated because a judge, not a jury, made findings regarding the nature of his prior conviction. \u201cIn <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>... the Supreme Court held that the government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315 (11th Cir.2005). <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding precedent despite recent Supreme Court decisions that may cast doubt on its future prospects. <em>Id. </em>at 1316 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">We have thus recognized that there is no Sixth Amendment violation when a district court enhances a defendant\u2019s sentence based on prior convictions, including those listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). <em>Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d at 961; <em>see also United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1276-77 (11th Cir.2005) (case involving that provision\u2019s \u201calien smuggling offense\u201d category). In addition, as Barrett acknowledges, the question of whether a conviction qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA is an issue for the judge, not the jury. <em>United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">In light of <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>and our holdings in <em>Orduno-Mireles, Gallegos-Aguero, </em>and Greer, there is no merit to Barrett\u2019s argument that his constitutional rights were violated when the district court judge determined the \u201cnature\u201d of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>prior conviction. Accordingly, the district court did not err, much less plainly err, in imposing Barrett\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-6\">. Nonetheless, Barrett's motion for leave to file a reply brief out of time is GRANTED.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
