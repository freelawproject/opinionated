The Immigration and Nationality Act authorizes the Attorney General to confer asylum on any refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a) (2006). It defines a refugee as a person unwilling or unable to return to his native country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution <em>on account of </em>race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2006) (emphasis added). Following the passage of the REAL ID Act, asylum applicants such as Giorgis who filed their applications after May 11, 2005, must establish that the protected ground asserted \u201cwas or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.\u201d REAL ID Act, \u00a7 101(a)(3), codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)\u00a9 (2006). Based on our review of the record, we agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>finding that Giorgis failed to establish that his political opinion was a central reason for the threats that he faced in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Giorgis also argues that he established that he faces a well-founded fear of future persecution if returned to Ethiopia based on his political activities here in the United States. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Giorgis fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">We therefore deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
