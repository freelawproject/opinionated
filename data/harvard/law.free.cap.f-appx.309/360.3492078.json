Brian Albritton, David Paul Rhodes, James Arthur Muench, United States Attorney\u2019s Office, Tampa, FL, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b387-9\">Before BIRCH, BARKETT and HULL, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b387-10\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Daniel Lashay Carley appeals his concurrent 140-month sentences after pleading guilty to (1) conspiracy to distribute 5 kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(ii)(II), and 846, and (2) possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(ii)(II).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">On appeal, Carley argues that the district court erred in sentencing him as a career offender under <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347 (11th Cir.2008), because his prior Florida state conviction for carrying a concealed firearm does not constitute a predicate offense for determining career-offender status under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir.2006). In addition, the decision to classify a defendant as a career offender is a question of law we review <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">A district court may enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence as a career offender if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-15\">(2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-16\">(3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-17\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). The Guidelines define a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than a year, that \u201c(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-18\">In <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), the Supreme Court addressed whether a conviction for felony driving under the influence constituted a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d). The Supreme Court concluded that such crimes were violent felonies only to the extent that they were \u201croughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed,\u201d to the crimes enumerated in the ACCA, namely, burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives. <em>Id. </em>at-, 128 S.Ct. at 1584-85. Applying this standard to felony driving under the influence, the Supreme Court held that the offense was not a violent felony because a conviction for driving under the influence did not require a showing of purposeful, violent, aggressive conduct, but was more comparable to strict liability crimes where no intent was required. <em>Id. </em>at-, 128 S.Ct. at 1586-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>In <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>we held that \u201ccarrying a concealed weapon in violation of Florida law is a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(1).\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 138 F.3d 1371, 1372 (11th Cir.1998), <em>abrogated by, Begay, </em>553 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1581. However, applying the <em>Begay </em>standard, we recently decided that <em>Gilbert </em>had been abrogated and held that the crime of carrying a concealed weapon could no longer be considered a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Archer, </em>531 F.3d at 1352. In light of <em>Archer\u2019s </em>holding that carrying a concealed weapon does not constitute a crime of violence and the government\u2019s concession of error, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Upon review of the record on appeal, and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs on appeal, we find reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b388-17\">. The guideline referred to as U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(1) in <em>Gilbert </em>is listed as \u00a7 4B1.2(a) under the 2007 version of the Guidelines, which apply to the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
