On appeal, Robertson\u2019s sole argument is that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to address his primary argument for a variance from the guideline range. For the reasons discussed below, we VACATE Robertson\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURE</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">The facts of this case are not in dispute. On January 17, 2007, a grand jury indicted Robertson for one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924. Robertson pleaded guilty to the charge on April 2, 2007. A Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) was subsequently prepared, which calculated Robertson\u2019s total offense level to be 23 and his criminal history category to be V, resulting in a guideline range of 84 to 105 months. In calculating this guideline range, the PSR twice considered one of Robertson\u2019s prior controlled-substances convictions, for attempted sale of less than 0.5 grams of cocaine, once for purposes of calculating his total offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) and again in determining his criminal history score.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">Robertson filed a sentencing memorandum, arguing for a below-guideline sentence based on three facts: (1) Robertson\u2019s prior controlled-substances conviction had been double-counted, once to set his base offense level to twenty-four under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) and once in increasing his criminal history score by three points, which increased his criminal history category by one level, resulting in \u201cdual punishment\u201d and a guideline range that was greater than necessary to achieve the objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); (2) Robertson completed barber school and hoped to start his own business after release from prison; and (3) Robertson had a close relationship with his 12-year-old daughter. Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 14-22 (Sent. Mem. at 1-9). The memorandum stated that, based on these facts, Robertson \u201curg[ed] the Court, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5K2.0, 5H1.2 and 5H1.6, to depart downward from the recommended advisory guideline range.\u201d J.A. at 14 (Sent. Mem. at 1). Robertson also requested a sentence of 63 months, contending that such a sentence \u201cis sufficient, but no greater than necessary, to achieve the goals of sentencing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">The Government responded to the sentencing memorandum and addressed all three of Robertson\u2019s arguments. However, in addressing the double-counting argument, the Government contended only that the double-counting of offenses is permissible under <em>United States v. Wheeler, </em>330 F.3d 407, 413-14 (6th Cir.2003), and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">The district court held Robertson\u2019s sentencing hearing on July 2, 2007. At the hearing, Robertson\u2019s counsel and the district judge engaged in the following colloquy regarding Robertson\u2019s double-counting argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-11\">THE COURT: All right. Mr. Small, I think [the] government pointed out there is [a] Wheeler ease arising out of our state that says it\u2019s appropriate to consider these drug convictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-12\">MR. SMALL: Your Honor, let me just be clear. I didn\u2019t make a specific objection to the calculations. In fact, I had no objections to the calculations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-13\">THE COURT: But you were making the argument that the sentence ought to be reduced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>MR. SMALL: That\u2019s the argument I\u2019m making, Your Honor. I\u2019m just making it under the 3553(a) factor. And frankly, with the exception of the immigration guideline, there is no other guideline that punishes a defendant more harshly for a criminal record than a gun guideline. So I was just making that argument for factors under 3553(a), not as a specific objection to the guideline calculations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-4\">THE COURT: Okay. The Court will, therefore, find that the total offense level is 23, the Criminal History Category is V, the guideline range is 84 to 105 months....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">J.A. at 45-46 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 4-5). Both parties then made arguments regarding the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Although neither party explicitly discussed the double-counting argument at this time, Robertson\u2019s counsel did note that, \u201cas I pointed out earlier, the objection, it wasn\u2019t an objection I had made,\u201d but rather was merely an attempt to illuminate the fact that counsel could find nothing \u201cin the application notes in [terms] of how the guidelines were structured for the specific type of offense that there is any particularized reason to ... substantially] enhance[ ] Mr. Robertson\u2019s guideline range to the 84 month range.\u201d J.A. at 46-47 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 5-6).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">After hearing the arguments of counsel and Robertson\u2019s allocution, the district judge stated that, \u201c[f]or clarity of the record, the Court has considered the factors under 3553(a) concerning the defendant, his personal history, his criminal history, [and] the other factors under 3553(a).\u201d J.A. at 55 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 14). The district judge then detailed Robertson\u2019s criminal history and pronounced sentence \u2014 84 months of imprisonment. J.A. at 55-56 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 14-15). The district judge further noted that \u201c[t]he Court has tried to recognize your recent efforts at getting a vocation that will give you a job, a productive job. The Court has tried to recognize your sensitivity to the needs of your daughter.\u201d J.A. at 57 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 16).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">After pronouncing sentence, the district judge asked, \u201cAre there any other matters, either side?\u201d <em>Id. </em>Robertson\u2019s counsel pointed out that the district judge had failed to inform Robertson of his right to appeal. After informing Robertson regarding this right, the district judge asked again, \u201cAre there any other matters?\u201d <em>Id. </em>Both counsel replied, \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Robertson timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">Robertson\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the district court erred when it failed to address Robertson\u2019s argument that his sentence should be reduced because the double-counting of one prior drug conviction in calculating his guideline range led to dual punishment that produced a \u201cguidelines range greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d Robertson Br. at 9. For the reasons discussed below, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b946-13\"><em>\u201cPost-Booker, </em>we review a district court\u2019s sentencing determination under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard, for reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Presley, </em>547 F.3d 625, 629 (6th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>sonableness review has both a procedural and a substantive component. <em>See Gall v. United, States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>498 F.3d 336, 339 (6th Cir.2007). Thus, when reviewing a district court\u2019s sentencing determination, we \u201cfirst ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">A sentence is procedurally unreasonable \u201cif the sentencing judge fails to \u2018set forth enough [of a statement of reasons] to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision making authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Lalonde, </em>509 F.3d 750, 769-70 (6th Cir.2007) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)); <em>cf. Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468 (\u201cUnless a party contests the Guidelines sentence generally under \u00a7 3553(a) \u2014 that is argues that the Guidelines reflect an unsound judgment, or, for example, that they do not generally treat certain defendant characteristics in the proper way \u2014 or argues for departure, the judge normally need say no more.... Where the defendant or prosecutor presents nonfrivolous reasons for imposing a different sentence, however, the judge will normally go further and explain why he has rejected those arguments.\u201d). Although sentencing courts are not required to \u201cgive the reasons for rejecting any and all arguments [made] by the parties for alternative sentences,\u201d <em>United States v. Vonner, </em>516 F.3d 382, 387 (6th Cir.2008) (en banc), for a sentence to be procedurally reasonable, \u201c[w]hen a defendant raises a particular[, nonfrivolous] argument in seeking a lower sentence, the record must reflect both that the district judge considered the defendant\u2019s argument and that the judge explained the basis for rejecting it.\u201d <em>Lalonde, </em>509 F.3d at 770 (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Peters, </em>512 F.3d 787, 789 (6th Cir.2008) (holding that a sentence is not procedurally reasonable if, \u201c[w]hen the defendant or prosecutor \u2018presents nonfrivolous reasons for imposing a different sentence,\u2019 ... a sentencing judge [fails to] address the \u2018parties\u2019 arguments\u2019 and \u2018explain why he has rejected those arguments\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468)).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">The Government contends that, rather than review Robertson\u2019s argument under the normal reasonableness standard, we should review Robertson\u2019s sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>only for plain error because Robertson did not object below to the district court\u2019s failure to consider Robertson\u2019s double-counting argument. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">We have articulated the requirements that must be satisfied at the district-court level in order to subject an argument on appeal to plain-error review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-5\">[District courts, after pronouncing the defendant\u2019s sentence but before adjourning the sentencing hearing, [must] ask the parties whether they have any objections to the sentence just pronounced that have not previously been raised. If the district court fails to provide the parties with this opportunity, they will not have forfeited their objections and thus will not be required to demonstrate plain error on appeal. If a party does not clearly articulate any objection and the grounds upon which the objection is based, when given this final opportunity [to] speak, then that party will have forfeited its opportunity to make any objections not previously raised and thus will face plain error review on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-3\"><em>United States v. Bostic, </em>371 F.3d 865, 872-73 (6th Cir.2004) (footnote omitted). <em>See also Vonner, </em>516 F.3d at 385-86 (applying <em>Bostic </em>to procedural reasonableness claims). We have repeatedly stressed that \u201c[a] district court can satisfy the requirements of the <em>Bostic </em>rule only by clearly asking for objections to the sentence that have not been previously raised.\u201d <em>United States v. Clark, </em>469 F.3d 568, 570 (6th Cir.2006) (holding that the <em>Bostic </em>requirements were not satisfied when a district court asked \u201cAnything else, Ms. Goode?\u201d); <em>Thomas, </em>498 F.3d at 340 (concluding that the district court asking \u201cDo you have anything further for the record, Mr. Canady?\u201d did not satisfy Bostic); <em>United States v. Love, </em>289 F. App\u2019x 889, 893 (6th Cir. 2008) (unpublished opinion) (noting that \u201cAnything else?\u201d was the type of \u201cspare question that we have found insufficient under <em>[Bostic </em>]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">In the instant case, after the district judge pronounced sentence, he asked, \u201cAre there any other matters, either side?\u201d J.A. at 57 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 16). After a brief exchange regarding the right to appeal, the district judge again asked, \u201cAre there any other matters?\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district judge never \u201cclearly ask[ed] for objections to the sentence,\u201d <em>Clark, </em>469 F.3d at 570; rather, the district judge asked a question that is similar to the types of questions that we have determined are insufficient under <em>Bostic, see id.; Thomas, </em>498 F.3d at 340. Thus, the district court did not meet the <em>Bostic </em>requirements, and Robertson\u2019s argument is therefore not subject to plain-error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">B. Procedural Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">Robertson asserts that the district court did not consider or address his argument \u201cthat the double-counting of [Robertson\u2019s] prior controlled substances conviction[] \u2014 once for purposes of calculating his total offense level under 2K2.1(a)(2) and then again in determining his criminal history score \u2014 resulted in a[n] advisory guidelines range greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing objectives of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d Robertson Br. at 9. As an initial matter, it is important to outline exactly what Robertson argued before the district court. Robertson\u2019s sentencing memorandum asked the court for \u201ca downward departure, based on what amounts to dual punishment for the same conviction.\u201d J.A. at 18 (Sent. Mem. at 5). Although Robertson used the word \u201cdeparture,\u201d it is clear from the context of the sentencing memorandum and Robertson\u2019s counsel\u2019s clarification and argument before the district court at the sentencing hearing that what Robertson was really requesting was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>a downward variance based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors because of the double-counting issue. <em>See United States v. Jordan, </em>544 F.3d 656, 671 n. 12 (6th Cir.2008) (explaining the difference between a \u201cdeparture\u201d and a \u201cvariance\u201d for purposes of sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">An argument that a district court should award a variance based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors because the guideline range double-counted prior offenses is a nonfrivolous argument. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Carballo-Arguelles, </em>446 F.Supp.2d 742, 745 (E.D.Mich.2006) (awarding \u201ca one-level reduction in [defendant\u2019s] total offense level to mitigate the double-counting of [defendant\u2019s] prior conviction\u201d); <em>United States v. Hernandez-Fierros, </em>453 F.3d 309, 313 (6th Cir.2006) (acknowledging that a sentencing court could \u201creject[] the recommended Guidelines range based on defendant\u2019s arguments\u201d that double-counting offenses under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 makes application of the guideline range unwarranted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Robertson raised a nonfrivolous request for a variance, the district judge was required to \u201caddress [Robertson\u2019s\u2019]arguments\u2019 and \u2018explain why he has rejected those arguments.\u2019\u201d <em>Peters, </em>512 F.3d at 789 (quoting <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468); <em>Lalonde, </em>509 F.3d at 769-70. Thus, the question that we must answer is whether the district court adequately addressed Robertson\u2019s argument. We conclude that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">Complete review of the sentencing transcript reveals that the sole discussion by the district court that involved the double-counting argument was the short colloquy regarding the <em>Wheeler </em>case between the district court and Robertson\u2019s counsel. This colloquy suggests that the district judge may not have understood the argument that Robertson was making. The district judge, as did the Government in its response to Robertson\u2019s sentencing memorandum, seems to have misunderstood Robertson to be contending that it was legally improper to double-count his prior convictions. <em>See </em>J.A. at 45 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 4) (\u201cTHE COURT: All right. Mr. Small, I think [the] government pointed out there is [a] Wheeler case arising out of our state that says it\u2019s appropriate to consider these drug convictions.\u201d). Robertson\u2019s actual argument was that, although double-counting is legally proper, in his particular case such counting resulted in a guideline range greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing objectives of \u00a7 3553(a), and thus a downward variance under \u00a7 3553(a) was warranted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>Even though Robertson\u2019s counsel clarified this issue twice during the sentencing hearing, the district court never responded to this argument. Rather, the district judge simply described Robertson\u2019s criminal history and pronounced his sentence. Had Robertson argued only that, generally speaking, his criminal history did not support the guideline range calculated when applying the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court\u2019s mere recitation of Robertson\u2019s criminal history may have been sufficient. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2469 (\u201cWhere a matter is ... conceptually simple ... and the record makes clear that the sentencing judge considered the evidence and arguments, we do not believe the law requires the judge to write more extensively.\u201d). However, this is not a case \u201c[w]here [the] matter is ... conceptually simple,\u201d nor does \u201cthe record make[] clear that the sentencing judge considered [Robertson\u2019s] arguments,\u201d <em>id.; </em>Robertson\u2019s argument was much more specific and complex than a general \u00a7 3553(a) variance argument and thus the district court was required to \u201caddress [Robertson\u2019s\u2019]argument[ ]\u2019 and \u2018explain why he has rejected th[e] argument ].\u2019 \u201d <em>Peters, </em>512 F.3d at 789 (quoting <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468); <em>Lalonde, </em>509 F.3d at 769-70; <em>see also Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468 (implying that, when a defendant \u201cargues that the Guidelines reflect an unsound judgment, or, for example, that they do not generally treat certain defendant characteristics in the proper way \u2014 or argues for departure,\u201d a district judge should speak more elaborately than in a typical case). In this case, the district court provided no such review and explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">The Government makes much of the fact that the district court, when detailing Robertson\u2019s criminal history, referred to the particular conviction that Robertson contends was double-counted. However, the mere mention of the crime does not mean that the district judge understood and considered the specific double-counting argument, especially in light of the fact that the conviction in question was mentioned in tandem with many other prior convictions that Robertson did not argue were double-counted. This context strengthens our belief that the district judge simply looked at Robertson\u2019s criminal history in general, and did not consider how the double-counted conviction was applied in calculating the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Moreover, after pronouncing the sentence, the district judge specifically addressed the other two grounds Robertson raised in support of Robertson\u2019s request for a variance, stating that \u201c[t]he Court has tried to recognize your recent efforts at getting a vocation that will give you a job, a productive job. The Court has tried to recognize your sensitivity to the needs of your daughter.\u201d J.A. at 57 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 16). The district court\u2019s specific mention of these two arguments for a variance while failing to discuss Robertson\u2019s primary argument for a variance lends further support to our conclusion that the district judge did not understand Robertson to be arguing for a variance based on the double-counting ground. There would be no other logical reason to specify only two of the three grounds Robertson raised in support of a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">The Government further contends that Robertson\u2019s sentence was not procedurally unreasonable because, in this case, \u201c[t]he District Court\u2019s discussion of the Section 3553(a) factors was more detailed and responsive than in eases where this Court has found [that] the sentence was procedurally unreasonable due to the court\u2019s failure to address a defendant\u2019s sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>arguments.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. at 27. This assertion is inaccurate. In <em>Thomas, </em>\u201c[t]he district court noted that it \u2018ha[d] received [Thomas\u2019s sentencing memorandum], read it and underst[oo]d its presentations.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>498 F.3d at 339 (second and third alterations in original). The district judge then addressed some of Thomas\u2019s arguments, calculated the applicable guideline range, and explained why he was sentencing Thomas in the middle of that range. <em>Id. </em>The panel vacated Thomas\u2019s sentence, stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-5\">Thomas in his sentencing memorandum raised a number of arguments regarding application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but those arguments went unmentioned and unaddressed, save the general statement by the district court that it had received, read, and understood the sentencing memorandum. In such circumstances, we must conclude that \u201cthe \u2018context and the record\u2019 do not \u2018make clear\u2019 the court\u2019s reasoning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 341 (quoting <em>United States v. Liou, </em>491 F.3d 334, 339 n. 4 (6th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2469)).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">Similarly in <em>Peters, </em>when faced with a \u201c\u2018Statement of Reasons\u2019 that set out a number of mitigating factors\u201d regarding why Peters, upon resentencing, should receive a \u201ctime-served\u201d sentence, the district court made only \u201ca cursory statement acknowledging Peters\u2019[s] arguments, [and] did not address the defendant\u2019s \u2018time-served\u2019 argument or the mitigating factors\u201d noted. <em>Peters, </em>512 F.3d at 788. The panel vacated the sentence, stressing that the district judge did not \u201caddress the \u2018parties\u2019 arguments\u2019 and \u2018explain why he has rejected those arguments\u2019\u201d and thus the sentence was procedurally unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">As in <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Peters, </em>the district judge in the instant case was faced with a sentencing memorandum that raised a non-frivolous argument that the district judge did not address specifically at the sentencing hearing. Nowhere in the sentencing hearing transcript is it evident that the district judge understood, let alone considered, Robertson\u2019s double-counting argument, which defense counsel renewed at the hearing. Thus, we hold that Robertson\u2019s sentence is procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">Because the district court erred when it failed to address Robertson\u2019s double-counting argument, we VACATE Robertson\u2019s sentence and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<author id=\"b951-12\">JAMES S. GWIN, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b951-13\">Because Defendant Robertson\u2019s double-counting argument was no different from his \u00a7 3553(a) argument that the Guideline range was too high, and because the district court both considered and sufficiently explained his reasons for rejecting that argument, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-14\">With his sentencing memorandum, Robertson explicitly asked the district court, \u201cpursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5K2.0, 5H1.2 and 5H1.6, to <em>depart downward </em>from the recommended advisory guideline range.\u201d J.A. at 14 (emphasis added). In addition to his request for a downward departure, Robertson asked the district court for a variance of \u201c63 months, as such a sentence is sufficient, but no greater than necessary, to achieve the goals of sentencing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-15\">As grounds for a departure, Robertson\u2019s double-counting argument fails. <em>See </em>18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b) (\u201c[T]he court shall impose a sentence of the kind, and within the range ... unless the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.\u201d); Appl. Note 10 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 (\u201cPrior felony convietion(s) resulting in an increased base offense level ... are also counted for purposes of determining criminal history points pursuant to Chapter Four, Part A (Criminal History).\u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(a)(2)(B) (\u201cA departure may be warranted in the exceptional case in which there is present a <em>circumstance that the Commission has not identified </em>in the guidelines but that nevertheless is relevant to determining the appropriate sentence.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>United States v. Wheeler, </em>330 F.3d 407, 413-14 (6th Cir.2003). The district court was aware of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Wheeler, </em>330 F.3d 407 (6th Cir.2003), and calculated the Guideline range accordingly. <em>See </em>J.A. at 45-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">The majority, however, concludes that \u201c[ajlthough Robertson used the word \u2018departure,\u2019 it is clear from the context ... that what Robertson was really requesting was a downward variance based on the \u00a7 3553 factors because of the double-counting issue.\u201d Majority Opinion at 922-23. I agree. In making the double-counting argument, the Defendant made no argument different from an argument under \u00a7 3553(a): \u201cBecause of this [double-counting] anomaly, the advisory guideline range in the present case results in a somewhat greater than necessary term of punishment to satisfy the purposes of sentencing.\u201d J.A. at 18. Robertson was simply arguing that the Guideline range was greater than necessary under \u00a7 3553\u2019s parsimony provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">To find that this case should be remanded for re-sentencing, the majority reasons: \u201cRobertson\u2019s argument was much more specific and complex than a general \u00a7 3553(a) variance argument and thus the district court was required to address [Robertson\u2019s] argument[ ] and explain why he has rejected th[e] argumentf ].\u201d Majority opinion at 924 (citing <em>United States v. Peters </em>512 F.3d 787, 788-89 (6th Cir.2008)) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">However, Robertson\u2019s sentencing memorandum made no specific or complex argument regarding double-counting. In the memorandum, Robertson\u2019s complete position on the issue was:,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-8\">The PSR places Mr. Robertson in a Criminal History Category of V. Included in this calculation are three criminal history points for a conviction in 2000 for attempted sale of less than .5 grams of cocaine. (PSR U 34). Because of this same conviction, Mr. Robertson received an offense level increase from 20 to 24. (PSR U11). Mr. Robertson respectfully requests a downward departure, based on what amounts to dual punishment for the same conviction. Typically, the guideline provisions in Chapter Two, establish offense levels based on a defendant\u2019s relevant conduct, rather than a defendant\u2019s prior record. However, firearms offenses under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), primarily give greater weight to a defendant\u2019s prior convictions in establishing the offense level. The more egregious exceptions being for immigration offenses under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.1. Because of this anomaly, the advisory guideline range in the present case results in a somewhat greater than necessary term of punishment to satisfy the purposes of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>J.A. at 18. The majority of this passage is descriptive; only the final sentence makes an argument, contending generally that the double-counting results in a greater than necessary sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">At the sentencing hearing, Robertson completely gave up the double-counting issue, save a cursory request that the issue be considered under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. When the district court asked Robertson\u2019s attorney whether <em>Wheeler </em>prevented the double-counting argument, defense counsel acknowledged there were no grounds to depart from the Guideline calculation. He explained that the double-counting argument should only be considered under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-6\">That\u2019s the argument I\u2019m making, Your Honor. I\u2019m just making it under the 3553(a) factor ... So I was just making that argument for factors under 3553(a), not as a specific objection to the guideline calculations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">J.A. at 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">These brief, unsupported positions exhaust all references that Robertson made to the double-counting issue in his sentencing memorandum and at the sentencing hearing. Given Robertson\u2019s cursory treatment of the double-counting issue, I do not believe the record supports the majority\u2019s finding that Robertson\u2019s argument was specific. As the references described above show, Robertson simply made an argument that he suffered double-counting and such double-counting caused his Guideline range to be too high under \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">Moreover, the record nowhere supports the majority\u2019s suggestion that Robertson\u2019s double-counting argument was complex. As discussed above, Robertson simply argued that whatever double-counting occurred caused his Guideline range to be unnecessarily high under \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s parsimony provision. Robertson\u2019s argument was not uncommon or complex. Sentencing courts receive arguments that the Guideline range is unnecessarily high under the parsimony provision in nearly every case.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">In this case, the district court heard and considered the Defendant\u2019s argument that 63 months was a sufficient but not greater than necessary sentence. In rejecting that suggestion, and deciding on the Guideline sentence of 84 months, the district court specifically considered the Defendant\u2019s criminal history, including his past offense conduct and also the circumstances of the offenses and the lenient sentences the Defendant had previously received. <em>See </em>J.A. at 55-56. All of these factors led the district court to believe a 63-month sentence was not sufficient and an 84-month sentence was not greater than necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-12\">In arriving at this conclusion, the district court \u201crecognize[d] that [the Defendant] has made some efforts to improve himself,\u201d including through his vocational efforts and his relationship with his daughter. J.A. at 56-57. The majority reasons that because the district court addressed these arguments that the Defendant had raised, but failed to explicitly refer to the double-counting argument, the district court must not have understood the Defendant\u2019s argument for a variance based on the double-counting. J.A. at 12. According to the majority, \u201c[t]here would be no other logical reason to specify only two of the three grounds Robertson raised in support of a variance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-13\">However, the district court\u2019s reference to the Defendant\u2019s arguments for a variance based on his vocational efforts and his relationship with his daughter were likely the result of the emphasis placed on those arguments by the Defendant himself. In addition to mentioning them in the sentencing memorandum, Robertson\u2019s attorney elaborated on both these arguments at the hearing. <em>See </em>J.A. at 48-49. Robert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>son, himself, also raised both of these issues when, seeking leniency, he addressed the district court at his sentencing. <em>See </em>J.A. at 50-51. As important, Robertson\u2019s double-counting argument simply argued that the Guideline range was unnecessarily high. The district court\u2019s discussion of Robertson\u2019s relationship with his daughter and his efforts to learn a trade were directly related to Robertson\u2019s argument that double-counting caused his Guideline range to be too high.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">I conclude that the district court considered the double-counting argument, which was no different from, nor more complex than, an argument that a Guideline sentence would be too long. Therefore, I believe the sentencing was proeedurally reasonable and the district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting the Defendant\u2019s contention that the Guideline sentence imposed was greater than necessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b946-7\">. In its brief, the government seems to imply that a general abuse-of-discretion standard applies in sentencing cases. Gov\u2019t Br. at 20. Such an assertion is inaccurate. A review of our caselaw reveals that the \"abuse-of-discretion standard, for reasonableness\u201d is a stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>dard whose parameters are specifically defined by Sixth Circuit precedent and thus is more than general abuse-of-discretion review. <em>See, e.g., Presley, </em>547 F.3d at 629-30 (holding that a sentence is reviewed under an \"abuse-of-discretion standard, for reasonableness,\u201d but, in lieu of undertaking traditional abuse-of-discretion review, applying the specifically defined procedural and substantive reasonableness requirements); <em>United States v. Bolds, </em>511 F.3d 568, 578-79 (6th Cir.2007) (holding that \"[a] district court necessarily abuses its sentencing discretion if it commit[s] [a] significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range,\u201d rather than applying the traditional abuse-of-discretion standard) (internal quotation marks omitted) (first alteration added). Thus, any argument that only traditional abuse-of-discretion principles apply in reviewing a sentence for reasonableness is misplaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b949-6\">. In a recent decision, <em>United States v. Stephens, </em>549 F.3d 459 (6th Cir.2008), we noted that a district court is not required to award a departure or variance on double-counting grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 468. However, Robertson is not arguing that the district court erred by not awarding a variance, but only that the district court did not consider this argument. Therefore, <em>Stephens </em>is not applicable to the instant appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b949-7\">. Contrary to the dissent's assertion, Robertson\u2019s argument was not simply that \"the Guideline range is unnecessarily high under the parsimony provision\u201d of \u00a7 3553(a), Dissent at 4, but rather was a more nuanced argument that the use of double-counting, though proper under the guidelines, caused Robertson\u2019s guideline range to be too high. Both Robertson\u2019s sentencing memorandum and his counsel\u2019s argument at the sentencing hearing specifically mention the double-counting argument. J.A. at 17-18 (Sent. Mem. at 4-5); J.A. at 45-47 (Sent. Hr\u2019g Tr. at 4-6).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">Moreover, Robertson\u2019s actual argument, as opposed to the argument that the dissent insists Robertson made, is a more complex argument than a generic invocation of the parsimony provision. An argument that the application of a particular guideline-approved practice in a specific case produces a sentencing range that is unnecessarily high raises substantial particularized issues well beyond a simple parsimony argument that a sentencing range is excessive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
