R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b451-24\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order filed May 22, 2008, 2008 WL 2156973, be affirmed. The district court correctly dismissed without prejudice appellant\u2019s conspiracy complaint, because the complaint contained only conclusory and unsubstantiated allegations of conspiratorial conduct. <em>See, e.g., Barr v. Clinton, </em>370 F.3d 1196 (D.C.Cir.2004). Moreover, appellant\u2019s damages claims are barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) (criminal defendant may not recover damages under \u00a7 1983 for harm caused by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>actions whose unlawfulness would render conviction or sentence invalid unless conviction or sentence has been invalidated in another proceeding). <em>See Williams v. Hill, </em>74 F.3d 1339 (D.C.Cir.1996) (applying <em>Heck </em>to actions against federal officials). Notably, the district court\u2019s dismissal was without prejudice to refiling should appellant ever meet the requirements of <em>Heck.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
