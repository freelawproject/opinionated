He does not argue that the district court erred in calculating the applicable guidelines range, but contends only that the stipulation that the sentences at issue run consecutively to a prior undischarged sentence was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Under the discretionary sentencing system established by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), district courts retain a duty to consider the Sentencing Guidelines, along with the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005). This court reviews the sentence imposed for reasonableness in light of those factors. <em>Id. </em>at 519. In <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), the Supreme Court established a bifurcated process for conducting a reasonableness review. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). Pursuant to <em>Gall, </em>this court must first determine whether the district court committed any procedural errors, \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">If the district court\u2019s decision is proeedurally sound, this court will \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard ... tak[ing] into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 808 (5th Cir.2008) (discussing the <em>Gall </em>approach to reasonableness review). Further, \u201ca sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Likewise, \u201ca rebuttable presumption of reasonableness applies to a consecutive sentence imposed within the parameters of the advisory federal guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 473 (5th Cir.2006). Both 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 authorize district courts to impose sentences to run concurrently with or consecutively to undischarged sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">Medina complains that the district court failed to sufficiently articulate its application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Because he did not object on this basis in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>530 F.3d 381, 387-88 (5th Cir.2008). In imposing the instant sentences, the district court stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court was not required to engage in \u201crobotic incantations that each statutory factor has been considered.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">Medina also argues that the district court imposed unreasonably long sentences by stipulating that his sentences were to run consecutive to his prior undischarged sentence. Even assuming that Medina sufficiently objected on this basis in the district court such that review under the abuse of discretion standard is appropriate, <em>see Williams, </em>517 F.3d at 808, Medina\u2019s eonclusory assertions fail to establish that the district court erred. Medina\u2019s consecutive sentences are within the applicable guidelines range and are entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>Candia, </em>454 F.3d at 473. Furthermore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>had the district court not specified one way or the other, the statutory presumption would have been that the instant sentences would run consecutively to his prior undischarged sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3584(a); <em>Candia, </em>454 F.3d at 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b933-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
