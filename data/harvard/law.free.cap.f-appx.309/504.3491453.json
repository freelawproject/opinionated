Rittweger (\u201cRittweger\u201d) appeals from a July 9, 2007, 2007 WL 1975490, Memorandum Opinion and Order (\u201cOrder\u201d) of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Koeltl, J.) denying Rittweger\u2019s motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 (\u201cRule 33\u201d). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-17\">Rittweger argues the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence the government failed to disclose prior to trial. <em>United States v. Rivas, </em>377 F.3d 195, 199 (2d Cir.2004) (\u201cA court of appeals reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial under Rule 33 for abuse of discretion.\u201d). Rittweger contends that the evidence, a memo to Rittweger written by the government\u2019s cooperating witness, contained statements that contradicted the witness\u2019s testimony and the government\u2019s overall theory of the case. It thus qualified, he argues, as exculpatory evidence wrongly suppressed under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). <em>See United States v. Siddiqi, </em>959 F.2d 1167, 1173 (2d Cir.1992) (\u201c[Rule 33] specifically contemplates that such motions may be made based on newly-discovered evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-18\">As the district court noted, however, the document in question cannot be considered \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>was offered into evidence at trial as Government Exhibit 359. <em>See United States v. Zagari, </em>111 F.3d 307, 322 (2d Cir.1997) (stating that evidence is \u201cnew\u201d only if \u201cit could not have been discovered, exercising due diligence, before or during trial\u201d). While it is unclear whether or when the document was produced during discovery, Rittweger did not object when it was introduced on the third day of an almost six-week trial. We have previously stated that the failure to ask for a continuance when allegedly new evidence is introduced at trial is, if not a waiver of any later unfair surprise claim, at least strong proof that the party was not in fact surprised by the \u201cnew\u201d evidence. <em>See United States v. Cephas, </em>937 F.2d 816, 823 (2d Cir.1991) (\u201cIf Harris were truly surprised by the testimony, he could have sought time to prepare his cross examination and/or answering case.\u201d); <em>United States v. Caine, </em>441 F.2d 454, 456 (2d Cir.1971) (\u201c[T]he absence of surprise is highlighted by appellants\u2019 failure to request a continuance when the court ruled the evidence admissible.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Moreover, although Rittweger argues the document was nevertheless \u201csuppressed\u201d because it was not disclosed in time for Rittweger to act upon or \u201cweave\u201d its contents into the defense case, the district court rightly pointed out that he actively cross-examined the document\u2019s author about its validity and suggested during summation that the document was a fake. Because the jury could have considered the implications of the exhibit in its deliberations, Rittweger cannot show that document was \u201cmaterial\u201d in that it \u201ccould reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 435, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">In total, because the district court did not base its order on \u201can error of law ... or a clearly erroneous factual finding,\u201d it did not abuse its discretion in denying Rittweger\u2019s Rule 33 motion for a new trial. <em>United States v. Figueroa, </em>548 F.3d 222, 226 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the Order of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
