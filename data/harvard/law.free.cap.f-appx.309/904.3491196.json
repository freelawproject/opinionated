He asserts that there was insufficient evidence to prove that he knowingly possessed with the intent to distribute the marijuana that was found in the van he was driving. However, the jury heard testimony from the van\u2019s passenger, Molina\u2019s former fianc\u00e9e, that Molina knew the marijuana was hidden in the van\u2019s gas tank and that he was to be paid for helping to smuggle it. She also testified that he had accompanied her on previous smuggling trips, knowing there was marijuana in the van, and received payment for doing so. Although Molina challenges the witness\u2019s credibility, we must view it in the light most favorable to the guilty verdict. <em>See United States v. Villarreal, </em>324 F.3d 319, 322 (5th Cir.2003). The element of intent also is supported by the testimony of the arresting state trooper that Molina suspiciously answered the trooper\u2019s questions. Because a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Molina aided and abetted the knowing possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute, his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence fails. <em>See United States v. Jaramillo, </em>42 F.3d 920, 922-23 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Molina also asserts that he is entitled to a new trial because the district court admitted receipts showing a financial transaction between his former fianc\u00e9e and an unindicted coconspirator that were more prejudicial than probative under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. Although Molina asserts that harmless error review applies, the issue was not preserved. <em>See United States v. Jimenez Lopez, </em>873 F.2d 769, 773 (5th Cir.1989). He fails to establish plain error because he does not explain how the admission of the receipts affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b930-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
