Straus, <em>Immigration Judge), </em>and (2) denying petitioner\u2019s motion to remand. <em>See In re Barron, </em>No. A73 612 221 (B.I.A. Apr. 16, 2008). The Immigration Judge concluded that petitioner had abandoned her application for cancellation of removal and ordered voluntary departure by April 12, 2007.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Before our Court, petitioner argues principally that the Immigration Judge\u2019s instruction regarding the deadline to file an application for cancellation of removal was inconsistent with applicable regulations. Petitioner also argues that she was denied due process of law, in violation of the Fifth Amendment, because she was not permitted to explain her reasons for not filing a timely application to the Immigration Judge, and that the BIA erred in not remanding her case for further proceedings. We assume the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Where, as here, \u201cthe BIA issues an opinion, the opinion becomes the basis for judicial review of the decision of which the alien is complaining.\u201d <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the questions of regulatory interpretation and due process \u201cinvolve! ] the application of law to undisputed fact, we review the issue[s] <em>de novo, </em>according the agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation substantial deference unless that interpretation is inconsistent with the plain language of the regulation.\u201d <em>Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). Finally, we review the BIA\u2019s decision to deny petitioner\u2019s motion for remand under a deferential \u201cabuse-of-discretion\u201d standard. <em>See Li Yong Cao v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>421 F.3d 149, 157 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Petitioner\u2019s principal argument is that the Immigration Judge\u2019s instructions disregarded applicable regulations. At a hearing on June 22, 2006, the Immigration Judge ordered petitioner to file an application for cancellation of removal by February 9, 2007 and \u2014 addressing petitioner directly \u2014 stated that \u201cif that application is not timely filed, your application will be denied as abandoned and an order of removal will be issued. It is critical that you make sure your attorney files that application on time.\u201d (Tr. of Proceedings, June 22, 1996, 4:19-21.) A week after the February 9 deadline passed, and no application having been filed, the Immigration Judge ordered petitioner\u2019s voluntary departure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Before the BIA, petitioner argued that the Immigration Judge\u2019s instruction was inadequate because he did not mention the \u201cgood cause\u201d exception in the applicable regulation. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.47(c) (\u201cFailure to file necessary documentation ... within the time allowed by the immigration judge\u2019s order, constitutes abandonment of the application and the immigration judge may enter an appropriate order dismissing the application <em>unless the applicant demonstrates that such failure was the result of good cause.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). The BIA rejected this argument because, in its view, \u201c[t]he regulations do not require the Immigration Judge to provide such instruction.\u201d <em>In re Barron, </em>No. A73 612 221, at 1. We agree. The text of the regulation does not require an immigration judge to inform aliens of the \u201cgood cause\u201d exception, and petitioner has not pointed to any authority that does.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Regarding petitioner\u2019s claim that she was denied the due process of law, we reject petitioner\u2019s argument that the Immigration Judge \u201cignore[d] the statutory and regulatory requirements,\u201d for the reasons stated above. On a more fundamental level, we have previously held that \u201c[a]ll aliens within the United States, whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent, are entitled to procedural fairness.\u201d <em>Ali v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 478, 490 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). The traditional constitutional minima for due process apply: an alien \u201cmust be afforded the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner, by an impartial and disinterested tribunal, and in a proceeding that is adequate to allow judicial review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). We see no violation of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>minimal constitutional requirements in the record before us. Petitioner had more than seven months \u2014 from her hearing in June 2006 to the application deadline in February 2007 \u2014 to prepare an application for cancellation of removal or, as the BIA observed, to request additional time to file. <em>See In re Barron, </em>No. A73 612 221, at 2. When the deadline expired, and petitioner had not submitted an application, she had received all the process that she was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Finally, in assessing petitioner\u2019s motion for remand, the BIA considered and rejected petitioner\u2019s two explanations as to why she had \u201cgood cause\u201d to delay filing her application. (We note that petitioner\u2019s application was not just late; it was never filed.) First, petitioner argued that there was a breakdown in the relationship with her attorneys. However, as the BIA observed, petitioner does not contest that she did not cooperate with her former attorney, which led to counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw from the case. <em>See id. </em>Second, petitioner argued that her daughter suffered a seizure in January 2007, and that all her energies were focused exclusively on her daughter\u2019s recovery. However, the BIA determined that remand was unwarranted because petitioner was nonetheless \u201caware of her obligation to file her application for cancellation of removal by the date provided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We find no abuse of discretion in these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we DENY the petition for review. As a housekeeping matter, we VACATE our December 30, 2008 order granting petitioner\u2019s May 19, 2008 motion for a stay of removal until the petition for review is decided, and now DENY her motion for a stay of removal. The Clerk of Court is instructed to update the docket accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-15\">. The BIA rescinded the Immigration Judge\u2019s order of <em>voluntary </em>departure because petitioner had not requested that form of relief from removal. <em>See In re Barron, </em>No. A73 612 221, at 2 (B.I.A. Apr. 16, 2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b494-6\">. Petitioner was represented by different counsel in the proceedings before the Immigration Judge. On January 29, 2007, petitioner\u2019s counsel filed a motion to withdraw from representation citing a \"broken down\u201d attorney-client relationship and petitioner\u2019s failure to respond to counsel\u2019s letters and telephone messages. Petitioner does not challenge these allegations on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
