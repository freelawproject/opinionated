Gonzales, </em>411 F.3d 977, 982-83 (8th Cir.2005) (standard of review); <em>see also Quomsieh v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 602, 605 (8th Cir. 2007) (when BIA adopts IJ\u2019s decision and adds its own reasoning, this court reviews both decisions together). Because Tarce alleged the same factual basis for all his claims, the conclusions that support the denial of his asylum claim also support the denial of his withholding-of-removal and CAT claims. <em>See Samedov v. Gonzales, </em>422 F.3d 704, 708-09 (8th Cir.2005).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
