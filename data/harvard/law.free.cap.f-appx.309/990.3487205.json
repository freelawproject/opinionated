Wharton contends that Gorman-Rupp\u2019s rejection of her application for the position of executive administrative assistant was motivated by age-based discrimination, as evidenced by comments made to her by the company\u2019s vice-president of human resources. She also alleges that the company retaliated against her for complaining about alleged age discrimination and sexual harassment when the same vice-president accosted her in the company parking lot and when her supervisor allegedly increased his scrutiny and criticism of her performance, resulting in a lower-than-expected pay raise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-18\">The district court held that, although the vice-president\u2019s alleged statements that Gorman-Rupp was \u201clooking down the road\u201d and \u201cwanted longevity\u201d constituted direct evidence of age discrimination, he was not a \u201cdecision maker\u201d in the hiring process and no evidence suggested that the purported decision maker harbored age-based discriminatory animus. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>district court also ruled that the parking lot incident did not qualify as a materially adverse employment action and that the company\u2019s criticisms and negative evaluation of Wharton stemmed from her longstanding performance deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">For the reasons that follow, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Wharton\u2019s age discrimination and retaliation claims and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">Since 1997, Wharton has been employed by The Gorman-Rupp Company in a variety of administrative support positions at its corporate offices in Mansfield, Ohio. She currently works as an engineering coordinator.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">Wharton alleges that, throughout her employment at Gorman-Rupp, Lee Wilkins, GormanRupp\u2019s vice-president of human resources, made offensive sexual comments to her. She also contends that Gorman-Rupp denied her application for its newly created position of executive administrative assistant because of her age.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">In September 2005, when Wharton was 58 years old, she applied for the executive administrative assistant position. According to the position\u2019s advertisement, the successful applicant would be required \u201cto work with company officers\u201d and communicate with its Board of Directors and shareholders. A committee of Gorman-Rupp executive officers, including Wilkins, senior vice-president and chief financial officer Robert Kirkendall, chief information officer William Danuloff, and treasurer Judith Sovine interviewed Wharton for the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-11\">Approximately two months after her interview, Wharton alleges that Wilkins told her that, although she performed very well at the interview, Gorman-Rupp did not select her for the position because \u201c[w]e were looking down the road, we wanted longevity.\u201d She then allegedly asked what he meant by \u201clongevity.\u201d Wilkins purportedly responded that \u201c[wje\u2019re both baby boomers,\u201d asked how old she was and how much longer she had to work before she retired, and remarked that she would be retiring \u201cbefore too long\u201d and that the company \u201cwent with a younger person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-12\">Wilkins allegedly made similar age-related comments to 49-year-old Susie Beckwith, another Gorman-Rupp employee who was interviewed but not selected for the same position. According to Beck-with, Wilkins told her that she was also rejected because of \u201clongevity and looking down the road.\u201d Beckwith testified in her deposition that the remark \u201cstung\u201d and that she responded, \u201cYou\u2019re telling me I\u2019m too old to replace somebody that was older than my mother?\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gorman-Rupp selected 31-year-old Sherri Green, a Gorman-Rupp employee, for the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-13\">On June 5, 2007, Wharton\u2019s attorney wrote a letter to Gorman-Rupp detailing her client\u2019s allegations of age discrimination and sexual harassment. Approximately three weeks later, on June 28, 2007, Wharton\u2019s supervisor, Craig Redmond, gave her what she characterizes as her first \u201cperformance deficiency notice\u201d that she had ever received during her ten years of employment at the company. The no<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>tice advised Wharton that she would not receive a full salary increase because of various attendance and performance concerns. According to Wharton, after her attorney complained, Redmond treated her \u201cdifferently\u201d by constantly nit-picking at her work and criticizing her for the slightest errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Wharton also alleges that on July 17, 2007, Wilkins accosted her in the company parking lot. According to Wharton, Wilkins approached her car, began yelling at her loudly, and called her \u201ca piece of shit.\u201d \u201cHis face was very angry,\u201d and Wharton \u201cfeared that he might strike\u201d her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">Gorman-Rupp temporary employee Scott Heslep witnessed the incident. According to Heslep, he heard Wilkins \u201cvery loudly say \u2018of shit,\u2019 \u201d characterized the tone in Wilkins\u2019s voice as \u201cone of extreme anger,\u201d and described the look Wilkins gave to Wharton as \u201cone of hate\u201d and \u201cvery threatening.\u201d Heslep also stated that \u201cMr. Wilkins\u2019 demeanor and voice frightened me, as I was not sure what he would do next.\u201d After Heslep reported to work, he \u201cwas still bothered by what [he] witnessed in the parking lot.\u201d He went to Wharton\u2019s office \u201cto see if she was alright,\u201d and she appeared to be \u201cvisibly upset.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">On August 23, 2007, Wharton filed suit against Gorman-Rupp in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, asserting several state law claims against the company.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The claims relevant to this appeal are Wharton\u2019s claims for age discrimination under Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 4112.14(A) and retaliation for complaining about age and sex discrimination under Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 4112.02(I).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1019-11\">On April 9, 2008, the district court granted summary judgment in Gorman-Rupp\u2019s favor on Wharton\u2019s claims of age discrimination and retaliation. Regarding her age discrimination claim, the court ruled that, although Wilkins\u2019s comments constituted direct evidence of age discrimination, there was no causal connection between the remarks and Gorman-Rupp\u2019s decision not to hire Wharton for the executive administrative assistant position. Specifically, the court found that, although Wilkins was a member of the hiring committee, CFO Kirkendall was the \u201cfinal\u201d and \u201csole\u201d decision maker and Wilkins\u2019s opinion did not \u201cultimately control, or even significantly influence,\u201d Kirkendall\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-12\">In so ruling, the court relied on four affidavits submitted by Kirkendall, Danuloff, Sovine, and Wilkins. According to those affidavits, which were virtually identical, Wilkins was a member of a committee convened by Kirkendall and tasked to define the job, advertise it, and screen resum\u00e9s from external applicants. Kirkendall, not the other committee members, was allegedly charged with making the hiring decision. Kirkendall purportedly decided \u201cearly in the process\u201d that the committee would interview all Gorman-Rupp employees who applied for the position, regardless of their qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>After interviewing ten applicants, the four committee members allegedly \u201cunanimously agreed\u201d about the top two finalists for the position, having ranked the applicants separately before disclosing their choices to the rest of the committee. According to Kirkendall\u2019s affidavit,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-4\">[t]here was no dissent within the committee and no discussion about any of the other applicants, including Ms. Wharton. No one tried to persuade me that any other applicant, including Ms. Wharton, should be included on the finalist list, and no one tried to dissuade me from picking [the two finalists]. Ms. Wharton\u2019s name was never mentioned by anyone in the committee or by me as a viable contender, or at all, following her interview. No one on the committee ever tried to influence any opinion I had formed of Ms. Wharton, negatively or positively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-5\">No committee member raised the issues of age or retirement regarding any of the interviewees, either in public or with me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1020-6\">The affidavits consistently stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-7\">Ms. Wharton\u2019s interview on November 11, 2005, was lackluster and unimpressive from the beginning. She gave a limp, unenthusiastic handshake. She came across as not very interested in the position and lacking in conviction about her qualifications. She seemed as though she took the interview process for granted and considered it to be merely perfunctory. Her grammar was poor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-8\">^ ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-9\">I do not believe, based on the credentials she presented, that Ms. Wharton was sufficiently qualified for the Executive Administrative Assistant position, and she certainly was not as qualified as the majority of the other candidates. I ultimately viewed her experience as being insufficiently \u201cexecutive\u201d and \u201cadministrative\u201d in nature, and her disengaged, grammatically incorrect interview performance just confirmed my opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-12\">Ms. Wharton was less qualified on paper, she interviewed poorly, and her skills and experience ranked her at or near the bottom of my list of all the applicants we interviewed.<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1020-13\">Regarding Wharton\u2019s retaliation claims, the court ruled that Wilkins\u2019s \u201coccasional insults\u201d did not satisfy the prima facie case for retaliation because they did not qualify as materially adverse employment actions. It also held that Redmond\u2019s alleged heights ened scrutiny and unfavorable evaluation of Wharton resulting in denial of a full pay raise were legitimate and non-discriminatory because the company documented her \u201clongstanding work performance deficiencies\u201d two years before she complained about alleged discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-14\">Wharton timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-16\">A district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo. <em>Johnson v. Univ. of Cincinnati, </em>215 F.3d 561, 572 (6th Cir.2000). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">The moving party bears the initial burden of specifying the basis for its motion and of identifying the portion of the record which demonstrates the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). Once the moving party satisfies this burden, the non-moving party must then produce specific facts demonstrating that a genuine issue of material fact exists for trial. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-6\">The court must view all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986); <em>Williams v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>187 F.3d 553, 560 (6th Cir.1999). However, the \u201cmere existence of <em>some </em>alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no <em>genuine </em>issue of <em>material </em>fact.\u201d <em>Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. at 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505 (1986) (emphasis in original). Thus, only disputed material facts, those \u201cthat might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law,\u201d will preclude summary judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 4112.14(A) makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against any job applicant \u201caged forty or older who is physically able to perform the duties and otherwise meets the established requirements of the job and laws pertaining to the relationship between employer and employee.\u201d Age discrimination claims brought under Ohio law are analyzed under the same standards as federal claims brought under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d). <em>Minadeo v. ICI Paints, </em>398 F.3d 751, 763 (6th Cir.2005) (citation omitted); <em>Barker v. Scovill, Inc., </em>6 Ohio St.3d 146, 451 N.E.2d 807, 809 (1983). Under the ADEA, a plaintiff may demonstrate age discrimination by presenting either direct or indirect (circumstantial) evidence. <em>Smith v. Chrysler Corp., </em>155 F.3d 799, 805 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">Direct evidence is \u201cevidence that proves the existence of a fact without requiring any inferences.\u201d <em>Blair v. Henry Filters, Inc., </em>505 F.3d 517, 523 (6th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Rowan v. Lockheed Martin Energy Sys., Inc., </em>360 F.3d 544, 548 (6th Cir. 2004)). Comments \u201cfrom the lips\u201d of the employer \u201cproclaiming his or her ... animus\u201d constitute direct evidence of discrimination. <em>Smith v. Chrysler Corp., </em>155 F.3d 799, 805 (6th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Robinson v. Runyon, </em>149 F.3d 507, 513 (6th Cir.1998)). <em>See also Coburn v. Rockwell Automation, Inc., </em>238 F. App\u2019x 112, 116 (6th Cir.2007) (unpublished) (stating that \u201cdirect evidence is found ... where a statement by an employer directly shows there is a discriminatory motive.\u201d) (quoting <em>Olive v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., </em>Nos. 75249 &amp; 76349, 2000 WL 263261, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 914 (Ohio Ct.App. March 9, 2000)). The statement must not be \u201cisolated, ambiguous, or abstract\u201d and must be a remark \u201cby the employer.\u201d <em>Coburn, </em>238 F. App\u2019x at 117-18 (quoting <em>Hoyt v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>No. 04AP941, 2005 WL 3220192, 2005 Ohio App. LEXIS 5700 (Ohio Ct.App. Dec. 1, 2005)). A discriminatory comment is attributable to the employer when it is made by a \u201cdecision maker.\u201d <em>Coburn, </em>238 F. App\u2019x at 118 (noting the \u201cvital difference\u201d between dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>criminatory statements by corporate decision makers and \u201cstray remarks\u201d by personnel who are unrelated to the decision making process) (quoting <em>Molnar v. Klammer, No.</em>2004-L-072-CA, 2005 WL 3528870, 2005 Ohio App. LEXIS 6227 (Ohio Ct.App. Dec. 23, 2005)). When a plaintiff offers direct evidence of discrimination, \u201cthe case should proceed as an ordinary civil matter[,]\u201d and \u201cthe burden shifts to the employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision absent the impermissible motive.\u201d <em>Blair, </em>505 F.3d at 523-24 (citations omitted). <em>See Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, </em>490 U.S. 228, 244-45 n. 10, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">Wharton contends that Wilkins\u2019s explanation about why the hiring committee did not select her for the executive administrative assistant position constituted direct evidence of age discrimination. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to Wharton, Wilkins\u2019s alleged remarks to Wharton that the company was \u201clooking down the road,\u201d \u201cwanted longevity,\u201d characterization of her as a \u201cbaby boomer\u201d in response to her request for an explanation about what he meant by \u201clongevity,\u201d questions about Wharton\u2019s age and how much longer she had before she retired, and comments that she would be retiring \u201cbefore too long\u201d and that the company \u201cwent with a younger person\u201d were not isolated, ambiguous, or abstract; rather, they directly concerned the specific hiring decision, and they can be interpreted as discriminatory. Further, Wharton need not rely on her own allegations to create a genuine issue of material fact about whether Wilkins made the comments because applicant Susie Beckwith also submitted an affidavit stating that Wilkins made similar comments to her when explaining why <em>she </em>was not selected for the same job. Both Wharton and Beckwith interpreted Wilkins\u2019s alleged remarks as age-based discrimination, Beck-with responding to Wilkins\u2019s alleged explanation by asking him, \u2018You\u2019re telling me I\u2019m too old to replace somebody that was older than my mother?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-11\">Although the parties frame the dispositive issue as whether Wilkins was a \u201cdecision maker,\u201d and the district court found that he was not, Wharton need not rely on that inquiry to impute Wilkins\u2019s comments to Gorman-Rupp. It is undisputed that Wilkins witnessed all or most aspects of the hiring process. Again considering the evidence in the light most favorable to Wharton, Wilkins, as a witness with personal knowledge, directly implicated all members of the hiring committee, including Kirkendall himself, the undisputed \u201cdecision maker,\u201d in alleged discriminatory conduct when he explained the hiring committee\u2019s decision to Wharton using the first-person plural \u201cwe.\u201d (\u201cWe were looking down the road, <em>we </em>wanted longevity.\u201d) Accordingly, we hold that the remarks are properly attributable to Gorman-Rupp at the summary judgment stage of analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-12\">Because Wharton presented direct evidence of age discrimination via Wilkins\u2019s comments, she need not establish the prima facie case required by the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting test and applicable when a plaintiffs discrimination claim relies solely on circumstantial evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Blair, </em>505 F.3d at 523-24 (citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number><em>McDonnell Douglas v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973)). However, we express no opinion about the merits of Gorman-Rupp\u2019s asserted defense \u2014 that it would have made the same decision not to hire Wharton for the position absent its alleged discriminatory motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">For the reasons stated, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Gorman-Rupp on Wharton\u2019s age discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">Wharton also contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Gorman-Rupp on her retaliation claims. She alleges that after her attorney sent Gorman-Rupp a letter complaining about alleged age discrimination and sexual harassment, it retaliated against her in two ways: (1) Wilkins accosted her in the company parking lot, and (2) Redmond increased his scrutiny and criticism of her work and issued a \u201cperformance deficiency notice\u201d that resulted in denial of a full salary increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 4112.02(1) makes it unlawful \u201c[f]or any person to discriminate in any manner against any other person because that person has opposed any unlawful discriminatory practice____\u201d Wharton agrees that her retaliation claims are based on circumstantial evidence. Retaliation claims arising under Ohio law that are based on circumstantial evidence are analyzed under the same <em>McDonnell Douglas/Burdine </em>evidentiary framework used to assess claims of discrimination. <em>Imwalle v. Reliance Med. Prods., Inc., </em>515 F.3d 531, 544 (6th Cir.2008) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">Under this test, a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of retaliation by demonstrating that (1) she engaged in protected activity; (2) the employer knew that she exercised her protected civil rights; (3) the employer thereafter discriminated against her in a materially adverse way; and (4) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). If the plaintiff satisfies all prima facie elements, the burden then shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for its actions. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). If the employer meets its burden of production, \u201cthe plaintiff must then demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reason offered by the defendant was not its true reason, but instead was a pretext designed to mask retaliation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-13\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-14\">Regarding the parking lot incident, the court held that Wilkins\u2019s alleged conduct was not a materially adverse employment action as required by the third element of the prima facie case. Specifically, the court found that such conduct, \u201ceven if insulting, fail[ed] to rise to the level of severity required to constitute behavior that would deter an employee from reporting discrimination.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-15\">The Supreme Court has stated that an action is \u201cmaterially adverse\u201d if it would \u201cdissuade! ] a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d <em>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. v. White, </em>548 U.S. 53, 68, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>anti-discrimination laws were not intended to mandate \u201ca general civility code for the American workplace,\u201d <em>id. </em>(citation omitted), \u201cpetty slights, minor annoyances, and simple lack of good manners will not create such a deterrence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cContext matters,\u201d and the deterrent impact of the alleged conduct must be judged by an \u201cobjective standard,\u201d taking into account the reactions of a \u201creasonable employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68-69, 126 S.Ct. 2405.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">Here, Wilkins\u2019s alleged conduct in the parking lot qualifies as a materially adverse employment action. Although the district court characterized the encounter as an \u201coccasional insult\u201d or \u201cstray comment,\u201d a disinterested witness to the incident, temporary employee Scott Heslep, perceived it quite differently. Heslep confirmed that he heard Wilkins yell \u201cof shit\u201d at Wharton, described the tone in Wilkins\u2019s voice as \u201cone of extreme anger,\u201d characterized the look that Wilkins gave to Wharton as \u201cone of hate\u201d and \u201cvery threatening,\u201d and stated that Wilkins\u2019s \u201cdemeanor and voice frightened me as I was not sure what he would do next.\u201d Heslep\u2019s description of the events he witnessed corroborates Wharton\u2019s testimony that she feared Wilkins might strike her. Following the incident, Heslep was so concerned about Wharton that he visited her office. According to Heslep, Wharton appeared to be \u201cvisibly upset.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">Threatening behavior by a vice-president of human resources toward a subordinate employee in the company parking lot, where that employee reasonably feels that violence is a real possibility, is likely to dissuade any reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination and transcends the realm of \u201cpetty slights, minor annoyances, and simple lack of good manners.\u201d Accordingly, we hold that the district court erred in finding that, as a matter of law, Wilkins\u2019s conduct in the parking lot was not a materially adverse employment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">Whether Redmond\u2019s alleged criticisms and unfavorable evaluation of Wharton that resulted in denial of a full pay raise were retaliatory are closer questions. The district court found that Gorman-Rupp articulated a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for unfavorably evaluating Wharton and denying her the raise and that she failed to demonstrate that its articulated reason was a pretext for retaliation. According to the court, Wharton had \u201clongstanding work performance deficiencies,\u201d most of which were documented by multiple supervisors in her 2005 and 2006 performance reviews, \u201clong before [she] reported any sex or age discrimination. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">Employers are, of course, permitted to supervise and negatively evaluate their employees. This is particularly true when the employer\u2019s concerns about the employee\u2019s performance predated her complaints about discrimination. <em>See, e.g., Zenni v. Hard Rock Cafe Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>903 F.Supp. 644, 655-56 (S.D.N.Y.1995) (holding that the plaintiff did not establish the causation element of the prima facie case for retaliation where he committed infractions and the employer negatively evaluated him before he complained about alleged discrimination); <em>Lawson v. Getty Terminals Corp., </em>866 F.Supp. 793, 804 (S.D.N.Y.1994) (holding that the plaintiff failed to establish the causation element of the prima facie case for retaliation where his employer informed him that it was dissatisfied with his performance and verbally counseled him about his failure to perform required job <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>duties before he complained about alleged discrimination). The district court noted Wharton\u2019s admission that Gorman-Rupp criticized her performance years before she complained about discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">Thus, while Gorman-Rupp\u2019s negative appraisals of Wharton\u2019s job performance may have been legitimate and non-retaliatory because they were longstanding, the major point of contention appears to be that Wharton always received her full pay raise in prior years <em>despite </em>such negative evaluations. Recognizing that fact, the district court inexplicably contradicted itself when it held that the same evidence precluding summary judgment on Wharton\u2019s FMLA interference claim <em>justified </em>summary judgment on her retaliation claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-6\">[T]he Defendant says that Plaintiff Wharton\u2019s work performance problems existed long before she took FMLA leave and that these problems constituted independent reasons to deny her the full salary increase. The record shows that the Plaintiff was indeed criticized for many of the same work performance problems in 2005 and 2006 as she was in 2007. <em>This argument, however, actually supports the Plaintiff\u2019s claim </em>that the Defendant wrongfully used her FMLAcovered absences to deny her a full raise in June 2007. The evidence suggests that the only substantive difference between the Plaintiffs 2005 and 2007 performance reviews is that the Plaintiff was criticized for her FMLA absences in the latter evaluation. <em>Despite her alleged similar work performance problems, </em>the Plaintiff received a 4.49% salary increase on July 1, 2005 and a 4.94% salary increase on July 1, 2006. On July 1, 2007, however, she only received a 2.04% salary increase. This evidence raises a genuine issue of material fact because a jury could reasonably find that the Defendant thus used the Plaintiff\u2019s FMLA leave against her, at least in part, in making its salary decisions in 2007.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-9\">Based on the apparent incongruity in the district court\u2019s analyses of Wharton\u2019s FMLA and retaliation claims and our duty to construe the facts in the light most favorable to Wharton, we conclude that the legitimacy of Gorman-Rupp\u2019s articulated non-retaliatory reason for denying Wharton the full pay raise three weeks after she complained \u2014 her deficient performance \u2014 is sufficiently called into question by the company\u2019s history of granting her full pay raises in previous years, despite its criticisms of her work performance and the close temporal proximity between her attorney\u2019s letter and the adverse action. <em>See Wexler v. White\u2019s Fine Furniture, Inc., </em>317 F.3d 564, 576 (6th Cir.2003) (holding that a plaintiff may demonstrate that an employer\u2019s proffered explanation for its conduct is pretextual where the plaintiff shows that the given reason \u201cdid not actually motivate the employer\u2019s conduct\u201d or \u201cwas insufficient to warrant the challenged conduct.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-10\">For these reasons, the district court erred in finding that Wharton failed to create a triable issue of fact about whether Gorman-Rupp\u2019s articulated legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for denying her a full pay raise three weeks after she complained was a pretext for retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-12\">For the reasons stated, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Wharton\u2019s age discrimination and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>retaliation claims and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1018-9\">. Gorman-Rupp created the executive administrative assistant position after 70-year-old Iris Wertz retired.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">.

The court also determined that a spreadsheet containing a \"years of work\u201d column that was used in the interview process did not demonstrate age-related bias, nor did it influence the hiring decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">. Regarding the spreadsheet containing a \"years of work\u201d column, we agree with the district court that it was not direct evidence of age discrimination. In fact, \"years of work,\u201d which may be synonymous with \u201cexperi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>ence,\u201d is a legit\u00edmate, non-discriminatoiy hiring consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
