The court has determined that the issues pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>sented occasion no need for a published opinion. <em>See </em>D.C. Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Appellant, an employee of the Department of Education, sued the Department, claiming her performance evaluation of \u201csuccessful\u201d constituted an adverse employment action. However, \u201cpoor performance evaluations are not necessarily adverse actions and they should not be considered such if they did not affect the employee\u2019s grade or salary.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Small, </em>350 F.3d 1286, 1293 (D.C.Cir.2003); <em>see also Russell v. Principi, </em>257 F.3d 815, 819 (D.C.Cir.2001). Appellant argued for the first time in her opposition to summary judgment that her performance evaluation resulted in a lesser bonus, but she offered no notice of such a link in her complaint. At oral argument, Appellant cited <em>Steele v. Schafer, </em>535 F.3d 689 (D.C.Cir.2008), to support the sufficiency of her complaint, but the complaint in <em>Steele </em>expressly referenced a hostile workplace, <em>id. </em>at 694. Here, Appellant\u2019s complaint merely referenced benefits generally. But assuming her complaint sufficed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8, the Department has offered a reasonable explanation for Appellant\u2019s 2003 performance evaluation, and Appellant has failed to show that this explanation was pretextual.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-9\">. Because the mandatory exhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional, <em>see Munsell v. Dep\u2019t of Agriculture, </em>509 F.3d 572, 581 (D.C.Cir. 2007); <em>In re James, </em>444 F.3d 643, 647-48 (D.C.Cir.2006), we do not decide whether Appellant adequately exhausted her administrative remedies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
