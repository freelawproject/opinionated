INA \u00a7 241(b)(3); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c). The Board concluded that Plata-Vega failed to prove that he suffered past prosecution or faced the probability of future persecution in Colombia. We deny Plata-Vega\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Plata-Vega and his family entered the United States in January 2005 as nonimmigrant visitors. In August 2005, PlataVega, on behalf of himself, his wife, and their children, filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act and the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. PlataVega sought relief based on his political opinion and membership in a particular social group.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Plata-Vega alleged that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) threatened him and his family after his cousin, Hilis Plata, was elected mayor of Manaure, Colombia, in 2001. Plata-Vega did not join a political party in Colombia, but worked with Hilis, a member of the Liberal Party, to counsel children to refrain from guerilla activities. Plata-Vega operated a family farm in Manaure, but lived 35 kilometers away in Valledupar where he owned several clothing stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">In April 2002, FARC ordered Hilis to resign as mayor. The next month, a bomb exploded in Hilis\u2019s office while the building was closed for lunch. Several days later, members of FARC confronted Plata-Vega on his farm and ordered him to stop collaborating with Hilis and to abandon the property. Plata-Vega visited the United States in February 2003, but he did not request asylum because he was \u201con vacation,\u201d his family did not have visas, and he did not believe that the \u201cthreats were that great.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">In November 2003, FARC mailed a letter to Plata-Vega in Valledupar and instructed him to end his collaboration with his cousin and to leave his farm. PlataVega received a second letter from the FARC in September 2004 that contained the same instructions and cautioned PlataVega that they had planted antipersonnel mines around the farm. In November 2004, Plata-Vega complained to authorities about the threats he had received, but the government did not offer him protection. After Plata-Vega\u2019s cousin Eliezar Plata disappeared, Plata-Vega and his family moved to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">Plata-Vega submitted several documents in support of his application. He filed a copy of the April 2002 letter in which FARC instructed Hilis to resign and a second letter that threatened to harm Hilis\u2019s family if he did not resign; newspaper articles that described the bombing of Hilis\u2019s office at city hall and the November 2004 disappearance of Plata Vega\u2019s cousin; and copies of the November 2003 and September 2004 letters from FARC to PlataVega. Plata-Vega also filed a declaration from an office of human rights that stated that he and his family had been displaced by violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-12\">At his removal hearing, Plata-Vega explained that he postponed reporting the threats to Colombian authorities because he was too busy to stop his activities. He stated that he returned to Colombia after his three visits to the United States because he thought the FARC would stop their threats. Plata-Vega acknowledged that his mother, sister, and brother, and Hilis and his family, remained in Colombia unharmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>The immigration judge found PlataVega credible, but ruled that he failed to meet the burden of proof for asylum and withholding of removal. The immigration judge found that Plata-Vega had based his application \u201con the activities of\u2019 Hilis. Hilis\u2019s continued residence in Colombia \u201cdiminishe[d]\u201d Plata-Vega\u2019s request for asylum. The judge gave the letters from FARC to Plata-Vega \u201climited weight or no weight at all\u201d because they were on different letterhead and because of \u201cthe level of fraud in this particular area.\u201d The judge found that Hilis had been the likely target of the bombing; the FARC threatened, but never harmed Plata-Vega; PlataVega\u2019s return to Colombia as the violence allegedly escalated undercut his argument that he feared for his life; and because Hilis had left office, there was \u201cno reason as to why anyone would want to harm\u201d Plata-Vega if he returned to Colombia. The judge found that Plata-Vega \u201cand his family were not displaced individuals\u201d though they were \u201cdispossessed of\u2019 the farm because there was \u201cno evidence that anyone harmed [Plata-Vega] in Valledupar\u201d or that he \u201ccould not continue to reside\u201d there. Based on these findings, the judge concluded that Plata-Vega had not suffered past persecution and did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The Board dismissed Plata-Vega\u2019s appeal. The Board found that Plata-Vega did not establish that he or his cousin was a target of the bombing and the threats he had received did \u201cnot rise to the level of past persecution.\u201d The Board agreed with the immigration judge that Plata-Vega did not establish a well-founded fear of persecution because he failed to prove that he had suffered past persecution and his family had remained in Colombia unharmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">We review the decision of the Board to determine whether it is \u201c \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Lorisme v. INS, </em>129 F.3d 1441, 1444-45 (11th Cir.1997)). \u201cTo reverse [those] fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1218 (11th Cir. 2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">Substantial evidence supports the finding that Plata-Vega did not have a well-founded fear of future prosecution. PlataVega testified that he vacationed in the United States as the threats against him allegedly escalated, but he returned to Colombia despite these threats. Plata-Vega also did not suffer any physical harm. Plata-Vega\u2019s cousin has left his political office and Plata-Vega, who had never joined the Liberal Party, has discontinued his activities that were adverse to the FARC. <em>See Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1237-38 (11th Cir.2006). PlataVega retained his home in Valledupar, and his family and Hilis\u2019 family remain unharmed in Colombia. <em>See De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1011-12 (11th Cir.2008). The record does not compel \u201ca reasonable factfinder ... to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution exists.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">Plata-Vega\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
