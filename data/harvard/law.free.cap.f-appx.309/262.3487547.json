R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-26\">Defendant-Appellant Jeremiah Vaughn Gregory, Jr. appeals his conviction for assaulting a federal correctional officer in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(a)(1) and (b). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Appearing pro se, as he did at his trial, Mr. Gregory contends he was not permitted to present his defense theory \u2014 namely, that his actions were justified as an act of war \u2014 to the jury. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Mr. Gregory is a self-described \u201coutlaw revolutionary combatant in the Great Aryan Revolution.\u201d Since 1988, he has been a member of a radical white supremacist organization called The Order. The organization\u2019s agenda is to destabilize the United States government with the intent of establishing an all-white nation in five western states. In furtherance of those objectives, Mr. Gregory robbed a bank in Montana and a bank in Utah. He was convicted of the robberies in the United States District Court for the District of Montana and the District of Utah and was ultimately sentenced to two consecutive terms of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">While he was incarcerated at the United States Penitentiary in Florence, Colorado (\u201cUSP-Florence\u201d), Mr. Gregory threw a scalding hot mixture of floor wax and water into the face of Federal Correctional Officer Mark Robles. The next day, and after being advised of and waiving his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), Mr. Gregory gave a detailed confession to two FBI agents. He was subsequently charged with assault under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(a)(1) and (b). Mr. Gregory represented himself at trial, and he and the FBI agents testified to the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Shortly after arriving at USP-Florence, Mr. Gregory secured a job in the kitchen \u201cfor a very specific reason\u201d \u2014 a \u201cplan.\u201d Specifically, he wanted access to \u201cimportant\u201d people who would come into the officers\u2019 mess hall to eat so that he could attack them and \u201ctry to kill as many of them as he could.\u201d To this end, he secured the staffs trust and was \u201cpretty much\u201d able to have access to anything he wanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">While working in the kitchen, Mr. Gregory learned that Congressman Joel Hefley and his staff were scheduled to visit USP-Florence and eat in the mess hall on August 10, 2006. Mr. Gregory testified that he went to work that day \u201cready to put a plan into action.\u201d He told the jury that he had obtained \u201ca gallon of grease stripper ... an unbelievably caustic chemical that is used to clean industrial ovens.\u201d He testified that he filled a crock pot-type device with the grease stripper and turned it on high to get it to a full boil. The plan was to splash the boiling liquid on the group and then use a multipurpose kitchen knife and a broken broom handle to stab and kill them. Mr. Gregory testified that the plan was thwarted when an outbreak of the chicken pox resulted in him being recalled to his cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-14\">Mr. Gregory testified that he had to create a \u201csecondary plan.\u201d He targeted Officer Robles because he was the most senior federal government employee with whom Mr. Gregory had contact. Knowing that Officer Robles smoked a cigarette every day around 3:20 p.m. in a small room between the housing unit and prison yard, Mr. Gregory planned the attack accordingly. On August 15, 2006, just after 3:00 p.m., Mr. Gregory poured floor wax and water into two thermal cups and microwaved them for eight minutes. He also secured a tube-shaped fluorescent light bulb. Mr. Gregory planned to follow Offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>cer Robles to the small room, throw the liquid in his face in an attempt to blind him, trap him inside the room, and stab him to death with the broken light bulb. Mr. Gregory only succeeded, however, in throwing the scalding mixture in Officer Robles\u2019s face. Officer Robles was able to escape through another door in the room that had accidentally been left unlocked by another prison employee. He suffered first and second-degree burns to his face and neck, and the liquid also melted the lenses of his glasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">After hearing the evidence, the jury returned a guilty verdict. The district court sentenced Mr. Gregory to the statutory maximum of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be served consecutively to the 480 months he was serving for the two bank robbery convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">There is no dispute that Mr. Gregory committed assault under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111. Indeed, he admitted to the crime in his confession to the FBI agents, during direct and cross examination at trial, and in his brief on appeal. Rather, he contends that the district court erroneously refused to present his theory of the defense to the jury. Specifically, he sought to elicit testimony that he is a member of The Order and, as such, is at war with the United States. According to Mr. Gregory, his attack on Officer Robles was justified as an act of war, which places his actions outside the criminal definition of assault. The district court ruled that this theory was neither a legal nor factual defense to the crime charged and prohibited Mr. Gregory from testifying or questioning witnesses about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">We review the district court\u2019s exclusion of evidence that would support Mr. Gregory\u2019s justification theory for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Jordan, </em>485 F.3d 1214, 1218 (10th Cir.2007). We have held that a justification defense to assault under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-9\">(1) that defendant was under an unlawful and present, imminent, and impending threat of such a nature as to induce a well-grounded apprehension of death or serious bodily injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-10\">(2) that defendant had not recklessly or negligently placed himself in a situation in which it was probable that he would be forced to choose the criminal conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-11\">(3) that defendant had no reasonable, legal alternative to violating the law, a chance both to refuse to do the criminal act and also to avoid the threatened harm; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-12\">(4) that a direct causal relationship may be reasonably anticipated between the criminal action taken and the avoidance of the threatened harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-13\"><em>United States v. Jones, </em>254 Fed.Appx. 711, 721 (10th Cir. Nov.7, 2007). Mr. Gregory\u2019s characterization of the attack as an act of war does not change the fact that Mr. Gregory planned the attack, which was also unprovoked as a matter of law. The facts and evidence he wished to elicit at trial have no bearing on the standard to invoke a justification defense. Thus, the district court did not err in prohibiting Mr. Gregory from presenting that defense theory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b290-15\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Mr. Gregory\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-9\">.
