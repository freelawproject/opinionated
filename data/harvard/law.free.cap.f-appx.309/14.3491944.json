Hollis appeals, but his newly appointed counsel cannot identify any nonfrivolous arguments to pursue and moves to withdraw. See <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Hollis opposes counsel\u2019s motion. See Cie. R. 51(b). We confine our review to the potential issues outlined in counsel\u2019s facially adequate brief and in Hollis\u2019s response. See <em>United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-26\">The government estimated that Hollis, who worked for the United States Postal Service as a window clerk, stole $52,560 from his cash drawer over a four-year period. Penelope Mundo, a postal inspector, testified at sentencing that on more than 400 occasions Hollis manipulated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>rental payments for post office boxes to disguise his thefts of cash. During her investigation, Agent Mundo even videotaped Hollis pocketing money from the cash register several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">During the plea colloquy, Hollis admitted only that he stole more than $1,000\u2014 the threshold for a felony \u2014 and at sentencing he disputed the government\u2019s calculation of loss. Hollis testified that his cash drawer was always short of change at the start of his shift, and so he regularly added $800 of his own money. The cash he was seen removing at the end of the day, Hollis continued, was his own money. Agent Mundo countered that when she conducted surveillance at the start of Hollis\u2019s shifts, she never saw him place cash into his register. Hollis\u2019s supervisors denied that they had a problem with too little change.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The district court calculated a total offense level of 12. The court began with a base offense level of six, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(a)(2), and added six levels because of the amount of loss, see <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(D). The court credited the government\u2019s loss estimate of $52,560 and assessed a two-level upward adjustment for obstruction of justice based on Hollis\u2019s insistence on a lower number. See <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1. At the same time, however, the court subtracted two levels for acceptance of responsibility. See <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3El.l(a). The court reasoned that Hollis had \u201csteadfastly admitted that he committed the acts which constitute the offense.\u201d The total offense level of 12 and Hollis\u2019s criminal history category of I yielded an imprisonment range of 10 to 16 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">In the <em>Anders </em>submission, counsel first considers whether Hollis could challenge his guilty plea. Hollis, though, has told counsel that he does not want the plea set aside, and so counsel appropriately omits any discussion of the plea colloquy or the voluntariness of Hollis\u2019s guilty plea. See <em>United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 671 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">Counsel next examines whether Hollis could argue that the district court erred in applying the increase for obstruction of justice on the theory that, since Hollis admitted he committed a crime, he could not have impeded the administration of justice. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. But obstructive conduct includes \u201cproviding materially false information to a judge or magistrate,\u201d and false information is material if it \u201cwould tend to influence or affect the issue under determination\u201d if credited. See <em>id. </em>cmt. nn. 4(f), 6. The district court found that Hollis made \u201ca consistent effort to understate the amount of money that he got as a result of his embezzlement with a goal towards reducing his sentence.\u201d Any challenge to the increase for obstruction thus would be frivolous. See <em>United States v. Sharp, </em>436 F.3d 730, 733, 737 (7th Cir.2006) (upholding increase under \u00a7 3C1.1 where defendant lied at sentencing about drug quantity); <em>United States v. Martin, </em>287 F.3d 609, 620 (7th Cir.2002) (upholding increase where defendant lied at trial about not consenting to a search).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">Counsel also considers whether Hollis could argue that the district court\u2019s loss calculation is clearly erroneous. See <em>United States v. Sykes, </em>357 F.3d 672, 675 (7th Cir.2004) (reviewing calculation of loss for clear error). A sentencing court need only make a reasonable estimate of loss, <em>United States v. Bhutani, </em>266 F.3d 661, 668 (7th Cir.2001), and reversal would be warranted only if the court\u2019s calculation \u201cevokes a \u2018definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Schaefer, </em>291 F.3d 932, 937-37 (7th Cir.2002) (citation omitted). On appeal the burden would be on Hollis to show that the court\u2019s finding is \u201cnot only inaccurate, but also outside the realm of permissible computation.\u201d <em>United States v. Mantas, </em>274 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>1127, 1131 (7th Cir.2001). Hollis did not produce any evidence but simply denied the government\u2019s figure, and so challenging the district court\u2019s loss calculation would be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">In his Rule 51(b) response, Hollis asserts that the court\u2019s calculation is not supported by sufficient evidence. He first contends that the government based its figure on handwritten receipts rather than computer-generated data. Why this would matter is unclear, but in any event Hollis is mistaken. Agent Mundo examined both the computer entries and the paper receipts Hollis created when he siphoned rental payments for post office boxes. Hollis also contends that Mundo should not have been permitted to testify about losses that occurred before she commenced her investigation in 2005. Investigators are not precluded from reconstructing events based on records of past transactions, and Hollis\u2019s contrary suggestion is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Equally frivolous is Hollis\u2019s contention that factors affecting the guidelines range were required to be alleged in the indictment and proved at sentencing beyond a reasonable doubt. We have explained on many occasions that the Supreme Court rejected this contention in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). See, e.g., <em>United States v. Shannon, </em>518 F.3d 494, 496 (7th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Hollins, </em>498 F.3d 622, 633 (7th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Finally, Hollis asserts that trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. A claim of ineffective assistance, however, is better pursued in a collateral proceeding where the record may be fully developed. See <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>394 F.3d 543, 557-58 (7th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">We therefore GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
