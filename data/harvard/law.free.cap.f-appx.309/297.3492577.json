They have abandoned their CAT claim by failing to argue the issue on appeal and have withdrawn their asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-25\">On appeal, the petitioners argue that the BIA erred when it affirmed the IJ\u2019s finding that Ojeda was not credible based on two minor omissions that the BIA incorrectly considered \u201csubstantial.\u201d Additionally, the petitioners assert that they were not required to produce corroborating evidence and argue that the BIA applied the wrong standard when it improperly failed to consider their claim for withholding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>removal after they withdrew their asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u201cWe review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion. Insofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (citations omitted). In the instant case, the BIA issued its own opinion with analysis and also adopted some of the IJ\u2019s reasoning. Therefore, we review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">\u201cTo the extent that the [IJ\u2019s and the] BIA\u2019s decision[s] were based on a legal determination, ... review is <em>de novo. \u201d DMuhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). Factual determinations, including credibility, are reviewed under the substantial-evidence test, which requires that a decision be reversed only if the evidence compels a reasonable fact-finder to find otherwise. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). Under this test, we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818 (quotation omitted). Furthermore, we are required to \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General or Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">[a]ny person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. To establish eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a well-founded fear that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a) and (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">An alien is entitled to withholding of removal to a particular country if he can show that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in that country because of [his] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). \u201cThe alien bears the burden of demonstrating that it is \u2018more likely than not\u2019 [that he] will be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to [his] country.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). \u201cThis is a more stringent standard than for asylum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, where a petitioner fails to establish eligibility for asylum, he likewise fails to establish entitlement to withholding of removal. <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1243 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-14\">Credibility determinations for purposes of withholding of removal are governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-15\">The testimony of the applicant may be sufficient to sustain the applicant\u2019s bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>den without corroboration, but only if the applicant satisfies the trier of fact that the applicant\u2019s testimony is credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee. In determining whether the applicant has met the applicant\u2019s burden, the trier of fact may weigh the credible testimony along with other evidence of record. Where the trier of fact determines that the applicant should provide evidence that corroborates otherwise credible testimony, such evidence must be provided unless the applicant does not have the evidence and cannot reasonably obtain the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii). \u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). Omissions are a proper consideration when evaluating an applicant\u2019s credibility. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287-88 (11th Cir.2005). Furthermore, the IJ is expressly permitted to make adverse credibility determinations based on \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, and all relevant factors,\u201d even if the inconsistencies or omissions at issue do not go to the heart of the claim. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Here, the BIA and IJ concluded that Ojeda was not credible, and their determinations were supported by substantial evidence. The IJ found inconsistencies in Ojeda\u2019s testimony about the threats he received and about the Bolvarian Circle\u2019s attack in 2001. The IJ also found that there was insufficient evidence to support Ojeda\u2019s claims that he was threatened because of his political activities, rather than because he filed a lawsuit against the government. Furthermore, because there were inconsistencies between Ojeda\u2019s testimony and the affidavits provided by his family members, Ojeda did not produce credible corroborating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Viewing the record in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s finding that Ojeda was not credible and not eligible for withholding of removal. The BIA and IJ properly determined that the petitioners did not establish their eligibility for withholding of removal by concluding that they did not meet even the less stringent test for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny the petitioners\u2019 petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
