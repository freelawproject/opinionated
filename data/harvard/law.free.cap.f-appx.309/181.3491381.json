Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to remand, <em>Romero-Ruiz v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 1057, 1062 (9th Cir.2008), and we review de novo due process claims, <em>Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 603 (9th Cir.2006). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that Petitioner failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 929-30 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">We are not persuaded that Petitioner\u2019s removal would result in the deprivation of his children\u2019s rights. <em>See Cabrera-Alvarez v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 1006, 1012-13 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by reaffirming its previous decision that the evidence Petitioner submitted with his motion to remand was insufficient to establish a prima facie case of hardship. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (The BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b208-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
