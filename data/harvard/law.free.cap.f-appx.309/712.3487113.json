We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2008). The Board properly rejected Akai\u2019s claim that his first motion to reopen was impaired by the ineffective assistance of his counsel, finding that Akai failed to comply with the requirements of <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 637 (B.I.A.1988). We further find this claim foreclosed in light of our recent holding in <em>Afanwi v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 788, 796-99 (4th Cir.2008) (holding there is no Fifth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel in removal proceedings). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-24\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
