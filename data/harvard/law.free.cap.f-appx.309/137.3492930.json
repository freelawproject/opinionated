We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-26\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because Bolanos\u2019 testimony and application were inconsistent concerning the reasons for his participation in and desertion from guerrilla activities and this participation and subsequent desertion formed the basis of Bolanos\u2019 fear of future persecution. <em>See Ceballos-Castillo v. INS, </em>904 F.2d 519, 520 (9th Cir.1990). In light of the consistency of the other details concerning Bola-nos\u2019 involvement with the guerrillas in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>application, a reasonable fact finder would not be compelled to accept Bolanos\u2019 explanation that the person who prepared the application failed to explain accurately Bolanos\u2019 reasons for his involvement with the guerillas. <em>See Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1999) (a contrary result is not compelled where there is \u201c[t]he possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). The agency therefore properly denied Bolanos\u2019 application for asylum. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Because Bolanos failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b163-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
