He received a sentence of thirty-six months\u2019 imprisonment. Goode asserts two sentencing errors on appeal. First, Goode contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court did not adequately consider the disparity between Goode\u2019s sentence and the applicable sentencing range under the Virginia sentencing guidelines. In failing to do so, Goode argues, the court violated the requirement of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) (2006) to consider \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities\u201d as well as the requirement of \u00a7 13(a) that those convicted under the Assimilative Crimes Act be subject to a like punishment as they would receive in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-15\">Second, Goode contends that, because the relevant state range is for a sentence of twelve to seventeen months\u2019 imprisonment, Goode\u2019s thirty-six month sentence is greater than necessary to fulfill the purposes of sentencing as set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-16\">Generally, we review sentences for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473-74 (4th Cir.2007). However, when we \u201creview a sentence imposed for an assimilated offense for which there is no sufficiently analogous offense guideline, we do so under the plainly unreasonable standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Finley, </em>531 F.3d 288, 294 (4th Cir.2008) (internal quo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>tation marks and citations omitted). When applying the plainly unreasonable standard, we first determine whether a sentence is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 438, 438 (4th Cir.2006). If we find that the sentence is procedurally or substantively unreasonable, we \u201cmust then decide whether the sentence is <em>plainly </em>unreasonable, relying on the definition of \u2018plain\u2019 that we use in our plain error analysis. Thus, for purposes of determining whether an unreasonable sentence is plainly unreasonable, \u2018[p]lain\u2019 is synonymous with \u2018clear\u2019 or, equivalently, \u2018obvious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">In determining procedural reasonableness, we must assess whether the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and any arguments presented by the parties, selected a sentence based on \u201cclearly erroneous facts,\u201d or failed to sufficiently explain the sentence. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473. Next, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, \u201ctaking into account the \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">When evaluating the sentencing court\u2019s explanation of a sentence, we have consistently held that the sentencing court \u201cneed not robotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d but should \u201cprovide us an assurance that the sentencing court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors with regard to the particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Moulden, </em>478 F.3d 652, 657 (4th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir.2006). On review, we will not evaluate the adequacy of the district court\u2019s explanation \u201cin a vacuum,\u201d but rather will consider \u201c[t]he context surrounding [its] explanation.\u201d <em>Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d at 381. In considering the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines, we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>446 F.3d 522, 527 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Our review of the record convinces us that Goode \u201coverstates the district court\u2019s lack of consideration, as well as the alleged unwarranted disparity between a sentence that would be imposed under the Virginia guidelines and the one imposed by the district court in this case.\u201d <em>Finley, </em>531 F.3d at 294. The district court indicated that it considered Virginia\u2019s sentencing guidelines but found Goode\u2019s \u201cabysmal\u201d criminal history justified a longer sentence, conceivably up to Virginia\u2019s five-year statutory maximum. However, in light of Goode\u2019s military service, the district court imposed a sentence of thirty-six months, which it found necessary to serve the requirements of 18 <em>TJ.S.G. \u00a7 </em>3553(a), specifically promoting respect for the law and protecting the public from Goode\u2019s misconduct. Accordingly, we find that Goode\u2019s sentence was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Additionally, Goode misunderstands 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13\u2019s prescription that individuals convicted under \u00a7 13 be subject to \u201ca like punishment\u201d as they would have received in state court. In <em>Finley, </em>we noted that \u201clike punishment, as used in the Assimilative Crimes Act, does not require that the punishment be identical but only that sentences in federal court for assimilated crimes fall within the minimum and maximum terms established by state law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Accordingly, district courts have wide discretion in imposing sentences within that range. <em>Id. </em>Were Goode to have been convicted of this offense in a Virginia state court, he would have faced a mandatory minimum sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>of one year and a statutory maximum of five years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(2), (3). Here, Goode received a sentence of thirty-six months. Because Goode was sentenced within the state-prescribed range, he received \u201ca like punishment\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Next, Goode contends that his sentence is \u201cfar too long,\u201d as it is \u201cgreater than necessary to comply with the purposes of sentencing set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d Further, Goode argues that \u201cthe mere act of driving onto federal property does not warrant a sentence so much longer than [he] would have received if he had been pulled over on a state road.\u201d As we discussed above, due to Goode\u2019s significant criminal history, his sentence is not greater than necessary to further the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a). District courts need not give equal weight to all of \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s factors. <em>See Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 476. Instead, it is \u201cquite reasonable for the sentencing court to have attached great weight to a single factor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In this case, the district court gave great weight to two factors, promoting respect for the law and protecting the public. Accordingly, Goode\u2019s second argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Because we do not find Goode\u2019s sentence unreasonable, we need not address whether it was plainly unreasonable. We reject Goode\u2019s challenges to his sentence and affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately addressed in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
