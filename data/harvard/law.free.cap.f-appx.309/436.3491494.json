Apr. 28, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 99 564 700 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 16, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-14\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See Shunfu Li v. Mukasey, </em>529 F.3d 141, 146 (2d Cir.2008). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Corovic v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 90, 95 (2d Cir.2008). We \u201cdefer to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d <em>Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-15\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. For example, while Zhu testified that he and his wife went into hiding in October 2004 after his wife became pregnant a third time, he testified that family planning officials approached him in December 2004 to ask his wife to report for a gynecological checkup. Similarly, while Zhu testified and his wife\u2019s letter indicated that they both went into hiding in March 2005, Zhu\u2019s asylum application and later testimony indicated that only he went into hiding. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Contrary to Zhu\u2019s assertion that his wife\u2019s letter was consistent with his testimony, the letter states, \u201cWe did not dare to return [to] the home after we escaped away.\u201d Finally, while Zhu testified that he lived at his home until March 2005 when he went into hiding and eventually left China, his asylum application indicated that he lived at home until May 2005. Because Zhu\u2019s explanations for these inconsistencies would not compel a reasonable factfinder to credit them, the IJ did not err in relying on those inconsistencies to support his adverse credibility determination. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005). To the extent Zhu argues that the inconsistencies are too minor to support an adverse credibility determination, that argument is foreclosed by the REAL ID Act. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 166-67 (\u201c[A]n IJ may rely on <em>any </em>inconsistency or omission in making an adverse credibility determination as long as the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 establishes that [the] applicant is not credible.\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Taken as a whole, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. Therefore, the IJ properly denied Zhu\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of removal, where the only evidence that he would be persecuted depended on his credibility. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s finding that, contrary to Zhu\u2019s testimony, the evidence did not demonstrate that he illegally departed China where his passport contained an exit stamp. <em>See Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167. Therefore, the IJ properly denied CAT relief in the absence of credible evidence indicating that he would be subjected to torture on that basis. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. The pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
