MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b297-22\">In 2003, Lloyd Taplin pleaded guilty to three counts of distribution of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). Utilizing the career offender provisions set out in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, rather than the crack cocaine provisions set out in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, the district court sentenced Taplin to a term of imprisonment of 151 months. In a series of amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines adopted in late 2007 and early 2008, the United States Sentencing Commission decreased by two levels the base offense level assigned to quantities of crack cocaine in \u00a7 2D1.1 and made that change retroactive to those previously sentenced under \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>United States v. Sharkey, </em>543 F.3d 1236, 1237 (10th Cir.2008) (setting out history of Amendments 706 and 713 of the Sentencing Guidelines). Soon thereafter, Taplin filed a motion, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), for a reduction in his sentence pursuant to Amendments 706 and 713. The district court denied the motion, concluding Taplin was not entitled to relief because his base offense level was set under the career offender guideline, rather than the crack cocaine guideline. Thus, this appeal presents the following pure question of law: Did the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>court err in concluding Taplin was not entitled to relief under \u00a7 3582(c) because Taplin\u2019s offense level was set by application of the \u00a7 4B1.1 career offender guideline, rather than the crack cocaine provisions set out in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1?</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">In a decision issued after the briefing was complete in this case, we resolved this exact question. <em>Sharkey, </em>543 F.3d at 1239. <em>Sharkey </em>holds that when a defendant\u2019s base offense level is set under the \u00a7 4B1.1 career offender guideline, the defendant is not entitled to a reduction in his sentence pursuant to Amendment 706 and \u00a7 3582(c). <em>Id. </em>It further holds that neither the decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), nor in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), alter that outcome. <em>Sharkey, </em>543 F.3d at 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">As <em>Sharkey </em>makes clear, the district court correctly denied Taplin\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion for a reduction in his sentence. Thus, the order of the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico denying Taplin\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
