On March 30, 1920, the following agreement was signed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-9\">\u201c March 30, 1920.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-10\">Mr. William Zampatella has hereby agreed to work for the Thomson-Crooker Shoe Company for one (1) year from date at the prices agreed upon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-11\">S. Zampitella.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-12\">Thomson-Crooker Shoe Co.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-13\">Zampatella testified, subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, that one Thomson, the defendant\u2019s president and general manager, agreed to pay him \u201c eighty cents a hundred,\u201d and said, \u201c I will pay you fifteen per cent bonus on the money you earn at the end of the year; \u201d that he (the plaintiff) agreed that he would sign a contract if Thomson \u201c would bring it to him; \u201d that he went to work the next day; that he signed the contract \u201c five or six days later; \u201d and that in December, 1920, a notice was posted that \u201c the bonus would not be paid this year on account of business being bad.\u201d The written memorandum signed by the parties was an incomplete statement of the contract; it did not purport to contain all its terms; there is nothing in the writing to show the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>wages which were to be paid the plaintiff. The evidence showing the wages he was to receive and the amount of the bonus based on his earnings for the year was admissible. <em>North Packing &amp; Provision Co. </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>196 Mass. 204. <em>Lyman B. Brooks Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>218 Mass. 205. <em>Glackin </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>226 Mass. 316, 319. If the jury believed this evidence, and the question was one of fact, they could find that a legal contract was made to pay this bonus; that it was not a mere gratuity but a part of the contract of service. See <em>Scott </em>v. <em>J. F. Duthie &amp; Co. </em>28 A. L. R. 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-3\">In the second case there was evidence for the jury that Harrington was employed as a foreman by the defendant; that in January, 1920, the general manager of the defendant agreed to pay him a bonus of fifteen per cent on his <em>\u201c </em>year\u2019s pay,\u201d payable on the Saturday before Christmas, 1920; that Harrington continued in the defendant\u2019s employment, and two or three days after Christmas, 1920, he asked the manager for the bonus, which was refused. This evidence was contradicted. But the.jury could have found that the contract was definite in that it was a promise to pay a bonus of fifteen per cent on the wages earned by the plaintiff; that it was founded on a good consideration; and that the plaintiff continued in the defendant\u2019s employment, relying on the promise to be paid the bonus on the Saturday before Christmas. The case was submitted to the jury properly and the judgment in his favor is to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">In the third case, it could have been found that, while in the defendant\u2019s employment, Shaft, the plaintiff, entered into an agreement by which he was to receive a bonus of fifteen per cent on his yearly wages, payable the week before Christmas in the year 1920; that this agreement was made on January 6, 1920; that he continued in the defendant\u2019s employment until January or February, 1921; and that the defendant refused to pay him the bonus of fifteen per cent as agreed. There was no error in submitting this case to the jury. There was a consideration for the contract, it was sufficiently definite, and the plaintiff, it could have been found, continued in the defendant\u2019s employment relying on the defendant\u2019s promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>According to the terms of the report, in each case the verdict for the plaintiff is to stand and judgment is to be entered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
