There was evidence of a will seemingly inequitable in its differing provisions for a son and a daughter. The son, out of an estate of over $300,000, would receive, at the most, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>income on $5,000 for life; the daughter would receive, at the least, $5,000, while she might get everything except the income on the $5,000 during the lifetime of her brother. There was evidence of weakness of mind of the testator; of business capacity and cupidity on the part of the wife; of prejudice by the wife and daughter against the wife of the son; of opportunity in the wife and daughter to overpower the testator\u2019s weaker will; of lack of self-assertion and the simplest business selfishness on the part of the son; of statements by the father of regard for the son, and of intentions to make other and more favorable testamentary dispositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">It is true that the testator was of sound mind; that the evidence of undue influence was weak; that undue influence is not made out by proof of effort by husband or wife to persuade the other to action desired by the person seeking to exert the influence; that a reasonable man might lack faith in the business capacity of the son; and that the argument for the contestant addressed to us in the brief suggests very strongly that the argument made to the jury was specious and unsound.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">A different verdict might have been found with propriety. Nevertheless, the inferences of fact on which the issue depended were for the jurors, not for the judge, to decide; and there was evidence which would warrant the conclusion reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
