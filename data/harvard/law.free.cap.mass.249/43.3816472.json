A witness palled by the plaintiff, who \u201c saw about all there was of the occurrence,\u201d testified he was standing on Beacon Street waiting for an inbound car and saw the plaintiff\u2019s intestate <em>\u201c </em>coming out of Kent Street \u201d and continuing across Beacon Street; that when she stepped from the curb to cross Beacon Street the electric car was about two hundred feet distant; that when it struck the intestate it was moving on Beacon Street at the rate of twenty-five miles an hour, and went about two hundred feet after it struck her. The witness stated he was \u201c watching the girl [the plaintiff\u2019s intestate] the instant she stepped down off the sidewalk \u201d and until she was struck, but did not see her look toward the approaching car and so far as he knew she <em>\u201c </em>was looking straight ahead.\u201d There was evidence that no bell was sounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">From the undisputed facts shown in this case, it appears that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate walked across the street when the approaching car was in full view, without looking and without taking any precautions for her safety. The evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s witness shows that the intestate was not in the exercise of due care. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85, does not help the plaintiff. The case is governed by <em>Duggan </em>v. <em>Bay State Street Railway, </em>230 Mass. 370; <em>Pigeon </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Northeastern Street Railway, </em>230 Mass. 392, <em>Sullivan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>236 Mass. 130, 137, <em>Will </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>247 Mass. 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\"><em>Bagnell </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>247 Mass. 235, <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>248 Mass. 89, <em>Conroy </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>248 Mass. 92, and <em>Barnett </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>244 Mass. 418, are distinguishable from the case at bar.
