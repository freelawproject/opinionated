Howard, Presiding Judge\n   Nathaniel Brennan (\"Brennan\") filed suit against Shelter Insurance (\"Shelter\") for bad faith refusal to settle a claim. In the course of discovery, Brennan sought the production of all documents contained in his insurance claims file. Shelter claims approximately 58 pages of documents in the file are protected by attorney-client privilege. Following an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review, the trial court ordered the entire file to be produced. Shelter now seeks a writ of prohibition from this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Shelter provided automobile insurance to Brennan for a Mercury Grand Marquis. While driving the Mercury, Brennan caused a two vehicle accident on December 6, 2009 (\"Accident\"). Following the Accident, Brennan was sued by the driver of the other vehicle for her injuries and by the driver's husband for loss of consortium (\"Browns\"). During the suit, a dispute arose as to whether five additional insurance policies that Brennan, and Brennan's parents, held with Shelter afforded additional liability coverage. The Browns refused to settle with Shelter for the $50,000 limit of the Mercury policy and the couple sued Brennan. Ultimately, a judgment was entered against Brennan on April 16, 2013, for a total amount of $300,000 plus interest. Shelter paid the $50,000 limit of the Mercury policy to the Browns on May 20, 2013, in partial satisfaction of their judgment against Brennan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Browns filed the underlying equitable garnishment action against Shelter in November 2013. They allege that Shelter owes additional coverage amounts under the Mercury policy and also contend that the other five policies afford additional coverage. In the same action, Brennan filed a cross-claim against Shelter asserting a claim for bad faith refusal to settle the Browns' claims in the Browns' original injury lawsuit (\"Underlying Suit\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Shelter claims that, based on a letter sent by Browns' counsel on January 4, 2010, the settlements demands were \"specifically designed to [facilitate]\" a future bad faith claim brought by Brennan against Shelter. Shelter retained outside counsel, Foland, Wickens, Eisfelder, Roper &amp; Hofer, P.C., and Clay Crawford (\"Crawford\") in particular, to represent Shelter's interests in connection with the coverage dispute. Shelter retained separate counsel from a different law firm to represent Brennan's interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   All communications related to the Accident, including communications between Shelter and Crawford, were kept in one claims file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the course of discovery for the Underlying Suit, Shelter produced a number of documents. Shelter withheld and redacted certain documents from the production on the basis of the attorney-client and work product privileges. Brennan filed a motion on November 17, 2017 seeking an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the documents described in Shelter's privilege logs. Following an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review, the court ordered all the documents to be produced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Shelter sought a writ of prohibition from this Court. On January 31, 2018, this Court found that the Browns \"have affirmatively stated that they have not sought discovery of communications from Shelter Insurance Company to its counsel, Foland, Wickens, Roper, Hofer &amp; Crawford, P.C. or from Foland, Wickens, Roper, Hofer &amp; Crawford, P.C. to Shelter Insurance Company.\" Because the privileged documents were not within the scope of the documents requested, this Court ordered that any\n   attorney-client communications be removed from the documents held\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   , because \"[a]ll such communications are privileged and, thus, absent waiver, are not discoverable,\" but otherwise denied Shelter's writ petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 28, 2018, the circuit court held a hearing regarding the allegedly privileged documents. The court stated that it was its belief that Brennan held the right to waive attorney-client privilege for all documents in the claims file-even those between Shelter and its attorney. Ultimately, the court held that it would stand on its prior ruling, again ordering the documents produced. Shelter then filed the current writ that is before this Court, again requesting that the circuit court be prohibited from ordering the production of privileged material.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"A writ of prohibition does not issue as a matter of right.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Brennan essentially argues that if Shelter is going to use the advice of counsel as a defense for their actions that such advice must now be produced.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    While being cross-examined during her deposition, Morley asserted that Shelter relied on advice of counsel. \"[A] waiver extorted under cross-examination is not voluntary.\"\n    <em>\n     Behrendt\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7320161\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/337/727/#p729\">\n     337 S.W.3d at 729\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal quotation omitted). \"Likewise, disclosure in response to an adverse party's discovery inquiry is not voluntary.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7320161\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/337/727/#p729\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (internal quotation omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Additionally, Shelter is not asserting reliance on advice of counsel as an affirmative defense. She said Shelter received advice of counsel prior to deciding not to sign the settlement agreement. But, that was not the sole reason Shelter declined to sign the settlement agreement. Morley testified that they did not sign for other reasons, including that it required Brennan to do certain things or the contract would not actually limit recovery and it required Shelter to give up any defense it would have to use the document as evidence in any case against it. This is not a case where a defendant is attempting to use a vague reference to privilege to avoid having to explain their failure to settle. The\n    brief excerpt of Morley's testimony, given in the context of being cross-examined in a deposition, wherein she said advice of counsel was a part of why Shelter chose not to settle does not amount to a waiver of privilege under Missouri law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Brennan relies on cases from other jurisdictions in support of his claim that Shelter waived privilege through this deposition testimony. He says that Shelter does not have to plead privilege as an affirmative defense for a waiver to occur in a bad faith refusal to settle case. He argues that it is instead implied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Hearn v.

Wash. 1975), the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington set forth three criteria that must be met to find an implied waiver of attorney-client privilege:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n    (1) assertion of the privilege was a result of some affirmative act, such as filing suit, by the asserting party; (2) through this affirmative act, the asserting party put the protected information at issue by making it relevant to the case; and (3) application of the privilege would have denied the opposing party access to information vital to his defense.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Brennan relies on\n    <em>\n     State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Lee\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1186915\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/199/52/\">\n     199 Ariz. 52\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1186915\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/199/52/\">\n     13 P.3d 1169\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2000). That case applied the\n    <em>\n     Hearn\n    </em>\n    test but found that an \"affirmative act\" could be implied:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n    Thus, we agree with the court of appeals that before a waiver can be implied, a\n    <em>\n     Hearn\n    </em>\n    -like requirement of an affirmative act of putting the privileged materials at issue is necessary. We also agree that mere denial of the allegations in the complaint, or an assertion that the denial was in good faith, is not an implied waiver. But in this case, State Farm advances its own interpretation of the law as a defense, including what its employees knew ... in making that evaluation. True, State Farm does not claim that it rejected the stacking claims because of its lawyers' advice, but it does not deny that what its employees knew included information from the lawyers.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1175 (internal citations omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    <em>\n     Lee\n    </em>\n    , an Arizona case, takes the majority rule and broadens it by allowing an affirmative act to be implied. The resulting application of such a rule would mean that an insurance company would always waive privilege if it ever consulted an attorney because the attorney's counsel would likely form at least part of the basis for the insurance company's behavior. An insurance company would never be entitled to attorney-client privilege in cases of bad faith settlement, even if the attorney's advice was but a part of the information the insurance company used in its decision making process.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Missouri has been clear about a preference for protecting \"the sanctity of the attorney-client privilege.\"\n    <em>\n     Peabody Coal Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10007923\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/863/604/#p607\">\n     863 S.W.2d at 607\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

To the extent that Shelter's petition for writ of prohibition seeks prohibition of future documents not yet requested we decline to issue such an advisory opinion. The writ in all other respects is denied. The stay on the proceedings is lifted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Witt, J. concurs\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Mitchell, K. concurs\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
