Garcia appeals from the motion court's denial of his Rule 24.035 post-conviction motion following an evidentiary hearing. Garcia argues that the motion court clearly erred in denying his claim that the plea court lacked jurisdiction to revoke his probation. Because Garcia's claim is not cognizable in a Rule 24.035 proceeding, we affirm. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
