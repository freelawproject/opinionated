(\"Father\"), challenges the trial court's final decree, entered after a bench trial, terminating his parental rights to his minor child, N.J.H. In three issues, Father contends that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the trial court's findings (1) that he knowingly engaged in conduct, or knowingly placed the child with persons who engaged in conduct, that endangered the child's physical or emotional well-being,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) that he abandoned the child's mother during pregnancy,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) that termination of his parental rights is in the best interest of the child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In June 2017, the Department of Family and Protective Services (\"DFPS\") filed a petition for the protection of N.J.H. and his sister. DFPS sought managing conservatorship and termination of the parental rights of the children's mother and alleged fathers. The DFPS investigator's affidavit states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 28, 2017 the agency received a referral alleging physical abuse of 8 month old [N.J.H.] ... by an Unknown Perpetrator. The report stated [N.J.H.'s] mother ... took [N.J.H.] to Texas Children's Hospital after being contacted by [N.J.H.'s] daycare regarding fever and swollen left leg. Report states medical exams discovered multiple fractures all over [N.J.H.'s] body in different stages of healing. The report describes [N.J.H.] as non-ambulatory and was observed not to sit up, which appeared to be unusual for [N.J.H.'s] age. The report states [mother] disclosed two months ago her oldest child, [two-year-old sister] ... and [N.J.H.] were sleeping in her bed. [Mother] reported leaving the room for two minutes and upon returning to the room, found [sister] to be jumping on the bed. [Mother] reported [sister] falling onto [N.J.H.] when she was told to sit down, [mother]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   reported taking [N.J.H.] to a hospital for X-Rays which did not show any fractures. According to the report, medical professionals state [N.J.H.'s] injuries are inconsistent with [mother's] explanation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [Mother] stated when [N.J.H.] was born she was in jail.... [Mother] stated his father is [M.H.].... [Mother] stated all she knows is a friend told her he robbed someone and ended up shooting the man so he is in jail for attempted murder....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   There is an immediate concern for [N.J.H.], infant, because of the extensive injuries that he has sustained, [mother] is unable to provide an explanation consistent with [N.J.H.'s] injuries. [Mother] is currently on probation for Aggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon. Viable relative or fictive kin placements could not be located and attempts to make contact with options provided by [mother] were unsuccessful. [N.J.H.] has been found to have over fifteen fractures in various stages of healing, [N.J.H.] has fractures to all extremities.... Medical professionals concluded injuries are not consistent with [mother's] story and are consistent with child abuse.... [Mother has] a history of domestic violence. [M.H.] is incarcerated for aggravated robbery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court found that there existed a continuing danger to the physical health and safety of N.J.H. and his sister, and it entered an emergency order for their protection. After a hearing, the trial court issued a temporary order, appointing DFPS the managing conservator of the children. The mother filed an affidavit relinquishing her parental rights to the children and is not a party to this appeal. After DNA testing eliminated M.H. as N.J.H.'s father, the mother identified Father. This appeal solely concerns N.J.H. and Father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 13, 2017, DFPS filed an amended petition, seeking to establish Father's paternity of N.J.H. In November 2017, after Father submitted to DNA testing, the trial court issued an order establishing Father's paternity of N.J.H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On November 9, 2017, the trial court ordered that Father submit to drug testing, and the results were positive for cocaine and marijuana. On February 15, 2018, the trial court again ordered that Father submit to drug testing, and the result was positive for marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In April 2018, DFPS filed an amended Petition, seeking to terminate Father's parental rights with respect to N.J.H. on the grounds that Father had engaged in conduct, or knowingly placed N.J.H. with persons who had engaged in conduct, that endangered N.J.H's physical or emotional well-being\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that Father had voluntarily and knowingly abandoned N.J.H.'s mother, beginning at a time during pregnancy and continuing through the birth, failed to provide her with adequate support, and remained apart from N.J.H. or failed to support him since his birth.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At trial, Felicia Huitt, a DFPS caseworker, testified that N.J.H., who was born in 2016, came into DFPS care due to physical abuse by his mother. He was eight months old at the time and had fifteen fractures in different stages of healing all over his body. Initially, mother identified another man, M.H., as N.J.H.'s father. After M.H. was excluded as N.J.H.'s father, the mother named Father as a possible father. Huitt noted that the mother stated that she did not think that Father was N.J.H.'s father and did not tell\n   him about N.J.H. After Father was established as N.J.H.'s father, DFPS gave Father a family service plan, which included a psychosocial evaluation, individual and group therapy, substance abuse treatment, and parenting classes. And, Father completed all of his services. Huitt also noted that Father had been working for his employer, a restaurant, for almost a year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Huitt testified that DFPS sought termination of Father's rights based on several concerns. Namely, Father had acknowledged that, despite his having two other children, he had been using marijuana on a daily basis until November 2017 and had been doing so \"for a long, long time.\" On November 9, 2017, Father tested positive for cocaine and \"high levels of marijuana.\" And, he \"submitted positive hair follicle tests up until\" April 25, 2018. The trial court admitted into evidence lab reports from Father's drug screens and a May 7, 2018 report to the trial court by Child Advocates. One lab report shows that, on November 9, 2017, Father tested positive for cocaine and marijuana. The Child Advocates report shows that Father's drug test result on December 22, 2017 was \"dilute negative\" and that Father admitted to a DFPS caseworker that he had recently used marijuana. Another lab report shows that, on February 15, 2018, Father again tested positive for marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Huitt also noted that Father had a 2013 conviction for domestic violence. The trial court admitted into evidence a judgment convicting Father of a 2013 offense of assault causing bodily injury to a family member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Huitt explained that Father was not allowed to visit N.J.H. until Father tested negative for drugs. Father tested negative on April 25, 2018, and Father visited N.J.H. twice before the May 17, 2018 trial. During his visits, Father interacted well with the child and brought him toys. Huitt noted, however, that Father was providing support for only one of his two other children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Huitt further testified that N.J.H. had been in his current foster home placement for approximately nine months. He lives there with his siblings, is thriving, and has a \"great bond\" with his foster parents and siblings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Etta Pickett, of Child Advocates, Inc., testified that Father's parental rights should be terminated because he had not demonstrated an ability to provide for the physical and emotional needs of N.J.H. Pickett noted that, during his visit with N.J.H., Father was very attentive, and he nurtured and played with N.J.H. However, Pickett noted, Father's drug use was an \"ongoing concern.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Father testified that he began a relationship with N.J.H.'s mother in 2015, and, at some point, they began living together at her house. One night in 2016, the child's mother told Father that she was pregnant and ended their relationship. Father moved out that night. Father noted that another man, whom Father thought was the baby's father, immediately moved into the mother's house. Thereafter, Father never had any further contact with the mother. N.J.H. was born in October 2016, but Father did not learn about him until October or November 2017, when DFPS contacted him. Once DNA testing confirmed that N.J.H. was his child, Father attempted to visit and brought him clothing, shoes, and toys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Father testified that he has been working for a restaurant for about a year. Prior to that, he was working as a bounty hunter. Although Father testified that he has an apartment, he noted that he was homeless two years prior. Father testified that, from January 2016 through November 2017, he was smoking marijuana at least three times per week. However, in November 2017, when DFPS became \"involved\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   in his life, he ceased his use of illegal substances. Father acknowledged that, although he has two other children, one of whom was, at the time of trial, eight years old, he was using marijuana during the pendency of this case. He denied that he had ever used cocaine. He asserted, rather, that he had \"purchased a sack [of marijuana] that was laced with cocaine.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Foster mother testified that N.J.H. and his two siblings have been in her home since August 2017 and are thriving. She stated that she and her husband love them and wish to keep them together and raise them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In its final decree, the trial court terminated Father's parental rights to N.J.H. on the grounds that Father had engaged in conduct, or knowingly placed N.J.H. with persons who had engaged in conduct, that endangered N.J.H.'s physical or emotional well-being and that Father voluntarily and knowingly abandoned N.J.H.'s mother during pregnancy and remained apart from N.J.H. or failed to support him since birth. The trial court appointed DFPS the sole managing conservator of N.J.H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In his first through third issues, Father challenges the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence to support termination under (1) Family Code section 161.001(b)(1)(E) (endangerment), (2) Family Code section 161.001(b)(1)(H) (abandonment of mother during pregnancy), and (3) Family Code section 161.001(b)(2) (best interest of the child).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review and Applicable Legal Principles\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A parent's right to the \"companionship, care, custody, and management\" of his child is a constitutional interest \"far more precious than any property right.\"\n   <em>\n    Santosky v.

There was legally and factually sufficient evidence of endangering conduct and that termination of Father's parental rights was in N.J.H.'s best interest based on, among other things, Father's positive test for cocaine and history of family violence. In addition, Texas appellate courts have repeatedly relied on evidence of a parent's marijuana use to support endangerment findings, so the Court's holding that is based, in part, on Father's marijuana use is well supported.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   I write separately, however, to suggest that we should more closely tailor our consideration of marijuana use to what the termination statute actually requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The statute expressly authorizing involuntary termination of the parent-child relationship based on a parent's use of marijuana or other controlled substances, i.e., Section 161.001(b)(1)(P), requires clear and convincing evidence of use \"in a manner that endangered the health or safety of the child[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our reliance on marijuana use-without accompanying evidence of impairment or some other circumstance that risks a child's health or safety-to show that a parent has engaged in a course of endangering conduct under Section 161.001(b)(1)(E) is a creature of judicial decision-making. It is not what the statute requires. And that decision-making fails to consider that there has been a sea change in society's acceptance of limited marijuana use. It may no longer be warranted to presume that marijuana use, by itself, indicates parental neglect or endangerment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Of course, marijuana, like alcohol and like illicit drugs, can be abused and may\n   impede a parent's ability to care for his or her child or place the child at risk of harm, but I believe our statutory framework requires something more than a single positive marijuana drug test or general statements about marijuana use before the courts reach that conclusion. Various geographic regions in our state and country, and the individuals elected to represent those voters' legislative inclinations, have increasingly concluded that marijuana\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   is not always synonymous with\n   <em>\n    abuse.\n   </em>\n   That older parental-termination cases dedicate little appellate-level analysis to this possibility counsels against overreliance on those cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    Marijuana Laws are Evolving\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Marijuana is still illegal under federal law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   but there is a clear trend among the states toward greater acceptance of marijuana use. Medical use of marijuana by qualified patients is now permitted in the District of Columbia and more than 30 states\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and territories.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Recreational use of marijuana is legal in the District of Columbia and 10 states (Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   A significant number of states now treat possession of a small amount of marijuana for personal consumption as a misdemeanor offense or have decriminalized it\n   altogether, electing instead to impose a civil penalty (though leniency in some of these states is extended only for first- or second-time possession).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   I can only surmise that the trend toward legalization and society's increasingly tolerant view of marijuana use result, at least in part, from recognition that almost \"5 million people reported using marijuana on a daily or almost daily period basis over a year, and almost half of the population has tried marijuana.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In Texas, this trend has not yet taken hold to the same extent as in other states. Possession of marijuana-even of small amounts of less than two ounces-remains a criminal offense punishable by jail time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   But there are hints of change here too. In 2015, our legislature adopted the Compassionate Use Act, which allows for medical use of low-THC cannabis by Texans who suffer from intractable epilepsy and have a prescription from qualified physicians.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   At least three of this State's larger cities-Houston,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dallas,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Austin\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   -have adopted misdemeanor diversion programs that do not decriminalize possession but encourage law enforcement officers to cite and release people in possession of small amounts of marijuana, rather than arrest them. Governor Greg Abbott recently indicated his willingness to consider legislation reducing possession of up to two ounces of marijuana from a Class B to a Class C misdemeanor offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the\n   2018 platforms of Texas's two major political parties include marijuana reform.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   And according to one recent poll, more than half of Texas's registered voters believe marijuana should be legalized.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    Our Consideration of Marijuana Use in Termination Cases Should More Closely Track What the Statute Requires\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   On occasion, including in opinions I have authored, this Court has explained that a parent's illegal drug use may support termination based on endangerment because \"it exposes the child to the possibility that the parent may be impaired or imprisoned.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   As marijuana laws evolve, we should reconsider this language and its underlying reasoning as it concerns a parent's recreational marijuana use as evidence of endangerment in termination cases. Such broad language suggesting that all drug use is equivalent may no longer be supportable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   If it is not true that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   marijuana use is endangering, then courts should, under Section 161.001(b)(1)(E)'s endangerment predicate, examine whether the use endangered or created a risk of physical or emotional harm to the child under the facts of the case. After all, the statute does not list drug use itself as a ground for termination; termination is authorized only when the drug is used in an endangering manner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was no evidence in this case, nor in many of the other termination appeals before our Court, regarding the physical effects of recreational marijuana use or whether the use or any pattern of use actually endangered the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   A parent's \"interest in the accuracy and justice of the decision to terminate his or her parental status is ... a commanding\n   one.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   To terminate parental rights or deprive a parent of access to his or her child based on endangerment absent evidence that marijuana use has actually caused or is causing a risk of harm does not satisfy the strict standards that apply in these cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   I do not attempt to propose a bright-line test for what evidence is required or when marijuana use may be sufficiently endangering so as to adversely impact an individual's ability to parent a child. It may be that the courts should consider a parent's recreational marijuana use only when specific facts show endangerment or when a parent is unable to provide regular care because of a substance-abuse problem, as shown by evidence that the parent has been diagnosed by a medical or mental health professional as having a current substance-abuse problem or satisfies the definition of substance abuse in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (\"DSM\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   A parent's occasional use of marijuana recreationally also may, under some circumstances, be evidence of his or her inability to provide proper care for a child of tender age.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Any meaningful \"endangering\" analysis would have to take into account where the use occurred, the level of the use, and, significantly, whether the child was in the parent's care at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In addition, courts may consider marijuana use for a different prong of the termination statute: failure to comply with\n   the provisions of a court order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   The family services plans approved and ordered by the trial courts frequently require a parent to abstain from drug use as a condition of visitation or reunification. Factfinders could conclude that parental rights should be terminated in cases where a parent does not abstain from marijuana long enough to satisfy the plan despite having knowledge that a failure to comply could support termination. But evidence of marijuana use for this ground would not include marijuana use before the plan was adopted. Evidence of marijuana use to prove endangerment, on the other hand, includes conduct before the termination proceedings commenced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Following the statute as written requires that parental drug use actually endanger the child. The trial courts are in the best position to determine the degree to which a child is endangered based on an assessment of the facts and the actual parenting of the child. On appeal, we should engage in a fact-specific analysis of the evidence of endangerment in each termination proceeding rather than rest on general characterizations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   With these concerns in mind, I respectfully concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     In re J.O.A.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7301947\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/283/336/#p345\">\n     283 S.W.3d 336\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 344 (Tex. 2009) (considering father's admitted marijuana use as evidence of endangerment);\n    <em>\n     Walker v.
