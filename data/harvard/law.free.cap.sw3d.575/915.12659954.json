The initial question in this proceeding is whether it is properly characterized as a pretrial habeas corpus proceeding from a pending criminal case or whether it is a habeas corpus proceeding challenging a confinement for some reason other than due to a pending criminal proceeding, specifically a civil proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   If this is a pretrial petition for a writ of habeas corpus from detention for a criminal proceeding, we do not have jurisdiction of it. On the other hand, we do have jurisdiction of some original habeas corpus proceedings if, among other criteria, they are properly characterized as civil proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Bhardwaj's detention clearly started as a criminal proceeding. His competency to stand trial was raised. It was determined that he was not, at that time, competent to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Bhardwaj had been detained for a substantial length of time before he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with this Court. The Court was concerned that a pretrial detention to determine competency had been, or should be, converted to a civil commitment proceeding of some type rather than proceed as a pretrial detention in a criminal proceeding that could not be brought to a conclusion because the defendant was not competent to stand trial and could thus potentially become involuntary restraint without judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court asked the parties to address our concerns. Responding to our expressed concerns as it related to the question of our jurisdiction the State filed a comprehensive brief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The brief documents the extensive factual and procedural history in the trial court and commitment proceedings. The brief then reviews the applicable law and again urged the State's motion to dismiss. The motion to dismiss, as does the brief, argues that because this is a pretrial petition for a writ of habeas corpus in a pending criminal proceeding, this intermediate appellate court has no jurisdiction. The motion thus seeks dismissal for want of jurisdiction. We requested and received a response to the motion to dismiss from Bhardwaj.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After due consideration of the State's brief, the State's motion to dismiss, Bhardwaj's response to the motion to dismiss, the record before us, and conducting our own legal research, we agree with the State that the petition for a writ of habeas corpus, filed while a criminal complaint/indictment is pending against the defendant but after a determination of incompetency to stand trial during the period of time prior to a jury trial on that issue, nevertheless remains a criminal proceeding over which this Court does not have jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Accordingly we grant the State's motion and dismiss this proceeding for want of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     APPENDIX\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ACCEPTED\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   10-19-00032-CR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   TENTH COURT OF APPEALS WACO, TEXAS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   3/29/2019 2:43 PM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   SHARRI ROESSLER CLERK\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   FILED IN 10th COURT OF APPEALS WACO, TEXAS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   3/29/2019 2:47:00 PM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   SHARRI ROESSLER Clerk\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    CASE NO. 10-19-00032-CR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    EX PARTE TARUN BHARDWAJ\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    IN THE COURT OF APPEALS TENTH JUDICIAL DISTRICT OF TEXAS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    STATE'S RESPONSE TO APPLICATION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   NOW COMES THE STATE OF TEXAS by and through her prosecuting attorney and in opposition of the Application for Writ of Habeas Corpus respectfully states the following to the Court based on its information and belief:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The procedural history of Bhardwaj's case is long and complicated. This is mostly due to (a) the fact that Bhardwaj has frequently changed attorneys throughout the proceedings, (b) Bhardwaj has refused to cooperate with the district court's inquiry into the matter of his competency to stand trial, (c) Bhardwaj has taken the unusual position of opposing any finding that he is incompetent to stand trial in spite of the recommendations and opinions of his lawyers, and (d) Bhardwaj's mental illness causes him to believe that his attorneys are working against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The facts most directly responsive to this Court's February 13, 2019 order are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   1. The Brazos County grand jury indicted Bhardwaj on one count of Stalking ( Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 42.072 ) on July 21, 2016. Exhibit 1 - Indictment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   2. Prior to his indictment, Bhardwaj already had two separate harassment charges pending.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   3. Bhardwaj was arrested on two new misdemeanor charges on December 30, 2016.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   4. Currently, Bhardwaj is detained pending trial on the felony stalking charge as well as two misdemeanor charges of harassment, one charge of unlawful restraint, and one charge of resisting arrest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   5. On January 30, 2017, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security placed an immigration detainer on Bhardwaj. Bhardwaj is being held without bond on the immigration detainer. Exhibit 2 - ICE Detainer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   6. Pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.005, Dr. Mary Conroy evaluated Bhardwaj concerning his competency to stand trial. She concluded that it is \"highly unlikely\" Bhardwaj is competent to stand trial. Exhibit 3 - Forensic Report of Dr. Conroy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   7. Bhardwaj requested a jury trial so that he might prove he was competent to stand trial and contest Dr. Conroy's opinion that he is mentally incompetent to stand trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Code Crim. Proc. arts. 46B.005(c) and 46B.051.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   8. After being represented at various stages of his pending criminal charges by attorneys Cam Reynolds, Margaret Meece, Bash Sharma, Kaushik Rambhotla and Lane Thibodeaux, Bhardwaj notified the court of his intention to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se.\n   </em>\n   The court held a\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   hearing and found that (a) a substantial issue exists concerning Bhardwaj's competency under the law; (b) Bhardwaj is unable to voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently invoke his right to represent himself or waive assistance of counsel; and, (c) Bhardwaj lacks the mental capacity to conduct his trial defense on the issue of competency or on the merits unless represented by counsel. Exhibit 4 - Order Denying Waiver of Counsel Assistance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   9. A jury trial was set for July 12, 2018, in order to determine whether Bhardwaj is competent to stand trial. However, on the morning of trial, Bhardwaj waived the jury trial and the court determined the issue of Bhardwaj's competency pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. arts. 46B.005 and 46B.054. The trial court found that Bhardwaj is incompetent to stand trial and ordered he be committed\n   to Austin State Hospital (\"ASH\") for restoration to competency pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.073. Exhibit 5 - Order of Incompetency to Stand Trial and Restoration Commitment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   10. After attempting to restore Bhardwaj to competency, ASH reported to the trial court that he remains incompetent to stand trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.079. Furthermore, ASH found that Bhardwaj is not likely to be restored to legal competency within the foreseeable future and that Bhardwaj meets the criteria for civil commitment. Exhibit 6 - Austin State Hospital Forensic Report.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   11. Upon Bhardwaj's return from ASH neither party objected to the final report of ASH.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.084.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   12. On March 25, 2019, the district court entered judgment finding Bhardwaj incompetent to stand trial pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.084(a-1)(1). Exhibits 8 - Transcript of March 25, 2019 Status Hearing &amp; 9 - Judgment Based on Final Report.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   13. The felony stalking indictment pending against Bhardwaj has not been dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.084(e).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   14. Bhardwaj's case is currently set for a jury trial on civil commitment pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.084(e) and Subchapter E of Chapter 46B. Trial is set to commence on May 20, 2019.

He is currently under indictment for Stalking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 42.072. He is also charged by information with two counts of harassment, one count of unlawful restraint, and one count of resisting arrest.

The courts of appeals have no original habeas-corpus jurisdiction in criminal matters.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2022.221\">\n    Tex.

App. 1977). However, Bhardwaj is not in jail because of the incompetency proceedings. He is in jail because of his pending criminal charges as well as his immigration detainer. If Bhardwaj's confinement converts to civil confinement at all, it would only be after the criminal charges against him are dismissed and the trial court determines that there is evidence of mental illness or retardation. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. arts. 46B.084(f), 46B.151. In such cases where the criminal charges are dismissed - which in not the case with Bhardwaj - the criminal court transfers the case to the appropriate civil court for civil commitment proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Subchapter F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In order to ensure a criminal defendant receives a fair trial, due process requires that a defendant who is incompetent may not be put to trial.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cooper v.

It is the trial court that conducts the informal inquiry and appoints experts to evaluate the mental competency of a defendant when evidence exists to support a finding of incompetency. Tex.

Tex. Code Crim. Proc. arts. 46B.071 -.073. The responsibilities of the treatment facility are fully outlined in Chapter 46B, Subchapter D. Once the treatment facility has fulfilled its responsibilities, the defendant returns to the trial court and the court is required to make a determination of the defendant's competency to stand trial based on the final report from the treatment facility. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.084(a). If the defendant is found by the court to be competent, the criminal proceedings resume. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 46B.084(d)(1).

Cases where a criminal defendant opposes a trial court's finding of incompetence are rare, but they do exist.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We seldom receive extensive briefing on the narrow issue of our habeas corpus jurisdiction. Because we believe the legal research and analysis on the issue contained in the brief should be available to the judges and lawyers in Texas, we have attached the entire brief, excluding the exhibits attached to the brief, to this opinion as an appendix. We do not incorporate it, but we do make reference to it for a discussion of the factual background and procedural history of this proceeding as well as the applicable law. Because the State's entire brief is attached, no useful purpose would be served for the Court to recite the facts, procedural history, or the relevant legal authorities herein.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Here, the State notes that Bhardwaj has filed this handwritten writ application\n    <em>\n     pro se.\n    </em>\n    The State does not presume to speak for Bhardwaj's attorney on this matter whatsoever.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
