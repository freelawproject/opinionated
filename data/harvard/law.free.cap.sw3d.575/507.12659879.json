Movant was convicted after a jury trial of three counts of statutory sodomy in the first degree, in violation of Section 566.062 RSMo, and two counts of sexual misconduct in the second degree, in violation of Section 566.095. Movant was sentenced to concurrent 12-year sentences on each of the first-degree statutory sodomy counts and 120 days on each of the sexual misconduct counts. On direct appeal this Court reversed the convictions for sexual misconduct in the second degree, and affirmed the convictions for first-degree statutory sodomy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
