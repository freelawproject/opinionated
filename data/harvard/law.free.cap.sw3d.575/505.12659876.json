Defendant argues the trial court erred by not declaring a mistrial during voir dire. An extended opinion would serve no jurisprudential purpose. The parties have been provided with a memorandum for their information only, setting forth the reasons for this order. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
