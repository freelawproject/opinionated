(\"Defendants\") appeal the trial court's order granting the motion for new trial of Wanda King, individually and as plaintiff ad litem for David King, Michael King, Tamara Nuckolls, Lea Ann Roach, and Tracy Rainey (\"Plaintiffs\"). Because Defendants' notice of appeal was untimely, the appeal is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   David King died from complications after Dr. Sorensen performed surgery to repair a large paraesophageal hernia. Plaintiffs brought an action for wrongful death and lost chance of recovery against the Defendants. After a six-day trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the Defendants. Plaintiffs filed a motion for new trial alleging in pertinent part that they were severely prejudiced by a juror's nondisclosure of a prior lawsuit filed against him and his wife. The trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing and thereafter denied Plaintiffs' motion for new trial concluding that Plaintiffs did not conduct a reasonable investigation as required by Rule 69.025 and thus waived any claim for relief. Plaintiffs appealed, and this court reversed finding that Plaintiffs did not waive their right to seek relief based on juror nondisclosure as prescribed by Rule 69.025.\n   <em>\n    King v.

It provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   When an appeal is permitted by law from a trial court and within the time prescribed, a party or his agent may appeal from a judgment or order by filing with the clerk of the trial court a notice of appeal.

Similarly, Rule 81.04(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   If an appeal is permitted by law from a trial court, a party may appeal from a judgment, decree, or order by filing with the clerk of the trial court a notice of appeal. No such appeal shall be effective unless the notice of appeal shall be filed not later than ten days after the judgment, decree, or order appealed from becomes final.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The question in this case is when did the judgment/order granting a new trial become final for the purposes of filing a notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants contend that the timeframe for appeal created in Rule 81.05 applied in this case. Rule 81.05 addresses the finality of judgments and the effect of authorized after-trial motions on finality for purposes of ascertaining the time within which an appeal may be taken. Under the rule, \"[a] judgment becomes final at the expiration of thirty days after its entry if no timely authorized after-trial motion is filed.\" Rule 81.05(a)(1). If a party files an authorized after-trial motion, the judgment becomes final on the earlier of ninety days from the date the last such motion was filed or the date when the last such motion is ruled (or thirty days after entry of the judgment, whichever is later). Rule 81.05(a)(2). Defendants argue that the January 25, 2018 judgment/order granting a new trial became final on April 4, 2018, when the trial court denied their motion for reconsideration and that they then had ten days to file their appeal. Alternatively, they argue that if the motion for reconsideration was not an authorized after trial motion and did not stay the time for filing a notice of appeal, the judgment/order became final thirty days after it was entered and their March 6, 2018 notice of appeal filed ten days after that was timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Similar arguments were recently rejected in two cases,\n   <em>\n    Sanford v.

They explained that the appellants' arguments ignored the purpose and function of Rule 81.05(a)'s delay of the finality of a judgment for thirty days, which is to allow the trial court to retain control over judgments to vacate, reopen, correct, amend, or modify judgments for good cause as provided under Rule 75.01.\n   <em>\n    Sanford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6797007\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/490/717/\">\n    490 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   720 ;\n   <em>\n    Kruszka\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12374311\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/514/95/\">\n    514 S.W.3d at 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

An order granting a new trial is interlocutory because it does not dispose of all disputed issues-quite the opposite, everything is left for future determination.\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. E.D. 2002).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, Defendants concede that the judgment/order granting a new trial in this case was interlocutory. They contend, however, that it was distinct from the orders at issue in\n   <em>\n    Sanford\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kruszka\n   </em>\n   in several ways and thus Rule 81.05 applied here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   First, Defendants contend that the right to appeal an order granting a new trial arises under a different statute ( section 512.020 ) than the other orders (sections 435.440 and 472.160, respectively). They assert that section 512.020 authorizes appeals from both an order granting a new trial (subsection 1) and from a final judgment (subsection 5), which strongly suggests that the time limits in Rule 81.05 apply in both situations. This argument is unsound, however, because section 512.020 also includes other dispositions that must be appealed within ten days of entry. For example, section 512.020(3) authorizes an appeal from an order granting or denying class action certification. Under Rule 84.035(a), a petition for permission to appeal such order must be filed within ten days of the entry of the order. \" Section 512.020 merely lists the kinds of orders that, in addition to final judgments, are appealable; it does not purport to address the procedural requirements for the appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Spiece v. Garland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409784\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/197/594/#p596\">\n    197 S.W.3d 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 596 (Mo. banc 2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Next, Defendants contend that unlike the orders in\n   <em>\n    Sanford\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kruszka\n   </em>\n   ,\n   the trial court's grant of a new trial was denominated a \"judgment\" under Rule 74.01(a), therefore, the time limits of Rule 81.05 applied. Rule 74.01(a) provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Judgment\" as used in these rules includes a decree and any order from which an appeal lies. A judgment is rendered when entered. A judgment is entered when a writing signed by the judge and denominated \"judgment\" or \"decree\" is filed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While section 512.020 grants the substantive right to appeal in this case, it must be read in conjunction with the procedural requirements for appeal in Rule 74.01(a).\n   <em>\n    Spiece\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409784\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/197/594/#p596\">\n    197 S.W.3d at 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, as Rule 74.01(a) applies to this case, there can be no order from which an appeal lies unless the decree or order is entered and denominated a \"judgment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409784\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/197/594/#p596\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In denominating the order granting a new trial as a \"judgment,\" the trial court simply perfected the order for appeal as required by Rule 74.01(a).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409784\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/197/594/#p596\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8409784\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/197/594/#p596\">\n    at 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (appeal from order granting of a new trial only proper after trial court entered judgment four days later).

They assert that the only way to prevent the wrongful grant of a new trial is to adjudicate that issue before a new trial is held. Defendants are correct that an order granting a new trial is not reviewable after a retrial of the case.\n   <em>\n    Rogers v.

Additionally, unlike the interlocutory orders in\n   <em>\n    Sanford\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kruszka\n   </em>\n   , the trial court has no power to disturb an order granting a new trial after entry, and it is subject to review only on appeal.\n   <em>\n    Clayton v.

These restrictions on the review of an order granting a new trial do not, however, leave an aggrieved party without recourse.
