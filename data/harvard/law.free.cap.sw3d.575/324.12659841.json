In each case, the county had not approved the liquor-by-the-drink sales, but the city had approved such sales. The Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Revenue, who collects taxes on all liquor-by-the-drink sales, distributed tax proceeds to the defendant cities in accordance with the liquor-by-the-drink tax distribution statute, Tennessee Code Annotated section 57-4-306. The statute required the recipient cities to then distribute half of their proceeds \"in the same manner as the county property tax for schools is expended and distributed.\" Tenn. Code. Ann. \u00a7 57-4-306(a)(2)(A) (2013). In each case, the recipient city distributed half of its tax proceeds to its own city school system and did not share the proceeds with the county. The counties sued the cities, claiming that the statute required the cities to distribute the tax proceeds as the counties distribute the county property tax for schools, which is pro rata among all schools in the county based on average daily attendance. In the instant case, the trial court held in favor of the county, concluding that the distribution statute was ambiguous and that public policy considerations favored the county's interpretation. Upon interlocutory appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed. After considering the statutory language, the statutory framework, and the legislative history, it adopted the interpretation of the statute advocated by the city. We agree with the Court of Appeals and hold in favor of the city.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The issues in this case are better understood with some knowledge of the development of the pertinent liquor-by-the-drink statutes. Consequently, we offer some background on the history of the statutes before we outline the facts and analyze the issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    The Liquor-By-The-Drink Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the years of federal prohibition (1920-1933), Tennessee had \"bone dry\" laws, which criminalized the sale, purchase, receipt, possession, transport, and manufacture of alcoholic beverages.\n   <em>\n    City of Chattanooga v.

Interpretation of this provision\n   is the issue presented to us in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Washington County\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The underlying facts in this case are essentially undisputed. Johnson City (\"the City\") lies in Washington County (\"the County\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City has at all relevant times had its own municipal school system separate from the Washington County school system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 1980, citizens of the City passed a referendum authorizing LBD sales within City limits. After that, the City received LBD tax proceeds from those sales. The City has never shared those tax proceeds with the County or with any school system in the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The County has not passed a referendum on LBD sales. It has, however, received LBD tax proceeds from lawful LBD sales in private clubs located in unincorporated areas of the County. Unlike the City, the County distributed half of its private club LBD tax proceeds among all of the school systems in the County-just as it distributes County property taxes for schools-pro rata in accordance with average daily attendance maintained by each.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2049-3-315\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 49-3-315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On May 2, 2014, the Washington County School System, by and through the Washington County Board of Education (\"the County Board\"), filed a lawsuit against the City seeking a declaratory judgment as to the rights and obligations of the parties concerning LBD tax proceeds. The County Board alleged that the City was required to share its LBD tax proceeds with the County just \"as the county property tax for schools is expended and distributed\" by the County. The County Board sought a declaratory judgment and damages in the \"full amount of unremitted tax revenues together with prejudgment interest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In June 2014, the City filed a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment, arguing that the County Board lacked capacity to sue. It also claimed that the LBD tax distribution provisions did not apply to the County because the County had never authorized LBD sales by referendum and that the language of the distribution statute did not require the City to share its LBD tax proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Subsequently, the County filed a motion to intervene, which was granted. As a result, we hereinafter refer to the County Board and Washington County collectively as \"the County.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In October 2016, the trial court entered an order granting summary judgment in favor of the County and denying the City's motion for summary judgment. In doing so, the trial court found that the distribution statute and the legislative history surrounding the July 2014 amendment were both ambiguous. Because of these ambiguities, the trial court considered \"public policy and the principles of equity and fairness,\" which led it to conclude that students in City and County schools should receive equal treatment under the LBD Act. On this basis, the trial court held that half of the City's LBD tax proceeds must be equitably distributed between the City and County school systems; it directed the City to pay the County accordingly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The City filed an application for interlocutory appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   which was granted\n   by both the trial court and the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Around the same time, three other cases involving the same issue regarding the distribution statute were appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Eastern Section.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blount Cnty.

The italicized portion of the statute, which we call \"the local education provision,\" is the specific provision in dispute in this case. The question is whether municipalities with their own school systems were required to expend and distribute their LBD tax proceeds with other schools in the county pro rata, that is, \"in the same manner as the county property tax for schools is expended and distributed\" by the county.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-4-306\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 57-4-306(a)(2)(A) (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We examined the proper interpretation of the distribution statute at length in\n   <em>\n    Coffee County\n   </em>\n   , the case arising out of the Middle Section Court of Appeals and released on the same date as this opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coffee Cnty.

May 8, 2019) (hereinafter \"\n   <em>\n    Coffee Cnty.\n   </em>\n   \"). After fulsome analysis, we concluded in\n   <em>\n    Coffee County\n   </em>\n   that the local education provision in the distribution statute \"required a municipality with its own school system to expend and distribute half of its LBD tax proceeds in the same manner that the county property tax for schools is expended and distributed within the municipality, which is for the benefit of the municipality's own school system.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 849.

Based on our analysis in\n   <em>\n    Coffee County\n   </em>\n   , we hold that the distribution statute did not require the City to share half of its LBD tax proceeds with the County and other school systems in the County pro rata. Rather, the local education provision directed the City to expend and distribute the education portion of its LBD tax proceeds in support of its own municipal school system. For this reason, we reverse the trial court and affirm the Court of Appeals decision in favor of the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The decision of the trial court is reversed and the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
