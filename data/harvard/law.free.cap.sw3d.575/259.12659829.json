Park, 410 N. Olive Street, and 2325 Guinotte Ave. The properties were primarily used for storage of items, much of which was not located within a building or structure and included several inoperable school buses. The southern two properties of land consist of 413 N. Park and 410 Olive Street and adjoin each other. Union Pacific has an easement for its railroad right-of-way running along the south side of these two properties. There is a public alleyway along the north side of these two properties, controlled by the City of Kansas City, Missouri (\"City\"), which intersects Park Street on the west and Olive Street on the east. The third property, 2325 Guinotte, is located north of the other two properties, separated from them by the public alleyway. There are no railroad right-of-ways or tracks that run adjacent to the property located at 2325 Guinotte, nor does that property abut any property owned or controlled by Union Pacific.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Tauvar's properties were in violation of certain fencing requirements of Chapter 80 of the City's Code (\"Zoning Code\") as well as other code violations. The Zoning Code required that since the property was used for storage, a cyclone-type fence at least eight feet in height is required to enclose the property to keep it from public access and view. A dispute arose between Tauvar and Union Pacific regarding the exact property line between Union Pacific's easement and Tauvar's two properties abutting the easement. Tauvar alleged that he had installed fencing to comply with the Zoning Code but Union Pacific had repeatedly removed portions of the fence in the area that abutted the railroad easement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The City notified Tauvar multiple times over many years, starting in 1995, of the requirement to fence the property because it was being used for the exterior storage of materials and alleging that he was in violation of the Zoning Code. Tauvar notified the City of the boundary line dispute between he and Union Pacific and his allegation that Union Pacific had been removing his fence. K.L.S. was an employee of the City who worked in the zoning compliance area and was the main person with the City attempting to obtain compliance for these properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   These properties were in a high crime area. In 2009 an inspection found that at least one homeless person was living in one of the busses stored on the property and a methamphetamine lab was being operated out of one of the unused buildings on the property. From 2008 through\n   the incident in 2012 there were continuing correspondence and conversations between K.L.S. on behalf of the City, Tauvar, and Union Pacific regarding the zoning violations, the boundary line dispute, and the required fencing of the properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During e-mail correspondence between Union Pacific and Tauvar regarding the ongoing property dispute, Tauvar asked Union Pacific to \"keep[ ] an eye out\" for an identified male who used to help Tauvar but had recently been seen by neighbors parking on the railroad tracks and going into the east side of Tauvar's building. Tauvar believed he was stealing or otherwise committing criminal offenses on the property. The message was forwarded by Espy, a Union Pacific Police Officer, to others who worked for Union Pacific, asking if Union Pacific could help Tauvar by increasing patrols near his property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   K.L.S. had visited Tauvar's property approximately 30 times to check on zoning compliance. On January 26, 2012, around 11:30 a.m., K.L.S. drove to the area of Tauvar's properties to photograph zoning violations on the property. K.L.S. parked and exited her vehicle on Olive Street. K.L.S. was in the public alleyway, preparing to take a photograph, when she was hit with a blunt object in the back of the head by an unknown assailant and knocked unconscious. The attacker then proceeded to beat K.L.S., sexually assault her at knifepoint, and steal items of personal property belonging to her and to the City. K.L.S. was then again knocked unconscious. She regained consciousness around 1:30 p.m. and called the police. The assailant was never identified or prosecuted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In January 2015, K.L.S. filed suit alleging negligence and negligence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   against Tauvar\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and negligence and negligence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   against Union Pacific and certain of its employees and \"liability for unlawful acts\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   against Union Pacific.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Union Pacific filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on March 21, 2017. K.L.S. filed a Response and Suggestions in Opposition on May 22, 2017. On July 13, 2017, K.L.S. filed a Motion to Strike Defendants Summary Judgment Affidavits, which included affidavits from Roger Poteet (\"Poteet\") and Steven Whitaker (\"Whitaker\"), which were among the exhibits submitted in support of Union Pacific's Motion for Summary Judgment. K.L.S. argued that Poteet's affidavit was untrue, or at best incompetent, because he gave sworn statements in the affidavit regarding the location of Union Pacific's northern ballast line between 1992 and 2011, but testified at a later deposition that the location was merely his assumption and he does not know the dimensions of the right-of-way. K.L.S. argued that Whitaker's affidavit was false and misleading because in the affidavit Whitaker testified that his opinion was based upon a Commissioners' Report from a case where land was condemned for a railroad right-of-way, but testified at a later deposition he actually relied on a survey conducted by the railroad in 1911 and he could not testify that any land was actually condemned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On July 24, 2017, Union Pacific filed a Suggestion in Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion to Strike Summary Judgment Affidavits. In the Suggestions, Union Pacific withdrew and did not, for purposes of its\n   summary judgment pleadings, \"rely on Mr. Poteet's Affidavit testimony concerning [Union Pacific's] 'Highline', or 'Lowline' railroad tracks, the ballast under those tracks, those tracks' subgrade and land underneath the ballast from 1992 when Mr. Poteet entered the [Union Pacific] Claims Department to his retirement in September 2011.\" In the Suggestions, Union Pacific also withdrew \"any argument from its summary judgment pleadings or references in Mr. Whitakers' Affidavit that any land was actually condemned in the action underlying the Commissioners' Report.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 18, 2017, Union Pacific filed a Motion to Limit the Scope of the Courts Review of its Two Pending Motions for Summary Judgment. In the Motion, Union Pacific \"specifically withdraws from its Response/Reply to Plaintiffs' Additional Statement of Materials [sic] Facts reliance upon the Affidavit of Roger Poteet or the Affidavit of Steven Whittaker.\" On August 21, 2017, K.L.S. filed Motions for Sanctions due to the false or misleading affidavits by Poteet and Whittaker. On February 2, 2018, a hearing was held on Union Pacific's Motion for Summary Judgment. On July 6, 2018, the court granted the motion in favor of Union Pacific and its employees.

In her first point K.L.S. argues that the trial court erred in granting Union Pacific's motion for summary judgment because it was error to rule as matter of law that Union Pacific did not owe a duty to K.L.S. K.L.S. contends it was foreseeable that the conduct of a third person could cause harm to K.L.S., Union Pacific's conduct increased\n   the risk of injury in the area, K.L.S. was an invitee, and Union Pacific assumed a duty of care. In her second point on appeal, K.L.S. argues that the trial court erred in failing to strike the affidavits of Poteet and Whitaker because the affidavits did not comply with Rule 74.04 since they were false and/or misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Point One\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In Point One, K.L.S. argues that the trial court erred in granting Union Pacific's motion for summary judgment because it was error to rule as a matter of law that Union Pacific did not have a duty to K.L.S. K.L.S. first argues that Union Pacific had a duty under the traditional principles of negligence law because special facts and circumstances clearly established that it was foreseeable that the conduct of a third person could harm K.L.S. K.L.S. argues that the high crime rate and the nature of the business made it foreseeable that a third person could cause K.L.S. harm. K.L.S. further argues that Union Pacific owed her a duty because it was foreseeable that by removing Tauvar's fence and/or failing to resolve the property dispute, it would result in someone getting hurt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"A petition seeking damages for negligence must allege ultimate facts which, if proven, show: 1) the existence of a duty on the part of the defendant to protect the plaintiff from injuries; 2) a breach of that duty; 3) causation; and 4) injury to the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Thiele v.

K.L.S. was not even on property where the ownership was disputed between Union Pacific and Tauvar. K.L.S. was standing in a public alleyway located on the opposite end of Tauvar's property from where Union Pacific railroad tracks lay. There was no evidence in the record to establish that Union Pacific was aware of the significant criminal activity in the area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   K.L.S. relies on an e-mail from Tauvar to an employee of Union Pacific regarding a distinct circumstance of a known person entering Tauvar's property illegally. While K.L.S. alleges that Union Pacific agreed to provide increased security patrols based on Tauvar's e-mail, a closer reading of the e-mail exchange only shows that one employee of Union Pacific contacted another employee of Union Pacific asking if they could assist Tauvar by increasing patrols in the area. Nothing in the record establishes that Union Pacific committed to actually providing additional patrols or the nature and extent of any agreement for additional patrols. Even given the high crime rate in the area, Union Pacific was under no duty to protect persons who are located in areas distinctly separated from any property Union Pacific owned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Under these facts, K.L.S. was not owed a duty by Union Pacific under the second exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   K.L.S. contends that whether or not the attack occurred on Union Pacific's property is irrelevant citing\n   <em>\n    Fincher v.

The injured plaintiffs in both\n   <em>\n    Aziz\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wilkins\n   </em>\n   were on property owned by the defendants. Here, K.L.S. was attacked by an unknown assailant while in a public alleyway which was not even adjacent to any property owned by Union Pacific. Further, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Aziz\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wilkins\n   </em>\n   where there were employees of the defendant present who could have intervened, there were no Union Pacific employees present who could have observed, known about or intervened in the attack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   K.L.S. then argues that Union Pacific owed her a duty because they were a possessor of Tauvar's property since they occupied the disputed portion of the property with the intent to control it. We need not address whether Union Pacific possessed Tauvar's property because it is undisputed that K.L.S. was attacked in a public alleyway and not on property owned by Union Pacific or even on property with disputed ownership between Union Pacific and Tauvar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   K.L.S. lastly argues that Union Pacific assumed a duty to resolve the property dispute and provide more security patrols. K.L.S. argues that Union pacific assumed the duty to resolve the property dispute between it and Tauvar and that by failing to resolve the dispute K.L.S. was forced to go to that location to take pictures of the zoning violation when she was attacked. She argues that but for Union Pacific's failure to resolve the boundary line dispute, Tauvar would have had the property properly fenced and there would not have been a need to K.L.S. to go to that location to photograph the zoning violations. K.L.S. further argues that Union Pacific voluntarily undertook a duty to assist Tauvar in patrolling the property to watch for criminal activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \"Missouri courts recognize that a defendant can assume a duty.\"\n   <em>\n    Bowan ex rel.

K.L.S. had come to observe and document zoning violations on Tauvar's property on multiple occasions prior to January 26, 2012. At the time of the attack, K.L.S. was not taking pictures of the lack of fencing that abutted Union Pacific's railroad tracks, which ran along the southern border of Tauvar's property. When she was attacked K.L.S. was taking a picture of the holes in the fence at the opposite end of the Tauvar's property where an abandoned school bus was stored. Further, there were zoning violations other than the alleged removal of the fence on Tauvar's land which would have caused K.L.S. to go to Tauvar's property irrespective of the boundary line dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   K.L.S. also alleges that Union Pacific assumed a duty to provide security patrols for this property. In support of this allegation, K.L.S. points to a March 24, 2010 e-mail between Tauvar and an employee of Union Pacific, where he stated that he hoped Union Pacific \"won't mind keeping an eye out\" for a certain known person that had been reported to have trespassed on the railroad right-of-way to gain access to certain buildings on Tauvar's property. Tauvar provided a vague description of the person and the vehicle that person was alleged to be driving. There is nothing in the record to support an inference that the person described in the e-mail was the person who assaulted K.L.S. Following receipt of this e-mail, the Union Pacific employee sent an e-mail to the Union Pacific police department asking \"can we help him with some patrols near his property? ? ?\" Based solely on these two e-mails, K.L.S. argues that Union Pacific undertook a duty to provide security patrols near Tauvar's property. Union Pacific, neither internally nor to Tauvar, agreed to actually provide extra security patrols. No evidence was provided that the K.L.S. was made aware of these emails or relied on them in anyway. Union Pacific never assumed a duty to provide extra security patrols.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hudson v.

Point One is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    Point Two\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In her second point on appeal, K.L.S. argued that the trial court erred in failing to strike the affidavits of Poteet and Whitaker or even rule on her motion to strike the affidavits or motion for sanctions prior to ruling on the motion for summary judgment because the affidavits did not comply with Rule 74.04. K.L.S. argues that the affidavits of Poteet and Whitaker were false and/or misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   After K.L.S. filed Plaintiffs' Motion to Strike Summary Judgment Affidavits, Union Pacific filed a Suggestion in Opposition to her motion to strike. In the Suggestions, Union Pacific withdrew and affirmatively stated that it did not, for purposes of its summary judgment pleadings, \"rely on Mr. Poteet's Affidavit testimony concerning [Union Pacific's] 'Highline', or 'Lowline' railroad tracks, the ballast under those tracks, those tracks' subgrade and land underneath the ballast from 1992 when Mr. Poteet entered the [Union Pacific] Claims Department to his retirement in September 2011.\" In the Suggestions, Union Pacific also withdrew \"any argument from its summary judgment pleadings or references in Mr. Whitakers' Affidavit that any land was actually condemned in the action underlying the Commissioners' Report.\" Union Pacific even filed a Motion to Limit the Scope of Courts Review of its Two Pending Motions for Summary Judgment. In the Motion, Union Pacific \"specifically withdraws from its Response/Reply to Plaintiffs' Additional Statement of Materials [sic] Facts reliance upon the Affidavit of Roger Poteet or the Affidavit of Steven Whittaker.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As both Poteet and Whittaker's affidavits were withdrawn, there was nothing left for the trial court to strike. The relief sought by K.L.S. was to have the affidavits stricken and removed from the court's consideration in ruling on summary judgment. As a result of Union Pacific withdrawing the affidavits and any argument relating to the affidavits, K.L.S. received the relief she was seeking. K.L.S.'s motion to strike the affidavits became moot when Union Pacific withdrew the affidavits and arguments relating to the affidavits because a request is moot when the question presented for decision seeks a ruling upon an issue which, if judgment were rendered, it would have no practical effect upon any existing controversy.\n   <em>\n    Kracman v.

Further, the facts contained in the affidavits in question were unnecessary in the court's ruling on the motion for summary judgment. Point Two is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We finally note that Union Pacific claims that this a frivolous appeal and sanctions should be awarded. Rule 84.19 provides that \"[i]f an appellate court shall determine that an appeal is frivolous it may award damages to the respondent as the court shall deem just and proper.\" \"A frivolous appeal is one that presents no justiciable question and is so readily recognizable as devoid of merit that there is little prospect that it can ever succeed.\"\n   <em>\n    Prenger v.
