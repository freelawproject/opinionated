In five points on appeal, he contends that the circuit court erred in finding statutory grounds for termination and that termination was in the child's best interests. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, a memorandum explaining the reasons for the decision has been provided to the parties. The judgment is affirmed. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
