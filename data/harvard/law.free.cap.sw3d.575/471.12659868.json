Mr. Newberry and Ms. Lowrance assert the circuit court improperly sustained Dollar General's motions to compel arbitration because Dollar General failed to meet its burden to show consideration supported either the employee arbitration agreements or the provisions delegating threshold issues of arbitrability to the arbitrator. This Court issued a preliminary writ in each case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This Court holds the arbitration agreement in each case includes a delegation clause providing that the arbitrator decides issues of formation - namely, whether there was consideration for the arbitration agreements. Because Mr. Newberry and Ms. Lowrance do not raise challenges specific to the delegation provisions, the circuit court properly sustained Dollar General's motions to compel arbitration, stayed the cases, and ordered the parties to arbitrate the question of whether consideration existed. The preliminary writs are quashed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In August 2014, Dollar General began prompting its employees each time they logged into their computers to electronically sign a document titled \"Dollar General Employee Arbitration Agreement.\" The agreement requires Dollar General and its employees to settle \"Covered Claims,\" including discrimination and retaliation, in arbitration. It indicates all arbitrations are to be conducted in accordance with the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") Employment Arbitration Rules, \"except as superseded by the terms of this [a]greement.\" As incorporated, AAA Employment Arbitration Rule 6.a provides arbitrators \"shall have the power to rule on [their] own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the arbitration agreement.\" The agreement itself, however, supersedes the\n   AAA rule by stating claims regarding the \"scope or enforceability\" of the agreement are not considered arbitrable \"Covered Claims.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The agreement further contains language permitting Dollar General employees to \"opt out\" of the agreement, provided the employees complete and submit an \"Arbitration Opt Out Form\" within 30 days of accessing the agreement. On the other hand, the agreement advises that if employees take no action within 30 days of the initial notice, the agreement automatically goes into effect. Ms. Lowrance, an at-will employee of nine years at the time, and Mr. Newberry, an at-will employee of 15 years at the time, testified they asked the district manager about the consequences of failing to sign the agreement. The manager informed them they would likely be discharged if they did not sign. Fearing loss of employment, Mr. Newberry and Ms. Lowrance electronically signed their agreements in August 2014. No Dollar General representatives signed the agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Newberry was discharged in June 2016, and Ms. Lowrance was discharged in October 2016. Both timely filed charges of discrimination with the Missouri Human Rights Commission and received notices of right to sue. In July 2017, Mr. Newberry timely filed a petition against Dollar General asserting sex, age, and disability discrimination, along with retaliation for voicing his opposition to the discrimination, against Dolgencorp and the supervisors who oversaw the discrimination and retaliation. In November 2017, Ms. Lowrance timely filed a separate petition raising the same claims against the same defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dollar General filed motions to compel Mr. Newberry and Ms. Lowrance to submit their claims to arbitration and stay further proceedings. In their suggestions opposing Dollar General's motions to compel, Mr. Newberry and Ms. Lowrance argued there was no consideration for the arbitration agreements. They further claimed to \"specifically challenge[ ]\" the delegation provisions by asserting they are unconscionable and there is no \"clear and unmistakable evidence\" of the parties' intent to incorporate them. During the hearing about Dollar General's motions to compel arbitration, Mr. Newberry and Ms. Lowrance testified they signed the agreements with knowledge they would be bound to arbitrate covered claims, read the documents before they signed them, read the \"opt out\" provisions, but did not necessarily \"understand\" the documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In January 2018, the circuit court sustained Dollar General's motions to compel arbitration and stay proceedings, finding \"no reason the principles of [\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Mr. Newberry and Ms. Lowrance subsequently petitioned this Court for a writ of mandamus or prohibition compelling the circuit court to rescind its orders for arbitration and prohibiting the circuit court from requiring them to submit their claims to arbitration.

They assert Dollar General failed to show consideration supported their agreements to arbitrate, including the severed delegation clauses. Specifically, they assert consideration is required for a delegation clause to come into effect as a contract. They claim, when a defense of lack of consideration is raised, the party seeking to compel arbitration has the burden of proof, which is a higher burden of proof than for contract defenses such as unconscionability, fraud, and illegality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Newberry and Ms. Lowrance contend threshold issues of formation cannot be delegated to an arbitrator unless there is a contract to arbitrate and a delegation clause that are both supported by consideration. They argue arbitrators cannot decide threshold issues of formation simply \"when any document purporting to require arbitration declares applicability of the AAA Rules,\" regardless of whether consideration existed for the delegation provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It is well-established that contract law governs arbitration agreements.\n   <em>\n    Rent-A-Ctr.

Instead, they asserted the delegation clauses were invalid due to an unspecified \"unconscionability\" rather than a lack of consideration. But, in this Court, as well as in their writ petitions in the court of appeals, they dropped their claims of unconscionability and asserted for the first time that there was no consideration for the delegation clauses in their contracts because those clauses were part of arbitration agreements\n   that themselves were made without consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   These allegations are inadequate to constitute a specific challenge to the delegation provision.

Because the lack of consideration Mr. Newberry and Ms. Lowrance assert with respect to the delegation clauses is the same lack of consideration they claim should invalidate the overall arbitration agreements, they do not raise a unique challenge to the delegation clauses.
