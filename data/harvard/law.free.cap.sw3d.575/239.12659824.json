Upon review of the briefs and the record, we find no error and affirm the judgment denying declaratory relief. We have provided the parties with a Memorandum explaining the reasons for our decision, because a published opinion would have no precedential value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   AFFIRMED.
