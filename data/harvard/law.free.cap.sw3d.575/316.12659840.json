In each case, the county had not approved the liquor-by-the-drink sales, but the city had approved such sales. The Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Revenue, who collects taxes on all liquor-by-the-drink sales, distributed tax proceeds to the defendant cities in accordance with the liquor-by-the-drink tax distribution statute, Tennessee Code Annotated section 57-4-306. The statute required the recipient cities to then distribute half of their proceeds \"in the same manner as the county property tax for schools is expended and distributed.\" Tenn. Code. Ann. \u00a7 57-4-306(a)(2)(A) (2013). In each case, the recipient city distributed half of its tax proceeds to its own city school system and did not share the proceeds with the county. The counties sued the cities, claiming that the statute required the cities to distribute the tax proceeds as the counties distribute the county property tax for schools, which is pro rata among all schools in the county based on average daily attendance. In the instant case, the trial court granted summary judgment for the defendant cities. The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that the distribution statute was ambiguous and that the statutory framework, legislative history, and other sources supported the trial court's interpretation of the statute. Discerning no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The issues in this case are better understood with some knowledge of the development of the pertinent liquor-by-the-drink statutes.

The distribution statute said that half of those proceeds would go to the general fund of the county, city, or town in which the taxes were generated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-4-306\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 57-4-306(a)(2)(B).

Interpretation of this provision is the issue presented to us in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Sullivan County\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The underlying facts in this case are essentially undisputed. The Cities of Bristol\n   and Kingsport (collectively, \"the Cities\") are located in Sullivan County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Cities have at all relevant times had their own municipal school systems separate from the Sullivan County school system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 1984, citizens of both Cities passed referendums authorizing LBD sales within their city limits. The County has never passed a referendum regarding LBD sales. However, since at least 1980, private clubs have legally sold LBD in the Cities and in unincorporated areas of the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On May 30, 2014, the Sullivan County Board of Education and Sullivan County filed separate complaints against the Cities. Both sought declaratory judgment as to the rights and obligations of the parties concerning LBD tax proceeds. The cases were ultimately consolidated. Hereinafter we refer to the Sullivan County Board of Education and Sullivan County collectively as \"the County.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The County also sought damages from the Cities for its pro rata share of LBD tax proceeds distributed to the Cities since 1980.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The County alleged that the distribution statute required the Cities to remit half of their LBD tax proceeds to the County, to distribute pro rata among all schools in the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Cities denied liability. They also asserted counterclaims against the County based on distribution reports attached to the County's complaints. The distribution reports showed that the County had been receiving LBD tax proceeds from the sale of LBD in private clubs for many years, but that it had never redistributed those proceeds pro rata to the other schools in the County. The Cities claimed in their counterclaims that the County owed them damages for their pro rata share of LBD tax proceeds unlawfully withheld.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Subsequently, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In their joint motion for summary judgment, the Cities argued that the distribution statute was ambiguous and that the statute's legislative history and longstanding rules of statutory construction supported a ruling in the Cities' favor. In its motion, the County asserted that the plain language of the distribution statute required the Cities to distribute their LBD tax proceeds pro rata across all schools in the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In February 2016, the trial court entered an order granting the Cities' motion for summary judgment and denying the County's motion on the main allegations in the County's complaint. The trial court first concluded that the distribution statute was unambiguous in favor of the Cities' interpretation. The County's interpretation, the trial court reasoned, required a two-part distribution scheme, whereby the Commissioner would distribute LBD tax proceeds to the Cities, and then the Cities would be required to distribute half of those proceeds in accordance with an average daily attendance formula. \"Nowhere does the language require the municipalities to distribute the funds according to the average daily attendance.\" The trial court also concluded that the distribution statute plainly did not require the Cities to turn over half of their LBD tax proceeds to the County for redistribution, because this would require \"a third distribution scheme\" that is not required by the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For these reasons alone, the trial court held, the Cities were entitled to summary judgment. In the alternative, the trial court said that, even if the statute were ambiguous, the legislative history supported the trial court's conclusion that cities operating their own school systems were not required to share their LBD tax proceeds with county schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Cities then filed a joint motion for summary judgment on their counterclaims against the County. In September 2016, after discovery and further briefings by both parties, the trial court entered an order granting summary judgment for the Cities. It ordered the County to pay $ 107,286 to Kingsport and $ 75,802 to Bristol, amounts that reflected each City's pro rata share of the undistributed private club LBD tax proceeds received by the County between 1980 and 2013. The County appealed the trial court's grant of summary judgment on its claim for LBD tax proceeds, but it did not challenge the trial court's grant of summary judgment on the Cities' counterclaims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Around the same time, three other cases involving the same issue regarding the distribution statute were appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Eastern Section.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blount Cnty.
