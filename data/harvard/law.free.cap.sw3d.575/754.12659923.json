Gordon Snyder (Snyder), Heartland Financial Services, LLC (Heartland) and Navigator Investment Services, LLC (Navigator) (collectively \"B.S.H.N. Defendants\") appeal the order of the Circuit Court of Jackson County denying their motion to compel arbitration of a cause of action brought by Abdiana Properties, Inc. and Abdiana Ice House, Inc. (together \"Abdiana\"). In Points 1, 3, and 4 of their appeal, the B.S.H.N. Defendants assert that Abdiana entered into a Private Debt Financing Agreement with Stone Development Inc. (\"Stone,\" a separate defendant that is not one of the appellants) and that because Abdiana's claims against the B.S.H.N. Defendants are related to, rely upon, and are intertwined with the Private Debt Financing Agreement, the B.S.H.N. Defendants are entitled, though non-signatories, to enforce the arbitration clause in said agreement. In Point 2 of their appeal, B.S.H.N. Defendants contend that Abdiana and Defendant Navigator executed a written Consulting Fee Agreement that included an arbitration clause, and that this was enforceable not only by Navigator, but also by the remaining non-signatory B.S.H.N. Defendants (Bengtson, Snyder, and Heartland). We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In April of 2014, Christina and Nicholas Abnos\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , the owners of Abdiana, reached\n   out to Bengtson, the principal of Heartland, with whom they had worked in the past, to discuss obtaining a line of credit to use in property development. Bengtson undertook assisting the Abnoses in obtaining a source of private funding in the amount of $ 3,500,000. With the Abnoses' approval, Bengtson had Snyder assist him in this task.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Through the B.S.H.N. Defendants, Abdiana began communicating with Stone, a secondary market lender based in California. The B.S.H.N. Defendants maintained that they had successfully closed loans with Stone in the past. Defendants then provided Abdiana a \"Letter of Commitment\" from Stone, which included the terms of the proposed loan, which required that Abdiana pay a $ 52,500 loan commitment fee, and which provided that Stone would refund the loan commitment fee if it did not fully fund the $ 3,500,000 credit facility within sixty days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 27, 2014, prior to making any payments to Stone, Christina received an email from Bengtson which included a proposed (but unsigned) Consulting Fee Agreement to be executed by Abdiana (by Managing Member Nicholas Abnos) and Defendant Navigator (by Bengtson, as \"Manager Consultant\"). Bengtson also provided documentation purporting to show that Stone possessed enough funds to fulfill its role. After receiving this supporting information, Abdiana sent three wire transfers totaling the entire $ 52,500 loan commitment fee to Verlin Gradney (a separate defendant alleged to be a principal and trustee of Stone). These separate transfers began on May 30, 2014, with a transfer of $ 31,500; and were completed on June 4, 2014. The proposed Consulting Fee Agreement provided that Navigator would receive a 3% commission on any amounts loaned to Abdiana by any money lending sources introduced by Navigator; and also contained an arbitration provision governing any disputes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On June 2, 2014, after sending the first wire transfer partly paying the loan commitment fee, Christina replied to Bengtson's email with a proposed Consulting Fee Agreement attached, which had been revised and signed by Christina as Managing Member of Abdiana. Christina had crossed out an indemnification provision in the proposed Consulting Fee Agreement, and noted that this provision was intentionally deleted. Neither Bengtson, nor anyone else, signed the revised Consulting Fee Agreement on behalf of Navigator or the other B.S.H.N. Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Abdiana and Stone later executed a Private Debt Financing Agreement, which purportedly included an arbitration provision. The Private Debt Financing Agreement was not included with the motion to compel arbitration and does not appear to have been provided to the circuit court, and is not included in our legal file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In September of 2015, after repeated requests to be provided the loan funding or have their loan commitment fee reimbursed, Abdiana was informed, during a conference call with Bengtson and representatives of Stone, that Stone was unable to fund the credit facility and was unable to refund the $ 52,500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Abdiana filed the underlying action on May 6, 2016, and their First Amended Verified Petition for Damages on June 2, 2017. Abdiana brought claims for fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and civil conspiracy against\n   the B.S.H.N. Defendants (the Appellants), and also against Stone, Gradney, and others. Abdiana also brought a count of professional negligence against Bengtson, Snyder, and Heartland; a breach of contract claim against Stone; and a claim for conversion against Gradney. The B.S.H.N. Defendants filed a motion to compel arbitration on January 22, 2018, which was denied by the trial court in its written order filed on May 29, 2018.

In\n   <em>\n    Ryan\n   </em>\n   , the appellant's failure to prove (through a hearing, affidavit, or other method) that the purported arbitration agreement attached to its motion was the actual contract between the two parties was fatal to its claims on appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7299268,7299286\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/296/471/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Here, the B.S.H.N.

Defendants are entitled to compel arbitration under the terms of the Consulting Fee Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   However, the B.S.H.N. Defendants' Request for Admissions did not establish the authenticity of the Private Debt Financing Agreement and they did not attach a copy of that agreement (verified or otherwise) to their Motion to Compel Arbitration. Consequently, it would be appropriate to decline to review Appellants' claim that they are entitled to rely upon the Private Debt Financing Agreement to compel arbitration. Because Appellants did include a request for a hearing in their reply suggestions, and because they also offered to provide the contract for in camera review by the trial court, we will, in the interest of judicial economy, consider enforcement of the purported arbitration clause included in the Private Debt Financing Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"Absent a contract to arbitrate, no party has a unilateral right to impose on another party a requirement of arbitration as the sole procedure for dispute resolution.\"\n   <em>\n    Morrow v.

Appellants cannot rely on their conduct signaling their acceptance when they were acting in that capacity prior to receiving the amended Consulting Fee Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The B.S.H.N. Defendants maintain, without specific citation or explanation, that \"Respondents' First Amended Verified Petition provides a clear indication that the Consulting Fee Agreement was considered an enforceable agreement between Respondents and Appellants.\" Appellants also contend that Abdiana admitted entering into the Consulting Fee Agreement and admitted that the Consulting Fee Agreement was enforceable. While Appellants provide a citation to the record for these assertions, our examination of the record reveals no support for the assertion that Abdiana conceded the Consulting Fee Agreement was enforceable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Point 2 is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In points 1, 3, and 4, the B.S.H.N. Defendants contend that arbitration is required because, even though they are not parties to the Private Debt Financing Agreement (entered into between Abdiana and Stone), they are nevertheless entitled to enforce its arbitration clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In Point 1, they assert that a non-signatory may compel arbitration \"when the signatory to a written agreement containing an arbitration clause 'must rely on the terms of the written agreement in asserting [its] claims' against the nonsignatory.\"\n   <em>\n    CD Partners, LLC v.

Or, as the Missouri Supreme Court has noted, a non-signatory may be able to compel arbitration against a signatory to an agreement when \"the very basis of the claim against the non-signatory was that it had breached duties and responsibilities purportedly assigned it by the agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Netco, Inc. v.

While Appellants accurately recite the general state of the law, they fail to\n   explain how it applies in this matter. In fact, they fail to include the Private Debt Financing Agreement between Stone and Abdiana in their record before the circuit court or in this appeal. The acts of Bengtson (inducing Abdiana's payments and in securing Stone's Letter of Commitment) which form the basis of their claims against the B.S.H.N. Defendants occurred\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   Abdiana entered into the Private Debt Financing Agreement with Stone. Abdiana makes no reference to the Private Debt Financing Agreement in their Amended Petition, and none of their claims against the B.S.H.N. Defendants are derived from its enforcement. Abdiana does not rely on the terms of the Private Debt Financing Agreement in asserting its claims against the nonsignatory B.S.H.N. Defendants. The B.S.H.N. Defendants are not entitled to enforce its arbitration clause on that basis.\n   <em>\n    Netco, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   194 S.W.3d at 361.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Point 1 is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In point 3 of their appeal, the B.S.H.N. Defendants argue they are entitled to enforce the arbitration clause of the Private Debt Financing Agreement, because Abdiana's Amended Petition refers \"to Stone Development, Inc., a signatory to the arbitration agreement, and Appellants collectively as Defendants and ascribe their acts collectively.\" Missouri does permit a nonsignatory to an agreement to enforce that agreement where a plaintiff \" 'made allegations which treat all these parties [signatories and non-signatories] as though they were signatories to the agreements.' \"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

Defendants fail to explain how this principle applies in the case at hand. They cite Counts I and IV of Abdiana's Amended Petition, which include claims of fraudulent misrepresentation and civil conspiracy against all defendants; but ignore the allegations throughout the Amended Petition that differentiate the various and separate roles the defendants played in conspiring to perpetrate the alleged fraud. The Amended Petition includes a separate count against Stone individually (regarding its breach of contract respecting the Letter of Commitment), two separate counts against Gradney individually (for conversion and constructive trust), and a separate count against the B.S.H.N. Defendants only (for negligence). The various claims brought against the defendants in this case are not treated as \"a single one that should be referred in its entirety to arbitration.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11104998\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/248/720/#p728\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The B.S.H.N.

While Appellants relate at length their connections to Stone, the type of relationship they describe is factually distinct in material ways from the cases they cite. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Nitro Distrib., CD Partners\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Kohner\n   </em>\n   , the non-signatories to the agreement containing the arbitration agreement were members, officers, or agents of the entity that was a party to the arbitration agreement.\n   <em>\n    Nitro Distrib., Inc. v.

As that case explains:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n    While the appellant in its point relied on does identify the ruling it is challenging and in general terms the legal reasons for the claim of reversible error, it fails to sufficiently \"explain in summary fashion why, in the context of the case, those legal reasons support the claim of reversible error,\" as required by Rule 84.04(d)(1)(C). Thus, it is nothing more than an abstract statement of law, which fails to satisfy the requirements of the rule as to a proper point relied on. Rule 84.04(d)(4). A point relied on which does not state why the legal reasons support the claim of reversible error, but instead sets out an abstract statement of law, is deficient and preserves nothing for appeal.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Because we can determine the actual claim of error and the basis for it in the argument, we review\n    <em>\n     ex gratia.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    In their petition Plaintiffs acknowledge signing the Consulting Fee Agreement, but do not indicate it was enforceable, and do not make contractual claims seeking its enforcement.
