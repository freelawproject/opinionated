In each case, the county had not approved the liquor-by-the-drink sales, but the city had approved such sales. The Commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Revenue, who collects taxes on all liquor-by-the-drink sales, distributed tax proceeds to the defendant cities in accordance with the liquor-by-the-drink tax distribution statute, Tennessee Code Annotated section 57-4-306. The statute required the recipient cities to then distribute half of their proceeds \"in the same manner as the county property tax for schools is expended and distributed.\" Tenn. Code. Ann. \u00a7 57-4-306(a)(2)(A) (2013). In each case, the recipient city distributed half of its tax proceeds to its own city school system and did not share the proceeds with the county. The counties sued the cities, claiming that the statute required the cities to distribute the tax proceeds as the counties distribute the county property tax for schools, which is pro rata among all schools in the county based on average daily attendance. In the instant case, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the city. The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that the distribution statute was ambiguous and that the statutory framework, legislative history, and other sources supported the trial court's interpretation of the statute. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The issues in this case are better understood with some knowledge of the development of the pertinent liquor-by-the-drink statutes.

Interpretation of this provision is the issue presented to us in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Bradley County\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The underlying facts in this case are essentially undisputed. The City of Cleveland (\"the City\") is located in Bradley County. The City has at all relevant times had its own municipal school system separate from the Bradley County school system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2002, citizens of the City passed a referendum authorizing LBD sales within City limits. The citizens of Bradley County rejected a similar referendum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Prior to the 2002 City referendum, the City had received LBD tax revenues from lawful alcohol sales at private clubs within its corporate limits. After the referendum, the City received LBD tax revenues from LBD sales at private clubs as well as other approved establishments within its corporate limits. The City never distributed any of its LBD tax proceeds to either Bradley County or the Bradley County School System.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On April 14, 2014, the Bradley County School System, by and through the Bradley County Board of Education, filed a lawsuit against the City in the trial court below. The plaintiff sought, among other things, a declaratory judgment as to the rights and obligations of the parties under the LBD Act and damages for past LBD tax proceeds allegedly due under the Act \"from the date of inception of the statute.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court later permitted Bradley County to participate in the case as an intervening plaintiff. Hereinafter, we refer to the Bradley County School System and Bradley County collectively as \"the County.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In May 2014, the City filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. It argued that the LBD Act was inapplicable to the County and, by extension, to the Bradley County School Board, based on Tennessee Code Annotated section 57-4-103(a).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-4-103\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 57-4-103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2013) (\"This chapter shall be effective in any jurisdiction which authorizes the sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises in a referendum in the manner prescribed by \u00a7 57-3-106....\"). After a hearing, the trial court denied the City's motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Subsequently, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In July 2015, the trial court entered an order granting summary judgment in favor of the City. The trial court noted that, under Tennessee Code Annotated section 57-4-103(a), the distribution provision applied only to local political subdivisions that had authorized LBD sales by referendum. Because the County had rejected a referendum authorizing LBD sales, the trial court reasoned, it \"has neither rights nor responsibilities under\" the LBD Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The County filed a motion to alter or amend arguing, among other things, that the trial court had misinterpreted the LBD Act by overlooking the fact that the distribution statute applied to private club LBD sales regardless of whether the local political subdivision had adopted LBD by referendum. The trial court denied the County's motion in part, reserving judgment on the question of whether private club LBD tax proceeds received by the City prior to the 2002 referendum should have been shared with the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After further briefing, the trial court granted summary judgment to the City\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   and denied the County's motion to alter or amend. The trial court explained that it had \"been provided no authority stating that pre-referendum taxes collected from private clubs should be allocated differently.\" Accordingly, the trial court entered a final order granting summary judgment in favor of the City and dismissing the complaint. The County filed a timely appeal from the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Around the same time, three other cases involving the same issue regarding the distribution statute were appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Eastern Section.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blount Cnty.

The italicized portion of the statute, which we call \"the local education provision,\" is the specific provision in dispute in this case.

May 8, 2019) (hereinafter \"\n   <em>\n    Coffee Cnty.\n   </em>\n   \"). After fulsome analysis, we concluded in\n   <em>\n    Coffee County\n   </em>\n   that the local education provision in the distribution statute \"required a municipality with its own school system to expend and distribute half of its LBD tax proceeds in the same manner that the county property tax for schools is expended and distributed within the municipality, which is for the benefit of the municipality's own school system.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 849. In that case, because the City of Tullahoma had its own school system, we held that the city \"was not required to share its LBD tax proceeds with the [c]ounty\" during the relevant time period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 849.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The issue in the instant case is substantively indistinguishable from the issue decided in\n   <em>\n    Coffee County\n   </em>\n   . We did not specifically address the City's argument based on Section 57-4-103(a) in\n   <em>\n    Coffee County\n   </em>\n   , because doing so was unnecessary based on our interpretation of the distribution statute. The same is true for the instant case. Therefore, based on our holding in\n   <em>\n    Coffee County\n   </em>\n   , we hold that the distribution statute did not require the\n   City to share half of its LBD tax proceeds with the County and other school systems in the County pro rata. Rather, the local education provision directed the City to expend and distribute the education portion of its LBD tax proceeds in support of its own municipal school system. Our conclusion applies to all LBD tax proceeds paid to the City-those generated from pre-2002 referendum LBD tax proceeds from private club sales as well as those generated post-referendum. For this reason, we affirm the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the City, albeit on a different basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The decisions of the trial court and the Court of Appeals are affirmed.

Tennessee Code Annotated section 57-4-101(a)(2) authorizes private club sales \"subject to the further provisions of [Chapter 4]\n    <em>\n     other than \u00a7 57-4-103\n    </em>\n    \" (which makes Chapter 4 applicable to jurisdictions that have voted for LBD sales by referendum).\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2057-4-101\">\n     Tenn.
