Townsend (\"Movant\") appeals the motion court's denial, without an evidentiary hearing, of her amended motion for post-conviction relief under Mo. Sup. Ct. Rule 29.15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Movant was convicted of robbery in the first degree and armed criminal action for taking bus transfer passes and a bus driver's wig at knifepoint after an escalating argument with the bus driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Movant contends she received ineffective assistance of trial counsel, raising two points on appeal: (1) counsel failed to submit the lesser-included offense of felony robbery in the second degree in addition to submitting instruction on the offense of misdemeanor stealing; and (2) counsel failed to object to Jury Instruction No. 5 where it departed from the original charging document's identification of bus transfer tickets as the sole property forcibly taken to include the forcible taking of the wig. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal and find that the motion court did not clearly err in\n   denying post-conviction relief. An extended opinion would have no precedential value. We have, however, provided a memorandum opinion only for use of the parties setting forth the reasons for the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We affirm the judgment pursuant to Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    All rule citations are to the Missouri Supreme Court Rules (2011) unless otherwise indicated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
