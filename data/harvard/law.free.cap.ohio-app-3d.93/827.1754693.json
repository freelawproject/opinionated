Appellant submits that the ordinance under which he was convicted, Section 607.19 of the Cleveland Codified Ordinances, is unconstitutionally vague and overly broad. He, therefore, argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss as the ordinance violates the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We find merit in appellant\u2019s argument, and conclude that the complaint issued by plaintiff-appellee, the city of Cleveland, should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">Detective Brian Heffernan testified during appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss hearing that on April 7, 1992, detectives were assigned to surveillance of the 1446 West 57th Street area due to neighborhood drug activity complaints. At approximately 5:00 p.m., appellant and several males were suspected of engaging in drug transactions. Appellant was travelling to and from a house, \u201ca common activity for drug dealers to do on the street.\u201d Detectives warned appellant about the complaints of drug activity, and advised him to leave the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-12\">Later that evening, at about 8:30 p.m., detectives once again noticed appellant when he approached two vehicles, and participated in suspected drug sales. Appellant was next seen leaning into a car which was stopped in the middle of the street. The detectives approached appellant in an undercover vehicle; appellant started to run away. Appellant disappeared from the detectives\u2019 sight for several seconds, but the detectives caught up to him. A search revealed that appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>was not in possession of any drugs, but he was nonetheless arrested for loitering and charged under Section 607.19 of the Cleveland Codified Ordinances (\u201cC.C.O. 607.19\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Appellant thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the charge based upon the alleged unconstitutionality of the ordinance. The trial court overruled the motion after hearing oral argument, leading to appellant\u2019s plea of no contest. Appellant was subsequently sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one hundred eighty days. This appeal followed, with appellant raising as his sole assignment of error the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">In both <em>Cleveland v. Snow </em>(Apr. 15, 1993), Cuyahoga App. No. 61871, unreported, 1993 WL 120278, and <em>Cleveland v. DeBose </em>(Apr. 8, 1993), Cuyahoga App. No. 61870, unreported, 1993 WL 106950, this court reversed decisions of the Cleveland Municipal Court holding that C.C.O. 607.19 was unconstitutional. Specifically, we found that the defendants \u201cfailed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt that Section 607.19 is either overbroad or vague.\u201d <em>DeBose. </em>The authorities relied upon in rendering this conclusion, however, have been recently questioned by the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Akron v. Rowland </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 374, 618 N. E.2d 138. Consequently, this court must revisit the opinions previously announced in <em>Snow </em>and <em>DeBose </em>as we are obligated to follow the decisions of the Supreme Court of Ohio. See <em>Krause v. Krause </em>(1972), 31 Ohio St.2d 132, 148, 60 O.O.2d 100, 108-109, 285 N.E.2d 736, 746 (Corrigan, J., concurring); <em>Hogan v. Hogan </em>(1972), 29 Ohio App.2d 69, 77, 58 O.O.2d 80, 85, 278 N.E.2d 367, 372-373.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">In <em>Rowland, </em>police officers first observed Rowland, who was a thirty-two-year-old, unemployed, African-American male, when he leaned into the window of a car stopped on Copley Road. There was a traffic signal and a small, convenience-type store located on the corner of Copley Road and Madison Avenue. Rowland entered the store when the officers advised him through a loudspeaker not to loiter in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">Rowland was later seen leaning into another car which was stopped on Madison Avenue. He walked to the front of the store when the officers pulled up next to the stopped vehicle. <em>Id., </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 376, 618 N.E.2d at 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">The officers saw Rowland talking with a group of people in front of the store at least a couple of times throughout the evening. According to the officers, every time Rowland was aware of their surveillance, he would enter the store. Furthermore, the officers at some point discovered Rowland had a prior drug conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>Rowland started to walk away from the store at approximately 7:00 p.m. with another person. The officers pulled their vehicle up next to him, and asked him to approach the cruiser. They did so on the pretext of asking for Rowland\u2019s assistance in identifying a photograph of a suspected robber. Rowland refused to approach the car. He was standing between twenty and twenty-five feet from the cruiser and it was very dark outside. Rowland then ran away.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">One officer pursued him, believing that Rowland handed something to his companion before taking flight. The officer who chased Rowland testified that it appeared Rowland threw something to the ground while running, and placed something into his mouth after he stopped. This officer caught, arrested, and searched Rowland and the area of his arrest. No drugs or drug paraphernalia were discovered in the searches. Additionally, the city did not provide any evidence of a drug-related offense at Rowland\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">The municipal court found Akron Codified Ordinances (\u201cA.C.O.\u201d) 138.26 to be constitutional. It then concluded that the defendant violated the ordinance by loitering \u201c \u2018in a manner and under circumstances manifesting the purpose to engage in drug-related activity!.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Rowland, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 376, 618 N.E.2d at 141. The court stated that the \u201c \u2018combination of all these factors [subsections (B)(1), (B)(3), (B)(5), (B)(6), and (B)(9) ] over a period of two hours after dark in the wintertime indicates something other than just standing out for sociability reasons.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The Summit County Court of Appeals affirmed the decision. The Supreme Court of Ohio, however, found A.C.O. 138.26<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to be unconstitutional. <em>Id. </em>at 389, 618 N.E.2d at 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">The issue in the present appeal is, therefore, whether C.C.O. 607.19 is significantly different from A.C.O. 138.26 to allow it to withstand appellant\u2019s constitutional challenge. We review this issue cognizant of the fact that in both <em>Snow </em>and <em>DeBose </em>this court characterized the Akron ordinance as nearly identical to the Cleveland ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">The majority of the Supreme Court in <em>Rowland </em>initially rejected the manner in which the Summit County Court of Appeals constructed A.C.O. 138.26, which was by adding the element of specific intent to the ordinance. The ordinance contained no requirement of specific intent on behalf of the accused; rather, it contained a prohibition against loitering \u201cin a manner and under circumstances manifesting the purpose to engage in drug-related activity.\u201d Further, not only does the ordinance not contain \u201cspecific intent\u201d language, but a specific intent requirement is irreconcilable with the goal of the ordinance, which is to punish offenders who act under \u201ccircumstances manifesting\u201d a purpose to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>commit a drug crime. Therefore, although legislative enactments should be interpreted so as to avoid serious constitutional questions, the appellate court, by adding the element into the ordinance, \u201crewrote it in such a way as to fundamentally change its meaning.\u201d <em>Id., </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 380, 618 N.E.2d at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">The Supreme Court, having established that the appellate court erred in its construction of A.C.O. 138.26, proceeded to analyze whether the ordinance as written was either vague or overly broad under either the federal or state Due Process Clauses. The court concluded that when the circumstances enumerated in A.C.O. 138.26(B) are used as mere examples of the \u201ccircumstances\u201d which may manifest drug-related activity, no actual evidence of the existence of the circumstances is necessary to support an arrest or conviction. If this approach is used, the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague. <em>Id. </em>at 381, 618 N.E.2d at 144-145. On the other hand, if actual evidence of the circumstances is necessary, the ordinance is unconstitutionally overbroad. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">With regard to the former interpretation, the court found two deficiencies in the language of the ordinance. First, it failed to provide notice to citizens as to what conduct was prohibited, or it was unduly open-ended and encroached on legal or permissible conduct. For example, there was no indication that Rowland was engaged in any drug activity. Yet the arresting officers were able to look at either the enumerated circumstances in A.C.O. 138.26(B) or draw upon their experience as police offices to surmise that Rowland was acting in a way which \u201cmanifested\u201d drug activity unbeknownst to Rowland. Finally, if the average person carefully perused the ordinance, he or she would be unable to understand what acts \u201cmanifest\u201d illegal activity, and would not be able to distinguish between innocent and illegal activity on the street. Consequently, \u201c \u2018[a] citizen cannot determine its meaning so that he may regulate his conduct. There is nothing in the ordinance that would enable him to know the dividing line between innocent loitering (for example, window shopping) and criminal loitering.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383, 618 N.E.2d at 146, quoting <em>Seattle v. Drew </em>(1967), 70 Wash.2d 405, 410, 423 P.2d 522, 524, 25 A.L.R.3d 827, 833 (ruling on ordinance very similar to A.C.O. 138.26). Second, the ordinance invited arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement among minorities, and was almost exclusively enforced against African-Americans.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Rowland, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 384-385, 618 N.E.2d at 146-147. The enforcement problem resulted from the ability of police officers to look at circumstances outside those enumerated in the ordinance to effectuate an arrest for loitering. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>After all, an arrest was possible even without the commission of a crime based upon suspicion alone. The ordinance thus failed to provide \u201can objective basis upon which to measure criminal behavior or guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385, 618 N.E.2d at 147. These two deficiencies, the lack of objective criteria with which to measure whether a citizen is \u201cloitering,\u201d and the consequent arbitrary enforcement allowed by this lack of criteria, resulted in an unconstitutionally vague ordinance. <em>Id. </em>at 386, 618 N.E.2d at 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Even when the Supreme Court considered whether requiring evidence of one or more of the circumstances set forth in A.C.O. 138.26(B) would render the ordinance constitutional, the court concluded that the ordinance remained over-broad. The court noted that at least nine of the named circumstances encroached on a \u201c \u2018substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct[,]\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 387, 618 N.E.2d at 149, quoting <em>Houston v. Hill </em>(1987), 482 U.S. 451, 459, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 2508, 96 L.Ed.2d 398, 410, because they can easily implicate innocent behavior, or can support arrest simply because of a citizen\u2019s status, friends, neighborhood or appearance, <em>id., </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 387, 618 N.E.2d at 148-149. Since A.C.O.138.26 sweeps conduct not punishable under the First and Fourteenth Amendments within its prohibitions, the ordinance is impermissibly overbroad. <em>Id. </em>at 388, 618 N.E.2d at 149-150.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">A review of <em>Rowland </em>demonstrates that the Supreme Court of Ohio attempted to find that A.C.0.138.26 was constitutional. It gave the ordinance the benefit of the doubt by interpreting it in two ways \u2014 by viewing it as an ordinance which required the introduction of specific evidence of the circumstances in section B, and by viewing it as one which did not require evidence of the circumstances exhibiting \u201cloitering.\u201d Under either interpretation, the court found the ordinance to be unconstitutional. The court understood that loitering laws are an attempt to solve or at least curb the drug crisis; however, when balanced against the fundamental and timeless principles espoused in the Constitution, A.C.O. 138.26 did not survive the constitutional challenge. <em>Id. </em>at 389, 618 N.E.2d at 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Applying the foregoing to C.C.O. 607.19, this court finds that the element of specific intent is sufficiently demonstrated therein to allow the ordinance to withstand the <em>Rowland </em>court\u2019s initial criticism of A.C.O. 138.26. C.C.O. 607.19 provides, \u201c[n]o person shall loiter * * * <em>for the purpose of engaging in drug-related activity </em>* * (Emphasis added.) The city of Cleveland must, therefore, offer evidence of specific intent on behalf of the accused, <em>i.e., </em>the accused loitered \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of engaging in prohibited conduct. In contrast to A.C.O. 138.26, the accused is afforded notice of the requisite <em>mens rea </em>which will support a violation of the law, and of the city\u2019s burden as to what it needs to show to prove the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>Our analysis is not complete, however, until we verify whether the circumstances enumerated in C.C.O. 607.19 pertaining to what conduct amounts to loitering for the purpose of engaging in drug-related activity suffer from the same constitutional deficiencies as A.C.O. 138.26. The Supreme Court after all did not limit its ruling of unconstitutionality to its finding that A.C.O. 138.26 did not contain a specific intent requirement. It merely expressed that the appellate court erred in implying a specific intent where there was none, and, therefore, it would review the ordinance for constitutional deficiencies as written and applied to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>Rowland </em>stated with regard to the issue of what conduct constitutes loitering for the purpose of engaging in drug-related activity under A.C.O. 138.26:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-6\">\u201cIf the circumstances enumerated in A.C.O. 138.26(B) do not form a sufficient basis for an arrest or conviction, the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague because it gives neither reasonable notice to citizens of what is prohibited nor reasonable standards for those charged with its enforcement. As a result it also offends the third value protected by the void-for-vagueness doctrine: it chills or inhibits people\u2019s exercise of their constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Id., </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 382, 618 N.E.2d at 145.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">C.C.O. 607.19 contains the words, \u201camong the circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such loitering is for the purpose of engaging in drug-related activity.\u201d Similar language was contained in A.C.O. 138.26, and was the basis for the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that the ordinance failed to provide sufficient notice as to what conduct would support a charge of loitering. The court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">\u201cThe word \u2018among\u2019 indicates that there are other circumstances, not specified in the ordinance, which may be used to form the basis of an arrest and conviction. It is, of course, unlawful for a citizen to be convicted of a criminal offense not defined by a legislative enactment. We find this lack of specificity to be fatal to the ordinance. * \u25a0 * * \u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 383, 618 N.E.2d at 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">We likewise find that the lack of specificity, <em>ie., </em>notice of suspected conduct, in C.C.O. 607.19 is fatal to the ordinance. Even though the ordinance contains a specific intent requirement, this requirement, <em>ie., </em>the purpose of engaging in drug-related activity, is explicitly connected to the \u201camong the circumstances\u201d language. Consequently, just because there is a specific intent requirement, the requirement can be proven by conduct not expressly contained in the ordinance. The citizens of Cleveland thus are without any guidance as to what conduct may be deemed illegal under it and, accordingly, the ordinance allows for an unduly open-ended interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>Additionally, the ordinance implicates prohibition of conduct which may be innocent, just as A.C.O. 138.26 did. Specifically, a person may be suspected of loitering for the purpose of engaging in drug-related activity under the Cleveland ordinance where the person repeatedly stops, beckons to, attempts to stop passersby, or engages passersby in conversation, or stops or attempts to stop motor vehicles by hailing, waving arms, or making other bodily gestures, or acts as a \u201clook-out,\u201d or transfers small objects or packages for currency or any other thing of value in a furtive fashion (leading a police officer to believe or ascertain a drug sale did or is about to occur), or displays the physical characteristics of drug intoxication or usage, including dilated pupils, glassy eyes, slurred speech, etc., or is identified as a member of a drug-related gang as uncovered by a law enforcement officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The <em>Rowland </em>court recognized that the application of similar language in A.C.O. 138.26 \u201creached a significant amount of protected activity.\u201d The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-6\">\u201cEach of the eleven circumstances, with the possible exception of subsections (B)(2) and (B)(8), describes status or conduct which can be innocent and may be protected under the Constitution. Among the circumstances A.C.O. 138.26(B) states \u2018may be considered in determining whether such purpose is manifested\u2019 are: <em>the suspect looks like a drug user, including being underweight or nervous </em>(subsection [B][l]); <em>the suspect behaves suspiciously, including hailing or stopping passing cars </em>([B][3]); <em>the suspect is identified by police as a gang member </em>([B][4]); <em>the suspect \u2018transfers small objects or packages in a furtive fashion\u2019 </em>([B][5]) * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-7\">\u201cThese circumstances, and others in the ordinance, can easily implicate a person\u2019s status, associates, mere presence, or otherwise innocent behavior. We feel that they encroach on a \u2018substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.\u2019 <em>Hill, supra, </em>482 U.S. at 459, 107 S.Ct. at 2508, 96 L.Ed.2d at 410. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Rowland, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 387, 618 N.E.2d at 148-149.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">In line with <em>Rowland, </em>this court finds that C.C.O. 607.19(a)(1) \u201csweeps within the prohibitions of the ordinance many things that may not be constitutionally punished under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388, 618 N.E.2d at 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">Notwithstanding our earlier conclusion that the Cleveland ordinance contains a specific intent requirement unlike the Akron ordinance, the remainder of the ordinance contains the same constitutional infirmities identified by the <em>Rowland </em>court. C.C.O. 607.19 is, therefore, susceptible of interpretations which are either impermissibly vague or overbroad, and is accordingly unconstitutional under the federal and state Due Process Clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>We recognize that the facts of this case are different from the facts of <em>Rowland </em>to the extent that Det. Heffernan testified that he believed appellant participated in drug sales. There was no evidence in <em>Rowland </em>that any officer believed the defendant actually participated in a drug sale. However, this distinction does not sway our opinion as both Det. Heffernan and the officer in <em>Rowland </em>could not testify beyond relating a hunch that the defendants sold drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The officers in <em>Rowland </em>became suspicious of Rowland when he acted in a manner similar to appellant\u2019s herein. Rowland purportedly used the convenience-type store to conduct sales out of, lingered in the area, leaned into stopped vehicles, spoke with a gathering of people, entered the store when he knew he was being observed by officers, attempted to or successfully transferred drugs from himself to a companion, and attempted to throw away or successfully threw away the drugs. The fact that the officers in <em>Rowland </em>did not testify to an observed transaction does not mean they did not believe Rowland was in possession of drugs, and did not suspect that he was transacting drug sales. Finally, as in <em>Rowland, </em>the city of Cleveland did not offer any evidence of a drug-related offense, nor did it file a complaint against appellant for a drug-related offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Appellant\u2019s assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">The judgment of the Cleveland Municipal Court is reversed; the cause is remanded to that court in order for a judgment of acquittal to be entered in favor of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b869-9\">Blackmon, P.J., and Parrino, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b869-10\">Thomas J.
