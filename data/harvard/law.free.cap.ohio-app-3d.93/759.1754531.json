Weil (\u201cthe Weils\u201d) for damage incurred as a result of Este\u2019s pumping of approximately three hundred gallons of oil into the Weils\u2019 basement.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">In July 1990, the Weils contracted with defendant Miller/Connelly Heating and Cooling Services (\u201cMiller\u201d) for the conversion of their home heating system from oil to natural gas. Prior to this time, the Weils had an ongoing automatic fuel-oil delivery arrangement with Este. Pursuant to its contract with the Weils, Miller removed the Weils\u2019 oil heating system, including the oil tank, and installed a natural-gas heating system. However, the oil inlet plug, located on the exterior of the house, was neither plugged nor removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">In November 1990, Este delivered approximately three hundred gallons of home heating oil into the Weils\u2019 oil inlet pipe. Due to the combination of the removal of the oil tank and the failure of the inlet pipe to be either plugged or removed, the oil was pumped directly into the Weils\u2019 home, causing damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">The Weils filed suit against both Miller and Este, asserting negligence and recklessness on the part of Este in delivering and pumping the oil into their home. Este then turned to Federated, its business automobile liability insurer, to defend and indemnify Este in the lawsuit. Federated refused, claiming that its insurance contract precluded coverage for this event, which resulted in Este\u2019s filing of a third-party complaint against Federated. Both Este and Federated filed motions for summary judgment on the issues of coverage under the insurance policy and the duty, if any, to defend and indemnify Este.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>The trial court granted Federated\u2019s motion and denied Este\u2019s motion. Pursuant to the filing of its timely appeal, Este now raises two assignments of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">In its first assignment of error, Este argues that the trial court erred by refusing to consider the affidavits of two professional grammarians. The affidavits essentially provided the trial court with the two experts\u2019 personal opinions as to what constitutes ordinary and commonly accepted rules of English grammar in order to assist the court in interpreting the insurance policy. The trial court determined that the two individuals\u2019 sworn statements were not cognizable under Civ.R. 56(E) or Evid.R. 702, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Civ.R. 56(E) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-7\">\u201cSupporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts <em>as would be admissible in evidence, </em>and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to matters stated therein. [Emphasis ours.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Pursuant to Evid.R. 702, expert opinions may be offered if the purported expert has some specialized knowledge that would assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. However, where, as here, the expert testimony is offered on a matter that is neither complex nor beyond the comprehension of the average person, a trial court does not abuse its discretion by excluding the evidence. See <em>Berry v. Motorists Ins. Co. </em>(1983), 13 Ohio App.3d 228, 13 OBR 280, 468 N.E.2d 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">We cannot say that the trial court erred in failing to consider the affidavits. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by deeming the affidavits inadmissible under Evid.R. 702, and, therefore, did not err in concluding that the affidavits were not cognizable under Civ.R. 56(E). The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">The second assignment of error attacks the trial court\u2019s granting of summary judgment in favor of Federated. The trial court concluded that the damage sustained by the Weils was not a loss covered under Federated\u2019s business automobile policy issued to Este, and that certain exclusionary provisions of the policy precluded the existence of any duty on Federated\u2019s part to defend Este in the Weil action. Based upon our review of the record, as discussed below, we are compelled to conclude that material issues of fact exist, and that, therefore, the lower court erred in granting summary judgment to Federated.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-11\">The trial court relied essentially upon three of the insurance policy\u2019s provisions as its basis for finding that the policy provided no coverage for the mishap at issue, and that Federated therefore had no duty to defend Este in the Weil suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Two of the policy\u2019s provisions address \u201cpollution\u201d exclusions. Under Section II(B)(ll)(a), insurance coverage does not apply to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-5\">\u201c \u2018Bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 arising out of the actual, alleged, or threatened discharge, dispersal, release of pollutants:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-6\">\u201c(1) That are, or that are contained in any property that is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-7\">\u201c(a) Being transported * * * or handled for movement * * * from the covered \u2018auto\u2019;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-8\">\u201c(b) Otherwise in the course of transit by the insured; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-9\">\u201c(c) Being stored, disposed of, treated or processed in or upon the covered \u2018auto\u2019;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-10\"><em>a </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-11\">\u201c(3) After the pollutants * * * are moved from the covered \u2018auto\u2019 to the place where they are finally delivered * * * by the \u2018insured.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">Endorsement CA-F-64 Ed. 7-88(B)(2) further provides that the above pollution exclusion does not apply to the \u2018discharge, dispersal, release or escape of pollutants\u2019 other than acids, certain explosives and radioactive materials under certain conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-13\">To fall within the purview of either of these pollution exclusions, the heating oil at issue must have been a \u201cpollutant,\u201d which is defined under the policy at Section II(B)(ll)(b) as \u201cany solid, liquid, gaseous or thermal irritant or contaminant, including smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste.\u201d The trial court concluded, as a matter of law, that \u201cthe property damage incurred by the volitious <em>[sic </em>] act of Este is an actual discharge of a pollutant (fuel oil) which is excluded under [Section II(B)(ll)(a) ].\u201d We believe, however, that the determination of whether the oil discharged at the Weil residence constituted a \u201cpollutant\u201d under the policy involved a question of fact. Absent either a stipulation by the parties that the oil was a \u201cpollutant\u201d under the terms of the policy, or the court\u2019s taking judicial notice of this fact on the record, we conclude that the trial court erred by determining that the oil at issue was a \u201cpollutant\u201d as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-14\">The third policy provision cited by the trial court in support of its determination to grant summary judgment to Federated was endorsement CA 23-05-01-87, which addresses the \u201cwrong delivery of liquid products.\u201d Under this provision, insurance does not apply to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-15\">\u201c \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 resulting from the delivery of any liquid into the wrong receptacle or to the wrong address, or from the delivery of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>liquid for another, if the \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 occurs after delivery has been completed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">The record before us reveals that Este claims that it never received notice of the Weils\u2019 conversion of their home heating system from oil to gas. Este essentially maintains that the November 7, 1990 delivery of the oil was made in accordance with the automatic delivery agreement with the Weils. The Weils\u2019 complaint, however, claims that they contacted Este to advise the company that they were converting the heating system to natural gas. The Weils further contend that an Este representative was dispatched to their home to inspect the oil tank and advised them that due to the small amount of oil remaining in the tank it was unnecessary to drain it prior to its removal from the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Based on the above, we hold that genuine issues of fact remain as to whether the oil was delivered into the \u201cwrong receptacle\u201d within the meaning of Endorsement CA 23-05-01-87. If a factfinder were to believe Este\u2019s account, it could be said that the oil that ultimately damaged the Weils\u2019 basement was delivered by Este without notice of the oil tank\u2019s removal in accordance with its ongoing contract with the Weils, and arguably was not delivered into the \u201cwrong receptacle.\u201d On the other hand, if the Weils\u2019 version of the facts were to be believed, then the delivery of the oil into their tankless basement arguably could be deemed to be a \u201cwrong delivery of a liquid product\u201d by Este and thereby preclude Este from coverage under the policy\u2019s CA 23-05-01-87 exclusion. Accordingly, the trial court erred when it determined, as a matter of law, that \u201cendorsement CA 23-05-01-87 specifically excludes the wrong delivery of a liquid product to the wrong receptacle, which is precisely what happened here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">In light of the above, we sustain Este\u2019s second assignment of error. There exist triable issues of material fact. Summary judgment in favor of Federated, therefore, was improvidently granted under Civ.R. 56. See <em>Addison v. The Ohio River Co. </em>(Mar. 18, 1992), Hamilton App. Nos. C-910057 and C-910059, unreported, 1992 WL 52719.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">Based upon our disposition of the second assignment of error, the trial court\u2019s judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b798-10\">Hildebrandt, P.J., Shannon and Klusmeier, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
