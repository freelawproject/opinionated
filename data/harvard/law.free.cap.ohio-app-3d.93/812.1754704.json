Appellant claims that the trial court erred in ruling that the conduct clause of his employment contract was \u201cunambiguous\u201d; that no material question of fact remained as to whether appellee had just cause to terminate him; and that an apology broadcast by appellee was not defamatory. Upon review, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>find appellant\u2019s assignments of error to be without merit. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">The record demonstrates that on December 3, 1991, appellant entered into a one-year written contract with appellee to host a daily, three-hour sports/talk program on appellee\u2019s radio station, WKNR. On June 10, 1991, appellant used the phrase \u201cjew you down\u201d in response to a call-in listener\u2019s question about \u201ctrading\u201d professional baseball players. The exchange occurred as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-6\">\u201cCall-in Listener: Have there been any trade rumors about any of these guys going anywhere?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-7\">\u201cCalton: Not right now because it\u2019s very difficult to make a trade when nobody\u2019s hitting, nobody\u2019s doing much because other clubs will try to really <em>jew you down. </em>It\u2019s like driving a car. If a valve goes bad, nobody wants to take it on trade but if the car\u2019s running great and looks good everybody wants it. And so its difficult to trade right now.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">Within minutes of the broadcast of this conversation, four listeners called in to express their offense and distaste over appellant\u2019s use of the phrase, \u201cjew you down,\u201d even though appellant made several on-air apologies. A fifth listener, called in to support appellant and to denigrate the preceding callers. The show\u2019s producer also received numerous phone calls from listeners who complained about the remark -without going on the air.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">The following day, <em>to wit, </em>June 11, 1991, WKNR management conferred with the station\u2019s corporate senior vice president, personnel from the department of human resources and the station\u2019s corporate legal counsel. After this conference, management orally notified appellant that he was terminated for using the phrase \u201cjew you down\u201d during his broadcast. Written notification of termination, dated June 11, 1991, was delivered to appellant by ordinary mail on or about June 13, 1991, pursuant to Paragraph 15 of appellant\u2019s employment contract. On June 13, 1991, WKNR\u2019s General Manager broadcast an official apology concerning appellant\u2019s remark. During the days following these events, the station received numerous calls and letters, both positive and negative, concerning appellant\u2019s remark and the station\u2019s decision to terminate him. The station was also the focus of significant media attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">On December 30, 1991, appellant filed the instant action for breach of contract and defamation, seeking compensatory damages in the amount of $460,000 and punitive damages in the amount of $920,000. On December 31, 1992, the trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, issuing the following \u201cOrder\u201d dated December 31, 1992:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-11\">\u201cThis Court finds that Larry Calton was terminated by CV Radio Associates with just cause pursuant to a valid, unambiguous contract clause in his employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>ment agreement after his on-air ethnic slur which \u2018reflect[ed] unfavorably on WKNR.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-5\">\u201cThis Court finds that as a matter of law the Defendant\u2019s lawful action terminating [its] employee Calton based on his violation of his employment agreement does not give rise to a defamation action. Calton had failed to produce evidence supporting any other specific facts to substantiate a claim of defamation by Calton against WKNR.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">The instant appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">I</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred in ruling that the phrase \u2018reflected] unfavorably on WKNR\u2019 (in Paragraph 15 of Larry Calton\u2019s contract) is an \u2018unambiguous contract clause.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">Appellant claims that the language found in Paragraph 15 of his employment agreement is ambiguous and subject to different interpretations. A review of appellant\u2019s brief in opposition, however, fails to demonstrate the different interpretations to which he refers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hence, appellant\u2019s argument is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">\u201cThe interpretation of a written agreement is, in the first instance, a matter of law for the court, and should be submitted to the jury only when provisions of the contract are ambiguous.\u201d <em>Seringetti Constr. Co. v. Cincinnati </em>(1988), 51 Ohio App.3d 1, 553 N.E.2d 1371, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-11\">\u201c[C]ommon words appearing in a written instrument are to be given their plain and ordinary meaning unless manifest absurdity results or unless some other meaning is clearly intended from the face or overall contents of the instrument.\u201d <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 241, 245-246, 7 O.O.3d 403, 406, 374 N.E.2d 146, 150.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">\u201cThe purpose of contract construction is to effectuate the intent of the parties. <em>Skivolocki v. East Ohio Gas Co. </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 244 [67 O.O.2d 321], 313 N.E.2d 374, paragraph one of the syllabus. The intent of the parties to a contract is presumed to reside in the language they chose to employ in the agreement. <em>Blosser v. Enderlin </em>(1925), 113 Ohio St. 121, 148 N.E. 393, paragraph one of the syllabus. The court need not go beyond the plain language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>the agreement to determine the parties\u2019 rights and obligations if a contract is clear and unambiguous. <em>Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.\u201d <em>Apex Sales Agency, Inc. v. The Mather Co. </em>(Nov. 19, 1992), Cuyahoga App. No. 60344, unreported, 1992 WL 354816.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">The record demonstrates that appellant was hired pursuant to the terms of a specific, employment agreement. Paragraph 15 of that agreement states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-6\">\u201cIf you shall commit any act which would bring you into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule, or which reflects unfavorably on WKNR, WKNR may, upon written notice to you, immediately terminate your employment hereunder. In the event WKNR terminates pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, WKNR shall be discharged from all obligations hereunder by making any and all payments earned and payable on account of services performed by you prior to such date of termination.\u201d (Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 1 \u2014 \u201cThe Agreement,\u201d at page 5.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">The plain and ordinary meaning of Paragraph 15 is that appellant must refrain from conducting himself in a manner which brings him into \u201cpublic disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule\u201d or risk termination. Appellant\u2019s argument that the phrase which follows this conduct clause is too broad to give notice as to prohibited conduct is unpersuasive. The ordinary meaning of the phrase \u201creflects unfavorably\u201d is not only clear on its terms but it is further defined and clarified by the descriptive words which precede it. Moreover, as an experienced broadcaster,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellant can hardly claim to lack notice of the fact that an employer can make the use of an ethnic or racial slur a ground for termination and that the broadcast of such a slur would in fact \u201creflect unfavorably\u201d upon the station.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">We find that appellant- has failed to demonstrate that the phrase at issue is subject to differing interpretations. We also find that he has failed to demonstrate that the plain and ordinary meaning of the phrase results in manifest absurdity or that some other meaning is clearly intended from the face or overall content of the instrument. The trial court did not err in finding that appellant was terminated pursuant to a valid and unambiguous contract clause. His first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-10\">\u201cThe trial court erred in granting WKNR\u2019s motion for summary judgment because ordinary, intelligent people could \u2014 and in fact do \u2014 reasonably disagree about whether there was a justifiable reason to terminate Larry Calton.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>Appellant\u2019s assignment of error is without merit as it inappropriately applies a standard of review formulated in an \u201cemployment at will\u201d case, <em>to wit, Mers v. Dispatch Printing Co. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio App.3d 99, 529 N.E.2d 958, to the instant case, which involves an explicit, one-year employment agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">In the instant case, the parties entered into a five-page, written agreement containing a definite term of employment and an express provision addressing cause for immediate discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C), summary judgment is proper if the trial court determines that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-7\">\u201c(1) No genuine issue as to any material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and viewing such evidence most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that conclusion is adverse to that party.\u201d See <em>Temple v. Wean, Inc. </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 317, 327, 4 O.O.3d 466, 472, 364 N.E.2d 267, 274, and <em>Delker v. Ohio Edison Co. </em>(1989), 47 Ohio App.3d 1, 2, 546 N.E.2d 975, 976.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">The record demonstrates that appellant was an experienced broadcaster; that he was hired to host a non-controversial sports/talk show; that he signed an employment contract which contained a specific conduct clause that permitted management to terminate him if he committed an act which brought him into \u201cpublic disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule or which reflect[ed] unfavorably on WKNR.\u201d Appellant\u2019s use of an ethnic slur clearly falls into that class of prohibited conduct. Appellant admitted and acknowledged that his use of the slur was offensive and that it was unprecedented in the sports talk show business.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">The fact that appellant submitted various letters, phone messages and faxes which criticized management\u2019s judgment in terminating him is irrelevant to the trial court\u2019s construction of the terms of the instant agreement and the parties\u2019 intent in entering into that agreement. Appellant\u2019s remark angered and alienated numerous members of WKNR\u2019s audience. It subsequently prompted significant audience and media attention thereby exposing the station to the controversy and disfavor it contracted to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">The issues appellant raises as genuine questions of material fact<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are immaterial to the trial court\u2019s inquiry into whether, pursuant to the plain language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>agreement, appellee could lawfully terminate appellant. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">III</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred in ruling that WKNR\u2019s termination of Larry Calton was lawful and that statements made by WKNR concerning said termination were not defamatory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-7\">\u201cTo establish a defamation claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate the existence of a <em>false publication </em>causing injury to a person\u2019s reputation, or exposing him to public hatred, contempt, ridicule, shame or disgrace, or affecting him adversely in his trade or business. <em>Matalka v. Lagemann </em>(1985), 21 Ohio App.3d 134, 136, 21 OBR 143, 145, 486 N.E.2d 1220, 1222. See, also, <em>Cleveland Leader Printing Co. v. Nethersole </em>(1911), 84 Ohio St. 118, 95 N.E. 735.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Ashcroft v. Mr. Sinai Med. Ctr. </em>(1990), 68 Ohio App.3d 359, 365, 588 N.E.2d 280, 283-284.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">Appellant has failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>claim for defamation. Appellant produced no evidence that the content of appellee\u2019s on air statement<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was false or that it was the proximate cause of his alleged injury. Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">IV</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-10\">\u201cThe depositions of James Glass and James Dolan are properly before the trial court and should be a part of the appellate record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error is moot as the parties, by joint stipulation, filed the depositions of James Glass and James Dolan pursuant to App.R. 9(E). Hence, they are a part of this record on appeal. Appellant\u2019s fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>assignment of error is overruled. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b853-5\">Harper, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b853-6\">Matia, J., dissents. .</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b849-13\">. A review of appellant\u2019s brief demonstrates reliance upon the opinion of a hostile witness, WKNR\u2019s former general manager, who had a claim pending against the station at the time of his deposition. This witness opined that appellant's use of the phrase \"jew you down\u201d was not a \u201cfireable offense\u201d and cited the remarks of listeners who were unhappy with appellant\u2019s termination. These statements, however, are irrelevant to and fail to support appellant\u2019s legal theory that the contract phrase, \u201creflects unfavorably,\u201d is ambiguous and subject to different interpretations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b850-11\">. The record demonstrates that appellant had been a professional radio and television broadcaster for approximately twenty years at the time he signed the contract with appellee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b851-11\">. Appellant contends that the fact that he apologized immediately after uttering the slur; that the fact that the slur could have been a pretext for termination; that his claim that he was terminated for violating a general company policy and not a specific provision of his contract; and that management's off-the-air racial remark operate to create a jury question with respect to whether appellee had just cause to terminate him. We disagree and find that the issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>appellant raises are irrelevant to the trial court\u2019s construction of appellant\u2019s employment agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b852-13\">. The on-air statement to which appellant refers reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-14\">\u201cGood Afternoon, I am Bob Barnes, Vice President &amp; General Manager of WKNR Radio.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-15\">\"On Monday afternoon, SportsTALK host Larry Carlton <em>[sic </em>] issued an on the air remark during his program. Although what our 'on-air' personalities say when broadcasting does not necessarily reflect the opinion of WKNR\u2019s management, Mr. Carlton\u2019s [sic] remarks were both offensive and inappropriate to a portion of our audience. In addition, Mr. Calton's remarks did not reflect the level of professionalism and responsibility we aim to provide here at WKNR.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-16\">\"WKNR apologizes to anyone who may have been offended by Mr. Calton\u2019s remarks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-17\">\"We specifically are against any form of discrimination based on race, color, creed or ethnic origin as well as being against any comments that perpetuate a stereotypical description of any group of people.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
