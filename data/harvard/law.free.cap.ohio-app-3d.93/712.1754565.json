Cole contends that the trial court erred (1) in failing to suppress the evidence obtained during the inventory search of his automobile, and (2) in failing to dismiss the misdemeanor charge for lack of a speedy trial. We reverse because Cole\u2019s automobile was unlawfully impounded; therefore, the inventory search was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">At 6:20 p.m. on January 26, 1993, Cole was arrested in an area with numerous complaints of drug activity. Two Akron police officers were on routine patrol in an effort to observe and screen some of that drug activity. The officers observed Cole drive his vehicle into the parking lot across the street from where they were driving their cruiser. Cole backed his car into the first parking space in front of the apartment building and exited his car. He then stood by his car and talked with Willie Biddings, who lived in the apartment building. The officers drove across the street into the parking lot where Cole was. One of the officers watched Cole because Cole was watching the cruiser. Cole then turned away from the officers and it appeared to one of the officers that Cole dropped something on the ground. The officers parked next to Cole\u2019s vehicle and saw a rock of cocaine and a razor blade near the vehicle\u2019s rear tire. Cole admitted that the razor was his; it field-tested positive for cocaine. After Cole was arrested, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>another police officer came to the scene and inventoried the contents of the vehicle in preparation for its being towed to the impoundment lot. The inventory officer found a loaded firearm in the trunk of Cole's vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Cole was indicted for drug abuse, a felony, and improper handling of a firearm in a motor vehicle, a misdemeanor. He moved to dismiss the misdemeanor because the statutory time period had expired, and he moved to suppress the evidence because of an improper <em>Terry </em>stop and an unlawful impoundment of his car. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss, relying on <em>State v. Leanza </em>(Sept. 1, 1982), Summit App. No. 10506, unreported, 1982 WL 2746, and denied the motion to suppress because, under the totality of the circumstances, the officers were justified in seizing Cole. A jury found him not guilty of drug abuse, but guilty of improper handling of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Cole now appeals, asserting two assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">Assignment of Error II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress illegally obtained evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">With this assignment of error, Cole argues that the evidence against him should have been suppressed for two reasons. Cole contends that the investigatory stop of him and the routine inventory of his vehicle were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">1. <em>Investigatory Stop</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">Cole contends that the officers\u2019 investigatory stop of him was improper because they did not have specific articulable facts that would give rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Initially, Cole bases this claim on the asserted fact that the officers seized him as they were driving across the street because they activated their overhead lights at that time. We note at the outset that in a motion to suppress, the trial court assumes the role of trier of fact and, as such, is in the best position to resolve questions of fact and evaluate witness credibility. See <em>State v. Clay </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d 250, 251, 63 O.O.2d 391, 391-392, 298 N.E.2d 137, 138. In ruling on the motion to suppress, the trial court did not find that the officers had activated their overhead lights while they were crossing the street. In fact, the testimony at the motion to suppress hearing established that the only light the officers may have activated was a spotlight or searchlight, not their overhead lights.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">Cole next contends that even if the officers did not seize him until they saw him make a furtive movement, that movement alone is not sufficient to justify an investigatory stop. We find that Cole\u2019s suspicious movement along with the total circumstances justified the officers\u2019 investigation of Cole. <em>State v. Bobo </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 177, 524 N.E.2d 489, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>2. <em>Routine Inventory Search</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">With this argument, Cole asserts that the inventory search of his vehicle was not valid, because his vehicle was illegally impounded. Cole contends that his vehicle was not subject to a traffic stop on a public street, that it was lawfully parked on private property, and that its contents were not in danger; therefore, the police did not have a valid reason for impounding it. We note that the state bears the burden of establishing that a warrantless search is valid under one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement. <em>Xenia v. Wallace </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 216, 524 N.E.2d 889, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>State v. Kessler </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 204, 207, 7 O.O.3d 375, 376-377, 373 N.E.2d 1252, 1255. In this case, the state contends that the search of Cole\u2019s car was valid as a routine inventory search of an impounded vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">In <em>South Dakota v. Opperman </em>(1976), 428 U.S. 364, 373, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 3099, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000, 1007, the United States Supreme Court recognized the constitutional validity of police inventory searches of lawfully impounded automobiles, \u201cwhere the process is aimed at securing or protecting the car and its contents.\u201d \u201cIn the interests of public safety and as part of what the Court has called \u2018community caretaking functions,\u2019 * * * automobiles are frequently taken into police custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 368, 96 S.Ct. at 3097, 49 L.Ed.2d at 1005. The Ohio Supreme Court, in interpreting <em>Opperman, </em>said that a routine inventory search of a lawfully impounded automobile is constitutional when performed pursuant to a standard practice and not merely as a pretext for an evidentiary search. <em>State v. Robinson </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 478, 480, 12 O.O.3d 394, 395-396, 391 N.E.2d 317, 318, certiorari denied (1979), 444 U.S. 942, 100 S.Ct. 297, 62 L.Ed.2d 309. Thus, in determining whether an inventory search is valid, a court initially must determine whether the police \u201clawfully impounded\u201d the vehicle. See <em>State v. Suttles </em>(Feb. 2, 1994), Summit App. No. 16333, unreported, 1994 WL 30494 (this court determined that the automobile was lawfully impounded after the police officer made a good faith effort in finding a third party to drive the appellant\u2019s vehicle where appellant\u2019s driving privileges were suspended).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">In this case, the state failed to offer any valid reason for th\u00e9 removal of Cole\u2019s vehicle. Cole was not arrested while in his car or for a traffic offense. There is no evidence that the car was not lawfully parked. The state did not present any evidence that the officers made a good faith effort to find a third party to secure its contents or drive the car if needed. On appeal, the state made no argument to this court that Cole\u2019s vehicle was lawfully impounded and, at the trial court, the state merely contended that the vehicle was towed pursuant to its policy of towing a vehicle when a suspect is placed under arrest. At the motion to suppress hearing, the prosecutor elicited from the inventory officer the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>\u201cQ. And why did you conduct this inventory of his vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">\u201cA. Mr. Cole had been .placed under arrest, and it\u2019s City of Akron Police Department procedure to \u2014 when we tow a vehicle, we inventory the vehicle for damages or items in the vehicle so that the person can\u2019t come back at a later date and state that something\u2019s been taken or damage was caused to the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\"><em>(( </em>* <em>ifr </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\">\u201cQ. Is it the normal procedure at the Akron Police Department to conduct an inventory when someone\u2019s placed under arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-8\">\u201cA. Yes, it is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">This testimony did not show any valid or standard criteria for determining when a vehicle will be impounded. See <em>Colorado v. Bertine </em>(1987), 479 U.S. 367, 375, 107 S.Ct. 738, 743, 93 L.Ed.2d 739, 748 (\u201cNothing in Opperman or Lafayette prohibits the exercise of police discretion so long as that discretion is exercised according to standard criteria and on the basis of something other than suspicion of evidence of criminal activity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">The second assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">Assignment of Error I</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-12\">\u201cThe trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss count two of the indictment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-13\">Because the loaded firearm found in the trunk of Cole\u2019s vehicle should have been suppressed, this assignment of error is rendered moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-14\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-15\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b750-16\">Baird, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AFv\">Quillin, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
