CMHA challenges the dismissal which was based on its failure to comply with federal notice requirements, specifically Section 966.4(Z )(3)(ii), Title 24, C.F.R. A careful review of the record compels affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-14\">Younger executed a lease on April 16, 1992 for a dwelling unit located at 17801 Parkmount, Cleveland, Ohio. The dwelling unit is part of CMHA\u2019s Riverside Park Estates, which it owns and manages pursuant to the federal Public Housing Program. See Part 966, Title 24, C.F.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-15\">CMHA, through its manager, issued a \u201cNotice of Termination and Invitation to Explain\u201d to Younger on September 4, 1992. This notice advised Younger that: (1) CMHA possessed information concerning violations of her lease; (2) CMHA would refuse to accept rent payments pending the eviction action, but she was still responsible for past due rent; (3) her lease would be terminated thirty days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>after the notice, and eviction proceedings would commence unless the matter was resolved; and (4) she had an opportunity to personally reply to the notice on September 9, 1992 or to make other arrangements.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">One of the attachments to the notice contained the following alleged lease violations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-5\">\u201cOn or about August 18, 1992, you were issued a Lease Violation Notice from the Management Office for Unauthorized Occupants in your Unit, and for disturbance coming from you [sic ] unauthorized occupants as well as possible illegal activities in your residence of 17801 Parkmount Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44185 Cuyahoga County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-6\">\u201cOn or about August 11, 1992, you were issued a Lease Violation Notice from the Management Office for Unauthorized Occupants in your unit, and for Disturbance of neighbors. Management received several calls of complaints about your guests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-7\">\u201cOn or about July 28, 1992, you were issued a Lease Violation Notice from the Management Office for Disturbance of Neighbors, Unauthorized Occupants and possible illegal activities coming from your unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-8\">\u201cOn June 3, 1992, you were issued a Lease Violation Notice from the Management Office for Disturbance of your neighbor^\u2019] peaceful enjoyment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-9\">\u201cOn or about January 15, 1992, a Judgment Entry was signed in Housing Court case No. # [sic ] 91-CVG-31651 stating that, you would remove Unauthorized persons from your unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-10\">\u201cThese incident(s) constitute a violation of your Dwelling Lease, Article 9, Sections A, B, D, N 0 [sic ] and P which reads [sic ] as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-11\">\u201c(A) Not to provide accommodations for boarders or lodgers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-12\">\u201c(B) Not to assign the lease or to sublease the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-13\">\u201c(D) To use the premises solely as a private dwelling for Resident and Resident\u2019s household, as identified in accordance with the provisions of Section 1, and not to use or permit its use for any other purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-14\">\u201c(N) To conduct himself/herself, and cause other persons who are on the premises with the consent of Resident or members of his/her household to conduct themselves, in a manner which will not disturb his/her neighbors\u2019 peaceful enjoyment of their accommodations and will be conducive to maintaining the estate in a decent, safe and sanitary condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-15\">\u201c(0) To refrain from illegal or other activity which impairs the physical or social environment of the estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>\u201c(P) In addition to the foregoing Subsections A through 0, Resident and members of his/her household, or a guest or other persons under the Resident\u2019s control, shall not engage in criminal activity including, but not limited to, drug-related activity on or near public housing premises, while Resident resides in public housing and such criminal activity shall be cause for termination of tenancy. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-4\">\u201cBecause of this violation(s), CMHA is exercising its right to refuse rent payments from you pending this eviction action as provided for in Article 3, Section D of your dwelling lease. This puts you in violation of Section 3, Section B of your dwelling lease for nonpayment of rent. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">After the scheduled conference of September 9,1992 with CMHA management, Younger was served on October 5, 1992 with a three-day notice to vacate the premises. Younger did not vacate the premises, leading to the filing of CMHA\u2019s complaint in forcible entry and detainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">The complaint contained all of the information set forth in the attachment to the September 4, 1992 \u201cNotice of Termination and Invitation to Explain.\u201d It also presented two causes of action, one for unlawful possession of the premises, and the other for unpaid rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Younger filed a motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment on December 18, 1992. She premised the motion on CMHA\u2019s alleged failure to afford her due process by identifying specific instances of conduct which caused the termination of her lease. CMHA\u2019s failure to supply this information, according to Younger, was a violation of Section 966.4(Z )(3)(ii), Title 24, C.F.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">The trial court issued its judgment on February 24, 1992 granting Younger\u2019s motion to dismiss. The court initially recognized that the purported grounds for termination were located in the September 4, 1992 notice of termination as set forth <em>supra. </em>It then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-9\">\u201c[T]he above grounds are not \u2018specific grounds\u2019 in that they do not refer to the dates of claimed violations, descriptions of specific events that are claimed violations, and the names of the individuals involved in the claimed violations (at least in as far as plaintiff can determine the names).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-10\">\u201cThus the required notice of lease termination fails. Plaintiffs service of Ohio Revised Code 1923.04 Notice to Vacate prior to expiration of tenancy is improper service, and thus this court lacks jurisdiction over this action. Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>This appeal followed with CMHA claiming as error<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-5\">\u201cI. The trial court erred when it granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment, because the tenant failed to exhaust administrative remedies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-6\">\u201cII. The trial court erred when it ruled that the notice of termination did not identify \u2018specific grounds\u2019 sufficient to satisfy due process requirements to allow the defendant to prepare a defense. The notice of termination'answers each of the six general interrogatories who, what, where, when, why and how.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-7\">\u201cHI. The trial court\u2019s ruling is in error as impermissible judicial activism.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-8\">\u201cIV. The trial court committed prejudicial error when it granted the motion to dismiss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">In its first assignment of error, CMHA charges that Younger should have either (1) attended the informal meeting with management; (2) filed a grievance under Section 966.4(Z )(3)(iv), Title 24, C.F.R.; or (3) requested to examine relevant documents pursuant to Section 966.4(m), Title 24, C.F.R. CMHA argues, therefore, that Younger was not entitled to have the complaint dismissed based upon insufficient notice because she did not use the administrative process to challenge the insufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">CMHA\u2019s suggestion that the trial court herein acted improperly because \u201cthe Code of Federal Regulations, which governs eviction actions, and administrative law generally, are designed to weed out cases which can be resolved outside the trial court setting\u201d is a curious one. Furthermore, CMHA finds fault with the trial court\u2019s placing \u201citself as the only arbiter of justice\u201d because \u201cthen there is really no purpose to alternative dispute resolutions and the already overburdened caseload of the Court system will only increase.\u201d This court is thus perplexed by appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, since it was CMHA which filed the forcible entry and detainer action, and it was CMHA which asked the trial court to be the \u201carbiter of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>there is any merit in CMHA\u2019s contention, this court is without authority to review this assignment of error. First, the record is silent as to how Younger reacted to the September 4, 1992 notice of termination; we do not know if she attended any meetings with CMHA management. Second, CMHA did not file a response to Younger\u2019s motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment, and, consequently, did not submit an argument in the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>relating to Younger\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Errors not brought to the attention of the trial court are waived for purposes of appeal when the error could have been avoided or corrected by the court. See <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364; <em>First Fed. S. &amp; L. Assn, of Akron v. Cheton &amp; Rabe </em>(1989), 57 Ohio App.3d 137, 567 N.E.2d 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">CMHA\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">For its second assignment of error, CMHA submits that the trial court erred in concluding that the notice of termination failed to contain specific instances of conduct which adequately notified Younger of the cause for termination of her lease. CMHA counters the trial court\u2019s conclusion by arguing that the notice did advise Younger of when the alleged violations occurred and the alleged violations themselves. However, CMHA maintains that to identify who was involved in the alleged violations would cause an undue financial burden on CMHA, its tenants and taxpayers in general.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">CMHA partially relies on the trial court\u2019s entry in case No. 91-CVG-31651 in support of its argument that the notice of termination impliedly informed Younger of all of the information necessary to prepare a defense. In other words, this entry in combination with the September 4, 1992 notice of termination, according to CMHA, met the requirements set out in Section 966.-4(i)(3)(ii), Title 24, C.F.R. The entry reads as follows in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-7\">\u00ab * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-8\">\u201c(1) Defendant [Younger] consents to Judgment in Plaintiffs favor on the first cause of action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-9\">\u201c(2) Plaintiff [CMHA] agrees not to execute on the judgment if defendant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-10\">\u201c(a) Removes and keeps Jason Hale off of CMHA premises;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-11\">\u201c(b) Calls CMHA or CPD police to report that Jason Hale is on the premises and criminally trespassing if defendant/tenant sees Jason Hale on CMHA premises; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-12\">\u201c(c) Visits with Jason Hale should be conducted off CMHA premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-13\">CMHA acts as a public housing authority (\u201cPHA\u201d) that administers the Public Housing Program. CMHA must, therefore, comply with two sets of regulations when it commences a forcible entry and detainer action: the state law encompassed in R.C. 1923.04 and the federal requirements enunciated in Sections 866.4(k) and (Z), Title 24, C.F.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-14\">A PHA is required to give a tenant written notice of any proposed termination of the tenant\u2019s lease. Section 966.4(i )(2), Title 24, C.F.R. Section 966.4(Z )(3)(ii), Title 24, C.F.R. provides in relevant part, \u201c[t]he notice of lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>termination to the tenant shall state <em>specific grounds </em>for termination, and shall inform the tenant of the tenant\u2019s right to make such reply as the tenant may wish. * * * \u201d (Emphasis added.) A PHA is required to set forth the specific grounds for termination in the notice \u201cto insure that the tenant is adequately informed of the nature of the evidence against him [or her] so that he [or she] can effectively rebut that evidence.\u201d <em>Escalera v. New York City Hous. Auth. </em>(C.A.2, 1970), 425 F.2d 853, 862; see, also, <em>Goldberg v. Kelly </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287; <em>Billington v. Underwood </em>(C.A.5, 1980), 613 F.2d 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Termination notices have been found to be insufficient where they contain only one sentence, are framed in vague and conclusory language, or fail to set forth a factual statement to justify termination. For example, in Assoc. <em>Estates Corp. v. Bartell </em>(1985), 24 Ohio App.3d 6, 24 OBR 28, 492 N.E.2d 841, this court found the following language to be insufficient to notify the tenant of the specific grounds for termination of her lease: \u201c[s]erious, repeated damage to unit. Repeated disturbance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10, 24 OBR at 32, 492 N.E.2d at 846. We characterized the notice as \u201cblanketed in broad language\u201d and concluded that it did not afford the tenant due process as required by the federal regulations. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Similarly, in <em>Hous. Auth. of DeKalb Cty. v. Pyrtle </em>(1983), 167 Ga.App. 181, 306 S.E.2d 9, the court determined the notice was deficient because it did not \u201cprovide the tenant with knowledge of the circumstances upon which the termination of the lease was predicated sufficient to afford the tenant an opportunity to prepare a meaningful rebuttal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183, 306 S.E.2d at 10-11. The termination notice stated the following reason for termination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-7\">\u201c \u2018 * * * Repeated incidents of intoxication and irresponsible use of the kitchen facilities in your Unit [which] have imposed a threat [to] the peaceful enjoyment and safety of your neighbors. * * * \u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">Even when a notice of termination specifies the individual involved in alleged wrongdoing which purportedly calls for the termination, the notice was found insufficient. Thus, in <em>Escalera, </em>the following notification failed to adequately apprise the tenants of the reasons for the termination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-9\">\u201c * * * \u2018Record of antisocial activities and arrests of your son, Fred, Jr., constituting a threat to the peace and safety of the community * * * and \u201c \u2018 * * * Illegal acts of Mr. Humphrey, having an adverse effect on the project and its tenants.\u2019 \u201d <em>Escalera, supra, </em>425 F.2d at 858, fn. 2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">A review of the notice sent to Younger in the instant case fails to comply with the requirements of Section 966.4(i )(3)(ii), Title 24, C.F.R., as it \u201cfailed to set forth a factual statement of the incident or incidents which constituted the grievance.\u201d <em>Hous. Auth. of King Cty. v. Saylors </em>(1978), 19 Wash.App. 871, 874, 578 P.2d 76, 79. The notice contains vague and broad allegations that unautho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>rized persons were in Younger\u2019s unit and that her neighbors were disturbed by-activities therein. Moreover, the notice was even more so deficient because it contained an allegation that there were \u201cpossible\u201d illegal activities occurring within the unit. If CMHA did not have any concrete facts to support this allegation, there would be no easy way for Younger to refute it. Additionally, the fact that CMHA included a statement that the incidents constituted a violation of Younger\u2019s lease, this statement did not make the notice sufficient. See <em>Hous. Auth. of King Cty. </em>(notice insufficient where termination predicated upon \u201cviolation of your lease in section 6j: The Tenant shall not commit or maintain a nuisance on or about the premises.\u201d). The notice was also insufficient, since it failed to notify Yotmger of the dates of the incidents. The fact that CMHA referenced the dates that the Lease Violation Notices were issued to Younger does not alter this insufficiency; neither this court nor the trial court could assume that the violation notices were issued to Younger on the date of the alleged incidents. Moreover, the notices failed to identify the individuals involved in the alleged incidents. Absent any of these details, the notice of termination forwarded to Younger fails as a notice to terminate her tenancy, and the trial court correctly identified this failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">CMHA\u2019s response that the trial court and Younger knew full well what activities caused it to issue the notice of termination and, therefore, Younger was not precluded from adequately responding to the termination process does little to persuade this court that it complied with the federal regulations. CMHA would not be hard pressed to prepare a notice of termination which includes a brief <em>factual </em>statement beyond allegations of \u201cdisturbance,\u201d \u201cpossible illegal activities,\u201d and \u201ccomplaints about your guests.\u201d It had in its possession all of the information necessary to prepare such a factual statement, as we assume it retains copies of the Lease Violation Notices themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">CMHA\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">CMHA, in its third assignment of error, accuses the trial court of judicial activism. Specifically, it proposes that the trial court\u2019s action stretches the bounds of reasonableness and turns forcible entry and detainer actions into \u201ccomplicated, technical processes] that a landlord cannot possibly satisfy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">This court reminds CMHA that if it only had complied with Section 966.-<em>4(1 </em>)(3)(ii), Title 24, C.F.R., it would not be in the position it finds itself in at the moment. Moreover, the federal regulation is technical in nature, and all PHAs must comply with the regulation. The trial court herein reviewed whether CMHA complied with the regulation, and properly found, as we do, that there was no compliance. We also surmised <em>supra, </em>that CMHA was in full possession of enough information to formulate a factual statement to include in the notice. CMHA\u2019s accusation that the trial court engaged in \u201cimpermissible judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>activism\u201d is an accusation without merit, an insult to the judicial process, and one which is repugnant to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">CMHA\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">CMHA\u2019s fourth assignment of error in which it submits that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Younger is without factual support. Younger\u2019s motion was structured as a \u201cmotion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment.\u201d The trial court expressly stated that it was granting the \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d for failure to comply with the federal regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">CMHA\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b861-9\">Spellacy, P.J., and Blackmon, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b857-12\">. Even though the trial court did not rule on CMHA\u2019s claim that Younger was liable for unpaid rent, this court has jurisdiction to review this appeal. See <em>Cuyahoga Metro. Hous. Auth. v. Jackson </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 129, 21 O.O.3d 81, 423 N.E.2d 177; <em>Skillman </em>v. <em>Browne </em>(1990), 68 Ohio App.3d 615, 589 N.E.2d 407.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
