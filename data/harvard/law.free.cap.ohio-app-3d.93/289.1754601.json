The indictment stated that appellant\u2019s failure to support included a total accumulated period of twenty-six out of one hundred and four consecutive weeks, and was a felony of the fourth degree. In returning a guilty verdict against appellant the jury also made the specific finding that appellant did in fact fail to provide support for twenty-six out of one hundred and four consecutive weeks. Appellant was sentenced to a prison term of one year, which was suspended. Appellant was then placed on probation for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">From this judgment appellant appeals, asserting one assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-7\">\u201cThe trial court improperly allowed maintenance and eventual conviction of a felony charge for non-support of dependents where there had not been a previous court finding that the defendant-appellant had failed to provide support pursuant to R.C. 2919.21(A)(2) for a total accumulated period of twenty-six weeks out of the preceding one hundred and four consecutive weeks prior to the date of indictment and during the period covering the indictment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Appellant contends that in order for a charge of nonsupport to be a felony pursuant to R.C. 2919.21(E), the state must allege and prove there was a prior conviction of failing to support for a period of twenty-six weeks. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">R.C. 2919.21(E) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-10\">\u201c(E) Whoever violates division (A) of this section is guilty of nonsupport of dependents, a misdemeanor of the first degree. If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of division (A)(2) of this section or there has been a court finding that the offender has failed to provide support under division (A)(2) of this section for a total accumulated period of twenty-six weeks out of one hundred four consecutive weeks, whether or not the twenty-six weeks were consecutive, then a violation of division (A)(2) of this section is a felony of the fourth degree. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">This section imposes a more severe sanction on repeat offenders and offenders who fail to provide support for an extensive period of time. Otherwise the offense is a misdemeanor. To enhance the offense from a first degree misdemeanor to a fourth degree felony, this section requires either that the offender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>have a prior conviction <em>or </em>there be a specific finding that the offender failed to support his children for a period of twenty-six weeks. <em>State v. Bale </em>(Dec. 7, 1993), Delaware App. No 93CAA1001, unreported, 1993 WL 535450. See, also, <em>State v. Lizanich </em>(Mar. 22, 1994), Franklin App. No. 93AP-1087, unreported, 1994 WL 97197.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Appellant cites <em>State v. Messer </em>(1992), 62 Ohio Misc.2d 232, 597 N.E.2d 568, where the Court of Common Pleas of Wood County reviewed the legislative history of R.C. 2919.21(E) and concluded there had to be a prior court finding of nonsupport for a period of twenty-six weeks in order for the enhancement provision to be triggered. We disagree with this interpretation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The wording of the statute does not require a prior judicial determination of failing to support for a period of twenty-six weeks. The intent of a statute is to be primarily determined from the language of the statute itself. See <em>Stewart v. Trumbull Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d 129, 130, 63 O.O.2d 227, 227, 296 N.E.2d 676, 677. The court\u2019s finding that the defendant failed to provide support for twenty-six weeks does not have to be a prior adjudication. It is sufficient for this finding to be made on the facts of the case before the court at the time. <em>State v. Cole </em>(Mar. 23, 1994), Hamilton App. No. C-930280, unreported, 1994 WL 91174. In the present case, the jury made such a finding and appellant was properly convicted and sentenced for the felony violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Having found no error prejudicial to the appellant herein in any of the particulars assigned and argued, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b325-9\">Shaw, P.J., and Thomas F. Bryant, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b324-12\">. R.C. 2919.21(A)(2) reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-13\">\"(A)^ No person shall abandon, or fail to provide adequate support to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-14\">\u201c(2) His or her legitimate or illegitimate child who is under age eighteen, or mentally or physically handicapped child who is under age twenty-one [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b325-10\">. We note that the Sixth District Court of Appeals also interpreted the wording of R.C. 2919.21(E) contrary to <em>Messer </em>in <em>State v. Sanders </em>(May 1, 1992), Wood App. No. 91WD109, unreported, 1992 WL 89616.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
