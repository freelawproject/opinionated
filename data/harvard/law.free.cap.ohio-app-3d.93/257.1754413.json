In February 1991, Ms. Kelly took the children and left home. Thereafter, the girls began to behave inappropriately; specifically, there were concerns regarding sexual acting out. As a result of the girls\u2019 behavior, Ms. Kelly arranged for them to enter counseling. Based on the disclosures made by Angel and Amy, appellant was indicted by the Stark County Grand Jury on December 4, 1992, and charged with two counts of rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02, two counts of sexual battery in violation of R.C. 2907.03, two counts of gross sexual imposition in violation of R.C. 2907.05 and two counts of endangering children in violation of R.C. 2919.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Appellant was arraigned on December 11, 1992, and entered pleas of not guilty to all charges. A jury trial was commenced on February 24, 1993. Among the witnesses called by appellee, the state of Ohio, were the alleged victims. Prior to their testimony, the court questioned each child to determine her competency to testify. Over appellant\u2019s objection, the court found each child to be a competent witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">At the close of the evidence, the trial court dismissed the two counts of endangering children. The jury returned a verdict of guilty to all remaining counts in the indictment. The trial court sentenced appellant to life imprisonment on each count of rape, to be served consecutive to each other, a definite term of two years on each count of sexual battery, merged with the counts of rape, and a definite term of two years on each count of gross sexual imposition, to run consecutive to each other and to the life sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Appellant timely filed a notice of appeal and this matter is now before this court for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Assignments of Error are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 1:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred in not conducting an adequate competency hearing and in finding Amy and Angel Kelly competent to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\">\u201cAssignment of Error No. 2:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-11\">\u201cThe trial court erred in admitting accusatory hearsay evidence as an Evidence Rule 803(4) exception without first conducting the analysis required by <em>State v.

We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">Under Evid.R. 601(A), a child under ten years is not competent to testify if the child \u201cappear[s] incapable of receiving just impressions of the facts and transactions respecting which they are examined, or of relating them truly.\u201d This determination must be made by the trial court through a voir dire examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-13\">Justice Resnick has set out certain factors that the trial court must consider in reviewing the competency to testify of a child under ten:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-14\">\u201cIn determining whether a child under ten is competent to testify, the trial court must take into consideration (1) the child\u2019s ability to receive accurate impressions of fact or to observe acts about which he or she will testify, (2) the child\u2019s ability to recollect those impressions or observations, (3) the child\u2019s ability to communicate what was observed, (4) the child\u2019s understanding of truth and falsity and (5) the child\u2019s appreciation of his or her responsibility to be truthful.\u201d <em>State v. Frazier </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 247, 574 N.E.2d 483, syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-15\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court conducted an examination of Amy Kelly, age six, and Angel Kelly, age four, in open court with counsel for appellant present. Appellant had been excluded from the courtroom at appellee\u2019s request under the authority of <em>Kentucky v. Stincer </em>(1987), 482 U.S. 730, 107 S.Ct. 2658, 96 L.Ed.2d 631. These examinations are included in the transcript at Vol. I, at 89-98. The trial court personally conducted the examination of the girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-16\">Both girls explained to the court the ramifications of telling a lie and the punishment for lying, thereby satisfying the requirements of numbers four and five enumerated in <em>Frazier. </em>The girls responded to the trial court\u2019s inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>about where they lived, what type of home they lived in, who lived with them now, the type of grade or class they were in (Amy corrected the court that kindergarten was not a grade), and who their teachers were, thereby satisfying numbers one through three of <em>Frazier. </em>At the conclusion of these voir dires, the trial court found the children competent to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Absent a showing of an abuse of discretion, appellate courts will not reverse a finding of competency entered by a trial court that has had the ability to personally observe and question the child. <em>State v. Lewis </em>(1982), 4 Ohio App.3d 275, 4 OBR 494, 448 N.E.2d 487. In order to find an abuse of discretion, we must determine that the trial court\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable and not merely an error of law or judgment. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">From our review of the record, we find no indication of an abuse of discretion by the trial court in conducting the voir dire examination nor in the decision of competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Assignment of Error I is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">Appellant claims that the trial court erred in admitting as evidence statements given by the victims to a physician and a social worker without a voir dire hearing on admissibility. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">Appellant cites to this court the dicta in Justice Resnick\u2019s opinion on <em>State v. Dever </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d, 401, 410, 596 N.E.2d 436, 444:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-11\">\u201cThe trial court should consider the circumstances surrounding the making of the hearsay statement. If the trial court finds in voir dire that the child\u2019s statements were inappropriately influenced by another, then those statements would not have been made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment. This inquiry will vary, depending on the facts of each case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">Admittedly, this suggested voir dire procedure was not done in the case <em>sub judice. </em>The trial court, under Evid.R. 104(A), is the sole determinant of the admissibility of evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-13\">\u201cRULE 104. PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-14\">\u201c(A) Questions of Admissibility Generally. Preliminary questions concerning the qualification of a person to be a witness, the existence of a privilege, or the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court, subject to the provisions of subdivision (B). In making its determination it is not bound by the rules of evidence except those with respect to privileges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>This obligation to determine admissibility refers to statements which are sought to be admitted under Evid.R. 803(4) as in the case <em>sub judice. </em>The issue to be determined under Evid.R. 104(A) is the admissibility of these statements by the victims to the physician, Leslie A. Mitchell, M.D., and the social worker, Elizabeth Mostatter. Appellant as much as concedes that the taking of the medical history by the social worker is the same as if it was given to the physician in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">We are required to examine the testimony to see if the trial court erred in finding that the evidence qualified as an exception to hearsay under Evid.R. 803(4). At the end of the testimony, the trial court specifically found that it met the exception. One wonders what the trial court would have done had it found that the testimony would not qualify under Evid.R. 803(4). This sort of dilemma would have been resolved had the trial court followed the dicta in <em>Dever.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Upon examination of the testimony under the guidelines of <em>State v. Boston </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 108, 545 N.E.2d 1220, and <em>Dever, </em>we find that the social worker who did the initial history did it for the purposes of diagnosis and treatment. During the history to Mostatter, Amy stated that her father had touched her and hit her. Dr. Mitchell did a physical examination of the children and it was during that physical that Angel responded to Dr. Mitchell\u2019s inquiry as to touching. Angel told Dr. Mitchell that her \u201cdaddy\u201d had done the touching. All of this testimony was given after the victims had testified, and except for the claim that Amy had been hit by her father, the testimony was consistent with their prior testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The motivational factors that were of great concern in <em>Boston </em>and the trustworthiness issue raised by <em>Boston </em>and <em>Dever </em>were in fact addressed in the case <em>sub judice </em>because the victims testified prior to Dr. Mitchell and Mostatter, and were subject to cross-examination and confrontation. This case is clearly distinguishable from the <em>Boston </em>and <em>Dever </em>cases were there was no prior cross-examination of the victims. Clearly, the right of confrontation was not violated by the trial court\u2019s technical error in not conducting a <em>Dever voir </em>dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Assignment of Error II is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">Appellant claims that statements made to a counselor do not qualify under the hearsay exception in Evid.R. 803(4). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">Appellant argues that the treatment of the victims by Lori Brisbin, Ph.D., a psychologist, does not qualify as a medical treatment exception under Evid.R. 803(4). To resolve this issue, we look to the dicta in <em>Boston. </em>In <em>Boston, </em>46 Ohio St.3d at 129, 545 N.E.2d at 1240-1241, the court concluded that treatment by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>psychologist did qualify as medical treatment under Evid.R. 803(4). Clearly, with that dicta, the Supreme Court has sanctioned using Evid.R. 803(4) when treatment is being given by a psychologist. As is suggested in <em>Boston, </em>the better course to follow when a child victim testifies is under Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">\u201cRULE 801. DEFINITIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">\u00ab * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">\u201c(D) Statements Which Are Not Hearsay. A statement is not hearsay if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">\u201c(1) <em>Prior Statement by Witness. </em>The declarant testifies at trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement jg ^ ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-10\">\u201c(c) one of identification of a person soon after perceiving him, if the circumstances demonstrate the reliability of the prior identification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">We concur that although the trustworthiness standards were not met, the statements made to Dr. Brisbin qualified under Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">Assignment of Error III is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">Appellant claims that the trial court erred in permitting \u201cexperts\u201d to testify as to their opinions regarding the existence of sexual abuse. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-15\">Evid.R. 702 permits opinions of experts if the testimony offered will provide information to the fact finder, <em>i.e., </em>jury, which is \u201csufficiently beyond common experience.\u201d <em>State v. Buell </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 124, 131, 22 OBR 203, 209, 489 N.E.2d 795, 803. As Justice Douglas concluded in <em>Boston, </em>experts may be in fields beyond law and medicine, including experts trained in child sexual abuse cases. Further, Evid.R. 703 defines the basis for the opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-16\">\u201cRULE 703. BASES OF OPINION TESTIMONY BY EXPERTS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-17\">\u201cThe facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by him or admitted in evidence at the hearing.\u201d &gt;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-18\">In order to review this assignment of error, we must examine the testimony of Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Brisbin. Dr. Mitchell opined that Angel had been sexually abused. Dr. Mitchell formed her opinion after obtaining the history from Angel, examining her and hearing Angel\u2019s own statements, which were testified to at the trial by Angel (see Assignment of Error II). Dr. Mitchell\u2019s statement was based upon her knowledge and skill in the specialized unit at Akron Children\u2019s Hospital and on the facts. The physical examination of Angel and data presented to Dr. Mitchell fulfilled the requirement of Evid.R. 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Dr. Brisbin, the psychologist who treated the victims as part of the overall assessment treatment team, opined that Amy and Angel had been sexually abused. Dr. Brisbin testified that this opinion was based upon her personal observations of Amy\u2019s sexual acting out during the counseling sessions and Amy\u2019s own account of the attacks (see Assignment of Error III and testimony of child). Dr. Brisbin also testified that Angel acted out in a similar fashion to her sister, including bed wetting and masturbation, and Angel also gave her own account of the attacks (see Assignment of Error III and direct testimony of the witness). Further, Dr. Brisbin was qualified by appellee as a child abuse expert spending eighty-five percent of her professional time on child abuse cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Dr. Brisbin\u2019s testimony met the requirements of Evid.R. 703. We note that appellant takes issue with the fact that Dr. Brisbin was a psychologist and not an M.D. In <em>Boston, </em>one of the doctors whose expert testimony was permitted was also a psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Assignment of Error IV is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Appellant claims that he was denied a fair trial and due process of law because of the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Appellant points to three separate types of misconduct. He first claims that the prosecutor offered her opinion of appellant\u2019s guilt to the jury. Second, appellant claims that the prosecutor repeatedly asked improper questions. Last, appellant claims that the prosecutor misrepresented the testimony during closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">The test for prosecutorial misconduct is whether the prosecutor\u2019s comments and remarks were improper and, if so, whether those comments and remarks prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the accused. <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 555 N.E.2d 293, certiorari denied (1990), 498 U.S. 1017, 111 S.Ct. 591, 112 L.Ed.2d 596. In reviewing allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, it is our duty to consider the complained-of conduct in the context of the entire trial. <em>Darden v. Wainwight </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 168, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144. We have been continually reminded by reviewing courts that a trial is similar to an arena of combat where our adversarial system generates both tension and turmoil during trial, <em>State v. Stephens </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St.2d 76, 53 O.O.2d 182, 263 N.E.2d 773, and where trials cannot be \u201csqueezed dry of all feeling.\u201d <em>State v. Keenan </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 402, 409, 613 N.E.2d 203, 208. It is conceded that the prosecutor may \u201cstrike hard blows, [but the prosecutor] is not at liberty to strike foul ones.\u201d <em>Berger v. United States </em>(1935), 295 U.S. 78, 88, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>55 S.Ct. 629, 633, 79 L.Ed. 1314, 1321. With these basic premises as controlling, we will address the three problem areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">OPINION OF PROSECUTOR</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Appellant claims that during voir dire, the prosecutor qualified herself as an expert in trying child abuse cases. There was no objection made to that statement; therefore, we find that it was not preserved for appeal. However, this issue might call for an examination under the plain error doctrine if in fact the remarks were improper. These are the first remarks of appellee in voir dire and are parallel to an attorney introducing himself or herself as a defense attorney, personal injury attorney or Ohio Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Appellant next argues that during the cross-examination of appellant, the prosecutor stated that appellant was not telling the truth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">\u201cQ. Isn\u2019t it true that you have testified, under oath,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: No, no, don\u2019t ask what he testified. The Jury can recall what he testified. Just ask a question. Don\u2019t ask him to characterize what the testimony was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-10\">\u201cMRS. ROHRER: Well, Your Honor, he\u2019s not telling the truth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">Upon review of the transcript, we find that this dialogue between the court and the prosecutor was after appellant was repeatedly evasive to the prosecutor\u2019s questions and had in fact goaded the prosecutor and challenged her after that comment. The remark is clearly one of frustration and there was no objection to that comment in the record. An error not raised in the trial court must be plain error for an appellate court to reverse. <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804. The plain error rule is to be taken with utmost caution under exceptional circumstances, and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">Given the totality of the circumstances involved in the dialogue between appellant and the prosecutor, we find no error rising to the standard of plain error to justify a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">\n<em>Improper Questioning</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b301-14\">Appellant claims that during direct examination of the victims on the issue of force, the prosecutor repeated questions disallowed by the court to get her answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-15\">The complained-of areas are in the transcript at Vol. I, 114-115, 148, 149-150, and involved the questioning of both girls. While the court denied opinion testimony, the court permitted the non-opinion questions that appellant now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>objects to in argument. Under this set of facts, we find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in overruling appellant\u2019s objections to the questions finally asked and answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\n<em>Closing Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Appellant claims that the prosecutor misrepresented the testimony during closing argument. In particular, appellant argues that the following statement was improper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">\u201cBut I asked her, did he make you do these things? And she said, \u2018Yes, he made me do these things\u2019. And how did you feel? T felt scared and I felt sad\u2019. Now that\u2019s force.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">There is no objection to this statement in the record; therefore, this must be considered under the doctrine of plain error. <em>Long. </em>The prosecutor\u2019s statement was on the issue of how the attacks made Angel feel. There is no testimony in the record regarding how Angel felt. Clearly, the prosecutor\u2019s statement was a misstatement of the evidence. Given the fact that the trial court permitted jurors to take notes, and the obvious inadvertence of the statement, we find no prejudice to the level of the plain error standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Assignment of Error V is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">Appellant claims that there was insufficient evidence of force to support a finding by the jury that the victims were compelled to submit by force or threat of force. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">The trial court instructed the jury on the issue of force, and provided a place on the verdict form for a finding of force by the jury. Appellant first argues that within the jury instruction on force, the trial court did not provide a definition of the necessary burden to convict. We disagree. Within the charge is the definition of the proper burden, <em>i.e., </em>beyond a reasonable doubt, and at the court\u2019s summation of the rape counts. We further note that appellant got the benefit of an incorrect charge on circumstantial evidence. See <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">The scope of our review is limited to the guidelines of <em>State v. Brown </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 305, 528 N.E.2d 523, paragraph four of the syllabus, certiorari denied (1989), 489 U.S. 1040, 109 S.Ct. 1177, 103 L.Ed.2d 239, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-14\">\u201cIn reviewing a claim that a jury verdict was against the weight of the evidence, or that the evidence was insufficient, a reviewing court\u2019s duty is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>review the record to determine whether there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">We are further guided by the language of <em>Jenks, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 273, 574 N.E.2d at 503, which states that in \u201creviewing both weight and sufficiency of the evidence, the same test is applied.\u201d Therefore, the reviewing court is to examine the evidence introduced at the trial \u201cto determine whether such evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus. As the appellate court, we must view the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution and in support of the verdict, and determine whether \u201cany rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Apart from the delineated sections of the transcript, we find other incidents of force in the record. Amy said that appellant would \u201churt mom\u201d if she told; Amy stated that Angel would be crying when in the bathroom with appellant; Angel testified that appellant made her do things; the mother stated that she would hear the children crying and screaming when she left appellant alone with the girls; and Amy told Mostatter during treatment at the care center that appellant had hit her.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Given the standard of review of <em>Brown </em>and <em>Jenks, </em>we find no error in the trial court\u2019s instruction on the issue of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Assignment of Error VI is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">Appellant claims that the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss Juror No. 27 for cause after the juror admitted knowing the victims. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-11\">After the jury was sworn, opening statements made and the direct examination of Amy, Juror No. 27 requested to confer with the trial court. The juror recognized Amy as possibly being a child in one of her classes at church. This was confirmed as being true during a recess. The trial court then conducted an inquiry of the juror as to whether this would affect her ability to fairly decide the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. Do you think that it would have any effect upon your fairly deciding the issues in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-13\">\u201cJUROR NO. 27: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-14\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. You think that you could put aside any past experience that you\u2019ve had with her and decide this case upon the law and the which is given to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>\u201cJUROR NO. 27: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Would you have any embarrassment whatsoever, if you ultimately find the Defendant not guilty, should you come in contact with the girl and/or her family in the future?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">\u201cJUROR NO. 27: No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The trial court then permitted appellant to question the witness and in particular, the witness answered the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\">\u201cMR. MACKEY: Did you form any opinion about their truthfulness and veracity from your acquaintance with the little girls?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-9\">\u201cJUROR NO. 27: No. I didn\u2019t have that kind of contact with them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">After this dialogue, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s challenge for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">Removal of a juror is within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Grubb </em>(1988), 44 Ohio App.3d 94, 541 N.E.2d 476. Crim.R. 24 enumerates the specific challenges for cause with thirteen specific causes and one as \u201cotherwise unsuitable.\u201d From our review of the transcript and Crim.R. 24, the association described by the juror did not fit any of these enumerated causes. We find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in the denial of appellant\u2019s challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">Assignment of Error VII is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Stark County, Ohio is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-14\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b304-15\">Smart and William B.
