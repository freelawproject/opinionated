Buie also appeals the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for stay. We reverse because the collective bargaining agreement (\u201cagreement\u201d) negotiated by the Doylestown Education Association (\u201cthe union\u201d) and the board does not specify the procedure by which contracts are to be terminated and, therefore, the trial court erred in determining that the appeal of the R.C. 3319.16 dismissal is premature until Buie completes his grievance procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">Buie was a tenured teacher employed by the board. At the beginning of the 1992-1993 school year, the board suspended Buie and initiated procedures to terminate his employment pursuant to R.C. 3319.16 and 3319.161. A hearing was conducted before a referee, who recommended that the board terminate Buie\u2019s employment for gross inefficiency. The board adopted the referee\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">Buie then filed a grievance challenging the termination as a violation of his rights under the agreement. He also filed an appeal in the common pleas court pursuant to the procedure set out by R.C. 3319.16. This \u201ctwo-tracked\u201d approach is the primary basis for the dispute on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>The board moved to dismiss Buie\u2019s appeal, arguing that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to hear it, since the agreement provided the only avenue of appeal and that was binding arbitration. The trial court dismissed the appeal, finding that Buie had to avail himself of the arbitration process before pursuing a statutory appeal under R.C. 3319.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Under the agreement, the union\u2019s Professional Rights and Responsibilities Committee (\u201cthe committee\u201d) must approve grievances before they are pursued to final, binding arbitration. The committee did not approve Buie\u2019s grievance for arbitration. Buie moved for a stay of the trial court proceedings so that he could urge the committee to reconsider its decision, which the trial court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Buie appeals assigning five errors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">\u201cI. The lower court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion for a stay pending efforts to have the Doylestown Education Association Reconsider its decision refusing to pursue appellant\u2019s grievance to arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">\u201cII. The lower court erred in concluding that Appellant Buie must first avail himself of binding arbitration, where the appellant has taken that process as far as possible on his own initiative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">\u201cHI. The lower court erred in concluding that the grievance submitted by Appellant Buie under the master contract is the exclusive remedy available to Appellant Buie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">\u201cIV. The lower court erred in concluding that Appellant Buie should be denied the right to have the decision of Appellee Board reviewed under Revised Code Section 3319.16.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\">\u201cV. The lower court erred in failing to find that the Teacher Tenure Act provides is analogous [sic] a civil right which under the terms of 4117.10(A) is not subject exclusively to the use of binding arbitration under a collective bargaining agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">As these assignments of error are interrelated, we will discuss them together. When the board began considering termination of Buie\u2019s employment, it initiated and followed the procedures set out in R.C. 3319.16 for termination of contracts by a board of education. R.C. 3319.16 provides that any teacher affected by an order terminating his or her contract may appeal to the common pleas court of the county where the school is located. The board, however, contends that even though it followed R.C. 3319.16 in terminating Buie\u2019s employment, Buie cannot avail himself of the appeal procedure set out by that statute. The board argues that R.C. 4117.10(A) requires that Buie pursue the dispute to final, binding arbitration according to the agreement\u2019s grievance procedure. R.C. 4117.10(A) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>\u201cAn agreement between a public employer and an exclusive representative * * * governs the wages, hours, and terms and conditions of public employment covered by the agreement. If the agreement provides for a final and binding arbitration of grievances, public employers, employees, and employee organizations are subject solely to that grievance procedure * * *. Where no agreement exists or <em>where an agreement makes no specification about a matter, </em>the public employer and public employees are subject to all applicable state or local laws or ordinances pertaining to the wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment for public employees.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The relevant inquiry then becomes whether contract termination is a matter specified in the agreement. We answer this in the negative. The trial court found that the agreement \u201caddresses the issue of termination\u201d but \u201cis silent on any procedure leading up to teacher termination.\u201d The only language in the agreement addressing the issue of termination is Article VI(J). It reads, \u201c[n]o teacher will be suspended, terminated, or subject to non-renewal without stated sufficient reasons.\u201d We find that when viewed in the context of the entire agreement, together with the grievance procedures language and the decision to use the statutory termination procedures of R.C. 3319.16, the agreement \u201cmakes no <em>specification </em>about\u201d the matter of teacher termination and thus such matters are governed by the statutory procedures used by the board. The board contends that the negotiated <em>grievance </em>appeal procedure applies after a teacher has been terminated through the <em>statutory </em>procedure. No logical reason is advanced for \u201cswitching gears\u201d at the appeal stage. We find that the decision to pursue termination by way of R.C. 3319.16 evinces a recognition that the grievance procedures in the agreement were inapposite to teacher terminations.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Moreover, the grievance procedure section of the agreement limits binding arbitration rights as follows: \u201cA grievance for binding arbitration is <em>limited </em>to any alleged violation of the <em>written negotiations agreement </em>between the Association [the Union] and the Board.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Buie successfully pursued a grievance alleging a violation of the written negotiations agreement prior to the termination of his employment. The grievance alleged that certain items should not have been included in his personnel file. An entire section of the agreement, Article VII, is devoted to how personnel files must be maintained. Unlike Article VII, the written negotiations agreement contains no such section on termination procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">We find additional support for our decision in that the grievance Buie filed regarding his termination did not challenge the termination as being contrary to the contract standards requiring that \u201c[n]o teacher will be * * * terminated * * * without stated sufficient reasons.\u201d Rather, he says that the board\u2019s stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>reason should not be applied to him as it is \u201cnot supported by the law and evidence\u201d in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">For all the foregoing reasons, we find that the trial court erred in dismissing Buie\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The third and fourth assignments of error are well taken. Given our disposition of those assignments of error, we do not reach the first, second, and fifth assignments of error as they are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b472-8\">Dickinson, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b472-9\">Reece, P.J., concurs separately.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b472-10\">Reece, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Alv\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">I would normally hold that the parties agreed to their contract, which provided for binding arbitration to resolve their dispute and, therefore, they must live with it. However, in this case Buie finds himself in a true \u201cCatch 22.\u201d He can\u2019t go to binding arbitration because his union won\u2019t pursue his grievance. He can\u2019t appeal to the court because he hasn\u2019t pursued arbitration. He\u2019s left with no appeal. The majority opinion provides an appeal which Buie must still show has any merit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
