Appellant stated: \u201c \u2018I am going to get you\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018[y]ou old gray-headed son of a bitch. I will go home and get my .38 and come back and kill you.\u2019 \u201d Shortly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>thereafter appellant, who lived just up the street from Blickenstaff, returned and threw a lighted \u201cMolotov cocktail\u201d under Blickenstaff\u2019s automobile, a 1969 Chevrolet El Camino pickup worth $2,000. A fire erupted underneath the car but it was extinguished, apparently because of rain, by the time the fire department arrived. There was smoke damage to the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">After the fire department left, appellant returned and smashed the window of the automobile with a hammer. A neighbor, Mrs. Sizemore, observed appellant throw the Molotov cocktail and smash the windshield, and appellant was arrested at his home shortly after the incidents. On the way to the police station appellant appeared to be very angry and spontaneously stated: \u201c\u2018Someday, I am going to kill that old man\u2019 or \u2018[sjomebody is going to kill that old man.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The only contentions raised on this appeal concern the sentence received by appellant. As to count I, the violation of Penal Code section 451a, the <em>court </em>committed appellant to the Youth Authority for the term prescribed by law. As to count II, the violation of Penal Code section 12303.3, the court sentenced appellant to be imprisoned in the state prison for the term prescribed by law but provided that: \u201cSentence is stayed pending appeal and pending execution and service of the sentence in Count 1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">As to count I appellant contends that the sentence provided in the Penal Code for violation of section 451a violates the cruel or unusual punishment and equal protection clauses of the California Constitution. We find that this issue is not appropriately presented by the facts of this case and therefore we decline to decide it. As to count II respondent concedes appellant\u2019s contention that the stay of execution'was intended to be made permanent to comply with Penal Code section 654. We modify the judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Punishment for Violation of Penal Code Section 451a</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Penal Code section 451a provides that \u201c[a]ny person who willfully and maliciously attempts to set fire to or attempts to burn . . . any . . . property mentioned in the foregoing sections, or who commits any act preliminary thereto, or in furtherance thereof, is guilty of a felony. . . .\u201d This section is unusual because it is one of the very few provisions of the Penal Code which prohibits the attempt to commit a specific crime. (See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>2 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1963) \u00a7 1047, pp. 991-992.) Most attempts are prosecuted under Penal Code section 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Formerly Penal Code section 451a provided that a person in violation thereof shall be \u201csentenced to the penitentiary for not less than one nor more than two years or fined not to exceed one thousand dollars.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But in 1966 the Legislature deleted this language and substituted the present provision that a person in violation thereof \u201cis guilty of a felony.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">The briefs argue the following issue: Since section 451a no longer specifies the term of imprisonment for its violation, how is such term determined? The parties direct us to no case squarely deciding the issue, nor have we found one.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Is the maximum term for violation of section 451a governed by Penal Code section 18, which provides, \u201cExcept in cases where a different punishment is prescribed by any law of this State, every offense declared to be a felony is punishable by imprisonment in any of the state prisons, not exceeding five years; . . .\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Or, since violation of section 451a is in the nature of an attempt, is the term of imprisonment governed instead by Penal Code section 664?<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>The People contend that section 18 applies, because violation of section 451a is itself a completed felony, for which no specific punishment is prescribed. Appellant contends that section 451a merely describes an attempt to violate one of \u201cthe foregoing sections\u201d mentioned in section 451a, and that the term of imprisonment is calculated by applying section 664 to the punishment for the offense which was attempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Appellant contends that on the facts of the instant case the offense which was attempted is the burning of personal property mentioned in Penal Code section 449a.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Since section 449a provides a punishment of imprisonment in the state prison for one to three years, appellant argues that the applicable punishment under subdivision 2 of section 664<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is imprisonment in the county jail for not more than one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Appellant argues that to punish a person convicted of violating section 451a on these facts by calculating the term under section 18 rather than sections 664 and 449a would lead to the anomalous result that the maximum punishment for the attempt (five years) would be greater than the maximum punishment for the completed crime (three years). Such a result, he contends, is arbitrary, irrational, and so grossly disproportionate as to violate the cruel or unusual punishment and equal protection clauses of the California Constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">On the other hand, the result suggested by appellant is also anomalous, because to make the crime punishable by imprisonment for one year in the county jail would be inconsistent with the express declaration in section 451a that its violation constitutes a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>The question posed by the parties is an interesting one, but we need not decide it. Appellant\u2019s arguments concerning Penal Code section 18 are irrelevant to his own case, because he was not sentenced pursuant to that provision. At the request of appellant\u2019s trial counsel and on the recommendation of the probation officer, the trial court, having found that appellant was 20 years of age at the time of apprehension for the crime, committed appellant to the Youth Authority on count I, pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 1731.5.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellant did not receive a sentence of imprisonment in the state prison, <em>(In re Keller, </em>232 Cal.App.2d 520, 526 [42 Cal.Rptr. 921].)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">As appellant\u2019s trial counsel was aware, appellant\u2019s period of custody in the Youth Authority is not governed by Penal Code section 18, but by Welfare and Institutions Code sections 1765<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and 1771.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>(In re Keller, supra; People </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>5 Cal.3d 313, 316, 317 [96 Cal.Rptr. 13, 486 P.2d 1213]; <em>In re Pfeiffer, </em>264 Cal.App.2d 470, 475 [70 Cal.Rptr. 831].) Thus appellant\u2019s argument as to Penal Code section 18 is beside the point. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Perez, 239 </em>Cal.App.2d 1, 7 [48 Cal.Rptr. 596]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Winning, </em>191 Cal.App.2d 763, 768 [12 Cal.Rptr. 885].)  The commitment of appellant for the period specified by the Youth Authority Act does not constitute cruel or unusual punishment or deny him equal pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>tection of the laws. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith, supra </em>at p. 317; <em>In re Herrera, </em>23 Cal.2d 206, 213-214 [143 P.2d 345]; see also <em>In re Gary W., </em>5 Cal.3d 296, 301-302 [96 Cal.Rptr. 1, 486 P.2d 1201].)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Double Punishment</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Respondent concedes appellant\u2019s contentions that the stay of execution on count II was intended to avoid the prohibition against double punishment in Penal Code section 654 and that in order to accomplish this result the stay was intended to be made permanent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We modify the judgment accordingly.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The judgment as to count II is modified by adding the words: \u201csuch stay to become permanent when service of sentence as to Count 1 is completed\u201d following the provision that \u201cSentence is stayed pending appeal and pending execution and service of the sentence in Count 1.\u201d In all other respects the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">Kaus, P.

Pertinent to this position is the decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Niles, </em>227 Cal.App.2d 749, 752, 755-756 [39 Cal.Rptr. 11], where it was held that double punishment under a judgment imposing multiple sentences was avoided by a concurrent stay of execution of the sentence for the lesser offense pending appeal and a proviso that the stay would become permanent when the sentence on the greater offense was completed. In the case at bench, however, the possibility of double punishment under the judgment is not avoided by the instant stay of execution, which was not permanent, but temporary; was subject to termination at any time; and upon termination would leave the judgment effective as to all of the sentences imposed. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 359-360; fn. omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b108-10\">The instant case is distinguishable from <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>271 Cal.App.2d 205, 209 [76 Cal.Rptr. 842], <em>People </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>275 Cal.App.2d 645, 650-653 [80 Cal.Rptr. 392], cert. den. 397 U.S. 1014 [25 L.Ed.2d 428, 90 S.Ct. 1247], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Mack, </em>2 Cal.App.3d 724, 729-730 [82 Cal.Rptr. 771], holding that the double punishment provision of Penal Code section 654 is not applicable to a commitment to the Youth Authority under Welfare and Institutions Code section 1731.5 because such commitment is not \u201cpunishment\u201d (Welf. &amp; Inst.
