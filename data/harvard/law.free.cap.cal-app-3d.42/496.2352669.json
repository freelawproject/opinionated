J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQp\">Action for damages and injunctive relief under the Unfair Practices Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d). Plaintiffs Paramount General Hospital Company, a limited partnership, and Paramount General Hospital, Inc., appeal from a judgment in favor of defendant National Medical Enterprises, Inc., and various individual defendants, after the trial court sustained defendants\u2019 general demurrers to plaintiffs\u2019 second amended complaint without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Allegations of Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Plaintiffs<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> own and operate as a business, a hospital and adjoining medical office building in Paramount. For the \u201cpurpose of earning a profit\u201d the partnership \u201csupplies\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> office space in the medical building to doctors. Plaintiffs also supply the following services: answering service, direct communication facilities to the hospital, receptionist service, \u201cspecialized suite improvements,\u201d radiological, pharmaceutical and other such services in the medical building; utilities; janitorial and security services, parking; and, in the adjoining hospital, laboratory, clinical testing, diagnostic, therapeutic and related facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Defendants are plaintiffs\u2019 competitors. When this action was filed, defendants were about to open a hospital and were constructing a medical building in Lakewood, a few miles from plaintiffs\u2019 hospital and medical building in Paramount. Defendants offered about a dozen named and five unknown doctors, medical office space and all the services enumerated above that plaintiffs now furnish to doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Plaintiffs allege that by the means described below, defendants are either giving away or selling below cost the use of office space in the medical building and the various services described above.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendants are making these offers for the purpose of destroying competition from plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Plaintiffs have been injured, because various specified doctors, who would have used plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cspace and services\u201d have accepted or intend to accept defendants\u2019 below-cnst or giveaway offers. Plaintiffs have \u201clost the patronage of the patients\u201d who would have been \u201csupplied\u201d by those doctors who will be accepting defendants\u2019 offer. Plaintiff partnership, which owns the office building, has been damaged over a four-month period in the amount of about $11,000 in lost rentals; plaintiff corporation, which owns the hospital, has been \u201cactually damaged in the amount of $796,000 or more, which is the net income that plaintiff corporation would have earned from said patients which it lost.\u201d (See fn. 14, <em>infra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Plaintiffs, in a second cause of action, recharacterize the appropriate facts alleged above as a \u201csecret rebate\u201d of which future tenants, who will be charged more, will not be advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The Unfair Practices Act (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17000 et seq.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> prohibits: (1) Selling below cost or giving away any \u201carticle or product\u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>the purpose of injuring competitors or destroying competition (\u00a7 17043); (2) selling or using any \u201carticle or product\u201d as a \u201closs leader\u201d (\u00a7 17044); (3) secret rebates, or the extension of special services or privileges to certain purchasers (\u00a7 17045); and\u2014not involved in this case\u2014(4) locality discrimination with respect to any \u201carticle or product\u201d (\u00a7 17040).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The Unfair Practices Act was enacted in 1941. (Stats. 1941, ch. 526, \u00a7 1.) (See, generally, Barron, <em>California Antitrust\u2014Legislative Schizophrenia </em>(1962) 35 So.Cal.L.Rev. 393, 400.) However, \u201clocality discrimination\u201d has been prohibited since 1913. (Stats. 1913, ch. 276, \u00a7 1.) Since 1933, secret rebates (Stats. 1933, ch. 261, \u00a7 1) and below-cost sales or giveaways (Stats. 1933, ch. 504, \u00a7 1) have been prohibited. (See generally <em>Wholesale T. Dealers </em>v. <em>National etc. Co., </em>11 Cal.2d 634, 640, seq. [82 P.2d 3, 118 A.L.R. 486].) The provisions of the Act have remained substantially unchanged since 1941. (See <em>Dooley\u2019s Hardware Mart </em>v. <em>Food Giant Markets, Inc., </em>21 Cal.App.3d 513, 516-517 [98 Cal.Rptr. 543].)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">In enacting the Act, the Legislature set itself no small goal. In section 17001 it declared that the purpose of the Act was \u201cto safeguard the public against the creation or perpetuation of monopolies and to foster and encourage competition, by prohibiting unfair, dishonest, deceptive, destructive, fraudulent and discriminatory practices by which fair and honest competition is destroyed or prevented.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">It will be noted that what the Legislature sets out to \u201cfoster and encourage\u201d is competition generally, not just competition in the sale or furnishing of certain goods or services.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The issue posed by this litigation must be viewed in the light of this broad legislative target.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">To achieve its aim, the Legislature specifically provided that the Act \u201cshall be liberally construed that its beneficial purposes may be subserved.\u201d (\u00a7 17002.)</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">Further\u2014and this is vital in view of defendants\u2019 contention that this litigation involves nothing but leases to real property to which transactions covered by the Act are as incidental as \u201ctires on a newly purchased automobile\u201d\u2014section 17049 provides in relevant part as follows: \u201cThe prohibitions of this chapter against . . . sales below cost embrace any scheme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>of special rebates, collateral contracts or <em>any device of any nature whereby such </em>. . . <em>sale below cost is in substance or fact effected in violation of the spirit and intent of this chapter.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">The specific prohibition contained in the Act on which plaintiffs chiefly rely is found in section 17043: \u201cIt is unlawful for any person<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> engaged in business within this State to sell any article or product at less than the cost thereof to such vendor, or to give away any article or product, for the purpose of injuring competitors or destroying competition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Defendants in their brief pose the issue on this appeal as follows: \u201cWhere the subject matter of the complaint is a proposed <em>ten-year lease of real property, </em>namely medical building office space, is a cause of action stated under those sections of the California Unfair Practices Act which proscribe the \u2018sale below cost\u2019 or \u2018giving away\u2019 of <em>\u2018articles or products\u2019 </em>by vendors\u2019?\u201d (Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">In thus posing the issue defendants lose sight of the pleaded facts as well as the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Factually, we are not concerned with a simple lease of real property. Plaintiffs and defendants compete in offering to the medical profession specially designed working quarters, as well as a variety of sophisticated, specialized services. Legally it is misleading to suggest that such terms as \u201csell,\u201d \u201cgive,\u201d \u201carticle or product\u201d or \u201cvendor,\u201d when used in the Act, have only the simple meanings which they suggest to laymen.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">We first turn to the Act\u2019s remarkably open-ended definitions of the relevant terms. Emulating equity which does not \u201cput a fence around fraud,\u201d the Legislature obviously sought to avoid the pitfall of circumscribing the transactions covered by the Act with such precision that its substantive purpose could be evaded by methods of marketing contrary to the spirit but without the literal reach of the Act. (See \u00a7 17049,- quoted <em>supra.) </em>To this end, every definition relevant to section 17043 is framed in terms of what the concept defined \u201cincludes.\u201d  The term \u201cincludes\u201d is \u201cordinarily a word of enlargement and not of limitation. [Citation.] The statutory definition of thing as \u2018including\u2019 certain things does not necessarily place thereon a meaning limited to the inclusions.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Western Air Lines, Inc., </em>42 Cal.2d 621, 639 [268 P.2d 723]; see also, e.g., <em>Television Transmission </em>v. <em>Public Util. Com., 47 </em>Cal.2d 82, 85 [301 P.2d 862].)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Thus, the Act defines \u201csell,\u201d to <em>include </em>\u201cselling, offering for sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>or advertising for sale\u201d (\u00a7 17022) and \u201cgive,\u201d to <em>include </em>\u201cgiving, offering to give or advertising the intent to give\u201d (\u00a7 17023). Further, the Act defines \u201carticle or product,\u201d to <em>include </em>\u201cany article, product, commodity, <em>thing of value, service </em>or <em>output of a service trade.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 17024; italics added.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The statutory definitions \u00e1re \u201cillustrative rather than restrictive.\u201d <em>(In re Cox, </em>3 Cal.3d 202, 216 [90 Cal.Rptr. 24, 474 P.2d 992].)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Defendants first assert that they are not \u201cselling\u201d or \u201cgiving away\u201d because these transactions involve transfers of title which defendants\u2019 lease-service packages do not. The point is illusory: services or the outputs \u201cof a service trade\u201d are covered by the Act because they are \u201carticles or products\u201d as defined in section 17024. Services, however, do not involve the passage of title: the words \u201cselling\u201d and \u201cgiving away\u201d therefore cannot possibly carry the technical meaning defendants would give them.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> No title to anything passes in connection with such services as diaper washing <em>(Sandler </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>94 Cal.App.2d 254 [210 P.2d 314]), hair cutting <em>(Garner </em>v. <em>Journeyman Barbers\u2019 etc. Union, </em>223 Cal.App.2d 101 [35 Cal.Rptr. 693]) or the cleaning and rental of uniforms <em>(Page </em>v. <em>Bakersfield Uniform etc. Co., 239 </em>Cal.App.2d 762 [49 Cal.Rptr. 46]) all of which have been held to be covered by the Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The trial court recognized quite correctly that nothing in the Act immunizes businessmen who market lease-service arrangements. Nevertheless, it found the Act inapplicable because, in its words, \u201c[t]he \u2018services\u2019 to be provided as a part of the package are wholly ancillary to the [real estate] . . . transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">The trial court thus properly rejected the notion that the Act does not apply merely because a transaction covered by it is contractually combined with one that it assumed to be immune from its impact.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Unfortunately, it then carved out an exception, not justified by anything in the Act, under which it immunized the entire package because the services, clearly covered by the Act, were merely \u201cancillary\u201d to the lease which it thought to be unaffected by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">From the point of view of the Act\u2019s purpose\u2014the fostering and encouragement of competition\u2014it cannot matter which element of a package is functionally \u201cancillary\u201d to the other: what is vital is whether the part of the package clearly covered by the Act is so substantial that cost-cutting with respect to it can be used as a means to injure or destroy competition.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus\u2014to borrow defendants\u2019 simile\u2014if competition in the automobile business can be injured or destroyed by giving away the tires, they are a substantial part of the package\u2014yet tires without a car are as useless to a driver as are services without an office to a doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Thus, defendants\u2019 lease-service package fits comfortably into the noninclusive definition of \u201carticle or product\u201d of section 17024. That \u201csell\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>and \u201cgive\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 17022, 17023) cannot be read in their technical sense has already been demonstrated. Collectively, they obviously refer to any method\u2014sale, lease, consignment, and so forth\u2014of marketing articles or products.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Defendants also refer us to various partial statutory definitions of \u201ccost,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> arguing that plaintiffs would be unable to prove below-cost selling under the Act\u2019s standards because the definitions do not fit defendants\u2019 package.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">These arguments anticipate plaintiffs\u2019 problems at the trial stage and as such are premature. Having in mind the incredibly complex nature of the package being offered by defendants\u2014see footnote 3, supra\u2014proof of their costs will undoubtedly become a lawyer\u2019s nightmare, though it may turn out to be a C.P.A.\u2019s dream. (McCarthy, <em>Whatever Happened to the Small Businessman? The California Unfair Practices Act </em>(1968) 2 U.S.F.L.Rev. 165, 177-178.) All the same we find nothing in the Act\u2019s definition of \u201ccosts\u201d which compels a holding that plaintiffs can never prove what they allege.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">In summary, we hold that plaintiffs have stated a cause of action for damages and injunctive relief based on a violation of section 17043. They have also stated a cause of action for injunctive relief based on an alleged threat to violate the prohibitions against the secret rebates of section 17045.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">The judgment is reversed with directions to overrule defendants\u2019 general demurrer.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Stephens, J., and Ashby, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 4, 1974, and respondents\u2019 petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied December 11, 1974.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-10\">Paramount General Hospital Company, a limited partnership, whose general partner is Irving Moskowitz, M.D., owns a hospital and medical building, which it leases to plaintiff, Paramount General Hospital, Inc., in which the majority shareholder is Dr. Moskowitz. The limited partners and minority shareholders are also the same, and include some of the doctors referred to in the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b462-11\">The reason that plaintiffs avoid the word \u201clease\u201d or \u201crent\u201d will become clear in the discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b462-12\">Defendants have offered to furnish the doctors the following package: They will sell their medical building to the doctors, subject to a deed of trust to secure a loan in the amount of the cost of the medical building. The loan is repayable over 20 to 25 years in equal installments of principal and interest. The doctors will not assume the loan, will not be liable oh the note and will invest nothing in the medical building. De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>fendants will also lease the land on which the medical building stands to the doctors for 30 to 50 years at $30,000 a year, which plaintiffs allege is less than the \u201cfair rent\u00e1l value\u201d of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"AOyP\">Second, the doctors will lease the building back to defendants for a term about equal to the term of the loan on the purchase of the building. Defendants will maintain the building, pay taxes, and pay the doctors rental in an amount that will exceed the loan payments by $6,700 annually.</p>\n<p id=\"A7r\">Third, the doctors will lease office space from defendants for a period of ten years. The rental will amount to $6 per square foot; however, defendants\u2019 cost in maintaining the office space will be $6.25 a square foot.</p>\n<p id=\"AbRx\">In brief, according to plaintiffs, the plan envisions the doctors leasing the building back to defendants at a profit, and defendants leasing\u2014or subleasing\u2014space back to the doctors at a loss. At the end of about 25 years, the doctors will own the building outright, which will then have a remaining useful life of about 5 years, and the fair market value of the remaining term of the land lease will be at least $600,000.</p>\n<p id=\"AH8\">The doctors will not be expected to wait 25 years, however. Plaintiffs allege that defendants and the doctors will agree that after five years, the doctors may exercise an option to require defendants to repurchase the building and land lease under an agreement, detailed by plaintiffs, which will result in the doctors receiving a sum ranging from $331,000 to $911,000 plus interest over a four-year period. Meantime, the doctors will be paying rent on their allegedly below-cost leases.</p>\n<p id=\"AaN\">Plaintiffs allege that in addition to the sale and lease package described above, defendants have purchased from some of the doctors certain real property at a price that defendants knew was substantially higher than fair market value and have offered to purchase from other doctors real property, also knowingly at a price substantially higher than fair market value. Defendants have offered to assume the present medical building lease obligations of the doctors and have offered to pay the legal fees involved in setting up the organization to buy and lease back defendants\u2019 medical building. Defendants have also offered to buyout at'allegedly inflated prices partnership and stockholder interests of some of the doctors in plaintiffs\u2019 operations. <em>(Ante, </em>fn. 1.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b463-13\">Unless otherwise indicated, all references are to the Business and Professions Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b464-12\">Respondents make much of the definition of \u201cordinary channels of trade\u201d in section 17028 which refers to \u201cordinary, regular and daily transactions in the mercantile trade . . . .\u201d Nothing in the Act, however, confines its impact to such trade. The term \u201cordinary channels of trade\u201d becomes relevant only in two situations: (1) To establish costs (\u00a7\u00a7 17027, 17077); and, (2) To define certain irrelevant exclusions from the Act.

If defendant\u2019s restrictive reading of the Act\u2019s definitions is correct, the only \u201cvendors\u201d to which it applies are artisans; to violate it, one would have to be an artisan who works on other people\u2019s personal property and who sells \u201cat less than the cost\u201d to himself.</p>\n<p id=\"Al_\">Further proof that the statutory definitions were not meant to be exclusive lies in the statutory exception for \u201cMotion picture films when licensed for exhibition to motion picture houses . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 17024.)

We find it unnecessary to do so, but will point out that historically \u201cthing\u201d is an all-encompassing definition, comprising every kind of property, real and personal. Thus, Blackstone writes: \u201cThe objects of dominion or property are <em>things, </em>as contradistinguished from <em>persons: </em>and things are by the law of England distributed into two kinds: things <em>real, </em>and things <em>personal. </em>Things real are such as are permanent, fixed, and immovable, which cannot be carried out of their place; as lands and tenements: things personal are goods, money and all other moveables; which may attend the owner\u2019s person wherever he thinks proper to go.\u201d (Book 2, ch. 2, \u00a7 15. Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"AkX\">More to the point, the term \u201cthing of value\u201d has been even more broadly interpreted. In California it has been applied to deeds of trust <em>(Coulter </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>71 Cal.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>381, 385 [235 P. 465]), the cancellation of county taxes <em>(City of Ojai </em>v. <em>Chaffee, </em>60 Cal.App.2d 54, 59 [140 P.2d 116]) and classified advertisements <em>(Independent Journal Newspapers </em>v. <em>United Western Newspapers, Inc., </em>15 Cal.App.3d 583, 586, fn. 3 [93 Cal.Rptr. 299]). In other jurisdictions, such diverse matters as worthless checks <em>(McCormick </em>v. <em>State </em>(Fla.App. 1964) 161 So.2d 696, 698), waivers of mechanics liens <em>(Beasley </em>v. <em>People </em>(1969) 168 Colo. 286, 287 [450 P.2d 658]), mortgage participating certificates <em>(Stauss </em>v. <em>Title Guarantee &amp; Trust Co. </em>(1940) 284 N.Y. 41, 46 [29 N.E.2d 462]), a woman\u2019s chastity <em>(Phillips </em>v. <em>State </em>(Okla.

S. &amp; Can. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1965) 237 F.Supp. 457, 463) have been found to be \u201cthings of value.\u201d There appears to be no historical reason why the bundles of rights, privileges, powers and immunities (Rest., Property, \u00a7\u00a7 1-5) which characterize interests in real property of one kind or another, are not \u201cthings of value.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b467-8\">We need not and therefore do not decide the correctness of the trial court\u2019s unarticulated premise that \u201cpure\u201d lease agreements\u2014those which do not involve the furnishing of any service by the lessor\u2014are not covered by the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Even if the value of the services offered by respondents is only 5 percent of the value of the total package, it seems clear that in a competitive market a \u201cvendor\u201d who has financial resources that enable him to absorb a temporary loss by offering the services below their cost may effectively destroy competition by doing so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b468-11\">Cf. <em>Price </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., </em>2 Cal.3d 245, 252, footnote 7 [85 Cal.Rptr. 178, 466 P.2d 722].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b468-12\">These definitions are contained generally in sections 17026, 17027, and 17029 of the Act.
