While a summary denial of an application for pretrial writ review does not operate as the law of the case <em>(People </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>9 Cal.3d 717, 720, fn. 3 [108 Cal.Rptr. 835, 511 P.2d 1187]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Medina, </em>6 Cal.3d 484, 492 [99 Cal.Rptr. 630, 492 P.2d 686]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Conley, </em>21 Cal.App.3d 894, 898 [98 Cal.Rptr. 869]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Werber, </em>19 Cal.App.3d 598, 602 [97 Cal.Rptr. 150]), a written opinion of the court demonstrating full consideration of the issue on its merits does invoke the doctrine of the law of the case. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Medina, supra; People </em>v. <em>Conley, supra; People </em>v. <em>Werber, supra.) </em>However, the doctrine of res judicata does not attach to give conclusive effect upon appeal and consequently application of the law of the case doctrine is to be declined by the appellate court \u201c \u2018where its application will result in an unjust decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Medina, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">In the instant case this court, by written opinion stating its reasons, on the merits, fully considered the identical issues in <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Saucedo) supra </em>(4 Civ. 13243). <em>In </em>that <em>opinion </em>we considered the applicable authorities in detail and there has been no substantive change in the law since the filing of that opinion (Oct. 11, 1973) which could operate to effect a different result. That opinion has long since become final. Hearing was denied by the Supreme Court. Defendant was represented by counsel and an extensive return was filed by him. In addition we had before us the entire record of the Penal Code section 1538.5 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Under these circumstances we find that application of the doctrine of the law of the case will <em>not </em>result in an unjust decision. We, therefore, apply that doctrine and affirm the judgment. No other issues have been presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
