The order adjudging petitioner in contempt states that petitioner wilfully stated to the court that he had instructed and was instructing his client not to provide the handwriting exemplars ordered by the court. Petitioner\u2019s conduct in advising his client to violate a lawful order of the court constituted a violation of petitioner\u2019s duty to \u201cmaintain the respect due to the courts of justice and judicial officers\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6068, subd.

Hawk, attorney for the defendant and contemner herein, did ask the following question: \u2018Now, he [the prosecutor] made some reference to a psychologist being here, and this man sitting here, his name is Harvey Ross from Los Angeles. He is a psychologist. Do you have any objection to someone coming up from Los Angeles for a couple <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>of days free of charge to Mr. Corona to help Mr. Corona select a jury because he believes Mr. Corona is innocent?\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The court found the contemner\u2019s references to the appearance of the psychologist at no cost to the defendant and to the psychologist\u2019s belief in the defendant\u2019s innocence constituted improper and prejudicial attempts to influence prospective jurors in violation of the professional ethics of contemner as an attorney at law, and an improper interference with the administration of justice and the trial of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">It is unprofessional conduct for a lawyer knowingly and for the purpose of bringing inadmissible matter to the attention of the judge or jury, to offer inadmissible evidence, ask legally objectionable questions, or make other impermissible comments or arguments in the presence of the judge or jury (Standard 7.5(b) of the American Bar Association Standards Relating to the Defense Function (hereafter ABA Standards-Defense Function)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\"> Petitioner contends, however, that \u201cno showing was made that there had been any prior order not to make <em>the statement in question, </em>or even any prior order cautioning Mr. Hawk about potentially improper comment.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Italics added.)  Petitioner\u2019s contention cannot be sustained. The People have provided us with a copy of the court\u2019s minute order of September 13, 1972, entered two days before the contempt, which reveals that on that date in chambers the court admonished Mr. Hawk about certain <em>voir dire </em>of the prospective jurors and warned him of the possibility of contempt if he persisted along those lines.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>An attorney should not assert his <em>personal belief </em>in his Ghent\u2019s innocence or the justice of his cause (1 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed.) Attorneys, \u00a7 239, p. 250). This rule has been codified (Rule DR 7-106 (C)(4), CPR of ABA). Counsel who asserts the personal belief of <em>another </em>in his client\u2019s innocence circumvents the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">A court has power to restrict examination that .is designed for partisan advantage rather than for the elimination of an unqualified juror <em>(People </em>v. <em>Crowe </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 815, 828 [106 Cal.Rptr. 369, 506 P.2d 193]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Semone </em>(1934) 140 Cal.App. 318, 326 [35 P.2d 379]). Petitioner\u2019s persistence in interjecting prejudicial comments into the <em>voir dire </em>examination, after having been warned by the court to refrain from so doing, constituted a contempt of the authority of the court (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1209, subd. 5).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"><em>Contempt No. 3: Misconduct during </em>voir dire <em>of the jury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">The judgment of contempt of court issued <em>nunc pro tunc </em>September 18, 1972, states that contemner on numerous occasions, while examining prospective jurors, stated and insinuated in certain questions asked by him that the prosecution intended to introduce into evidence photographs of a gruesome or revolting nature depicting deceased human bodies or portions thereof, which photographs contemner did further state and insinuate were not necessary to be introduced in evidence; that he, contemner would attempt to keep such photographs from being admitted into evidence; that the court had repeatedly admonished contemner that such statements and insinuations were improper; yet on September 18, 1972, during the examination of a prospective juror, contemner asked the following question: \u201cNow, understanding what our position is, do you see any reason in the world why you should look at all these gory photographs?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">The court found that the contemner\u2019s reference to the necessity of such evidence and its character constituted improper and prejudicial attempts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>to influence prospective jurors, a violation of the professional ethics of contemner as an attorney at law, and an improper interference with' the administration of justice and the trial of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">For the reasons stated in our discussion of Contempt Number' 2, and because the court had the power to restrict the examination of jurors within reasonable bounds, petitioner\u2019s persistence in interjecting prejudicial comments into the <em>voir dire </em>examination, after having been warned by the court to refrain from so doing, constituted a contempt of the authority of the court (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1209, subd. 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\"><em>Contempt No. 4: Misconduct during </em>voir dire <em>of the jury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The judgment of contempt of court issued <em>nunc pro tunc </em>September 20, 1972, states that following the examination of a prospective juror, and after the prosecution had peremptorily challenged another prospective juror, and after repeated admonishments not to attempt to influence prospective jurors by the interjection of prejudicial comments into the jury selection proceedings, petitioner made the following statement: \u201cYour Honor, for the record, I want to say that they passed that woman one time and now they exercise their peremptory challenge; and to me that\u2019s an act of absolute white racism. I would like the record to . show that the District Attorney is trying to systematically exclude minority groups. He excluded Mrs. Bailey because her husband is black; and now he excludes Mrs. Jackson, who is black also. I think it is improper.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">The court found that the contemner\u2019s references to white racism and systematic exclusion of minority groups from the jury constituted improper and prejudicial attempts to influence prospective jurors, a violation of the professional ethics of contemner as an attorney at law, and an improper interference with the administration of justice and the trial of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">Although <em>jurors </em>may properly be interrogated upon the subject of racial prejudice <em>(Ham </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>409 U.S. 524 [35 L.Ed.2d 46, 93 S.Ct. 848]), petitioner\u2019s reference to the prosecution\u2019s lawful exercise of a peremptory challenge as an \u201cact of absolute white racism,\u201d after repeated admonishments by the court not to attempt to influence prospective jurors by the interjection of prejudicial comments into the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>selection proceedings, constituted a contempt of the authority of the court (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1209, subd. 5).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">\n<em>Contempt No. 5: Referring in his opening statement to two heart attacks suffered by the defendant \u201cas the result of his arrest and incarceration.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The judgment of contempt of court issued <em>mine pro tunc </em>October 3, 1972, shows that contemner, on numerous occasions, while examining prospective jurors, insinuated in certain questions asked by him that the defendant had been treated improperly and unfairly by the officers who arrested him; that the court had repeatedly admonished contemner that said statements and insinuations were improper; that, nevertheless, in his opening statement for defendant, contemner did state \u201cI would expect the county doctor to testify that Juan Corona suffered two heart attacks as the result of his arrest and incarceration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The court found that contemner\u2019s reference to the heart attacks was an effort to create sympathy in the minds of the jury for defendant and to create a prejudice against the prosecution, and that the reference constituted an improper and prejudicial attempt to influence the jurors at the trial of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">In his opening statement a lawyer should confine his remarks to a brief statement of the issues in the case and evidence he intends to offer which he believes in good faith will be available and admissible. It is unprofessional conduct to allude to any evidence unless there is a good faith and reasonable basis for believing such evidence will be tendered and admitted in evidence (Standard 7.4 ABA Standards-Defense Function).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">At the contempt proceedings in chambers, petitioner related to the court that he expected to introduce medical testimony that the defendant had suffered a heart attack \u201cas a result of the accusation, being incarcerated\u2014at least there will be medical evidence before the jury that a man who suffers a heart attack from being in custody would certainly have suffered a heart attack from digging 25 graves. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>It appears to us that petitioner was referring to evidence which he believed in good faith would be available and admissible, and thus we find it difficult to adopt the court\u2019s characterization of the statement as an \u201cinsinuation that the officers who arrested the defendant had treated him improperly and unfairly,\u201d made in defiance of an admonition that such insinuations were improper. We conclude, therefore, that the evidence does not support this charge of contempt and that the judgment of contempt in this instance must be annulled.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\n<em>Contempt No. 6: Referring to his client by his first name and making reference to his friendship for his client.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The judgment of contempt of court issued <em>nunc pro tunc </em>October 3, 1972, shows that contemner, while examining prospective jurors, on numerous occasions referred to the defendant by his first name and on various occasions referred to his friendship for his client; that by such references contemner intended to, and did, imply to the jury that he vouched for the character of his client; that the court repeatedly admonished contemner that said appellation and references were improper; that, nevertheless, while making the defendant\u2019s opening statement to the jury, contemner referred to his client as \u201cJuan\u201d and engaged in the following colloquy: \u201cMr. Hawk: Okay. Let me tell you about the man that I smuggled cupcakes into his cell up in Yuba City on his birthday in February of 1971 contrary to the Sheriff\u2019s office regulations about bringing in foodstuffs, which I did anyway. The Court: Mark the record for me, please, Mr. Reporter. Mr. Hawk: Let me tell you about Juan, the Christian. Mr. Williams . . .: Objection. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The court found that contemner\u2019s continual references to his friendship and affection for the defendant constituted improper and prejudicial attempts to influence the jurors, a violation of the professional ethics of contemner as an attorney at law, and an improper interference with the administration of justice in the trial of the case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>As an officer of the court the lawyer should support the authority of the court and the dignity of the trial courtroom by strict adherence to the rules of decorum and by manifesting an attitude of professional respect toward the judge, opposing counsel, witnesses and jurors (Standard 7.1(a), ABA Standards-Defense Function).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">A court has authority to control courtroom conduct of an attorney that is in flagrant disregard of elementary standards of proper conduct and to temper his speech in order \u201cto insure that courts of law accomplish that for which they were created\u2014dispensing justice in a reasonable, efficient and fair manner.\u201d <em>(In re Buckley, supra, </em>pp. 253, 254, fns. 21, 22). The record discloses that petitioner stubbornly defied the court\u2019s order to refrain from calling his client by his first name and from making references to his friendship for his client.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Petitioner\u2019s conduct, following numerous warnings, constituted a contempt of the authority of the court (Code Civ.

Proc., \u00a7 1209, subd. 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\n<em>Contempt No. 8: Making reference in his opening statement to his friendship with Judge Richard Arnason.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">The judgment of contempt of court issued <em>nunc pro tunc </em>October 5, 1972, states that contemner, while making the defendant\u2019s opening statement, made the following statement: \u201c \u2018It is something that I got from Richard Arnason who was a judge in Martinez. You may recall this, as he was the presiding judge in the Angela Davis trial. He is an old friend of mine.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">The judge found that contemner, by said reference, intended to, and did, imply to the jury that Judge Richard Arnason did vouch for the character and integrity of contemner, and that the statement constituted contemptuous and insolent behavior and prejudicial misconduct on the part of the contemner.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">We have concluded that this judgment of contempt must be annulled. The language used was wholly innocuous and did not constitute contemptuous and insolent behavior toward Judge Patton, the judge conducting the trial, within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 1209, subdivision 1. Further, the order of contempt contains no <em>finding </em>that petitioner disobeyed any previous court order or warning with respect to such conduct, so as to constitute contempt under subdivision 5 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>section 1209 <em>(In re Hollinan </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1179, 1184 [81 Cal.Rptr. 1, 459 P.2d 255]; <em>In re Buckley, supra, </em>p. 250).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\n<em>Contempt No. 9: Humiliation of a witness.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The judgment of contempt of court issued <em>nunc pro tunc </em>October 5, 1972, shows that on that date petitioner, after having been admonished to refrain from interjecting into his examination statements, comments and observations, while cross-examining a prosecution witness engaged in the following colloquy: \u201cMr. Hawk: \u2018Have you ever done any flying\u2019? [The Witness]: \u2018No.\u2019 Mr. Hawk: 1 recommend that you don\u2019t.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The court found that the question and statement, each of which referred to the witness\u2019s alleged inability to determine directions on an exhibit at the trial, constituted contemptuous and insolent behavior and prejudicial misconduct on the part of the contemner.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">A court - has a duty to exercise reasonable control over the mode of interrogation of a witness (Evid. Code, \u00a7 765). The interrogation of all witnesses should be conducted fairly, objectively and with due regard for the dignity and legitimate privacy of the witness, and without seeking to intimidate or humiliate the witness unnecessarily. Proper cross-examination can be conducted without violating rules of decorum (Standard 7.6(a), ABA Standards-Defense Function).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Petitioner\u2019s conduct toward the witness did not constitute legitimate cross-examination and justified the interposition of the court <em>(People </em>v. <em>Durrant </em>(1897) 116 Cal. 179, 212 [48 P. 75]; Evid.

Considered in connection with all the surrounding circumstances <em>(In re Buckley, supra, </em>p. 250,. fn. 16), and following a prior warning, petitioner\u2019s conduct in cross-examining this witness constituted a contempt of the authority of the court <em>(In re Hallinan, supra </em>at pp. 1184-1185; Code Civ.

It was unprofessional conduct for petitioner to state, in the presence of the jury, that the prosecutor had a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt (Standard 7.5(b), ABA Standards-Defense Function). Conduct such as this could only have the purpose of inflaming the jury or causing the trial judge to declare a mistrial. \u201cWhere such a course of conduct is involved, no admonition that it is wrong is required as a prerequisite to a finding of contempt. A lawyer admitted to practice must be held already to know that such flagrant misconduct is improper.\u201d <em>(DeGeorge </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>40 Cal.App.3d 305, 315).

He lives at the Yuba City Jail. Mr. Williams: I will object. That\u2019s improper. Mr. Hawk: I can't show where he lives? The Court: That [sic] is the purpose of it, to show what?

I am entitled to show that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The court found that the statements by contemner were made with the object of bringing the criminal record of the witness to the attention of the jury for the purpose of affecting the credibility of the witness in the eyes of the jury, the contemner knowing that his statements and proposed inquiry were not a proper means to impeach the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">In appearing in his professional capacity before a tribunal, a lawyer shall not intentionally or habitually violate any established rule of procedure or of evidence (DR 7-106 (C)(7), CPA of ABA). (17) The deliberate asking of questions calling for inadmissible and prejudicial answers is misconduct <em>{People </em>v. <em>Fusaro </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 877, 886, [96 Cal.Rptr. 368], cert. den., 407 U.S. 912 [32 L.Ed.2d 686, 92 S.Ct. 2445]).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Section 787 of the Evidence Code expressly precludes attacking a witness\u2019 credibility by showing prior <em>arrests </em>for misdemeanors or felonies, or prior misdemeanor convictions <em>(Grudt </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1970) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>2 Cal.3d 575, 591 [86 Cal.Rptr. 465, 468 P.2d 825]). A witness may be impeached, however, by showing that he has been convicted of a felony (Evid. Code, \u00a7 788). The proof must show <em>conviction </em>of a <em>felony, </em>not a misdemeanor (Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed.) \u00a7 1244, p. 1147).  Questions designed to bring before a jury the fact that a witness who has not been convicted of a felony is residing in jail evade the rule by indirection and are highly improper <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sutton </em>(1964) 231 Cal.App.2d 511, 514 [41 Cal.Rptr. 912]).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">The record discloses that petitioner questioned a witness in a manner designed to bring before the jury evidence that was inadmissible under Evidence Code section 787. Petitioner\u2019s conduct, in violation of established rules of procedure and of evidence, was highly improper and, following a prior warning of the court, constituted a contempt of the authority of the court (Code Civ.

Fahey, one of the opposing counsel, as follows: \u201cI am sorry if I offended the high-priced lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">In appearing in his professional capacity before a tribunal, a lawyer shall not engage in undignified or discourteous conduct which is degrading to a tribunal (DR 7-106 (C)(6), CPR of ABA).

In <em>Buckley, </em>however, our Supreme Court concluded that <em>Mayberry </em>did not apply because (1) unlike <em>Mayberry, </em>the trial court did not wait to adjudge petitioner in contempt, but immediately cited him and soon thereafter signed the order of commitment, and (2) the attack there did not consist,of \u201cfighting words\u201d which the court found in <em>Mayberry </em>carried such a potential for bias as to require disqualification <em>(In re Buckley, supra, </em>at p. 256).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In this case, unlike <em>Mayberry, </em>where the defendant was sentenced for each of eleven contempts after the trial ended, and unlike <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Hayes </em>(1974) 418 U.S. 488, 490 [41 L.Ed.2d 897, 903, 94 S.Ct. 2697], where the trial judge postponed final adjudication and sentence of nine contempts until after the conclusion of trial, the trial judge did not wait until the end of the trial to adjudicate petitioner in contempt. Instead, the trial judge dealt with each contempt as a discrete and separate matter at a different point during the trial. In each instance, the trial judge conducted contempt proceedings in chambers following the allegedly contemptuous conduct, where petitioner was given an opportunity to be heard in defense or mitigation, and where petitioner was convicted and sentenced, with execution of the sentence suspended until such time as the jury was discharged, a procedure approved in <em>People </em>v. <em>Fusaro, supra, </em>18 Cal.App.3d at pages 888-891, and in <em>In re Grossman, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.3d at pages 628-629.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">In <em>Codispoti </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania </em>(1974) 418 U.S. 506, 513 [41 L.Ed.2d 912, 920, 94 S.Ct. 2687] the court recognized that \u201cThere are recurring situations where the trial judge, to maintain order in the courtroom and the integrity of the trial process in the face of an \u2018actual obstruction of justice,\u2019 [citations]\u201d must necessarily convict and sentence the accused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>or the attorneys for either side for various acts of contempt as they occur. The court noted, moreover, that a judge, when faced with the kind of conduct at issue in <em>Mayberry, </em>\u201c \u2018could, with propriety, have instantly acted, holding petitioner in contempt . . . .\u2019 <em>[Mayberry </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, supra] </em>400 U.S., at 463.\u201d (418 U.S. at pp. 514-515 [41 L.Ed.2d at p. 921].)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The record discloses, however, that petitioner at no time engaged in the kind of personal attack on the judge that, regardless of his reaction or lack of it, he would be unlikely \u201cto maintain that calm detachment necessary for fair adjudication.\u201d <em>(Mayberry </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, supra, </em>400 U.S. at p. 465 [27 L.Ed.2d at p. 540]; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Hayes, supra, </em>418 U.S. at p. 501 [41 L.Ed.2d at p. 909].) In <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Hayes, supra, </em>however, it xvas held that \u201ccontemptuous conduct, though short of personal attack, may still provoke a trial judge and so embroil him in controversy that he cannot \u2018hold the balance nice, clear and true between the State and the accused . . . .\u2019 <em>Tumey </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>273 U.S. 510, 532 (1927).\u201d The court stated that \u201cIn making this ultimate judgment, the inquiry must be not only whether there was actual bias on respondent\u2019s part, but' also whether there was \u2018such a likelihood of bias or an appearance of bias that the judge was unable to hold the balance between vindicating the interests of the court and the interests of the accused.\u2019 <em>Ungar </em>v. <em>Sarafite, </em>376 U.S. 575, 588 (1964). \u2018Such a stringent rule may sometimes bar trial by judges who have no actual bias and who would do their very best to weigh the scales of justice equally between contending parties,\u2019 but due process of law requires no less. <em>In re Murchison, </em>349 U.S. 133, 136 (1955).\u201d (418 U.S. at p. 501 [41 L.Ed.2d at p. 909].) We note that in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Hayes </em>it was not petitioner\u2019s conduct, considered alone, that required recusal; rather, the critical factor was the <em>character of respondent\u2019s response to misbehavior during the course of the trial. </em>(418 U.S. at p. 503, fn. 10 [41 L.Ed.2d at p. 910].)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">With these considerations in mind, we have examined the record in this case. In light of all the circumstances shown, we are unable to characterize the judge\u2019s response to petitioner\u2019s behavior during the course of the trial as approaching the aggravated type of response found to exist in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Hayes, supra </em>(418 U.S. p. 501 [41 L.Ed.2d pp. 909-910]), or in <em>Offutt v. United States </em>(1954) 348 U.S. 11, at pages 15-17 [99 L.Ed. 11, at pages 16-18, 75 S.Ct. 11], Unquestionably, in the course of a trial of four months, the trial judge on occasion expressed irritation with petitioner.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> However, as in <em>DeGeorge </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>\u201cmost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>of the trial judge\u2019s irritation was expressed not in relation to petitioner\u2019s conduct, which was disrespectful, but rather in response to petitioner\u2019s misconduct in seeking an unfair advantage over his opponent.\u201d (40 Cal.

Nor need we examine the judgments of contempt of court entered <em>nunc pro tunc </em>November 16, 21, 27, and December 21, 1972, for the court, after ordering petitioner remanded to the custody of the sheriff to serve 54 days in the county jail for contempts Nos. 1 through 14, ordered petitioner purged of the last four contempts and dismissed said judgments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b128-8\">The court also adjudged defendant Corona in contempt of court for his conduct in refusing to provide the exemplars and imposed a fine of $300, deferring execution thereon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Rule 1 of the Rules of Professional Conduct of the State Bar of California reads as follows: \u201cThe specification in these rules of certain conduct as unprofessional is not to be interpreted as an approval of conduct not specifically mentioned. <em>In that connecr tion the Code of Professional Responsibility of the American Bar Association should be noted by the members of the State Bar.\" </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b129-8\">An attorney who wilfully disobeys or violates an order of the court requiring him to do or forbear an act connected with or in the course of his profession, which he ought in good faith to do or forbear, is also subject to disbarment or suspension (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6103).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b130-7\">The term \u201cunprofessional conduct\u201d denotes conduct which it is recommended be made subject to disciplinary sanctions (Standard 1.1(f), ABA Standards-Defense Function).

The obvious intent of which would be to inject extraneous matters into the record, to make statements of fact which have an obvious purpose solely to influence the prospective jurors, contains two particularly objectionable aspects. One, the reference to \u2018free of charge.\u2019 And second, that this psychologist \u2018believes that\u2019 your client is innocent.

Mr. Hawk: That is the way I put it. The Court: It went way beyond anything necessary to protect any record in this case. It is just another inflammatory remark.

It is contemptuous, far out of line. It is ridiculous. Mr. Hawk: I apologize for it. I don\u2019t know whether the Court believes me, but I do have an affection for Juan Corona, but it was not the thing to say in an opening statement. The Court: The Court finds you in contempt. Five days in the County Jail. This is outrageous. You persist in this sort of conduct and you talk about your affection for Mr. Corona. In this opening statement you alluded to your friendship which I admonished you before about. It is not proper. All you are intending to do by this, regardless of what your personal feelings may be, it insinuates that you are vouching for your client\u2019s credibility and it is not a professional way to do it. It is clearly improper. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b135-7\">In chambers, during <em>voir dire </em>of the jurors, the court issued the following warning: \u201cI want to warn you for the last time, that one other subtle insinuation which you are continuing to persist in, and that is your continuing to vouch for Mr. Corona by reference to your friendship for him. If that slips out once more you will be back for sentence for the same thing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b135-8\">It has been held that in instances of direct contempt an apology to the judge should be given serious consideration <em>(In re Buckley, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 237, 257). \u201cA judge should bear in mind that he is engaged, not so much in vindicating his own character, as in promoting the respect due to the administration of the laws; and this consideration should induce him to receive as satisfactory any reasonable apology for an offender\u2019s conduct\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1850) 1 Cal. 152, 153). The effect to be given to such a mitigating factor, however, lies exclusively in the sound discretion of the judge <em>(In re Buckley, supra, </em>p. 257; <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1955) 43 Cal.2d 755, 763 [278 P.2d 681]; <em>City of Vernon </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1952) 38 Cal.2d 509, 520 [241 P.2d 243]; <em>In re Friday </em>(1934) 138 Cal.App. 660, 664 [32 P.2d 1117]). It seems apparent from the colloquy set forth in footnote 13, <em>ante, </em>that the judge could not accept the apology as satisfactory in view of the prior admonishment. Consequently, it cannot be said that the trial judge abused his discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b137-9\">For the guidance of the trial bench we point out that in case of direct contempt, the order adjudging a person guilty must be stated with sufficient particularity, description and detail to show without aid of speculation or reference to any extrinsic document that a contempt actually occurred. <em>(Raiden </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1949) 34 Cal.2d 83, 86 [206 P.2d 1081].)</p>\n<p id=\"AQK\">The judge, therefore, must draw the order with meticulous care and should not delegate the draftsmanship to counsel or depend upon the clerk, no matter how experienced, to incorporate it into the minutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\">The \u201cbounds of the law\u201d include disciplinary rules and enforceable professional obligations. The disciplinary rules, which state the minimum level of conduct below which no lawyer can fall without being subject to disciplinary action, are mandatory in character.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b139-11\">The prosecutor admitted in chambers that he had made such a statement (see CPR of ABA, DR 7-103 (A) and (B) with respect to duties of public prosecutors). Nevertheless, despite a motion for mistrial on the part of the prosecution and a motion to dismiss by the defense, the court directed that the trial proceed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b141-9\">The \u201crap sheet\u201d of this witness, belatedly produced by the prosecution in compliance with a discovery order (see <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 812 [112 Cal.Rptr. 257, 518 P.2d 1353]), showed that the witness had been, in. fact, convicted of a felony. It is clear from the record, however, that petitioner was not prepared to prove the felony conviction at the time he was cross-examining the witness, and was in fact attempting to bring a misdemeanor conviction to the attention of the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b141-10\">Upon admission to the California State Bar, petitioner took an oath \u201cfaithfully to discharge the duties of any attorney at law to the best of his knowledge and ability\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6067).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b142-11\">The disclaimer of an intent to commit contempt is no defense where a contempt clearly appears from the circumstances constituting the act <em>(City of Vernon </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>38 Cal.2d at p. 518).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b144-6\">In chambers, in admonishing petitioner for his misconduct, the judge portrayed petitioner\u2019s behavior .on various occasions as \u201cshocking,\u201d \u201coutrageous,\u201d \u201cdisgraceful,\u201d and a \u201cdisgrace to the administration of justice.\u201d \"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The judge, of course, had the obligation to maintain order and decorum in the proceedings before him (Canon 3 A(2), Canons of Judicial Ethics of the American Bar Association), and the power to punish any contempt in order to protect the rights of the defendant and the interests of the public by assuring that the administration of criminal justice shall not be thwarted (Standard 7.1, ABA Standards Relating to the Function of the Trial Judge; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Haldeen </em>(1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 478, 483 [73 Cal.Rptr. 102]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Petitioner himself asserts that none of his actions were \u201cDisorderly, contemptuous, or insolent . . . <em>toward the judge\u201d </em>(italics added) within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 1209, subdivision 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b145-8\">A contempt charged under the provisions of section 1209 of the Code of Civil Procedure is a petty offense and petitioner had no federal constitutional right to a jury trial <em>(In re Morelli </em>(1970) 11 Cal.App.3d 819, 850 [91 Cal.Rptr. 72]; <em>Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1968) 265 Cal.App.2d 370, 375 [72 Cal.Rptr. 177]; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Hayes, supra, </em>418 U.S. at p. 495 [41 L.Ed.2d at p. 905]). Where separate contemptuous acts are committed, the contemner may be punished for each separate offense <em>(Donovan </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 848, 855 [250 P.2d 246]). And where the trial court has jurisdiction, a sentence imposing punishment within the statutory limits for each offense will not be disturbed by a reviewing court <em>(In re Karpf </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 355, 374 [88 Cal.Rptr. 895]). None of the individual citations for contempt carried a penalty of more than five days in jail and a $500 fine. Thus, each fell within the \u201cpetty\u201d classification.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
