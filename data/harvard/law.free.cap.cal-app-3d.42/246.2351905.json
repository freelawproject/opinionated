Hinson was injured on January 5, 1973, when his pickup collided with another vehicle on Highway 33 as he was driving to work. For the reasons hereafter expressed, we hold there is substantial evidence to support the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">The facts pertaining to Hinson\u2019s employment as gleaned from a sparse record are as follows: Hinson drove a tractor and did maintenance work on tomato pickers on a large ranch operated by Giffen, Inc. He reported for work at 6 a.m. at a headquarters shop on the ranch which was located approximately two miles from his home and was paid on an hourly basis from the time he reported to work. The employer had a pickup available which the foreman would use to take the tractor drivers to the fields and to return them to the shop at the end of the day\u2019s work. However, at times, Hinson and the other drivers would use their own cars to get to the fields if they had driven them to work. Hinson testified that the foreman would \u201crather\u201d that the employees take their own cars to the tractors, thus avoiding the necessity of his having to take them to and from the fields. Hinson also testified that the use of his own car saved him a trip back to the shop after he finished work in the fields; if he had his own car he could go directly home from where his tractor was located. He said, however, that he did not take his own car to the fields if the foreman didn\u2019t ask him to.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hinson\u2019s employer did not pay him for any of the mileage he drove in his own car nor did he pay him for gas or oil he used.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Hinson kept six to ten wrenches of different sizes in his pickup which he used on the job. The wrenches were carried by hand with a chain through them and kept on the tractor during his working hours. Hinson took the tools home each night in his car to keep them from being stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Our Supreme Court has observed that the tension underlying the so-called \u201cgoing and coming rule\u201d is generated by the legitimate interests of the employer to be immune from liability for the employee\u2019s injury or death that occurs in the everyday transit from home to work, and the valid competing interests of the employee for protection where the accident occurs in nonroutine transit, or where the employee uses a means of transportation undertaken for his employer\u2019s benefit. <em>(Hinojosa </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., </em>8 Cal.3d 150, 156-157 [104 Cal.Rptr. 456, 501 P.2d 1176].) The court said: \u201cWe think a careful analysis of the decisions will develop the formula that reconciles the divergent positions. . . . The decisions [exclude] the ordinary, local commute that marks the daily transit of the mass of workers to and from their jobs; the employment, there, plays no special role in the requisites of portage except the normal need of the presence of the person for the performance of the work. . . . On the other hand, many situations do not involve local commutes en-route to fixed places of business at fixed hours. <em>These are the extraordinary transits that vary from the norm because the employer requires a special, different transit, means of transit, or use of a car, for some particular reason of his own. </em>When the employer gains that kind of a particular advantage, the job does more than call for routine transport to it; it plays a different role, bestowing a special benefit upon the employer by reason of the extraordinary circumstances. <em>The employer\u2019s special request, his imposition of an unusual condition, removes the transit from the employee\u2019s choice or convenience and places it within the ambit of the employer\u2019s choice or convenience, restoring the employer-employee relationship.\u201d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>(Italics added.) <em>(Hinojosa, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at p. 157.) Mr. Hinojosa worked as a farm laborer on seven or eight noncontiguous ranches operated by his employer. While he was enroute home after leaving work the car in which he was a passenger collided with another vehicle causing him injuries for which he sought workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. In holding that the injury to Hinojosa was compensable as not within the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule, the court observed that to get from one field to another within the work day required the use of automotive transportation and it was directly to the employer\u2019s benefit that Hinojosa furnish his own transportation <em>since the employer did not furnish it himself. </em>The court stated, \u201cAlthough . . . the requirement for the car was implicit rather than express, the use of a vehicle can be \u2018an implied or express condition of . . . employment.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (8 Cal.3d at p. 161.)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Unlike Hinojosa, Mr. Hinson was not required to furnish his own transportation from the shop to the fields; his employer made available a company pickup to transport him to his tractor. Thus, it cannot be said that Hinson\u2019s use of his own car was a condition of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Hinson contends, however, that because the foreman would \u201crather\u201d that the drivers take their cars to the fields if they had driven them to work on a particular day, we are compelled to find that the use of his car was an implied requirement of the job. He argues in essence that this expression of preference on the part of the foreman mandated the use of his own car, thus conferring a special benefit on the employer and extending the employment relationship to the daily transit to and from his home. We believe, however, that this testimony, at best, raises a factual question as to whether the employees were required to use their own cars; Hinson\u2019s other testimony shows that the company pickup was available to take the drivers to the fields if they didn\u2019t bring their cars to work, and the employees preferred to take their cars to the fields to avoid having to return to the shop after completing the day\u2019s work. From the latter evidence, a reasonable inference may be drawn that the employees\u2019 use of their cars on the job arose as a matter of convenience to all concerned, rather than at the employer\u2019s request and for its particular advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">We read <em>Hinojosa </em>to mean that an injury occurring during a particular transit from the home to the job is compensable when the transportation is ac\u00e9omplished by means imposed either as a condition of employment, such as the requirement that the employee use his own car during working hours, or that he use his own car at the special request of or as an accommodation to his employer. A practice adopted for the mutual convenience of the employer and the employee and left to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>discretion of the employee (if he didn\u2019t want to take his car to the field he would be taken in the company pickup), does not rise to the status of a requirement of employment, nor does it establish such a \u201cspecial\u201d advantage to the employer as to extend the employer-employee relationship to the regular commute from the home to the place of work. (See <em>Hinojosa, supra, </em>8 Cal.3d at p. 159.)</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">Nor does the fact that Hinson took his tools home every night make the use of his car a condition of his employment or constitute such a special advantage or service to his employer as to extend the employment relation off of the job site. The taking of the tools home each night was for Hinson\u2019s personal benefit and convenience and, thus, was merely incidental to his employment. (Cf. <em>Eby </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>75 Cal.App. 280, 282 [242 P. 401]; see also 8 Schneider\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 1739, pp. 203-207.)</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">We emphasize that in reviewing a decision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board we may not redetermine factual questions decided on the basis of substantial evidence. (Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 5952-5953; <em>Granco Steel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd., </em>68 Cal.2d 191, 196 [65 Cal.Rptr. 287, 436 P.2d 287].)  While the question of whether Hinson was injured in the course of his employment is one of law, the subsidiary questions of whether he was required to use his own car as a condition of his employment, and whether the use of his car in going from the shop to his tractor was such a \u201cspecial\u201d circumstance as to extend the employment relationship to the daily transit from and to his home, under the record before us, are questions of fact. There is substantial evidence in the record to support the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The order of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Brown (G.
