Jiminez, Linda' Bray, and Jennie R. Jiminez as Guardian ad Litem for Edward Padilla, Angelina Padilla, Andy Padilla, Nicki Padilla, Susan Buckman and Dolores Jiminez filed a complaint in the Santa Cruz County Superior Court against State of California, County of Santa Cruz, and others for damages for the alleged wrongful death of Leo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Padilla. Plaintiff Jennie R. Jiminez is the mother of Leo, all the other plaintiffs ate either sisters or brothers of the decedent, whom it is charged drowned in the Merced River through the negligence and carelessness of the defendants. Defendants State of California and County of Santa Cruz answered, denying liability, alleging contributory negligence and assumption of risk and alleging that plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action is barred by certain sections of the Government Code. The personal defendants answered, denying liability and alleging contributory negligence and assumption of risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Defendant County of Santa Cruz filed motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">It is conceded that at the time of his drowning Leo was a juvenile under the direction and control of defendant by reason of a juvenile court placement in \u201cFrom Now On Homes for Youth,\u201d he having been declared a ward of the court as coming within the provisions of section 602 of the Juvenile Court Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The trial court found that \u201cthe action has no merit and does not present a triable issue of fact as to the defendant, County of Santa Cruz,\u201d ordered the action dismissed and judgment entered in favor of defendant County of Santa Cruz and against plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Section 844.6 of the Government Code</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">The trial court\u2019s action was based on its interpretation of that section which at the time of the drowning provided in pertinent part \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law [except as provided in certain subdivisions of the section not applicable here] \u00e1 public entity is not liable for: ... (2) An injury to any prisoner.\u201d Section 844 provides \u201cAs used in this chapter, \u2018prisoner\u2019 includes an inmate of a prison, jail or penal or correctional facility.\u201d The trial court interpreted the word \u201cprisoner\u201d in section 844.6, subdivision (a)(2), as encompassing a ward of the juvenile court declared under section 602 and under placement by that court. The question here raised has never heretofore been determined in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Section 844, in defining \u201cprisoner,\u201d uses the word \u201cincludes,\u201d indicating that the term \u201cprisoner\u201d is to be broadly interpreted. The Legislative Committee comment to that, section states \u201ca prisoner or ward of the juvenile court engaged in fire suppression would be considered a prisoner as defined by this section . . . .\u201d Likewise, the Legislative Committee comment to section 844.6 states \u201cThe immunity provided to public entities by this section prevails over all other provisions of the statute. Thus, the public entity is immune from liability for injuries to prisoners <em>(which includes wards of the juvenile court) </em>...\u201d (italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>It appears from these comments that the Legislature intended that the word \u201cprisoner\u201d included all inmates of any facility in which they were placed by the courts or law. Thus, in <em>People </em>v. <em>White </em>(1960) 177 Cal.App.2d 383 [2 Cal.Rptr. 202], the appellant was adjudged a psychopathic delinquent pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code, section 7058, and committed to Mendocino State Hospital. Later he was transferred to Atascadero State Hospital, thence to the medical facility at Vacaville and then to San Quentin prison. While there he was convicted of violation of section 4502 of the Penal Code, which prohibits a \u201cprisoner\" from having in his possession, among other objects, \u201cdirk or dagger or sharp instrument,\u201d because he had in his possession a homemade sharp knife and a file. He appealed his conviction on the ground that at the time, having been committed as a \u201cpatient\u201d he was not a \u201cprisoner\u201d within the meaning of section 4502 of the Penal Code. However, the reviewing court said \u201cA patient may also be a prisoner. The word \u2018prisoner\u2019 is defined in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary as \u2018a person under arrest, in custody or in prison; <em>one involuntarily restrained </em>. . \u201d (italics added). The court goes on, \u201cOxford Universal Dictionary defines \u2018prisoner\u2019 as: \u2018One who is kept in prison or in custody; specifically, <em>one who is in custody as the result of a legal process.\u2019 </em>[Italics added.] Ballantine Law Dictionary defines a prisoner as: \u2018A person deprived of his liberty by virtue of a judicial or other lawful process.\u2019 Thus, the significance of the word \u2018prisoner\u2019 is not the manner of commitment, but rather the fact of a judicial commitment.\u201d (Pp. 384-385.)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Certainly a ward of the juvenile court, committed to a place of custody such as a foster home, is \u201cone involuntarily restrained,\u201d \u201cone who is in custody as the result of a legal process,\u201d and one \u201cdeprived of his liberty by virtue of a judicial . . . process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1963) 222 Cal.App.2d 221 [34 Cal.Rptr. 907], a minor was committed to the youth authority after having been declared a ward of the juvenile court. He was subsequently transferred to the correctional facility at Soledad. The court, at page 226, pointed out that the defendant, although an inmate of Soledad, was still a ward of the juvenile court and that \u201che may be designated a prisoner in the sense that he was in custody as the result of a legal process.\u201d The court also held (pp. 225-226) that \u201ca person who is legally confined in a state prison is a \u2018prisoner\u2019 whether his confinement results from a criminal conviction or from a commitment stemming from a proceeding of a noncriminal nature.\u201d As stated by plaintiffs in the instant case, proceedings in the juvenile court are of a civil rather than a criminal nature. <em>(In re K. D. K., </em>269 Cal.App.2d 646, 653 [75 Cal.Rptr. 136].) However, the juvenile court has the power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>commit a ward to a placement, where he is involuntarily restrained and deprived of his liberty by judicial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">In <em>Larson </em>v. <em>City of Oakland </em>(1971) 17 Cal.App.3d 91 [94 Cal.Rptr. 466], the reviewing court in holding that the term \u201cprisoner\u201d as used in Government Code section 844.6, did not include persons temporarily detained by law officers for the purposes of investigation, reviewed some definitions of the word. \u201c \u2018A \u201cprisoner\u201d is a person deprived of his liberty by virtue of a judicial or other lawful process\u2019 (41 Am.Jur., p. 886, \u00a7 2); any person is a prisoner who is held in confinement against his will <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Curran, </em>297 F. 946); T. A person held in custody, captivity or a condition of forcible restraint, especially while on trial or serving a prison sentence\u2019 (American Heritage Dict, of the English Language (1969)); T. One who is confined in a prison or whose liberty is forcibly restrained; one held in custody; a captive; specif., in law, a person confined in a prison by virtue of an order of arrest or of a legal committal . . .\u2019 (Brit. World Lang. Ed., Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Dict.); T. One who is kept in prison or in custody; <em>spec., </em>one who is in custody as the result of a legal process, . . .\u2019 (The Oxford English Dictionary (1933)); \u2018One held in confinement against his will\u2019 (3 Bouvier\u2019s Law Dict., 3d rev. (8th ed. 1914)).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Handley </em>(1970) 11 Cal.App.3d 277 [89 Cal.Rptr. 656], the defendant was in court and was told by the judge without revoking his bail that he was \u201cin custody.\u201d The reviewing court stated (p. 283): \u201cUpon being told by the court, \u2018You are in custody. Sit down over there,\u2019 the respondent was a \u2018person deprived of his liberty by virtue of a judicial or other lawful process,\u2019 and, therefore, a \u2018prisoner\u2019 within the contemplation of Penal Code section 4532,\u201d the section dealing with escape by a person \u201cwho is in the lawful custody of any officer or person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Plaintiffs call attention to Welfare and Institutions Code section 851, which states \u201cThe juvenile hall shall not be in, or connected with, any jail or prison, and shall not be deemed to be nor be treated as a penal institution. It shall be conducted in all respects as nearly like a home as possible.\u201d Nevertheless, if a ward is placed there he is \u201ca prisoner in the sense that he was in custody as the result of a legal process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">In the Notes on page 595 of the Continuing Education of the Bar book on California Government Tort Liability it is pointed out that the definition of \u201cprisoner\u201d in section 844 \u201cis crucial for determining the scope of the immunities provided in\u201d section 844.6. \u201cThe use of the verb \u2018includes\u2019 rather than \u2018means\u2019 indicates this definition is not exhaustive, and other than the enumerated categories of \u2018prisoners\u2019 may exist. The Legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Committee Comment suggests a broad rather than a narrow interpretation . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The Notes suggest that the Legislative Committee comment to the effect that \u201cthe legislature intended wards of the juvenile courts to be classified in some circumstances as prisoners\u201d raises \u201cinterpretative problems.\u201d However, the Notes make no suggestion as to how these problems should be solved, and, in spite of plaintiffs\u2019 intimation to the contrary, set forth nothing contrary to the interpretation we are placing on sections 844 and 844.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The fact that having originally been placed as a ward Leo later was returned to the custody of his mother without, however, being released as a ward of the court, and then, because of incorrigibility, again was placed elsewhere by the court, makes him no less a \u201cprisoner\u201d in the sense important here, nor does the fact that the drowning occurred while the director of the home had taken him on a vacation trip with other inmates of the home. Leo was in the director\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The case of <em>Leroy T. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 434 [115 Cal.Rptr. 761, 525 P.2d 665] is not in point. There the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board refused to grant a juvenile court ward committed to a forestry camp injured in the course of working as a firebreaker, the workmen\u2019s compensation benefits provided by Welfare and Institutions Code section 883, part of the juvenile court law, but granted him the compensation benefits provided by Labor Code section 4458. Welfare and Institutions Code section 883, provides \u201cWhenever any boy committed to [a forestry] camp is engaged in fire prevention work or the suppression of existing fires, he shall be subject to workmen\u2019s compensation benefits to the <em>same extent as a county employee, </em>and the [county] board of supervisors shall provide and cover any such boy committed to such camp while performing such service, with accident, death and compensation insurance <em>as is otherwise regularly provided for employees of the county.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Labor Code section 4458 prescribes that adult prison inmates injured while engaged in fire suppression activities are entitled only to the minimum benefits decreed by Labor Code sections 4452-4453. It was the board\u2019s position that, in spite of the express language of section 883 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, a boy committed to a forestry camp, and hence a ward of the juvenile court, should receive prescribed compensation benefits. The Legislature must have intended that he be considered a prison inmate for compensation benefits. While the reviewing court pointed out the differences between a juvenile court ward and a prison inmate, its decision was based on its finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>section 883 was clear and meant just what it states. There is nothing in the opinion which in any way indicates that section 884.6 of the Government Code, the section with which we are dealing in the instant case, does not mean what it states, namely, that for purposes of public immunity a juvenile court ward, being an inmate of a correctional facility, is a \u201cprisoner.\u201d In <em>Leroy T., </em>the court was dealing with an attempt by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board to disregard completely a statute clear on its face, and in the case at bench we are dealing with the attempt of plaintiff to disregard a statute clear on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Taylor, P.
