They have exactly defined meanings, however. In this policy:</p>\n<p id=\"b245-19\">\u201c1. the words \u2018YOU\u2019 and \u2018YOUR\u2019 mean or refer to the policyholder first named in the attached Declarations, and include that policyholder\u2019s spouse if living in the same household.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-20\">\u201c2. the words \u2018WE,\u2019 \u2018US,\u2019 \u2018OUR,\u2019 and \u2018THE COMPANY\u2019 mean or refer to the Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-21\">\u201c3. the words \u2018THE INSURED,\u2019 \u2018AN INSURED,\u2019 and \u2018ANY INSURED\u2019 mean or refer to the persons and organizations specifically indicated as entitled to protection under the coverage being described.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-22\">\u201c4. the words \u2018YOUR AUTO\u2019 mean the vehicle or vehicles described in the attached Declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-23\">* <em>Hi</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-24\">\u201c7. the word \u2018OCCUPYING\u2019 means in, upon, entering, or alighting from a motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-25\">The insuring provisions of the Nationwide contract provide coverage against physical damage to \u201cyour auto\u201d; \u201cauto liability (for damage or injury to others caused by your auto)\u201d; \u201cmedical payments (medical expenses payable regardless of fault)\u201d; \u201cfamily compensation (medical, confinement, and death benefits, payable regardless of fault)\u201d; \u201cuninsured motorists (for bodily injury caused by uninsured motorists)\u201d; and \u201ccomprehensive family liability (for damage or injury to others from nonvehic\u00fclar causes).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-26\">By endorsement, ASCAA\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage was extended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>to cover bodily injury caused by under-insured motorists. The uninsured motorist provision provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\u201cCOVERAGE</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u201cUnder this coverage, we will pay bodily injury damages that you or your legal representative are legally entitled to recover from the owner or driver of an * * * [underinsured] motor vehicle. Damages must result from an accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the * * * [underinsured] vehicle. Bodily injury means bodily injury, sickness, disease, or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u201cRelatives living in your household also have this protection. Anyone else is protected while occupying:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">\u201c1. your auto.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">\u201c2. a motor vehicle you do not own, while it substitutes temporarily for your auto. Your auto must be out of use because of breakdown, repair, servicing, loss, or destruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">\u201c3. a four-wheel motor vehicle newly acquired by you. The coverage applies only during the first 30 days you own the vehicle, unless it replaces your auto.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">\u201c4. any other motor vehicle while it is being operated by you or a relative living in your household. However, the vehicle must not be owned or furnished to you or a relative living in your household for regular use.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">\u201cThis coverage also protects others for damages they may be legally entitled to recover because of bodily injury suffered by an insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">\u201cIn any * * * [underinsured] motorists claim, we will jointly determine with the insured or his legal representative whether there is legal right to recover damages, and if so in what amount. If agreement cannot be reached with regard to liability or amount of damages, the matter will be decided by arbitration. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">U* * jft</p>\n<p id=\"b246-14\">\u201cCOVERAGE EXCLUSIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b246-15\">\u201cThis * * * [Underinsured] Motorists insurance does not apply as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-17\">&lt;&lt;* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b246-18\">\u201c4. It does not apply to bodily injury suffered while occupying a motor vehicle owned by you or a relative living in your household, but not insured for * * * [Underinsured] Motorists coverage under this policy. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-19\">In the absence of policy declarations in the record, the parties stipulated, <em>inter alia, </em>to the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-20\">\u201c1. * * * the Akron-Summit Community Action Agency (\u2018ASCAA\u2019) was the named insured under a contract of insurance issued by the defendant, Nationwide Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-21\">* *</p>\n<p id=\"b246-22\">\u201c10. * * * [Mildred Foster\u2019s] vehicle was not furnished to Dale Gordon or the ASCAA for regular use.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-24\">&lt;&lt;* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b246-25\">\u201c12. Dale Gordon was not named as a designated driver under the auto policies issued to * * * [ASCAA].</p>\n<p id=\"b246-26\">\u201c13. * * * [Mildred Foster] * * * was not named as a driver in any of the Nationwide policies issued to ASCCA [sic].</p>\n<p id=\"b246-27\"><em>U* </em>* *</p>\n<p id=\"b246-28\">\u201c15. Dale Gordon was not a resident of the households of any of the drivers named as drivers of any of the vehicle [sic] insured by Nationwide for ASCAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-29\">\u201c16. The five vehicles insured by Nationwide for ASCCA [sic] were all operational and in use by others when this accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-30\">\u201c17. Each driver for the ASCCA [sic] was listed by name for the vehicle they [sic] were going to drive under a category which stated \u2018List Each Drive [sic] in Household.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-31\">No list of designated drivers or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>named vehicles was made a part of the insurance policy or otherwise incorporated by reference into the policy. Nor do the stipulations or any other declaration indicate what significance, if any, was to be given the fact that Dale Gordon was not named as a designated driver under the auto policies and that each driver for ASCAA was \u201clisted by name for the vehicle they [sic] were going to drive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Nationwide argues that we should interpret the stipulations to mean that only those drivers who were listed by name for the specific vehicles they were going to drive for ASCAA were covered by the Nationwide policy and that Dale Gordon was not covered because he was not named as a designated driver. The difficulty we have in adopting Nationwide\u2019s argument is that there simply is no language in the policy or in the stipulations that would cause us to conclude that such a legal conclusion flows from the facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">As in all cases in which insurance coverage is provided by an insurance policy, the issue in this case will be determined by a \u201c* * * reasonable construction [of the contract] in conformity with the intention of the parties as gathered from the ordinary and commonly understood meaning of the language employed.\u201d <em>Dealers Dairy Products Co. </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co. </em>(1960), 170 Ohio St. 336, 10 O.O. 2d 424, 164 N.E. 2d 745, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Bobier </em>v. <em>National Cas. Co. </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 215, 28 O.O. 138, 54 N.E. 2d 798, paragraph one of the syllabus. However, it is well-settled that, where provisions of a .contract of insurance are reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation, they will be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insur\u00e9d. <em>Faruque </em>v. <em>Provident Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 34, 31 OBR 83, 508 N.E. 2d 949, syllabus; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Preferred Risk Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St. 3d 340, 342, 513 N.E. 2d 733, 736, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Considering the policy language as a whole, the general intent of the insurance contract as revealed by the stipulations appears to have been to insure ASCAA as a legal entity against liability arising from the use of certain named ASCAA vehicles when driven by designated drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">Although the parties dispute whether the Nationwide policy insures all ASCAA employees, as King argues, or only specific employees, as Nationwide argues, we consider neither position to be entirely dispositive. Other courts presented with family-oriented language in policies issued to partnerships and corporations have interpreted. the scope of underinsured motorist coverage both ways.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties\u2019 stipulation identifies ASCAA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>as the \u201cnamed insured.\u201d The policy defines \u201cYOU\u201d as the \u201cpolicyholder first named.\u201d Therefore, neither the employees as a whole nor the group of \u201cdesignated drivers\u201d may be interpreted as the entity to which the word \u201cYOU\u201d refers. We conclude that ASCAA, as a legal entity, is the \u201cYOU\u201d referred to in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">As noted by the trial court, the critical language of the underinsured motorist provisions pertinent to this case states:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">\u201cUnder this coverage, we will pay bodily injury damages that you or your legal representative are legally entitled to recover from the owner or driver of an * * * [underinsured] motor, vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">\u201cRelatives living in your household also have this protection. <em>Anyone else is protected while occupying:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">&lt;&lt;* <em>at </em>*</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">\u201c4. <em>any other motor vehicle while it is being operated by you </em>* * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">An important exclusion states that the underinsured motorist insurance:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">\u201c4. * * * does not apply to bodily injury suffered while occupying a motor vehicle owned by you or a relative living in your household, but not insured for * * * [Underinsured] Motorists coverage under this policy. <em>at </em>*</p>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">Examination of this policy language reveals that the question of coverage turns upon the meaning of the undefined phrases \u201c[Relatives living in your household\u201d and \u201c[ajnyone else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-16\">\u201cCommon words appearing in a written instrument will be given their ordinary meaning unless manifest absurdity results, or unless some other meaning is clearly evidenced from the face or overall contents of the instrument.\u201d <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Buckeye Pipe Line Co. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St. 2d 241, 7 O.O. 3d 403, 374 N.E. 2d 146, paragraph two of the syllabus. Because \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d refer to ASCAA as a legal entity, the ordinary meaning of the phrase \u201c[Relatives living in your household\u201d used in the policy is \u201cmanifestly absurd.\u201d However, in the context of the policy as a whole, the phrase \u201c[Relatives living in your household\u201d may be interpreted as referring to all employees of ASCAA, as referring to designated drivers only, or as a nullity. Therefore, the phrase is ambiguous and must be construed in favor of the insured. <em>Faruque, supra; Thompson, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-17\">If the phrase \u201c[Relatives living in your household\u201d is construed to refer to all employees of ASCAA, the exclusion cited above precludes coverage because Gordon was occupying a motor vehicle owned by another employee-\u201crelative,\u201d which vehicle was not insured under the policy. Such construction in favor of the insurer is contrary to law. Alternatively, if the phrase is construed either to refer to a designated list of \u201cdrivers in the household\u201d or to be a nullity, under-insured motorist coverage is extended to Gordon. A construction of \u201c[Relatives living in your household\u201d as referring to the designated drivers listed as \u201cdrivers in the household\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>would be in harmony with the intent of the parties to establish a specific and limited category of individuals entitled to bodily injury protection under nearly all the categories of coverage afforded under the policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, we need not reach that issue because, under the underinsured motorist coverage, whether the phrase \u201c[Relatives living in your household\u201d refers to designated drivers or is simply a nullity, we conclude that Gordon was an insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The stipulations establish that Foster\u2019s automobile was loaned to Gordon for use in the scope of his employment. As such, it was operated by and for ASCAA, the \u201cYOU\u201d referred to in the contract. Therefore, the policy language at issue places Gordon in the position of \u201canyone else\u201d who is entitled to protection \u201c* * * while occupying * * * any other motor vehicle while it is being operated by you [ASCAA] * * The express exclusions from underinsured motorist coverage do not apply.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Nationwide's limiting interpretation of the underinsured motorist provision is founded, in part, upon an unstated assumption that its policy insures the same designated individuals and named vehicles under all coverages. Yet, the precise language used in the insurance contract implies a different result and supports the broad construction of the underinsured motorist coverage prompted by our finding of ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">The insurance contract\u2019s definition of \u201cTHE INSURED,\u201d \u201cAN INSURED,\u201d and \u201cANY INSURED,\u201d as a person \u201c* * * specifically indicated as entitled to protection under the coverage being described,\u201d implicitly recognizes that different provisions of the policy may specifically entitle differing groups of persons and automobiles to protection, depending upon the coverage described. This court has previously recognized that the actual language of uninsured or underinsured motorist provisions, because broadly written, may cause the coverage to exceed the scope' impliedly intended, as evidenced by the policy declaration. <em>Ohio Farmers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1969), 17 Ohio St. 2d 73, 46 O.O. 2d 404, 246 N.E. 2d 552, paragraph one of the syllabus<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>; <em>Kish </em>v. <em>Central Natl. Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number><em>Group </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St. 2d 41, at 44 and 49, 21 O.O. 3d 26, at 28 and 31, 424 N.E. 2d 288, at 291 and 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">For example, the auto liability provisions for damage or injury to others caused by \u201cyour auto\u201d cover \u201c* * * damages resulting from the ownership, maintenance, loading or unloading of your auto.\u201d \u201cYOUR AUTO\u201d is defined in the policy as \u201cthe vehicle or vehicles described in the attached Declarations\u201d \u2014 here, the five vehicles stipulated by the parties. In addition to \u201cyour auto,\u201d the auto liability provisions are extended to also cover \u201ca motor vehicle you do not own, while it substitutes temporarily for your auto * * * out of use because of breakdown, repair, servicing, loss, or destruction\u201d; and newly acquired vehicles for the first thirty days. The under insured motorist provisions not only encompass these categories but also reach an even broader group, including any other nonowned vehicle not furnished for regular use, such as, in this case, Foster\u2019s automobile. Moreover, we note that an express coverage exclusion found under the auto liability coverage which excludes \u201c* * * bodily injury to an employee of any insured, while the employee is engaged in the activities of employment,\u201d is clearly absent from the underinsured motorist \u201cCOVERAGE EXCLUSIONS.\u201d In the construction of insurance contracts, \u201c[wjhere exceptions, qualifications or exemptions are introduced into an insurance contract, a general presumption arises to the effect that that which is not clearly excluded from the operation of such contract is included in the operation thereof.\u201d <em>Home Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>(1945), 146 Ohio St. 96, 32 O.O. 30, 64 N.E. 2d 248, paragraph two of the syllabus. See, also, <em>Moorman </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St. 3d 20, 22, 4 OBR 17, 19, 445 N.E. 2d 1122, 1124. Accordingly, we conclude that Gordon was an insured under the underinsured motorist provisions of the Nationwide policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">In addition to seeking a declaratory judgment, King requested that the trial court order Nationwide to arbitrate his claim. The insurance contract provides for arbitration of claims arising under the underinsured motorist coverage \u201c[i]f we [Nationwide] and the insured do not agree about the insured\u2019s right to recover damages or the amount of damages * * *.\u201d Having found that Gordon was an insured within the scope of the underinsured motorist coverage, his legal representative, King, is entitled to an order that Nationwide arbitrate his claim pursuant to the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b250-11\">Sweeney, Locher, Douglas, Wright and H. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b250-12\">Holmes, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-8\"> Some courts have agreed with King that because insurers have inserted family-oriented policy language insuring against bodily injury in contracts issued to partnerships, such language must be intended to provide coverage to individuals. <em>E.g., Hartford Acc. &amp; Indemn. Co. </em>v. <em>Huddleston </em>(Ky. App. 1974), 514 S.W. 2d 676 (family-oriented language in policies issued to partnerships causes the underinsured motorist provisions of the policies to also insure the partners and their families). Other courts, in cases cited by Nationwide, have found, to the contrary, that employees are not covered under underinsured motorist provisions of policies issued to partnerships, <em>e.g., Testone </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1973), 165 Conn. 126, 328 A. 2d 686, and not covered under other property damage and bodily injury provisions in policies issued to partnerships, <em>e.g., Rosen </em>v. <em>Natl. Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(Fla. App. 1971), 249 So. 2d 701, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>and corporations, <em>e.g., Harleysville Mut. Ins.

At least one court has found the intent to insure corporations so clear and unambiguous that family-oriented language in a policy issued to a corporation was declared a nullity. <em>Pearcy </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemn.
