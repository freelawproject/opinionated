R. Kondritzer </em>and <em>Edward Cohen, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-14\"><em>Anthony J.

As this report was supportive of appellant\u2019s prayer for permanent and total disability compensation, appellant contends that the commission\u2019s decision to deny such compensation was rendered without the requisite \u201csome evidence\u201d to support said decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-16\">This proposition is predicated on this court\u2019s judgment in <em>State, ex rel. Anderson, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 166, 16 O.O. 3d 199, 404 N.E. 2d 153, which established an evidentiary doctrine precluding the commission\u2019s consideration of evidence which did not evaluate the combined effect of all the claimant\u2019s recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>conditions. However, this court has recently overruled its previous judgment in <em>Anderson </em>and abandoned the combined-effect evidentiary doctrine established therein. <em>State, ex rel. Burley, </em>v. <em>Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E. 2d 936. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s objection based on the <em>Anderson </em>combined-effect evidentiary doctrine is no longer valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Next, appellant challenges the commission\u2019s reliance on the non-examining report of Dr. Dillahunt, on the basis that Dr. Dillahunt does not state with sufficient specificity which examining physician\u2019s findings he relied upon in deriving his own conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">This court need not consider the merits of this proposition because the Industrial Commission did not premise its judgment exclusively on Dr. Dillahunt\u2019s report. The commission states that its decision was based \u201cparticularly on the medical reports of Drs. Parsons, Berger and Dillahunt.\u201d Pursuant to this court\u2019s judgment in <em>State, ex rel. Burley, supra, </em>the reports of Drs. Parsons and Berger constitute some evidence which would support the commission\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we hereby affirm the decision of the court of appeals denying appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b103-10\">Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and H. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b103-11\">Locher, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b103-12\">Moyer, C.J., not participating.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
