Turton and McCloud and that the only qualified evidence before the commission was the report of appellant\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Williams, which supported appellant\u2019s prayer for permanent and total disability compensation. Appellant supports these claims by citing <em>State, ex rel. Anderson, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 166, 16 O.O. 3d 199, 404 N.E. 2d 153. In <em>Anderson, </em>this court established an evidentiary rule which prevented the commission from relying on any medical evidence that did not evaluate the combined effect of all the claimant\u2019s recognized conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">Appellant's reliance on <em>Anderson </em>is no longer valid. In <em>State, ex rel. Burley, </em>v. <em>Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E. 2d 936, this court specifically overruled the <em>Anderson </em>decision and abandoned the combined-effect evidentiary standard announced therein, by holding:</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">\u201cThis court\u2019s role in the review of mandamus actions challenging the Industrial Commission\u2019s decision as to the extent of disability in cases involving multiple allowed conditions shall henceforth be limited to a determination as to whether there is some evidence in the record to support the commission\u2019s stated basis for its decision.\u201d <em>Burley, supra, </em>syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-13\">In this case, the commission\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s application for permanent and total disability compensation was premised particularly upon the reports of Drs. Turton and McCloud. Dr. Turton estimated that appellant\u2019s psychological impairment was in the range of ten percent and Dr. McCloud estimated appellant\u2019s orthopedic impairment at five percent. We find that these reports constitute some evidence to support the commission\u2019s determination that appellant is not permanently and totally disabled and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-14\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b50-15\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and H.
