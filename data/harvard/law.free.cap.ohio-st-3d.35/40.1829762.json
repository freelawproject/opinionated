Paragon, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St. 3d 72, 5 OBR 127, 448 N.E. 2d 1372, and (2) these medical reports did not consider the combined effect of the recognized disabilities, as mandated in <em>State, ex rel. Anderson, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 166, 16 O.O. 3d 199, 404 N.E. 2d 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-14\">In regard to the claim that the evidence did not address the extent of the claimant\u2019s disability, this court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>noted on a number of occasions that the medical evidence before the commission need only address the claimant\u2019s degree of impairment. It is the commission that must determine claimant\u2019s disability. <em>Meeks </em>v. <em>Ohio Brass Co. </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St. 3d 147, 10 OBR 482, 462 N.E. 2d 389; <em>State, ex rel. Elliott, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St. 3d 76, 26 OBR 66, 497 N.E. 2d 70. Hence, the fact that the medical evidence relied upon by the commission does not take into account claimant\u2019s disability in no way affects the validity of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Similarly, appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>State, ex rel. Anderson, supra, </em>is also misplaced. In <em>Anderson, </em>this court established an evidentiary rule which prevented the commission from relying on any medical report which did not consider the combined effect of all the claimant\u2019s recognized conditions in a case involving multiple injuries. However, the <em>Anderson </em>decision and its accompanying evidentiary doctrine were recently overruled in <em>State, ex rel. Burley, </em>v. <em>Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E. 2d 936. A writ of mandamus may only issue where the relator demonstrates, <em>inter alia, </em>a clear legal right to the relief requested. <em>State, ex rel. Harris, </em>v. <em>Rhodes </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St. 2d 41, 8 O.O. 3d 36, 374 N.E. 2d 641. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we find that appellant has failed to meet this burden and hereby affirm the judgment of the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b78-7\">Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas and Wright, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b78-8\">Locher, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b78-9\">Moyer, C.J., and H.
