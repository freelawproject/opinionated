Westchester, </em>v. <em>Bacon </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 42, 15 O.O. 3d 53, 399 N.E. 2d 81, paragraph one of the syllabus. Clearly, appellant could not and cannot sustain this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">First, there is no evidence in the record that appellant has filed any civil action in libel in the Court of Common Pleas of Pickaway County. Second, a writ of mandamus cannot issue ordering a person to cease commenting about a criminal case which has been fully adjudicated. Finally, a writ of mandamus cannot issue ordering the trial court to enter a judgment for appellant in a civil suit allegedly pending before that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">Appellant has failed to demonstrate that he has a clear legal right to the relief prayed for and further has failed to demonstrate that appellee is under a clear legal duty to perform the requested acts. Therefore, dismissal of' this action by the court of appeals was appropriate and the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b218-15\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and H.
