Therefore, the court of appeals was correct in stating that appellant failed to state a ground upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-12\">Even if this were not so, appellant has failed to sustain his burden of establishing that a writ of mandamus should issue by demonstrating that he has a clear legal right to the relief prayed for. <em>State, ex rel.
