Comm. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St. 3d 31, 25 OBR 26, 494 N.E. 2d 1125. In <em>Vulcan, </em>this court provided some insight as to the type of evidence which is necessary to establish that an injury has become a permanent condition. The court stated at 33, 25 OBR at 27, 494 N.E. 2d at 1127:</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">\u201c* <em>* * </em>The commission\u2019s designation of a disability as permanent relates solely to the perceived longevity of the condition at issue. It has absolutely no bearing upon the claimant\u2019s inability to perform the tasks involved in his former position of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">The appellate court concluded that Dr. Moyes\u2019 report did not constitute \u201csome evidence\u201d upon which the commission could base its finding of permanent disability. The court focused primarily upon that portion of Dr. Moyes\u2019 report which found that the claimant was \u201ctemporarily permanently [sic] unable to return to her former position of employment.\u201d The appellate court viewed this phrase as being \u201cambiguous\u201d and \u201cconfusing\u201d and held that it would be manifestly unjust for the Industrial Commission to rely on such evidence to support its finding of permanent disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">While the appellate court\u2019s conclusion as to the reliability of the ambiguous terminology used in Dr. Moyes\u2019 report appears well-founded, a review of the commission\u2019s order demonstrates that the commission premised its finding upon a segment of Dr. Moyes\u2019 report different from that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>scrutinized by the appellate court. Dr. Moyes\u2019 report sets forth two distinct observations in two separate paragraphs. The first observation concerns appellee\u2019s inability to return to her former position of employment. This is where Dr. Moyes employs his ambiguous terminology. However, in the next paragraph of the report, Dr. Moyes expresses his opinion as to whether the claimant\u2019s condition had become permanent. There, Dr. Moyes indicates that the claimant had reached \u201cmaximum recovery after this period of time.\u201d This is the language which the commission quotes in support of its finding and, pursuant to this court\u2019s judgment in <em>Vulcan Materials Co., supra, </em>this statement constitutes some evidence that the claimant\u2019s condition had become permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we find that the appellate court\u2019s decision to negate the commission\u2019s factual finding of permanent disability is not well-founded and we reverse the judgment of the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b228-8\">Locher, Holmes, Wright and H. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b228-9\">Sweeney and Douglas, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b228-10\">Moyer, C.J., not participating.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
