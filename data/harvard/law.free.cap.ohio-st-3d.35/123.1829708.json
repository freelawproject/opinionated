The doctrine assumes that proper jurisdiction and proper venue lie in the court which plaintiff has chosen, <em>id. </em>at 504; cf. Ohio Civ. R. 3(D), and additionally presupposes the availability of another forum in which the defendant may be sued.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he doctrine furnishes criteria for choice between them.\u201d <em>Gilbert, supra, </em>at 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">The criteria set forth in <em>Gilbert </em>and other United States Supreme Court decisions are to be applied flexibly, with each case turning on its own facts. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Green Bay &amp; Western Ry. Co. </em>(1946), 326 U.S. 549. These factors may be divided into the private interests of the litigants and factors of public interest involving the courts and citizens of the forum. Important private interests include: \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>relative ease of access to sources of proof; availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling, and the cost of obtaining attendance of willing, witnesses; possibility of view of premises, if view would be appropriate to the action; and all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy, expeditious and inexpensive. There may also be questions as to the enforceability of a judgment if one is obtained.\u201d <em>Gilbert, supra, </em>at 508. The <em>Gilbert </em>court noted that \u201cthe plaintiffs\u2019 choice of forum should rarely be disturbed,\u201d <em>id., </em>particularly when the plaintiff has chosen his home forum. <em>Koster </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. </em>(1947), 330 U.S. 518, 524. However, in <em>Piper Aircraft Co. </em>v. <em>Reyno </em>(1981), 454 U.S. 235, 256, the court held: \u201cBecause the central purpose of any <em>forum non conveniens </em>inquiry is to ensure that the trial is convenient, a foreign plaintiff\u2019s choice deserves less deference.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">Public interest factors to be considered include the administrative difficulties and delay to other litigants caused by congested court calendars, the imposition of jury duty upon the citizens of a community which has very little relation to the litigation, a local interest in having localized controversies decided at home, and the appropriateness of litigating a case in a forum familiar with the applicable law. <em>Gilbert, supra, </em>at 508-509. Additionally, the court in <em>Reyno, supra, </em>at 249-255, noted that the possibility of an unfavorable change in law upon dismissal should not, standing alone, bar such dismissal, provided the remedy in the alternate forum is not so clearly inadequate as to amount to no remedy at all. Essentially, \u201cthe ultimate inquiry is where trial will best serve the convenience of the parties and the ends of justice.\u201d <em>Koster, supra, </em>at 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Once a court has determined that the alternate forum is the more convenient, the common-law doctrine requires the court to dismiss the action. <em>Gilbert, supra, </em>at 512. The dismissal may be conditioned upon the refiling of the action in the alternate forum with defendant consenting to its jurisdiction. Other conditions may include, <em>inter alia, </em>defendant\u2019s consent to waive any statute of limitations defense, consent to comply with the discovery rules of the original forum, and consent to satisfy any judgment rendered against it in the alternate forum. See, <em>e.g., Dowling </em>v. <em>Richardson-Merrell, Inc. </em>(C.A. 6, 1984), 727 F. 2d 608; <em>In re Union Carbide Corp. Gas Plant Disaster at Bhopal, India </em>(S.D. N.Y. 1986), 634 F. Supp. 842, modified on appeal (C.A. 2, 1987), 809 F. 2d 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The final aspect of the common-law doctrine is the applicable standard of review upon appeal from a <em>forum non conveniens </em>dismissal. \u201cThe <em>forum non conveniens </em>determination is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. It may be reversed only when there has been a clear abuse of discretion; where the court has considered all relevant public and private interest factors, and where its balancing of these factors is reasonable, its decision deserves substantial deference. <em>Gilbert, </em>330 U.S., at 511-512; <em>Koster, </em>330 U.S., at 531. * * *\u201d <em>Reyno, supra, </em>at 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">We now turn to the arguments presented by appellants and <em>amici curiae </em>urging us to reject the adoption of <em>forum non conveniens </em>as the law of Ohio. We find none of their arguments persuasive. In <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Rosner </em>(1935), 294 U.S. 629, 643, the court expressly held that a state court \u201cmay in appropriate cases apply the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens.\u201d </em>See, also, <em>Missouri, ex rel. Southern Ry. Co., </em>v. <em>Mayfield </em>(1950), 340 U.S. 1. We are to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>day, for the first time, faced with a most appropriate case in which to apply the doctrine, and thus join our many sister jurisdictions which have already done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Appellants first argue that our adoption of the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens </em>is inconsistent with prior decisions of this court which they read as specifically rejecting the doctrine as a matter of state policy, citing <em>State, ex rel. Consolidated Rail Corp., </em>v. <em>Gorman </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St. 2d 274, 24 O.O. 3d 362, 436 N.E. 2d 1357; <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Scaffide </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St. 2d 85, 7 O.O. 3d 175, 372 N.E. 2d 598; <em>and Mattone </em>v. <em>Argentina </em>(1931), 123 Ohio St. 393, 175 N.E. 603. We find appellants\u2019 reading of these decisions overly broad. While it is true that this court has not previously adopted the doctrine and applied it to a particular case, nor has the doctrine been embodied in any rule or statute in Ohio, <em>State, ex rel. Starner, </em>v. <em>DeHoff </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St. 3d 163, 18 OBR 219, 480 N.E. 2d 449; <em>State, ex rel. Consolidated Rail Corp., </em>v. <em>Gorman, supra, </em>our prior decisions are clearly distinguishable and do not prevent the application of <em>forum non conveniens </em>in an appropriate case.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Our decision in <em>Mattone, supra, </em>has failed to weather the legal changes which have occurred in the fifty-seven years since it was handed down, and has lost its effectiveness. That case involved a transitory tort action between the residents of West Virginia, arising out of a single-car automobile accident which occurred in West Virginia. Defendant was properly and legally served in Jefferson County, Ohio, and the action was venued in that county pursuant to G.C. 11276, a general venue statute. This court held that where an Ohio court of common pleas had jurisdiction over a transitory tort action, and where service in Ohio was proper, the court was without discretionary authority to decline to entertain jurisdiction over such case. The court first distinguished the case from the decision in <em>Loftus </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania RR. Co. </em>(1923), 107 Ohio St. 352, 140 N.E. 94, in Which a limiting venue statute (G.C. 11273) was upheld and applied, the court holding that where transitory jurisdiction was proper but venue in Ohio was not due to the limiting statute, a trial court is not obligated by the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to entertain the suit. See, <em>e.g., </em>Blair, The Doctrine of Forum Non Conveniens in Anglo-American Law (1929), 29 Colum. L. Rev. 1, at 12-18. In differentiating <em>Loftus </em>from the case at hand, the <em>Mattone </em>court determined that as service was proper therein under the general venue statute, and no exception applied, a discretionary dismissal of the nonresident\u2019s action would in effect violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and implicitly the access-to-courts provision of the Ohio Constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-14\">Of course, the Privileges and Immunities Clause does not apply to nonresident aliens like appellants here. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number><em>Zobel </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1982), 457 U.S. 55, 73-74, fn. 3 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). In fact, \u201c[n]o alien has a constitutional right to sue in United States courts.\u201d <em>Heine </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co. </em>(C.A. 9, 1931), 50 F. 2d 382, 386, citing <em>Kline </em>v. <em>Burke Constr. Co. </em>(1922), 260 U.S. 226. In addition, the United States Supreme Court later held that the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens, </em>when applied to nonresident United States citizens, does not offend the Privileges and Immunities Clause. <em>Missouri, ex rel. Southern Ry. Co., </em>v. <em>Mayfield, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u201c[I]f a State chooses to \u2018[prefer] residents in access to often overcrowded Courts\u2019 and to deny such access to all non-residents, whether its own citizens or those of other States, it is a choice within its own control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Even earlier, the Supreme Court had noted, \u201c[t]here are manifest reasons for preferring residents in access to often overcrowded Courts, both in convenience and in the fact that broadly speaking it is they who pay for maintaining the Courts concerned.\u201d <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven &amp; H. RR. Co. </em>(1929), 279 U.S. 377, 387. It was this change in law which prompted the Supreme Courts of Minnesota and Nebraska, states to which the <em>Mattone </em>court turned for guidance, to overrule their earlier decisions and adopt the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens. </em>See fn. 3, <em>supra. </em>Given this change in the law, as well as the repeal of G.C. 11276 (R.C. 2307.38, effective July 1, 1971), and the adoption by this court of the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure, the <em>Mat-tone </em>decision does not control our decision today.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Scaffide, supra, </em>this court reversed a so-called <em>forum non conveniens </em>dismissal of a petition for writ of habeas corpus originally filed in the court of appeals. Our reversal was based on specific language in Sections 2 and 3, Article IV of the Ohio Constitution, particularly Section 2(B)(3), which precludes a court of appeals or the Supreme Court from refusing to exercise its original jurisdiction in habeas corpus.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Our Constitution provides no similar explicit constraint on the discretion of courts of common pleas. Section 4(B), Article IV provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">\u201cThe courts of common pleas and divisions thereof shall have such original jurisdiction over all justiciable matters and such powers of review of proce\u00e9dings of administrative officers and agencies as may be provided by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">This general provision is similar to the provisions in former Sections 2 and 6 of Article IV pertaining to appellate (circuit) courts which, <em>prior to </em>the 1913 amendment adding what is now Section 2(B)(3), granted such appellate courts the discretion to decline to exercise their original jurisdiction over extraordinary writs. <em>Hughes, supra, </em>at 89; <em>State, ex rel. Werden, </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1875), 26 Ohio St. 170; <em>Ex parte Shean </em>(1875), 25 Ohio St. 440; <em>Ex parte Shaw </em>(1857), 7 Ohio St. 81. As a further distinguishing factor, all the parties involved were residents of the same Ohio county, and were not seeking a dismissal of their case and refiling outside the state, nor were they even seeking a transfer of their case to another Ohio county (which, as we discuss below, is not permitted on <em>forum non conveniens </em>grounds but only pursuant to Civ. R. 3[C]). Rather, the court of appeals in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>Hughes </em>felt the juvenile court was the more appropriate court for the habeas action and elected not to entertain jurisdiction itself. The <em>Hughes </em>decision has no application to the facts presented <em>sub judiee.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Finally, appellants argue our decision in <em>State, ex rel. Consolidated Rail Corp., </em>v. <em>Gorman, supra, </em>also demonstrates a rejection of <em>forum non conveniens. </em>This argument misconstrues the procedural posture of the case, which was an appeal from the denial of a writ of mandamus. In affirming, we merely noted that since the doctrine had theretofore not been adopted in Ohio, relator could show no clear legal duty on the part of the common pleas judge to apply it in relator\u2019s Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act action. The decision merely states the obvious and is not a commentary on the merits of the doctrine nor its viability in future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The argument proposed by <em>amici curiae </em>is similar to that discussed above. However, they argue that this court specifically rejected the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens </em>by its adoption of Civ. R. 3 in its current form. Their claim is only partially correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Section 5(B), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution, adopted May 7, 1968, as amended, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\u201cThe supreme court shall prescribe rules governing practice and procedure in all courts of the state, which rules shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right. Proposed rules shall be filed by the court, not later than the fifteenth day of January, with the clerk of each house of the general assembly during a regular session thereof, and amendments to any such proposed rules may be so filed not later than the first day of May in that session. Such rules shall take effect on the following first day of July, unless prior to such day the general assembly adopts a concurrent resolution of disapproval. <em>All laws in conflict with such rules shall be of no further force or effect after such rules have taken effect. </em>* * *\u201d (Emphasis added.) See <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Steiner </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St. 2d 86, 61 O.O. 2d 335, 290 N.E. 2d 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-13\">In early 1969, the Rules Advisory Committee submitted its draft of the proposed rules to this court. The venue rule in this draft was designed to replace the inconsistent and widely scattered venue statutes in place at the time, and was based in large part on the statutes proposed by Professor Richard S. Miller, in his article, Implementing Current Theories of Jurisdiction, Venue and Services of Process \u2014 Proposals for Revision of the Ohio Statutes (1968), 29 Ohio St. L. J. 116, 152-155. See 4 Anderson\u2019s Ohio Civil Practice (1987) 116, Section 149.01. This draft included language specifically adopting <em>forum non conveniens </em>provisions for both intra- and interstate change of venue.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>This court, in the final version of the rules submitted to the General Assembly for its approval, removed all reference of \u201cconvenient forum\u201d from Civ. R. 3, substituting \u201cproper venue\u201d in subdivisions (B) and (C), and \u201cproper forum\u201d in subdivisions (D) (former subsection [e]) and (E) (former subsection [g]). The commentators have indicated that the reason for the change was a recognition that <em>transfer </em>of a case from one proper venue to another proper venue <em>within </em>the state for means of convenience is unnecessary in a geographically small state such as Ohio, and that any inconvenience to witnesses in such a situation could be remedied by the use of depositions. Anderson\u2019s Ohio Civil Practice, <em>supra, </em>at 116; McCormac, Ohio Civil Rules Practice (1970), Section 2.19 (both of which refer to the flood of litigation over district to district transfer within the federal system pursuant to Section 1404[a], Title 28, U.S. Code).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It must be remembered that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number><em>transfer </em>of an action within the Ohio judicial system involves considerations wholly separate from a conditional dismissal and refiling outside Ohio. Thus, Civ. R. 3(C) now provides for a <em>transfer </em>of a properly venued action, Civ. R. 3(B), to an adjoining county in Ohio (whether venue is \u201cproper\u201d there or not) only \u201cwhen it appears that a fair and impartial trial cannot be had in the county in which the suit is pending.\u201d We are not faced with such a situation herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">However, in Civ. R. 3(D), the word \u201cproper\u201d was substituted for \u201cconvenience\u201d merely to provide consistency throughout the rule. As a result, this subsection only applies when venue in Ohio is not proper under any of the options of subsection (B). We have found no Ohio case in which Civ. R. 3(D) has been applied, undoubtedly because it can only be applied in the extremely rare pure transitory action where both plaintiff and defendant are non-Ohio residents and the cause of action arose outside this state, but the defendant is \u201ccaught\u201d and served while momentarily in Ohio. Anderson\u2019s Ohio Civil Practice, <em>supra, </em>at 143-145, Section 149.18; see, also, <em>Price </em>v. <em>Wheeling Dollar Savings &amp; Trust Co. </em>(1983), 9 Ohio App. 3d 315, 9 OBR 581, 460 N.E. 2d 264; <em>Penrod </em>v. <em>Baltimore &amp; Ohio RR. Co. </em>(1979), 64 Ohio App. 2d 216, 18 O.O. 3d 164, 412 N.E. 2d 949; <em>Singleton </em>v. <em>Denny\u2019s, Inc. </em>(1987), 36 Ohio App. 3d 225, 522 N.E. 2d 1097; <em>McWilliams </em>v. <em>U-Haul International, Inc. </em>(Nov. 20, 1986), Clark App. No. 2254, unreported; <em>Gallimore </em>v. <em>Arcadia Natl. Life Ins. Co. </em>(May 12, 1986), Miami App. No. 85CA25, unreported.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Civ. R. 3 does not expressly preclude the application of the common-law doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens </em>in interstate or international situations not covered by subsection (D), whether or not venue is \u201cproper\u201d in Ohio. Additionally, the Civil Rules, <em>like forum non conveniens, </em>\u201cshall be construed and applied to effect just results by eliminating delay, unnecessary expense and all other impediments to the expeditious administration of justice.\u201d Civ. R. 1(B). Therefore, since neither the commentators nor the parties have provided evidence of a contrary intent on the part of the rule revisionists, we hold that the application of <em>forum non conveniens </em>in the case <em>sub judice </em>was within the trial court\u2019s inherent power and does not conflict with Civ. R. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Appellants\u2019 last argument against our recognition of the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens </em>as the law of Ohio is that to do so would violate the access-to-courts provision of the Ohio Constitution, Section 16, Article I. See, <em>supra, </em>fn. 6. We disagree. The right of \u201cevery person\u201d to bring an action in an Ohio court is not an unlimited, absolute guarantee that every cognizable claim filed in a court of general jurisdiction will be litigated to a final conclusion in such court. Litigants may find their claims barred by a reasonable statute of limitations, stayed by lawful injunction, dismissed by summary judgment and tempered by any number of other devices consonant with due process or \u201cdue course of law.\u201d The doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens </em>is one such device, which, when applied according to the case-specific guidelines set forth in <em>Gilbert </em>and its progeny, fulfills rather than denies the constitutional guarantee that <em>every </em>person \u201cshall have justice administered without denial or delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Our final task is to determine whether the trial court below properly employed the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens, </em>considering all the relevant private and public interest factors and the weight given to each. We will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>independently assess and reweigh each factor, as our review is limited to the narrow determination of whether the trial court abused its discretion in ordering a conditional dismissal herein. See <em>Reyno, supra. </em>An abuse of discretion implies \u201c \u2018not merely error of judgment, but perversity of will, passion, prejudice, partiality, or moral delinquency.\u2019 \u201d <em>State, ex rel. Commercial Lovelace Motor Freight, Inc., </em>v. <em>Lancaster </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St. 3d 191, 193, 22 OBR 275, 277, 489 N.E. 2d 288, 290, quoting <em>State, ex rel. Shafer, </em>v. <em>Ohio Turnpike Comm. </em>(1953), 159 Ohio St. 581, 590-591, 50 O.O. 465, 469,113 N.E. 2d 14, 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">The trial court considered the following private interest factors: if suit were maintained in Ohio, the foreign plaintiffs would benefit from this country\u2019s practice of allowing counsel to operate on a contingent fee basis, a practice whose absence in Great Britain makes it difficult for many plaintiffs to bring suit in that nation; in Ohio, plaintiffs are not burdened by paying their opponent\u2019s attorney fees should they lose, as they would be in Great Britain; in Ohio, unlike Great Britain, plaintiffs would be entitled to a jury trial and could utilize depositions rather than live witnesses at trial, would likely be entitled to punitive damages, and would benefit from far more liberal law regarding strict products liability; and the documents and witnesses relating to the initial development of Bendectin in defendant\u2019s Cincinnati laboratories are located in this state, which to that extent would benefit both parties. However, plaintiffs would have to travel at great expense to Cincinnati, as would the several witnesses located in Great Britain, also at plaintiffs\u2019 expense. These foreign witnesses, relating to the personal and family medical history of the plaintiffs, and relating to the preparation, testing and distribution of Debendox in Great Britain, are located throughout Great Britain. Finally, the Ohio courts would be unfamiliar with applying British law, which would inure to neither party\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The public factors considered were the burden on Ohio courts in applying foreign law in a difficult case; the lack of subpoena power to compel cooperation of foreign witnesses; the \u201cnear certainty\u201d that allowing this suit would result in the filing in Cincinnati of one thousand or more similar Debendox cases from various countries; and the tremendous burden upon the jury system of Hamilton County should such a flood of litigation occur, coupled with the equally tremendous burden on the limited resources of the Ohio judiciary and the potential denial to our own citizens of access to Ohio courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The court then balanced these considerations in light of the fact that Debendox was manufactured almost exclusively in Great Britain by a British corporation; its contents were somewhat different from the drug developed by defendant in the United States; Debendox was tested and licensed under British law, promoted and sold by British firms to citizens and residents of Great Britain; the injuries all occurred there; and the information on the initial development and testing of Bendectin in this country had been discovered in a virtually identical federal case, <em>In re Richardson-Merrell, Inc. </em>(S.D. Ohio 1982), 545 F. Supp. 1130, affirmed and modified in <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Richardson-Merrell, Inc. </em>(C.A. 6, 1984), 727 F. 2d 608, and was still available to the plaintiffs herein.

While the' better practice may be that the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens </em>should be adopted as the law of this state, I disagree both with the manner in which it was adopted herein and in its application to the instant cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\"><em>Forum non conveniens </em>is a doctrine of procedure, not substance, applying <em>only </em>in situations where an action is <em>properly </em>before a court which possesses both jurisdiction and venue. The method for establishing procedural rules in Ohio is set forth in Section 5(B), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution. This provision provides in part that \u201c[t]he supreme court shall prescribe rules governing practice and procedure in all courts of the state * * Thus, the doctrine <em>offorum non conveniens </em>can be adopted either by constitutional amendment, by a legislative enactment not inconsistent with the rules of practice and procedure, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>by a rule of practice and procedure promulgated by this court and approved by the Ohio Legislature. Since neither the Ohio Constitution nor the Ohio Revised Code currently embodies the doctrine, if <em>forum non conveniens </em>is to be considered available in Ohio, it must be contained within the scope and content of the currently existing Rules of Civil Procedure adopted by this court. Yet, Ohio\u2019s Rules of Civil Procedure, as they currently exist, provide for no such practice. Either an action is <em>proper </em>or it is not. Convenience is not an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\">Civ. R. 3 sets forth the procedure for commencing an action and determining proper venue in Ohio. This rule additionally provides the appropriate procedure to be utilized when there is no <em>proper </em>forum in Ohio. While at first glance this section may appear to adopt the doctrine <em>o\u00ed forum non conveniens, </em>closer scrutiny reveals that such is not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">As shown by the majority, the initial draft version of Civ. R. 3(D), submitted to this court by the Rules Advisory Committee of the Ohio Judicial Conference, would have adopted the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens. </em>In fact, the thrust of the entire Rule 3, as proposed, was directed towards ensuring that complaints were lodged in convenient forums in both interstate and intrastate actions. Proposed Civ. R. 3(e) and <em>(f), </em>42 Ohio Bar, at 224-228. However, when this court submitted its proposed rules to the General Assembly for approval, Civ. R. 3, in particular Civ. R. 3(D), had been substantially revised and retitled to <em>eliminate </em>the \u201cconvenient forum\u201d concept, replacing it with the currently utilized \u201cproper forum\u201d concept. 42 Ohio Bar, at 1202-1205. The two concepts are <em>not </em>coextensive. To now say that \u201cproper forum\u201d was substituted for \u201cconvenient forum\u201d \u201c* * * merely to provide consistency throughout the rule\u201d flies in the face of this court\u2019s action in 1969 and contorts the express language approved by both this court <em>and </em>the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Further, since 1970, when Ohio\u2019s Rules of Civil Procedure were adopted, this court has, on three occasions, stated that the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens </em>is not embodied in any rule in Ohio. <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Scaffide </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St. 2d 85, 7 O.O. 3d 175, 372 N.E. 2d 598; <em>State, ex rel. Consolidated Rail Corp., </em>v. <em>Gorman </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St. 2d 274, 24 O.O. 3d 362, 436 N.E. 2d 1357; and <em>State, ex rel. Starner, </em>v. DeHoff (1985), 18 Ohio St. 3d 163, 18 OBR 219, 480 N.E. 2d 449. To now discover a new interpretation for Civ. R. 3(D) is somewhat incongruous. Additionally, the majority has, albeit weakly, attempted to distinguish this court\u2019s most definitive statement to date concerning the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens, Mattone </em>v. <em>Argentina </em>(1931), 123 Ohio St. 393, 175 N.E. 603, solely on the basis of its <em>age </em>and the passage of the Civil Rules in Ohio. However, the general venue statute relied upon in <em>Mattone, </em>G.C. 11276, is neither in conflict with, nor narrower in scope than, Civ. R. 3, the current venue authority. Furthermore, as shown <em>supra, </em>the history of Civ. R. 3 acts not to erode the comments of the court in <em>Mattone, </em>but to support them. In <em>Mattone </em>at 397-398, 175 N.E. at 605, this court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">\u201cThe courts of common pleas of this state are given such jurisdiction as is provided by law, to wit, by the acts of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">\u201cThat body having specifically given the court of common pleas jurisdiction in the character of action presented in this case, as set forth in Section 11276, General Code, it follows that the rule of discretionary power of the courts to entertain jurisdiction, ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>plicable in other states, does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u201c* * * In some states this rule of discretionary power is recognized, but the statutory and constitutional provisions of this state are such that we cannot adopt the rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Later, the <em>Mattone </em>court concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\u201cIt is urged that the requiring of the courts of this state to take jurisdiction in a case such as is presented by this record would tend toward a great burden upon the courts of this state. However, this is a <em>legislative problem and is not one for the courts. </em>We deem the matter entirely controlled by the statute above indicated.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 400, 175 N.E. at 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Accordingly, to adopt the doctrine at issue herein, I believe that a condition precedent to that adoption must, at a minimum, be an amendment to Civ. R. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Moreover, even were this court able to adopt the doctrine in the manner in which it has done so, the instant cause clearly is not an appropriate case for the application of <em>forum non conveniens. </em>The factors present herein simply weigh in favor of appellants\u2019 choice of forums \u2014 Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">The cause now before us is not a transitory action in which neither party is a resident of Ohio and the cause of action did not arise in Ohio. Instead, in the case at bar, appellee has its principal place of business in Ohio. It is alleged appellee did the testing for the original drug in Ohio and that appellee did sell the drug in the United States. Accordingly, with regard to appellee, appellants\u2019 choice of Ohio as its forum for litigation is not only proper but also convenient.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">Further, it is most interesting to note that former apostles of <em>stare decisis </em>have suddenly seemed to not only abandon their prior blind opposition to applying modern legal doctrines in order to bring Ohio jurisprudence into the twentieth century, but have also more than rendered the doctrine a relic \u2014 having today implicitly declared the doctrine to be dead!</p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">No matter what judicial footwork and machinations are used by the majority to <em>\u201cdistinguish\u201d </em>this court\u2019s prior and recent holdings on the issue \u2014 the fact remains that this court has <em>twice </em>stated \u201c* * * that although the states were free to accept or reject the doctrine of <em>forum non conveniens, </em>Ohio * * * [has] neither judicially adopted the doctrine, nor embodied it in any rule or statute.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Starner, </em>v. <em>DeHoff, supra, </em>at 164, 18 OBR at 220, 480 N.E. 2d at 451; and <em>State, ex rel.

Add to this the clear history that it was the specific intention of this court and the legislature <em>not </em>to adopt the doctrine and one must come to the inevitable conclusion that those of us who are charged with being too judicially progressive would now seem to have free rein as we continue to move the law of Ohio into the twentieth century in such fields as medical malpractice, products liability, workers\u2019 compensation, wrongful discharge, landlord-tenant, and spousal and parental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-15\">Finally, it is a sad day for Ohio when the highest court in this state holds that <em>our </em>Constitution, specifically Section 16, Article I, which provides for our courts to be open to \u201cevery person,\u201d does <em>not </em>include aliens. This is akin to the outrageous and outmoded holdings of yesteryear when blacks and women were not \u201cpersons\u201d under the law. Therefore, I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and permit appellants\u2019 litigation to continue.</p>\n<judges id=\"b172-16\">Sweeney, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
