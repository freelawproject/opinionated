The conveyance presents the ordinary case of a grant for life to the parents, with a vested remainder in fee to the children of the life tenants, as tenants in common.

The language of this conveyance does not show an intention to postpone its vesting after the death of Mrs. Johnson. There Is no word or clause in the instrument indicating that the estate should not- become vested in the children of Mrs. Johnson until after the death of both herself and husband, or either of them, and therefore it would vest before their decease. <em>Childs </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>11 Met. 16. <em>Furness </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>1 Cush. 134. <em>Eldridge </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>9 Cush. 516.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-5\">4. It makes no difference that the legal estate, for the life of Mrs Johnson and her husband, was vested in a trustee. There was a vested remainder capable of seizure on execution. Gen.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZK\">The purpose of Nathan Johnson in executing the deed of trust is therein recited to have been to secure the income of the trust property to his wife and the property to their children.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The conveyance is to trustees, with apt words of limitation as applied to the real and personal property conveyed; and the purposes of the trust might require more than a life estate in the trustees. Clearly, therefore, they took the legal estate in fee. The principal trusts declared are, 1st, to the use of the grantor\u2019s wife for life; 2d, if she should die before him and intestate, to pay two thirds of the income to him, and one third to their children until his death ; 3d, upon her death, leaving a will, to convey the trust property according to the dispositions and directions expressed in such will; 4th, if she should leave no will, then, after his death, to \u201c convey the same to the person or persons legally entitled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">\u201c Th\u00e9 person or persons legally entitled \u201d upon the death of the grantor are his heirs or distributees; and as the trust deed expressly requires a conveyance of the estate to them, contains no other disposition of the principal, and manifests no intention to reserve to himself any greater interest in or control over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>personal property than the real estate, and <em>nemo est hoeres </em>viven<em>tis, </em>this description of the persons who are to take the principal in remainder must be held to mean his heirs and distributees at that time. <em>Richardson </em>v. Wheatland, 7 Met. 169, 175.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\">It follows that neither the grantor, nor his son who died before him, had any interest in the estate which could be taken by creditors, and that there must be a <em>Decree for the plaintiffs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
