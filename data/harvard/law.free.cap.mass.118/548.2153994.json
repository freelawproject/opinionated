There was no evidence of compensation being fixed, other than appeared in said records. There was evidence tending to show that the defendants, upon their application, were duly licensed during the time covered by the declaration and sold at retail a certain amount of the petroleum inspected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-6\">The plaintiff testified that when first appointed inspector of petroleum he notified the defendants of his appointment, and that he should inspect what petroleum they sold; that they always notified him when they had a car load of oil that needed inspection ; that when thus notified he inspected it as soon as <em>possible; </em>that he made no claim for services except under the appointment, and that whatever was due for services in this case belonged to the city according to the above records. No question was made at the trial that the defendants did not have notice of the appointment of the plaintiff as inspector of petroleum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b566-7\">The plaintiff contended that such inspection was a benefit to the defendants, and gave to their goods an increased market value and sale; and requested the judge to instruct the jury that, upon the aforesaid facts and testimony, he was entitled to recover the amount claimed in his declaration ; that the order of June 10, 1872, was a fixing of the compensation of the inspector of petroleum, and, unless amended or changed, fixed the compensation to be paid; that the action of the mayor and aldermen annually in the appointment of an inspector of petroleum, without taking any further or additional action, was equivalent to fixing the compensation under the order or ordinance; and that if there was no annual compensation fixed by the mayor and aldermen, the defendants having received the benefit of the inspector\u2019s skill and services, he was entitled to a reasonable compensation therefor, if it was done at their request, whether his compensation was fixed or not by the mayor and aldermen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>The judge declined so to instruct the jury, but instructed them that, upon the plaintiff\u2019s showing, he could not recover on either count in his declaration, except for the inspection of so much of the first two items in his account annexed as were kept for sale or sold at retail, and that the burden of proof was upon him to show the quantity inspected by him thus kept or sold. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $5.27 ; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-4\">In the Superior Court the instructions were affirmed, and the plaintiff entered the exceptions in this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b567-5\"><em>W.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYhR\">The St. of 1869, <em>c. </em>152, \u00a7 1, authorized the mayor and aldermen to appoint one or more persons to be inspectors of petroleum, and to \u201c fix their compensation, to be paid by persons requiring their services under the provisions of this statute.\u201d This authorizes the exaction of fees from such persons, only for the purpose of compensating the inspector, and not for the benefit of the city treasury \u2014 differing in this respect from the statutes under which <em>Boston </em>v. Schaffer, 9 Pick. 415, was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">The order of the mayor and aldermen of June, 1872, authorizing the inspector to-collect certain fees from such persons, conformed to the statute. But the orders of March, 1873, and January, 1874, appointing the first assistant engineer to be inspector of petroleum, and giving him a salary of $1200, and requiring him to pay all fees into the city treasury, by thus prescribing a new way of compensating the inspector, necessarily superseded and repealed the former order, so far as his compensation was concerned; and as the mayor and aldermen had no power to exact fees for any other purpose, the provision for the payment of fees into the city treasury was void, and the inspector is not authorized by any order of the mayor and aldermen to recover fees from the defendants for services since the order of March, 1873, took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">Being a public officer for whose compensation provision is made by law, the plaintiff cannot recover anything for official services except as so provided, even if he performed such services at the defendants\u2019 request. <em>Andrews </em>v <em>United States, </em>2 Story, 202. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number><em>Converse </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 21 How. 463. <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Mann, </em>It Wend. 44. <em>Evans </em>v Trenton, 4 Zab. 764. <em>Pool </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>5 Cush. 219.
