At the last mentioned date they were expelled. It appeared that a short time before said date the ministers and elders charged them with entertaining opinions and promulgating doctrines within the society, at variance with the established belief and subversive of the organization, and a hearing was had before the ministers and elders on that subject, and they were asked to state their views ; there was much conversation on points of doctrine, and the discussion was confined to the question whether the plaintiffs were in conformity with the religious faith and doctrine of the society, the plaintiffs insisting that they were; the plaintiffs adhered to their views, and were told if they persisted they would have to leave; the next day they were again before the ministers and elders, and still adhering, they were told they must go to the office with their things, which was equivalent to an expulsion. They did so, and the next day left the community. No formal charges or charges in writing were made against them, and it was admitted by the defendant that there was no record of the proceedings. All the ministers and elders were present on the occasions mentioned. It was admitted at the trial by the plaintiffs that they were expelled for alleged nonconformity to the belief and doctrines of the society, though they denied that they were in fact not in conformity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-4\">One of the plaintiffs had stated generally, the defendant objecting, that the opinions and doctrines advocated by her were not inconsistent with the established belief ; and the counsel for the plaintiffs offered to show by this and other witnesses, what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>their opinions and doctrines were, and that they were in fact in strict conformity to the established faith, and claimed the right f o go to the jury on that question, and that their expulsion was wrongful.

The primary administrator of authority in the defendant society is in the established ministry at New Lebanon. Covenant, art. 1, sect. 2. The ministerial authority in every family emanates from the central authority at New Lebanon. Art. 1, sec. 4. The ministry appointed as aforesaid have authority to make rules necessary for the government of the society. Art. 1, sec. 5. The object of the society is the mutual protection, support, comfort and happiness of the members, spiritually and temporally. Art. 2, sec. 1. The qualifications and disqualifications are enumerated in sections 2 and 3 of art. 2. Art. 2, sec. 4, provides that a member signing the covenant shall thenceforth be entitled to all the benefits and privileges of the society. Art. 3, sec. 2, and art. 5, show that this society recognizes the distinction between the society itself and the church, which is part of the society; the temporal affairs of the family being managed by the trustees, deacons and deaconesses; while the control of the spiritual affairs of the church, by art. 4, is conferred upon the elders. Art. 6, sections 1 and 2, refer to members of the family, or society, who are in church relation. The article is so headed; and sec. 1 provides that every member standing in Gospel union shall enjoy equal rights and privileges in all things pertaining to the church ; and section 2 provides that the benefits, etc., secured to members of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the church, shall not extend to those who disobey the rules of the association, or who refuse to submit to the constituted authority of the church, \u201c of which refusal or non-compliance the leading authority acknowledged in the first article of this covenant,\u201d (that is, the ministry at New Lebanon,) \u201c shall be the proper and constitutional judges.\u201d Sec. 5 provides for the removal of a member from one family to another, when such person is in union with the authority, and apparently, also, when he is in contempt of the authority. Art. 7 provides that no member shall, contrary to the provisions of the covenant, make any claim for debt, damages, etc., against either trustees, church or society; but provides no stipulation that the members may not claim for a breach of the covenant, or for their support; to which they are entitled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-4\">2. The defendants are a religious society within the meaning of the statutes of this Commonwealth. The members are a corporate body of proprietors of the property of the society. <em>Lawrence </em>v. Fletcher, 8 Met. 153. <em>Cogswell </em>v. <em>Bullock, </em>13 Allen, 90. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>30. The relations between religious societies and the church of such societies, is, that the religious society is a corpora tian capable of holding and managing property, etc., while the church is a voluntary association, consisting of some or all the members of such society, united by covenant or agreement mainly for purposes of celebrating the ordinance of the Lord\u2019s Supper. It is merely incident to the corporation. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>May, </em>5 Cush. 336, 345.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-5\">3. Whatever power is given the leading authority mentioned in art. 1 of the covenant, over the ecclesiastical rights of members of the church, such power does not extend to the right of expulsion from the society itself, and a consequent deprivation of the enjoyment of the temporal rights of a member. But if the plaintiffs have been legally expelled and the action of the defendant is conclusive of that fact, such expulsion does not necessarily affect the civil rights of the plaintiffs as connected with the defendant, and they are entitled to recover for a breach of contract or upon a quantum meruit for their services, or upon their count in tort. The authority which undertook to act in expelling the plaintiffs, was not the leading authority contemplated in art. 6, namely, the New Lebanon ministry \u2022 and the action of the society, through its officers, was a breach of its contract with the plaintiffs. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>being no formal charges against the plaintiffs, and no record of the proceedings, there has been no legal expulsion of the plaintiffs, if the society or the officers had power to expel them for any cause, and as the action of the society was such as to deprive them of a peaceable enjoyment of their rights as members, \u2014 namely, a support in sickness and in health, \u2014 the defendant has committed a breach of its covenant with the plaintiffs, for which the plaintiffs are entitled to damages. If. the court shall construe sec. 6 of the covenant to mean that the defendant may take young children and keep them until old age comes on, having the benefit of their services and all their contributions to the society, through the useful period of their lives, and then turn them out, as they have the plaintiffs, without form of impeachment or trial, into a world which, by the Shaker faith and practice, would be depopulated, but which, in its present state, would be forced to support such members as objects of charity, then it is submitted that that part of the covenant is contrary to public policy, and void. An expulsion from the temporal rights of the society is not anticipated by articles 6 and 7, and there is no provision in the covenant for such expulsion. It does not appear that the ministry have ever made any rules, as doubtless they might have done under art. 1, sec. 5. If art. 6 contemplates any punishment for nonconformity to the doctrines of the church, strictly considered, such punishment is only a suspension of the right of communion with the church. A private corporation cannot disfranchise a member unless the power to do so is expressly granted. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Philadelphia Club, </em>50 Penn. St. 107. A member of any church may be expelled from the church proper, but if he has bought a pew in the building where the society worships, and paid for it, the society cannot lawfully deprive him of the use of it without making him suitable restitution; and the courts of law will interfere to protect the rights of such member. In the case at bar all the civil rights of the plaintiffs are involved, and they are entitled to relief. <em>Forbes </em>v. <em>Eden, </em>4 Court of Session Cases, 3d Series, 143. <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Cheney, </em>58 Ill. 509, 537. <em>Ferraria </em>v. <em>Vasconcellos, </em>31 Ill. 25. <em>Baptist Church </em>v. <em>Witherell, </em>3 Paige, 296, 301. <em>Gable </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>10 Paige, 627; <em>S.

The court has authority to inquire whether members expelled or those remaining are true conformists to the organized faith and established doctrines of the church and society, though only one is expelled and a thousand remain. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Gable, </em>2 Denio, 525. In <em>Waite </em>v. Merrill, 4 Greenl. 102, which is regarded by all Shakers as the great\" bulwark protecting them from all liability to ex-members, the plaintiff without any provocation left the society and brought a suit for his wages, not contending that the society had violated its covenant. In <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Medical </em>Society, 111 Mass. 185, 193, the defendant had special power to expel members, and this court merely decided that it had no equity jurisdiction of the case as it was brought. In <em>Goesele </em>v. Bimeler, 14 How. 589, the plaintiffs sought to recover property which their ancestor had contributed as a member of the society of Separatists, whose covenant was similar to that of the Shakers. The court refused the relief upon the ground that the ancestor had recovered compensation for his labor and his property by the covenant of the society to support him in sickness and in health, which had been done ; and great stress is laid upon this obligation of the society.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-4\">5. It is admitted that there were no formal charges made against the plaintiffs, and none at all in writing.' \u201c No man can be deprived of his office, which is a valuable property, without having the offence with which he is charged fully and plainly, substantially and formally described to him.\u201d <em>Murdoch's </em>Case, 7 Pick. 303, 330. This is so essential to justice and fairness it ought never to be dispensed with.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b105-5\">6. Where members have vested interests, the court will determine the validity of the by-laws of the society. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Worcester, 3 </em>Pick. 462. <em>Andover Free Schools </em>v. <em>Flint, </em>13 Met. 539. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Philadelphia Club, </em>50 Penn. St. 107. The plain tiffs do not contend that the covenant is contrary to public policy and void; but that the construction we have mentioned would render that part of it so; while without any judicial strain it may be so construed as to give it validity, and at the same time afford relief to the plaintiffs against the society, and not cast them penniless upon a world which the society is at enmity with.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b105-6\"><em>J.

The plaintiffs, having duly signed and sealed the \u201c covenant or constitution,\u201d became bound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>by all the provisions of that instrument. They thus subjected themselves to the discipline, and to all the orders, rules and regulations of the church, and to the counsels and directions of its elders. Covenant, art. 1, sec. 5 ; art. 6, sec. 3.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-4\">2. The plaintiffs were expelled from the defendant society by its duly constituted officers under the rules of said society, for an alleged promulgation of doctrines, within the society, at variance with its established belief and subversive of its organization. Of the justice of the expulsion, the duly constituted officers were the exclusive judges, and their decision is not open to revision by any other tribunal. <em>Farnsworth </em>v. Storrs, 5 Cush. 412. Covenant, art. 6, secs. 2, 3.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b106-5\">3. By the covenant the plaintiffs bound themselves, in the most explicit language, not to make any claim against the society, its officers, members or property, under any circumstances whatever, on account of any property or service given or rendered by them to the society. Covenant, art. 7, sec. 2. This contract is obligatory upon the plaintiffs, and is open to no legal or moral objection. <em>Waite </em>v.

The established order of this ministry includes four persons; two of each sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u201c Section 4. <em>Of the ministerial office in the several societies or communities. </em>We further acknowledge and declare, covenant, and agree that the ministerial office and authority in any society or community of our faith, which has emanated, or which may emanate, in a regular line of order from the centre of union aforesaid, is, and shall be acknowledged, owned, and respected, as the spiritual and primary authority of such society or community, in all matters pertaining to the ministerial office. And in case of the decease or removal of any individual of said ministry, in any such society, his or her lot and place shall be filled by agreement of the surviving ministers in council with the elders and others, as the nature of the case may require, together with the knowledge and approbation of the primary ministerial authority at New Lebanon aforesaid, to which they are responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\u201c Section 5. <em>Powers and duties of the ministry. </em>The ministry being appointed and established as aforesaid are vested with the primary-authority of the church and its various branches. Hence, it becomes their special duty to guide and superintend the spiritual concerns of the society as a body of people under their care and government, and in connection with the elders in their respective families and departments, who shall act in union with them, to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>and establish such orders, rules, and regulations as may be found necessary for the government and protection of the church and society within the limits of their jurisdiction, and also to counsel, advise, and judge in all matters of importance, whether spiritual or temporal. The said ministry are also invested with authority, in connection with the elders as aforesaid, to nominate and appoint to office ministers, elders, deacons, and trustees, and to assign offices of care and trust to such brethren and sisters as they, the said ministers and elders, shall judge to be best qualified for the several offices to which they may be appointed; and we do hereby covenant and agree that such nominations and appointments being made and officially communicated to those concerned, and receiving the general approbation of the church, or of the families concerned, shall thenceforth be confirmed and supported, until altered or revoked by the authority aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u201c Article <em>II.\u2014Institution of the Church. </em>\u2014 Section 1. <em>The object and design of church relation. </em>We further acknowledge and declare that the great object, purpose, and design of our uniting ourselves together as a church or body of people, in social and religious compact, is faithfully and honestly to occupy, improve, and diffuse the various gifts and talents, both of a spiritual and temporal nature, with which Divine wisdom has blest us for the service of God, for the honor of the Gospel, and for the mutual protection, support, comfort, and happiness of each other as brethren and sisters in the Gospel, and for such other pious and charitable purposes as the Gospel may require.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u201c Section 2. <em>Who are not admissible into church relation. </em>As the.unity, stability,- and purity of the church essentially depend on the character and qualifications of its members, and as it is a matter of importance that it should not be incumbered with persons who are under any involvement or incapacity, natural or moral: Therefore, no member of any company or association in business or civil concern, no copartner in trade, no person under any legal embarrassment or obligations of service, no minor, no slave or bond-servant, no insane person, no profane person, nor any person who lives in the wilful violation of the known and acknowledged principles of moral conduct, shall be deemed qualified for admission into the covenant relation and communion of the church.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\u201c Section 3. <em>Preparation for admission into church relation. </em>In order that believers may be prepared for entering into the sacred privilege of church relation, it is of primary importance that sufficient opportunity and privilege should be afforded under the ministry of the Gospel for them to acquire suitable instruction in the genuine principles of righteousness, honesty, justice, and true holiness, and also that they should prove their faith and Christian morality by their practical obedience to the precepts of the Gospel according to their instructions. It is also indispensably necessary for them to receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>the one uniting spirit of Christ, and to become so far of one heart and one mind, that they are willing to sacrifice all other relations for this sacred one. Another essential step is to settle all just and equitable claims of creditors and filial heirs, so that whatever property they may possess shall be justly their own. When this is done, and they feel themselves sufficiently prepared to make a deliberate and final choice, to devote themselves, with all they possess, wholly to the service of God, without reserve, and it shall be deemed proper by the leading authority of the church, after examination and due consideration, to allow them to associate together in the capacity of a church or a branch thereof in gospel order, they may then consecrate themselves and all they possess to the service of God forever, and confirm the same by signing and sealing a written covenant predicated upon the principles herein contained, and fulfilling, on their part, all its obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u201c Section 4. <em>Admission of new members. </em>As the door must be kept open for the admission of new members into the church, when fully prepared, it is agreed that each and every person who shall at any time after the date and fcx&amp;eution of the church covenant, in any branch of the community, be admitted into the church as a member thereof, shall previously have a fair opportunity to obtain a full, clear, and explicit understanding of the object and design of-the church covenant, and of the obligations it enjoins upon the members. For this purpose, he or she shall, in the presence of two of the deacons or acting trustees of the church, read, or hear the same distinctly read, so as to be able freely to acknowledge his or her full approbation and acceptance thereof in all its parts. Then he, she, or they (as the case may be) shall be at liberty to sign the same; and having signed and sealed it, and being subject to all the obligations required of the original signers, shall thenceforth be entitled to all the benefits and privileges thereunto appertaining; and the signature or signatures thus added shall be certified by the said deacons or trustees, together with the date thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\u201c Section 5. <em>Concerning youth and children. </em>Youth and children, being minors, cannot be received as members of the church possessing a consecrated interest in a united capacity, yet it is agreed that they may be received under the immediate care and government of the church, at the desire or consent of such person or persons as have a lawful right to or control of such minors, together with their own desire or consent.

Their number and order should correspond with that of the ministry. They are required to be persons of good understanding, of approved faithfulness and integrity, and gifted in spiritual administration. They must be selected and appointed by the ministry, who are to judge of their qualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u201c Section 2. <em>Duties of the elders. </em>As faithful watchmen upon the walls of Zion, it becomes the duty of the elders to watch over their respective families; to instruct the members in their respective duties; to counsel, encourage, admonish, exhort, and reprove as occasion may require; to lead the worship; to be examples to the members of obedience to the principles and orders of the Gospel, and to see that the orders, rules, and regulations pertaining to their respective families or departments are properly kept.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">\u201c Article Y. \u2014 <em>Of Family Deacons and Deaconesses. </em>\u2014 Section 1. <em>Their qualifications and appointments. </em>The office of family deacons and deaconesses has long been established in the church, and is essentially necessary for the care, management, and direction of the domestic concerns in each family, order, or branch of the church. They are required to be persons of correct and well grounded faith in the established principles of the Gospel, faithful in duty, closely united to their elders, and of sufficient capacity in business. Of the qualifications the ministry and elders by whom they are chosen and appointed must be the judges. Their number in each family is generally two of each sex, but may be more or less, according to the size of the family and the extent of their various duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">\u201c Section 2. <em>Their duties and obligations. </em>The deacons and deaconesses of families are intrusted with the care and oversight of the domestic concerns of their respective families. It is their duty to make proper arrangements in business; to maintain good order; watch over, counsel, and direct the members in their various occupations, as occasion may require; to make application to the office deacons or trustees for whatever supplies are needed in the several departments of the family; to maintain union, harmony, and good un. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>derstanding with the said office deacons; and to report to their elders the state of matters which fall under their cognizance and observation. But their power is restricted to the domestic concerns of their respective families and departments, and does not extend to any immediate or direct correspondence with those without the boundaries of the church. They have no immediate concern with trade and commerce; therefore it is not their business to puy and sell, nor in any way to dispose of the property under their care, except with the counsel and approbation of the trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u201c Article VI. <em>\u2014Privileges and Obligations of Members. </em>\u2014 Section 1. <em>Benefits and privileges of members in church relation. </em>The united interest of the church having been formed and established by the freewill offerings and pious donations of the members respectively, from the commencement of the institution, for the object and purposes already stated, it cannot be considered either as a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common, but as a consecrated whole, designed for and devoted to the uses and purposes of the Gospel forever, agreeable to the established principles of the church: Therefore it shall be held, possessed, and enjoyed by the church, in their united capacity, as a sacred and covenant right: That is to say, all and every member thereof, while standing in Gospel union and maintaining the principles of this covenant, \u00a1hall enjoy equal rights, benefits, and privileges, in the use of all things pertaining to the church, according to their several needs and circumstances ; and no difference shall be made on account of what any one has contributed and devoted, or may hereafter contribute and devote to the support and benefit of the institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">\u201c Section 2. <em>Proviso. </em>It is nevertheless stipulated and agreed that the benefits, privileges, and enjoyments secured by this covenant to the members of the church, shall not be considered as extending to any person who shall refuse to comply with the conditions of this association; or who shall refuse to submit to the admonition and discipline of the constituted authority of the church; or who shall wilfully depart from the principles and practice of those religious and moral obligations which have been established in the church, agreeable to the primitive faith and distinguished principles of this institution; of which refusal or non-compliance the leading authority acknowledged in the first article of this covenant shall be the proper and constitutional judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">\u201c Section 3. <em>Obligation of the members. </em>As subordination and obedience is the life and soul of every well regulated community, so our strength and protection, our happiness and prosperity, in our capacity of church members, must depend on our faithful obedience to the rules and orders established in the church, and to the instruction, counsel, and advice of its leaders.
