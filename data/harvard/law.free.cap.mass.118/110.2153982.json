There were also then living, grandchildren of the testator\u2019s father, bearing the name of Parker, Harleston, the son of Peter, then 19 years of age ; George, the son of Charles, then 12 years of age; James V., the son of Charles, then 10 years of age; Richard T., the son of James, then 11 years of age.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-6\">The testator died December 29, 1844, leaving all the above named children and grandchildren of his father surviving, except the grandchild George, the son of Charles. The testator\u2019s wife Anna survived him, and died in July, 1873. All the children and grandchildren before named, then and now living, are the petitioners James Parker, Richard T.

Parker, and the respondent, Harleston Parker.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>The property in question was devised to the testator by his father, under the following clause in the will of the latter: \u201c My house and farm in Roxbury aforesaid having, descended to me from my parents, I am desirous that it should be held by one of my children without division ; and as my son John is my oldest child, it appears to me more proper that it should be held by him than by either of my other children; and as his greater age and the situation in which he has been placed has enabled him to devote more of his time to my business and to render me greater services in that way than either of his brothers had an opportunity of doing, I think it just to give him the whole of the house and farm, furniture and farming utensils, without making any deduction for them from his share of my estate, notwithstanding the same may exceed in value the pieces of land I have given my other children ; and I do therefore hereby give and devise to my said son John, and his heirs forever, my country house and farm called my homestead.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b128-4\"><em>S.

W. Paine P. 0. </em>Prince, for the respondent,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbF\">contended that the respondent took a vested interest under the will, and that there were ho contingent interests to be represented by a trustee.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b128-6\">Gray, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEH\">The petition before us was presented to the judge of probate under the St. of 1874, <em>c. </em>388, \u00a7 2, which provides that in any proceedings for the assessment of damages sustained by the laying out of highways or the construction of waterworks for a city or town, \u201c when it shall appear that any interest is unrepresented by reason of any contingency or other cause by which the owner thereof is unknown or cannot then be ascertained, a guardian <em>ad litem </em>may be appointed by the tribunal wherein such proceedings are pending, to represent such interest, or the judge of probate for the county in which such proceedings are pending may, upon the petition of any party in interest, after such notice as he may order to all persons who, or whose issue unborn, may be or may become interested in such apportionment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>appoint a trustee, who, upon giving such bond as the judge of probate may require, shall represent such otherwise unrepresented interest, and shall receive, hold, manage and invest any sum which may be receivable on account of such interest in case of the apportionment aforesaid, for the benefit of the parties entitled to such interest, and shall pay the same over, principal and interest, to such parties whenever they become entitled thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">The appointment of this trustee is but a preliminary order with a view to secure a hearing in behalf of all possible interests in the matter to be tried. It is not an adjudication of title. The object and scope of the order are to designate a suitable person to represent those interests which are not now so vested that the owners thereof can come in to protect their own rights; not to require the nature and extent of those interests to be defined and determined in advance, and while the parties to whom such inters ests may belong or accrue are not before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">If the suggestion that there are or may be such interests appears, to the tribunal to which the application for such an appointment is made, to be frivolous or without reasonable grounds to support it, the application may properly be refused. But where, as in this case, there are reasonable grounds for such suggestion, a representative of those interests should be appointed, in order that, if and when it shall become necessary to adjudicate what those interests are, he may be heard upon all questions of law or fact involved in that adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">For these reasons, without expressing any further opinion upon the question which has been argued at the bar, we are of opinion that the decree of the judge of probate must be reversed, and the petition granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">That decree appears by the record to have been made <em>pro forma </em>and without argument, in accordance with a practice which is becoming much too common in the lower courts, and which tends to convert this court from an appellate tribunal, as contemplated by the statutes, into a court of original jurisdiction. If the judge of probate had performed his appropriate duty, of judicially hearing and considering the case, the parties and the court might have been spared an argument here upon a question which cannot, as now presented, be authoritatively determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">\n<em>Trustee to be appointed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
