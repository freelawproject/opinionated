Because the first count charges two separate and distinct offences. 2. Because each of said counts is indefinite, in that each count charges that the defendant had the charge or custody of a certain animal, which charge should not be in the alternative. 3. Because each count alleges cruelty to an animal, to wit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>a cow, without any allegation of ownership, or other description or identification. 4. Because each count of the complaint, while charging the defendant with having the charge or custody of an animal, fails to allege that the cruelty charged was unnecessary. 5. Because there is no allegation in any of said counts rendering it certain whether the defendant was in the charge or custody of said animal, as owner, or in some other capacity.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-4\">This motion was allowed as to the first count and overruled as to the rest.

Those counts sufficiently and properly allege the offence described in the first clause of the first section of the statute for the prevention of cruelty to animals. St. 1869. <em>c. </em>344. The defendant is indeed described as having the charge or custody of the animal upon which the cruelty was inflicted, but under this clause of the statute this statement in the complaint is not material, nor is it by its form made essentially descriptive of the offence. The act of cruelty committed by any one, without regard to the ownership or custody of the animal, is made an offence. The last part of the section provides for the offence of unnecessary cruelty or unnecessary failure to provide food, drink or shelter, chargeable to the person having the charge or custody of any animal. That is not the offence here charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">The words \u201chaving the charge or custody\u201d of the animal named are to be regarded as surplusage, and do not render these counts indefinite. Nor was it necessary to allege the ownership or otherwise describe the animal, or to charge that the cruelty was unnecessary. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McClellan, </em>101 Mass. 34. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lufkin, </em>7 Allen, 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
