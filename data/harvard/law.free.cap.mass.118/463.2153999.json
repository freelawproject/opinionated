The evidence was conflicting upon the question whether the side track had been purposely constructed for winter travel. At the time of the accident the plaintiff had been driving in his sjeigh along the lower track until he came to the bridge, and was turning up toward the crowned centre of the road, which at that point was worn smooth towards the sides by sleighs, when his horses slipped and fell over the side of the bridge. The jury were instructed, upon the question of the plaintiff\u2019s care, that if the accident was in any respect attributable to the plaintiff\u2019s being out of the proper or wrought track of the road, and would not have occurred if he had travelled in the wrought track, and he left the wrought road intentionally and for no reason except to get better sleighing, he would not be entitled to recover. <em>Held, </em>that this ruling was erroneous, and that the question whether the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care was for the jury.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A04\">Tort to recover for injuries to the plaintiff\u2019s horses and harnesses, alleged to have been caused by a defect in a highway in the defendant town.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>At the trial in the Superior Court, before Brigham, C.

On the side of this elevated way, until it reached the culvert, another well trodden pathway had been made by sleighs, which had passed along it to get better sleighing when the snow had blown from the higher part. It was lower in grade than the other, and corresponded in location with the ditch on that side. As it approached and crossed the bridge, it turned up into the turnpike, and then turned off again into the lower or ditch track. It was in evidence that no provision had been made for travellers to go down from the wrought to the side track, or to return therefrom. On the question whether this side track or winter road had been purposely constructed for winter travel, the evidence was conflicting.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">The plaintiff was in his sleigh at the time of the accident. He followed the line of sleigh travel as described, until he came to the bridge, and then turned up toward the crowned centre of the road, which at that point had been worn smooth by the sleighs, and was slippery towards the sides. One of his horses slipped, fell, finally went over the side of the bridge, and was drowned.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">In this aspect of the case, the jury were told, in connection with other instructions not excepted to, and not reported, \u201c that if the accident was in any respect attributable to the plaintiff\u2019s being out of the proper or wrought track of the road, and would not have occurred if the plaintiff had travelled in the wrought track, and if the plaintiff left the wrought road intentionally and for no reason except to get better sleighing, the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>This instruction is open to the objection that the question of the plaintiff\u2019s care was a question of fact, upon this evidence, for the jury. The jury might have found that the plaintiff was in the exercise of ordinary care in passing from one travelled path to the other ; and they might have found otherwise. But it could not be properly ruled as a matter of law that the conduct of the plaintiff here disclosed was conclusive upon that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">For this reason a new trial must be had, and it is not necessary to discuss the other instructions, or to determine whether they need qualification upon facts now presented, but which may be materially varied at the next trial. <em>Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
