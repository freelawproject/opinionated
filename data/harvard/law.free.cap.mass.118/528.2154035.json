Hearing before Dewey, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions in substance as follows\":</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-10\">The original action was in tort for deceit and conspiracy, in which the defendant and Samuel K. Elliott were charged with conspiracy to defraud the plaintiff by passing to him, as collateral security for Elliott\u2019s note of $800, a forged and fictitious promissory note, purporting to be for the sum of $750. See 116 Mass. 148. After verdict, at December term 1874, and before judg ment, the defendant moved to arrest judgment, set aside the ver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>diet, and grant a new trial, on the ground that since the verdict the plaintiff had received sufficient property of Elliott to pay or secure him for Elliott\u2019s note. The motion and affidavits annexed thereto were made part of the bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-4\">At the hearing, the defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the introduction of any oral evidence, either from the plaintiff or the defendant, to prove or disprove the affidavits, no affidavits having been filed by the plaintiff to oppose the motion, the facts not being of record upon which the motion was based, and the defendant having no notice of what the plaintiff would prove in opposition to the motion. The judge admitted evidence offered by the plaintiff in opposition to the allegations in the motion, and requested the defendant to produce his witnesses in court for examination, instead of hearing and deciding the case on the affidavits filed; to which the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-5\">It appeared by the affidavits and evidence in the case that, since the trial of the original suit, the plaintiff had exchanged about 1200 acres of western land, in Wayne County, Missouri, estimated at $18,000, in way of trade, and took in exchange therefor certain property in Chicago, Illinois, which he still holds; that said western land was conveyed to the plaintiff by one Lamb, by Spaulding paying about 75 cents an acre, being what Elliott was bound to pay to redeem the lands. The facts were in dispute as to the terms upon which Spaulding held the property, whether in trust for Elliott, or as security for the aforesaid note, or whether it was held by Spaulding free from any trust or obligation to Elliott.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-6\">The defendant asked. the judge to rule, as a matter of law, that, if the plaintiff held sufficient property, of any kind, which he received from Elliott, to pay him for the note, that the law itself would apply it, but the judge declined so to rule. The judge found that there was no agreement between the plaintiff and Elliott as to the property conveyed by Lamb to the plaintiff, and did not find that the plaintiff had received any property which he was bound to apply to the payment of the $800 note of Elliott; and overruled the motion for a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-7\">To the rulings of the presiding judge, and to the refusals to rule as requested, the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AFP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number><em>W.
