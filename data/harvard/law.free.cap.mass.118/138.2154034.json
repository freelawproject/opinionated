Trial before Bacon, J., who allowed a bill of exceptions in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-5\">A town meeting was held in Winthrop on June 10, 1872, in pursuance of a warrant dated May 31, 1872, containing the following articles: \u201cArticle 2, To see if the town will accept a street as laid out by the road commissioners, from Winthrop Street to Pleasant Street, or any part of said street. Article 3. To see if the town will build the street laid out by the road commissioners, or any part thereof, and raise money to pay for the same.\u201d The town voted \u201c that the town accept the plan for a street as laid out by the road commissioners, from Winthrop to Pleasant Street; \u201d and \u201c that the road commissioners be instructed to build the street as laid out by them, from Winthrop Street to Pleasant Street as accepted by the town.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-6\">It appeared that a plan entitled \u201c Plan of a proposed street in Winthrop,\u201d which showed the boundaries and admeasurements of various estates included within the \u25a0 proposed way, including the petitioner\u2019s, and bearing the following indorsement, signed by the town clerk: \u201c Town of Winthrop; filed in the office of the town clerk this the first day of June, 1872,\" was filed by the road commissioners, but not signed by them, in the office of the town clerk, on June 1, 1872; and that on June 3,1872, a paper, of which the following is a copy, was filed, signed by Albert Richardson and David Floyd: \u201cAmount of land taken from James Blaisdell, 10,104 feet, at .06 per foot, $606.24.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-7\">The plaintiff called th\u00a7 town clerk as a witness, who testified that Richardson and Floyd were the road commissioners for the town of Winthrop, and that the plan was produced in the town meeting aforesaid, and verbally explained by them to the inhab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>itants as they were about to act on the aforesaid ai tides. The road was in fact constructed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-4\">. The judge ruled that the plan and paper, filed as aforesaid, were not a sufficient compliance with the requirement of the statute; and ordered a verdict for the respondent. The petitioner alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b156-5\"><em>A.

St. of 1871, <em>e. </em>158. No town way laid out or altered by them can be accepted and allowed at a meeting of the town for such purpose, \u201c unless such laying out or alteration with the boundaries and admeasurements is filed in the office of the town clerk seven days at least before such meeting.\u201d Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>43, \u00a765.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">This provision is not a mere formality, but intended to lay down an indispensable condition, upon compliance with which the right bf appropriating private property to public uses of this description can alone be lawfully exercised. <em>Jeffries </em>v. <em>Swampscott, </em>105 Mass. 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">The plan filed by the road commissioners cannot be considered as satisfying the requirements of the statute. Even if it set forth the boundaries and admeasurements of the road and of the land proposed to be taken, it did not bear the signatures of the commissioners, nor did it even appear by the certificate of filing, indorsed by the town clerk, that it was filed by them.1 It bore no evidence that it was an authentic document proceeding from them, whip}' indicated that according to the boundaries and admeasurements as laid down upon it they proposed and reported the laying out of a town way.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">In <em>Jeffries </em>v. <em>Swampscott, supra, </em>there was a report filed by the selectmen, but without reference to a plan which was not filed it was not intelligible ; and it was held that, such plan not having been filed seven days before the town meeting, no report had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>filed, sufficient to satisfy the statute and authorize the taking of the landowner\u2019s property. Here no report whatever was filed; a plan was filed, but even if it had been properly authenticated, it was unintelligible for want of any reference to a report setting forth a laying out by the road commissioners in conformity therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Nor was this defect cured by the paper signed by the road commissioners stating the quantity and value of the land taken by them from the petitioner. It had no reference to the plan, alluded to no way or road laid out by them ; and the mere fact, that the quantity of land stated in this paper, and that which appeared upon the plan as belonging to the petitioner and included within the line of what is there laid down as a road, are similar, cannot connect the two papers together so as to make such a report of a laying out of a road as is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
