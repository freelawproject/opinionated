The record should have stated through whom the inhabitants of Leyden claimed the alleged appeal, as it did through whom it claimed to defend. <em>Sayles </em>v. Briggs, 4 Met. 421. <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>2 Gray, 115. The implication, however, clearly is that the town was represented throughout by the same person, namely, Mowry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-6\">2. It has never been decided in this Commonwealth that selectmen have not, by virtue of their general authority, power to defend an action of this kind. <em>Bursley </em>v. <em>Barnstable, </em>14 Gray, 106. <em>Walpole </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>11 Allen, 149. <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Charlestown, </em>7 Gray, 12. <em>Lexington </em>v. <em>Mulliken, </em>7 Gray, 280. <em>Clark </em>v. Russell, 116 Mass. 455.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-7\">3. The objection not having been taken on the return day of the writ, and Mowry having then been allowed to appear, it was too late to make it afterwards. The objection being made and entertained, and the town, being denied the right to defend through the person who appeared for it, could not then claim or be deemed to have taken an appeal through the same person, he having by the decision of the justice no standing in court for that purpose. This writ therefore can be maintained. <em>Skipwith </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>2 Mass. 35. <em>Putnam </em>v. Churchill, 4 Mass. 516.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number><em>A.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahc\">The appeal from the judgment of the justice of the.peace appears by his record to have been taken by the town, and does not appear to have been claimed in its behalf by a person unauthorized to represent it. The appeal would open to the appellant, in the Superior Court, the whole case, as to the law, the facts and the judgment, and render immaterial any irregularities in the judgment appealed from. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>6 Gray, 343. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Calhane, 108 Mass. 431. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Sheehan, Ib. 432 note. <em>Wallace </em>v. Brown, 5 Foster, 216. The appeal not having been entered in the Superior Court, that court, upon the complaint of the adverse party, rightly affirmed the judgment of the justice of the peace. Gen. Sts. <em>C. </em>120, \u00a7 27. <em>Noyes </em>v. Sherburne, 117 Mass. 279.
