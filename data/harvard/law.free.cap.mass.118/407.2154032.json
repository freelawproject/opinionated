The case was reserved by <em>Ames, </em>J., for the consideration of the full court, upon the pleadings and an agreed statement of facts, and appeared to be as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-4\">The testator by his will, dated September 28, 1855, and admitted to probate on July 21, 1857, after sundry legacies, by the sixth article thereof made the following bequest:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-5\">\u201c To my sister Almina C.

Frost, it is my will that my property should then be divided equally among all my brothers and sisters : if not living, the share of each to be divided equally among their children.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-6\">Wilder Carter, a brother of the testator, and Amanda Wilder, a sister, died before the will was made, both leaving children who are now living. At the date of the will the following brothers and sisters were living: Minot Carter, Theresa Carter and Hepzibah Carter, all of whom died before the testator, unmarried; \u25a0 Chandler Carter, who is now living ; and\"Almina Frost, who died . after the testator, leaving children who are now living.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b424-7\"><em>0. </em>6r. <em>Delano, </em>for Chandler Carter,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABE\">contended that the bequest, after the death of Almina Frost, was to the brothers and sisters as a class, and that the brother then surviving, being the only representative of the class, was entitled to the whole.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b424-8\"><em>S.

It follows that her children, as well as the children of his brother and of his sister who died before him, are each entitled as a class to one fourth of the residue, and the surviving brother to the other fourth. <em>Decree </em>accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
