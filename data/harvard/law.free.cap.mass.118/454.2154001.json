Sts. <em>c. </em>87, \u00a7 6, alleging that the defendant at Hinsdale, \u201c on the first day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five, with force and arms, at Hinsdale aforesaid, in the county aforesaid, and on divers other days and times between that day and the twenty-first day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-five, <em>knowingly, </em>willingly and unlawfully did keep and maintain a certain common nuisance, to wit: a tenement in said Hinsdale, there situate, then and on said other days and times there used for the illegal keeping and illegal sale of intoxicating liquors, against the peace of the Commonwealth, and contrary to the form of the statutes in such cases made and provided.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-9\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Rockwell, </em>J., on appeal, the defendant moved to dismiss the complaint and all proceedings, for the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-10\">\u201c 1.

The complaint does not set forth any offence with that degree of certainty and precision required under the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-3\">\u201c4. It is no offence to keep intoxicating liquors. Only the sale, keeping or exposing for sale is made an offence under the law of 1875. The complaint must be for illegal sales, not for keeping a nuisance. No action can be maintained for keeping a lommon nuisance.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-4\">The judge overruled the defendant\u2019s motion.

Van D. </em>Marie, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQm\">1. The complaint is drawn under the Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>87, \u00a7 6. This section makes any building used for the sale of intoxicating liquors, legally or illegally, a nuisance. The St. of 1875, <em>c. </em>99, authorizes the granting of licenses, when sales may be made legally. By \u00a7 22, all inconsistent acts or parts of acts are repealed. Section 6 of the Gen, Sts. <em>c. </em>87, being inconsistent therewith, is repealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b471-6\">2. The St. of 1875, <em>c. </em>99, regulates the sale of intoxicating liquor. By \u00a7 1, it is provided that nothing in said chapter contained shall apply to \u201c sales of cider and of native wines by the makers thereof,\u201d not to be drunk on the premises. There is no law requiring a person to have a license or any authority whatever for the purpose of selling cider or native wines, not to be drunk on the premises.. The defendant, relying on no license, appointment or authority for his justification in the trial of said action, the burden of proof changes to the Commonwealth, and the St. of 1864, <em>c. </em>121, does not apply. The Commonwealth must therefore set forth in the complaint and prove that the defendant had no license or authority, and that the liquors were sold to be drunk on the premises. \u201c It is an elementary principle of the criminal law, that a want of averment cannot be helped by evidence, and that a jury cannot convict a person of any crime, however clearly it may be proved, unless it is duly and technically set forth in the indictment.\u201d Bigelow, C. J., in <em>Green </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>12 Allen, 155, 171. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>16 Pick. 211.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b471-7\">The complaint should aver that the intoxicating liquors kept by the defendant were intoxicating liquors other than cider and native wine by the makers thereof, and not to be drunk on the premises.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number><em>C.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aut\">The St. of 1875, <em>c. </em>99, regulating the sale of intoxicating liquors, and repealing the previous statutes upon the same subject, did not repeal the nuisance act, Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>87, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7, on which this complaint is founded. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>100 Mass. 204.
