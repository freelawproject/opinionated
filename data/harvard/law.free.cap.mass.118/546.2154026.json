The railroad ran through the whole length of the seventy acres north of the road in a circular direction, not . far from the highway, leaving the largest portion of the cultivated land across the railroad from his house, above and in the same direction as the highway, cutting the seventy acres in two parts, and rendering necessary some provision for passing and repassing across the railroad in carrying on the farm. The county commissioners had provided, in their order, for a cart and cattle pass under the railroad, for two grade crossings, and another cattle pass, and had ordered the railroad corporation to provide and maintain these crossings in a suitable and convenient manner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b562-9\">The petitioner called as a witness one Ruggles, who testified that he resided about one fourth of a mile from the petitioner, that he had observed the provisions for the petitioner to cross the railroad, and the petitioner\u2019s mode and necessities in the management of his farm; that he had been in the habit of taking down and putting up bars himself as a farmer, and that there was another railroad in operation running through his farm. He was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>then asked the following question : \u201c What, in your opinion, ia the increased expense to the petitioner in carrying on his farm arising from the construction of this railroad through it as located?\u201d To this question the counsel for the respondent objected, on the ground that it was not a proper subject for the opinion of witnesses, and further that if it were a proper subject for opinions, the witness had shown no such qualifications as would be necessary. The presiding officer permitted the question to be put, and the respondent excepted. The witness answered: \u201c Fifty dollars per year.\u201d This matter of the inconvenient and expensive management of his farm, since the location of the railroad, was made by the petitioner an important element in his claim for damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b563-3\">The jury returned a verdict for the petitioner, which was accepted by <em>Colburn, </em>J., in the Superior Court, and the respondent appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b563-4\"><em>W.

If the effect of constructing the railroad through his land was to make it more inconvenient and expensive for him to cultivate and manage his remaining land, this might be, and there is nothing in the bill of exceptions to show that in this case it was not, an element proper for the consideration of the jury. The question how much his expenses of carrying on his remaining land in the future would be increased by the location of the railroad through his farm, is not one which is susceptible of demonstration as an existing fact. Like the questions which usually arise, when land is taken for a railroad or highway, of the value of the land taken, and of the appreciation or depreciation of the adjoining land, it is necessarily a matter of judgment and estimate. A witness who is acquainted with the land, and knows its capabilities and the proper mode of cultivating it, can form a more intelligent opinion than the jury, whose judgment, unless they can be aided by the opinions of such witnesses, must be formed solely upon a rapid view or a description of the premises. We are of \u2022pinion that the case at bar falls within the principle of the nu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>merous adjudications in this Commonwealth, which permit the opinions of competent witnesses to be given as to the value of land taken, or as to the damages or benefits to adjoining land, to aid the judgments of the jurors. <em>Vandine </em>v. Burpee, 13 Met. 288. <em>Walker </em>v. Boston, 8 Cush. 279. <em>Shaw </em>v. Charlestown, 2 Gray, 107. <em>West Newbury </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>5 Gray, 421. <em>Swan </em>v. <em>Middlesex, </em>101 Mass. 173. <em>Sexton </em>v. <em>North Bridgewater, </em>116 Mass. 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">The question whether a witness has the requisite knowledge to enable him to give his opinion is one which is largely within the discretion of the presiding judge or officer. In this case the witness was a farmer, having a farm near the petitioner\u2019s, which was divided by a railroad, who knew the petitioner\u2019s farm, his mode and necessities in the management of his farm and his means of crossing the railroad. We cannot see that the presiding officer erred in admitting his testimony. <em>Verdict accepted.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
