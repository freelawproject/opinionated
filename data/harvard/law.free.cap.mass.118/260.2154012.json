Wyeth, to recover a certain sum alleged to be due the bankrupt at the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings. Trial in the Superior Court, before Pitman, J., without a jury, who allowed a bill of exceptions in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-7\">Wyeth commenced bankruptcy proceedings December 8, 1873, and the plaintiff was appointed assignee January 15,1874. There was sufficient evidence that Wyeth was insolvent on and prior to December 3, 1873. The plaintiff, who was the only witness in the case, testified that some time in March, 1874, he called at the banking rooms of the defendant corporation to ascertain whether Wyeth had any credit account with the bank, to which the plaintiff, as assignee, would be entitled ; that the officers of the bank, the president being present, examined their books, and in answer to his inquiry stated to the plaintiff that prior to December 3 1873, there was due to Wyeth from the bank the sum of $800 but that on that day Wyeth assigned or transferred his account to one Parker; that the plaintiff thereupon notified the officers that he claimed the amount of said credit account as assignee of the estate of Wyeth, and forbade their paying the same to any other person.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-8\">Upon this evidence, the defendant offering none, the judge ruled, as matter of law, that the plaintiff had failed to make out a case that entitled him to recover, and ordered judgment for the defendant.

The ruling, without settling that fact, that as matter of law the plaintiff had failed to make out a case that entitled him to recover, was erroneous. <em>Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
