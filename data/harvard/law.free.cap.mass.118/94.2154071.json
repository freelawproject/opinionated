Whether the instrument of assignment was such as to entitle the defendants to prove that the reissue was invalid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-5\">2. Whether the reissue was void by reason of the facts set forth in the report, which are not now important to be stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-6\">If the court should decide either of these questions in the negative, the plaintiff was to have judgment for the whole amount of the notes, with interest. If the court should decide both questions in the affirmative, and should further hold that the defendants were entitled to an apportionment or abatement of the amount of the notes, the case was to be sent to an assessor to determine the amount thereof.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-7\"><em>G.

Gilmore, of Painesville in the county of Lake and State of Ohio, in consideration of one dollar and other good and valuable consideration, to me in hand paid by Walter Aiken and Charles L. Aiken, both of Franklin in the county of Merrimack and State of New Hampshire, do hereby sell, assign and transfer to them all the right, title and interest I have in and to the following described patents; to wit, one bearing date January 26, 1869, and numbered 86,297, issued to myself and one Leonard Anderson as the inventors of a new and useful 1 improved machine for dressing millstones; \u2019 another bearing date May 26, 1863, and numbered 38,670, issued to myself as the inventor of a new and useful 1 improvement in machinery for dressing or working stone.\u2019 The other bears date October 28, 1862, originally issued to myself, and reissued to Leonard Anderson, of said Painesville, on the date aforesaid, which said reissue is numbered 3279, and is for a new and useful 1 improved machine [for] tramming, staffing and fine-dressing of millstones,\u2019 and assigned by said Anderson to myself.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\u201c Also I hereby sell, assign and transfer to said Walter Aiken and Charles L. Aiken all my right, title and interest in a petition for a patent now pending before the commissioner of patents at Washington in the name of myself and John S. Crane, of Franklin aforesaid, whether the said patent has already been granted and allowed or not, the same being for a further improvement in machines or machinery for dressing and working stone.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\u201c To have and to hold the same to the said Walter Aiken and Charles L. Aiken, their heirs and assigns, for the full term for which the same were granted, and for which the last aforesaid patent may Be granted, as fully and entirely as the same would have been or could have been held and enjoyed by me had this assignment and sale not been made; with the further right to whatever extension, if any, may be granted for either of said patents by the commissioner of patents or Congress; and I hereby authorize said Walter Aiken and Charles L. Aiken, or their assigns, to use my name, aid and assistance if the same shall be necessary at any time for any purpose in getting said extension of either or all of said patents; and I hereby agree to assign to them at any time any right which may hereafter be acquired by them in connection with or relating to said patents by extension or otherwise in my name, upon the condition that I shall be in no way charged with any expense in relation to such right or extension; and I do hereby covenant with said Walter Aiken and Charles L. Aiken that I will do no act which shall in any way impair tne right I now have to said patents or either of them and hereby assigned to them,</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">\u201c Witness my hand and seal this twenty-second day of April a. d. 1871.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">\u201c James T.

Frank Walton.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Gray, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aya\">The extent of the interest undertaken to be con veyed by the plaintiff to the defendants, and of the obligation or estoppel created by such conveyance, depends upon the terms of the written instrument of assignment executed by him to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">By that instrument, he sells, assigns and transfers to them only the right, title and interest which he has in three patents, one issued to himself and Anderson, a second issued to himself, and a third issued to himself and reissued to Anderson. The further clause, in the nature of a habendum, \u201c to have and to hold the same \u201d \u201c for the full term for which the same were granted,\u201d is equally limited by the words <em>\u201c </em>as fully and entirely as the same would have been or could have been held and enjoyed by me had this assignment and sale not been made.\u201d The grant is not enlarged, so far as regards the question before us, by the further grant of rights in any extensions of the patents, or by the agreement for further assignment. And the only express covenant is that the plaintiff \u201c will do no act which will in any way impair the right I now have to said patents or either of them and hereby assigned to them.\u201d The assignment is in the nature of a quitclaim deed of whatever right, title or interest the plaintiff has or may acquire in the patents specified, and creates no warranty that either of the patents was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The validity of the first and second patents and of the original issue of the third patent is not denied. The transfer of the plaintiff\u2019s rights in those was a legal, and there are no facts in the case upon which the court can say that it was not a sufficient, consideration for the notes sued on.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">According to the terms of the report, therefore, upon which the case has been reserved for our determination, there must be <em>Judgment for the plaintiff for the whole </em>amount.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
