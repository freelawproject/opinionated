J., who allowed a bill of exceptions in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-6\">There was evidence tending to show that the plaintiff, practising as a physician in Hinsdale, and having an established reputa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>fciou and practice as such, being about to remove to Ann Arbor, in the State of Michigan, to engage in practice as a physician there, and in connection with his duties as demonstrator of anatomy in the university there, part of the year, sold to the defendant his real estate in Hinsdale, and certain personal property there, and introduced the defendant as a physician to succeed the plaintiff in the practice of medicine in Hinsdale. The defendant entered upon the business of a physician there, and continued in the same until the fall of 1870, when the plaintiff and defendant executed the contract declared on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-4\">There was also evidence tending to show that the terms, on which the defendant succeeded to the plaintiff in practice, did not include a stipulation or promise on the part of the plaintiff that he would not continue in, or return to, the practice of medicine in Hinsdale; that about the time the contract was made, the plaintiff came to Hinsdale with the design of resuming practice there, and had attended to one case in Hinsdale before the contract, with the defendant\u2019s knowledge. The defendant testified that he did not know of such intention on the part of the plaintiff ; that he did not communicate such intention to the defendant ; but the defendant, from statements made by the plaintiff as to his business in Ann Arbor, fearing that he might so resume practice, and on account of representations of the plaintiff that they together in partnership might greatly increase the business, reluctantly entered into the agreement of partnership which the plaintiff urgently proposed. The parties contradicted each other as to whether the amount lost by the plaintiff upon the sale and disposition of certain articles of personal property was to be paid by the defendant as part of the terms of the defendant\u2019s succeeding the plaintiff in the practice of medicine, and whether said loss was taken into consideration in the stipulation in the contract of partnership that the defendant would pay the plaintiff $200, on his withdrawal before sharing in the business. There was also conflicting testimony as to the time when the plaintiff was to commence business under the partnership contract, the defendant testifying that the plaintiff was to commence precisely on April 1,1871, and the plaintiff that it was to be about April 1, 1871, subject to his convenience in closing his lecture season at Ann Arbor. There was no communication between the parties from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>the time of the execution of the contract until the defendant wrote to the plaintiff on April 7, 1871, stating that he saw that the plaintiff did not intend to return to practise for the summer, charging the plaintiff with fraud, with inducing him to enter into the contract, and declaring that, should the plaintiff return, he should decline to enter into partnership with him. To this letter the plaintiff replied on April 17, 1871, charging the defendant with treating him badly, and saying that the only thing else called for by the contract was the payment of $200. The plaintiff never came to practise under the contract, or offered so to do. The plaintiff claimed at the trial damages for the refusal of the defendant to take him in partnership, and also the $200 mentioned in the contract. There was no evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s withdrawal except as above stated, or of the refusal by the defendant to take the plaintiff as a partner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-4\">The defendant requested the judge to rule \u201c that the stipulation that the plaintiff, on withdrawal or ceasing to do business without having shared in the benefit at all, should be entitled to $200, is on the face of the contract not mutual, and is without consideration ; that the contract is by its terms for a partnership commencing immediately, and determinable at the will of the parties without damage to either party, except as provided in respect to horse and carriage ; that at least it is so determinable by the defendant ; that if the plaintiff did not enter into the contract in good faith, but with the intent not to go into business under it, and only to withdraw and claim the sum of $200, he cannot recover anything under the contract; that if the plaintiff neglected to begin business under the contract at the time he agreed to begin, the defendant might afterwards refuse to receive the plaintiff as a partner and treat the contract as annulled; that the plaintiff is not entitled to $200 as for his withdrawal before he was to commence business under the contract; that if the defendant, before the plaintiff was to begin business under the contract, notified the plaintiff that he would not take him as a partner, it was still the duty of the plaintiff to be ready and willing to enter upon the partnership and offer to do so at the time he agreed to do so ; that if the plaintiff had a right to reestablish himself in practice in Hinsdale, his withdrawal from the contract would be no benefit to the defendant, and in this respect there would be no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>consideration for the $200 ; that the plaintiff cannot recover both the $200 as for withdrawal, and damages for refusal by the defendant to go on with the partnership.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-4\">The judge declined to give these instructions, and instructed the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-5\">\u201c A contract, between a physician, who is in the possession of a medical and surgical practice in a specified district or town, with another physician, for a partnership in such practice providing that the physician in such possession shall pay to the physician $200, if he, the latter, shall withdraw from the contract, without having shared the benefit of that practice at all, is not a contract without consideration in law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-6\">\u201c If the plaintiff had, before the date of the written contract, been a physician and surgeon at Hinsdale and vicinity, having a reputation there in such profession, and was about to resume the business at Hinsdale, the agreement of the defendant to pay $200 if .the plaintiff should withdraw from the contract and cease to do such business at Hinsdale, would be for a valid consideration, if the defendant never after did such business there.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-7\">The question of damages for the defendant\u2019s refusal, if any, was submitted to the jury with instructions, but the jury returned no damages on that account, but returned as damages the $200 mentioned in the contract, with interest, upon the direction of the presiding judge that the plaintiff was at any rate entitled to that sum and interest under the first instruction above given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-8\">To these rulings, and to the refusal to instruct as requested, the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b509-9\"><em>8. T. </em>Spaulding, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b509-10\"><em>A. J. </em>Fargo, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b509-11\">Wells, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQq\">The contract provides that \u201c if the party of the first part shall withdraw from this contract and cease to do business in Hinsdale, without having shared the benefit of this business at all, then the said Seymour shall pay the said party of the first part the sum of two hundred dollars.\u201d This stipulation implies that the plaintiff might so withdraw at any time, even before entering upon any participation in the business contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">At the trial, the court refused to rule, as requested by the defendant, \u201cthat the plaintiff is not entitled to $200, as for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>withdrawal before he was to commence business under the contract,\u201d and did rule that a contract providing for such a withdrawal was not a contract without consideration in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">It would follow from these rulings that the plaintiff would be entitled to recover the $200, if he had so withdrawn, without regard to any consideration for the agreement to pay that sum, except what was furnished in the written contract itself; and it was apparently so ruled at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Construing the contract in the mode suggested, and as it was apparently construed at the trial, there would be no consideration for the defendant\u2019s agreement to pay $200, so long as the contract remained wholly executory. There would no mutuality, because the plaintiff was under no obligation to proceed or to do anything in its execution; and the contract itself conferred no new rights or advantages upon the defendant, and recites none as having been conferred. If the defendant had in fact gained any advantage from the making of the contract of partnership, by reason of the previous reputation of the plaintiff and his withdrawal from business in that vicinity ; or if it had appeared that the contract was entered into by the defendant in view of such expected advantage; that might have furnished sufficient consid* eration.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The second instruction, given at the request of the plaintiff, being to that effect, was correct. But the first instruction or ruling before referred to authorized and required the jury to return a verdict for the $200, if the plaintiff had so withdrawn, without regard to proof of any consideration except what was to be derived from the written contract itself. This was erroneous, <em>Goward </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>98 Mass. 596. <em>Exceptions sustained.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
