The declaration alleged that the defendants printed and published of the plaintiff a certain article or item in their newspaper containing amongst other matter the following: \u201c It appears that Elbridge G. Woodard, whose wife (meaning the plaintiff) is employed in the kitchen of the Mansion House, had heard from intercepted letters, that one Bailey, a blacksmith of Shelburne Falls, had planned an elopement with Mrs. W. (meaning the plaintiff.)\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-5\">The answer contained a demurrer assigning for cause that the words above set forth were not actionable, and upon a fair construction of them cast no imputation upon the plaintiff\u2019s character ; and also contained a general denial of all the material allegations of the plaintiff, except those as to the printing and publishing of the libel, which were admitted, and alleged, by way uf justification, the truth of what was published, that the same was privileged as being \u201c current news of the day,\u201d and that the plaintiff\u2019s character had not been damaged thereby.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-6\">In the Superior Court, Aldrich, J., overruled the demurrer, and the case proceeded to trial upon the above issues.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-7\">The plaintiff called her husband Elbridge G. Woodard as a witness, who, upon cross-examination, testified that he had never told any person that he had taken a letter from the post-office addressed to his wife from Bailey, of the purport mentioned in the alleged libel, or that he had intercepted any such letter, and he specially denied that he had ever told Euclid Owen, or S. D. Bardwell, that he had taken such letter from the post-office, or intercepted any such letter, or that he had said to them anything of that kind, and denied that he had told the last named persons that he had destroyed such letter. Against the plaintiff\u2019s objection the defendants were allowed to call said Owen and Bardwell, both of whom testified that the husband of the plaintiff had told them that he took a letter from the post-office addressed to his wife, that he opened it, and found it was from Bailey; that it appeared from it that Bailey was going to Greenfield to see his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>(Woodard\u2019s) wife; that he caught Bailey when he came according to +he appointment in the letter; and that he (Woodard) had destroyed that letter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-4\">The judge instructed the jury that they might consider this evidence of Owen and Bardwell, so far as it tended to contradict the plaintiff\u2019s husband in what he had testified contrary thereto but that the evidence was not competent to prove the truth of the alleged libel against the plaintiff, or to prove that Woodard did in fact receive or destroy such a letter, or that there ever was such a letter taken from the post-office, or to prove the contents of the letter. The evidence upon the other parts of the case in issue was conflicting. The rulings of the judge with reference to them and the entire case, except in the above particular, were acquiesced in by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the defendants; and the plaintiff excepted to the admission, of the above evidence, and to tho ruling and instruction of the judge with reference to the same.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b421-6\"><em>O. G-. </em>Delano, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b421-7\"><em>C. Q.

The bill of exceptions implies, in the statement of his cross-examination, that he had testified in chief that he had received no such letters, or at least \"contains nothing to show that he had not so testified. The plaintiff therefore fails to sustain the \u00a1burden, resting upon her as the excepting party, of showing that the evidence admitted to contradict him and impeach his credibility was irrelevant or incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
