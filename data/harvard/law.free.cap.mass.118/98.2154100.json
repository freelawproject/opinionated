Each note recited that the defendant deposited therewith as collateral security a mortgage of $2500 signed by G. H. Robinson, recorded with Suffolk deeds, lib. 1152, fol. 221 and 223 respectively, with authority to sell the same with notice either at public or private sale or otherwise at the option of the holder or holders of the notes on the non-performance of the promises therein contained, he or they giving the defendant credit for any balance of the net proceeds of such sale remaining after paying all sums due him to the said holder or holders or to his or their order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-7\">At the trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Bacon, </em>J., the signatures of the maker of the notes were admitted. The plaintiff testified that he still held the mortgages of real estate and mortgage notes of $2500 each, mentioned in the notes in suit, which were assigned to him as collateral to those notes, when they were given, and had never in any way disposed of them or foreclosed the mortgages; that he deducted the interest from the principal in the notes when they were given, so that he really advanced to the defendant about $1200 on account of each note in suit and no more.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>The defendant offered to prove in defence that after the notes in suit were given, as well as after they matured, there was a verbal agreement made between him and the plaintiff that the plaintiff should either sell and dispose of said mortgages and mortgage notes or foreclose the mortgages by selling the premises under the power of sale in the mortgages and pay himself out of the proceeds the amount of the notes in suit, and the balance to the defendant; and in consideration thereof the defendant was to allow and pay him two per cent, a month on the amount of the notes till he got his money in one of those ways ; that that was the way and means by which, according to the verbal agreement, the notes in suit were to be paid; but the judge excluded the evidence, and, the defendant not offering any other evidence, ordered a verdict for the plaintiff.

The new agreement relied on was not performed by the defendant, or prevented in its performance by the plaintiff 5 nor does it appear that the plaintiff agreed to accept the defendant\u2019s promise alone as a satisfaction of his debt. An agreement with mutual promises to perform, upon which the parties have a legal remedy, may, it is said, be pleaded as a good accord and satisfaction, when the plaintiff accepts the new promise and relies upon it for his only remedy. But there must be this agreed substitution of the new for the old cause of action, or the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover upon the original undertaking is not defeated. In addition to this, the alleged promise of the plaintiff to rely upon the securities held by him for the payment of his notes was made solely in consideration of an oral promise by the defendant to pay a higher rate of interest. Upon such a promise the plaintiff is without legal remedy, because, by statute, a rate of interest higher than six per cent, cannot be recovered by action, unless the agreement to pay the same is in writing. St. 1867, <em>c. </em>56, \u00a7 2. There could, therefore, be no substitution of the latter promise for the defendant\u2019s personal liability as maker of the notes within the rule as above stated. <em>Good </em>v. <em>Cheesman, </em>2 B. &amp; Ad. 328. <em>Reeves </em>v. <em>Hearne, </em>1 M. <em>&amp; </em>W. 323. <em>Bige</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number><em>low </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>1 Gray, 245. <em>Goodrich </em>v.
