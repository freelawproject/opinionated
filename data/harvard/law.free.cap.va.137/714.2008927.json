Are taxes owing by the taxpayer to the Federal government \u201cbills,\u201d or \u201caccounts payable,\u201d within the meaning of subsection \u201c2\u201d of paragraph \u201csecond\u201d of -section 8 (\u201cSchedule C\u201d) of the tax bill statute, approved March 6, 1918 (Acts 1918, pp. 171, <em>et seq.)?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">The question must be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">The property of the taxpayer which was assessed for taxation in the instant case consisted wholly of '\u201cbills and accounts receivable.\u201d This is a distinct kind of property, different from \u201cstock on hand,\u201d \u201cmachinery and tools not taxed as real estate,\u201d \u201cmoney on hand and on deposit,\u201d and \u201call other property of any kind whatsoever, including all * * (other) demands and claims\u201d employed in the trade or business of the taxpayer. \u201cBills and accounts receivable\u201d are of course \u201cdemands\u201d or \u201cclaims;\u201d but, as appears from the express language of the statute, they are a peculiar kind of demands or claims, different from all other demands \u2022or claims \u201cwhatsoever.\u201d It is manifest from the terms of the statute that the \u201cexcess of bills and accounts receivable,\u201d which is taxable thereunder as \u201ccapital,\u201d is to be ascertained by deducting from the total thereof \u2022only the amount of \u201cbills and accounts payable,\u201d which \u25a0 are the same kind of demands or claims as \u201cbills and accounts receivable,\u201d with the single exception that the latter are owing to (\u201creceivable\u201d by), and the former . are owing by (\u201cpayable\u201d by) the taxpayer. It is plain) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>therefore, that it is not every kind of demand or claim, owing by the taxpayer which the statute allows to be deducted from the total of his \u201cbills and accounts receivable,\u201d in order to ascertain the \u201cexcess\u201d thereof which is taxable as \u201ccapital\u201d but only such demands, and claims owing by him as would be \u201cbills and accounts receivable\u201d if they were owing to (\u201creceivable\u201d by), instead of being owing by (\u201cpayable\u201d by) him.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Now, as to the meaning of the terms \u201cbills and. accounts receivable\u201d and \u201cbills and accounts payable;\u201d these terms have a well understood technical meaning.. According to that meaning they embrace only contract obligations, express or implied. Blake\u2019s Law Dictionary (2d ed.), pp. 16, 134; 1 Words and Phrases, p. 87; 1 Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, pp. 63, 243; 1 C. J. .730. As appears from these authorities \u201caccounts receivable\u201d are contract obligations \u201cowing to a person oil open account;\u201d \u201cbills receivable\u201d are all other contract obligations \u201cowing to\u201d a person; \u201caccounts payable\u201d are contract obligations owing by a person on open account; and \u201cbills payable\u201d are all other contract obligations owing by a person. Such obligations do not include taxes, State or Federal, as the latter are not contract obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">In 1 Cooley on Taxation (3d ed.), page 17, this is said::</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">\u201cTaxes not Debts.\u2014* * taxes are not contracts between party and party, either express or implied; but they, are the positive acts of government, through its-various agents, binding upon the inhabitants, and to the making and enforcing of which their personal consent is not required. * * They are not the subject of set-off * * on behalf of the person taxed, as against (the) State, municipality or collector. * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">To the same effect see 37 Cyc. 710; 26 R. C. L. p. 26; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>City of East Orange, </em>95 N. J. Law, 365, 111 Atl. 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>The ease of <em>Felker </em>v. <em>Standard Yarn Co., </em>148 Mass. 226, 19 N. E. 220, is relied on for the plaintiff in error taxpayer as a contrary holding. That was a case in which the collector of taxes filed a bill to enforce the payment of taxes assessed upon the real and personal property of the defendant company under a statute (Pub. St. 1882, e. 12, \u00a720), which provided as follows: \u201cWhen a person taxed * * neglects to pay his tax for one year after it is committed to the hands of the collector, the collector may, in his own name, maintain an action of contract, or trustee process, therefor, in like manner as for his own debt. The court held that the tax was a debt within the meaning of this statute and that the suit was maintainable under its provisions. The case is plainly not in point in the instant case, for the reason that the peculiar terms of the statute required such holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">That the holding of the authorities on the subject is as above stated, is not controverted in argument before us in behalf of the plaintiff in error taxpayer. It is, however, urged in his behalf that when the statute in question (subsection \u201c2\u201dof paragraph \u2018 \u2018second\u201d of section 8, \u201cSchedule C\u201d) is read along with section 2304 of the Code of 1919 and with the \u201cfirst\u201d paragraph of said section 8, it becomes apparent that the statute in question does not use the terms \u201cbills and accounts payable\u201d with the aforesaid technical meaning, but with the meaning of <em>all debts, claims, or demands whatsoever, </em>owing by the taxpayer, which would include the Federal taxes in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Section 2304 of the Code (1919), so far as material, is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Construction of the Revenue Laws.\u2014In addition to the rules of construction prescribed by chapter two of this Code, the following rules of construction shall apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>the law for the assessment and eolleetion of taxes, unless such, construction should be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">\u201cThe word \u2018credits\u2019 shall be construed to mean <em>all solvent </em>debts, <em>claims or demands </em>owing or coming <em>to </em>any person, whether the evidence of such debts, claims or demands be in writing or not, * * .\u201d (Italics supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The word \u201ccredits\u201d is not used in the subsection of the statute in question. Moreover, we find this word only in the \u201cthird\u201d paragraph of said section 8 (\u201cSchedule C\u201d), and it is there used to designate property upon which the statute means to impose taxation, and not to designate deductions which the taxpayer is entitled to' make from taxable property. And that such is the meaning of the word \u201ccredits\u201d as used in said section 2304 is indeed apparent from the very terms there used,, defining \u201ccredits\u201d as \u201csolvent\u201d debts, claims or demands owing or coming <em>to </em>any person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">The \u201cfirst\u201d paragraph of said section 8 imposes taxation upon certain bonds and other ehoses in action (which consist of contract obligations alone), and does allow the deduction by the taxpayer from the aggregate amount of such form .of property \u201cof all <em>such </em>* * demands or claims * * owing to others (by him) as principal debtor.\u201d But, manifestly, from the very terms of' this portion of the statute the deductions allowed are confined to obligations of the taxpayer which are of the same kind as those on which this paragraph of the statute imposes taxation, namely, contract obligations of the taxpayer, not taxes owning by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">Moreover, as this court held in <em>Bridgewater Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Funkhouser, </em>115 Va. 476, 79 S. E. 1074, each classification of property made by statute imposing taxation stands alone so far, as determining whether any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>deductions can be allowed from the aggregate amount thereof, and, if any, what deductions. In that ease this is said* * The lawmaking power alone must determine whether such an allowance shall be made * * and, if made, against what forms of property the deduction shall be allowed and to what extent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Examples are cited in argument for the plaintiff in error of claims which might arise owing to the taxpayer from sources other than contracts which would be taxable to the corporation as capital, such as claims arising out of condemnation of the property of the corporation for public use, or out of a tort committee against the corporation, and it is urged that if such claims are taxable they are deductible. But the error in this assumption consists in this: Such claims would be taxable, but not as \u201cbills and accounts receivable.\u201d They would be taxable under subsection 5 of the aforesaid statute as \u201call other * * demands and claims,\u201d and from such form of property the statute allows no deduction whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">The ease will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
