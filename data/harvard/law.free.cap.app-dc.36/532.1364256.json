K. Landespriv. Milly-Kerzen-Seifen und Grlyeerin-Fabrik Yon F. A. Sarg\u2019s Sohn &amp; Company, applied for registration of \u201cKalodont\u201d as a trademark for tooth paste, and were opposed by appellees, Hall and Kuckel, on the ground that they had used \u201cSozodont\u201d as a trademark on similar preparations for many years prior to any use of \u201cKalodont,\u201d and that the latter so nearly resembles the former as to be calculated to mislead, deceive, and confuse, and to result in interference and conflict in trade. The opposition was sustained by the Examiner, whose decision was affirmed on appeal to the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The finding that the appellees had used \u201cSozodont\u201d as a trademark long prior to the date of use claimed for \u201cKalodont\u201d is fully supported by the evidence. There was no evidence of any actual confusion in trade. Witnesses for appellees expressed opinions that it would be the result should appellants\u2019 goods be put on general retail sale. Some testimony on the part of appellants tended to show, from a very limited observation, that confusion had not resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The decision turned substantially upon \u201cthe judgment 'of the eye\u201d in the comparison of the two words. Comparing the marks we have come to a different conclusion. We think that the case is governed by <em>Hall v. Ingram, </em>28 App. D. C. 454, where it was held that there was no such misleading resemblance between \u201cSozodont\u201d and \u201cZodenta.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The decision will be reversed, and this decision will be certified to the Commissioner of Patents. <em>Reversed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
