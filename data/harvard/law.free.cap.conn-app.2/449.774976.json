Because we conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, principles of fundamental fairness to the plaintiff outweigh a consideration of caseflow management, we find error in the dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">The facts are not in dispute. On June 22,1977, Officer Joseph Civitello of the East Haven police department was driving a suspect to the police station when, according to the complaint in this action, he was run off the road and assaulted by the defendant, Francis Paranto, Sr. The police officer was injured, and East Haven furnished him with medical and surgical care and with workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">The plaintiff town of East Haven brought the present suit against the defendant for reimbursement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>benefits paid. Paranto denied the allegation in the complaint, and counterclaimed for damages for assault and false restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The case was scheduled to be tried at three different times prior to the time in question. Each time it was scheduled, the case was postponed at the request of the defendant\u2019s counsel. Finally, the case was scheduled on a trial list for August 10, 1982, and it was reached on August 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">On August 11, the town\u2019s attorney moved for a one day postponement because of the unavailability of Civitello, a material witness. In support of its motion for postponement, the town presented the testimony of the sheriff who said that he had been unable, despite repeated attempts, to serve a subpoena upon Civitello, although he thought he could serve him if he were \u201cgiven a couple of days to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The court denied the motion for postponement and dismissed the complaint, sua sponte. From this dismissal, the town appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The town claims that \u201c[n]othing in our jurisprudence permits the dismissal of an action for failure to have present in court a material witness at the commencement of a civil trial.\u201d It maintains that this dismissal was not a proper dismissal pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 251<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for failure to prosecute with due diligence, nor was it proper to dismiss under Practice Book \u00a7 302 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>failure to make out a prima facie case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The town further maintains that it should have been allowed to try to meet its burden of proof with the evidence which was available. To foreclose that possibility was, it claims, an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The defendant takes the position that it was a proper dismissal under Practice Book \u00a7 251 and points out that the town had a full day from the start of the list to the call of the case within which to subpoena the police officer. The defendant also cites the court\u2019s caseflow management powers as authority for the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">After denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion to postpone, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">\u201cThe Court: Counselor, the Motion to Postpone is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">\u201cMr. Reilly: May I have an exception, your Honor?</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">\u201cThe Court: You may have an exception. And, the Complaint is dismissed. And also the Counterclaim is also dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">\u201cMr. Reilly: May I have an exception to the Complaint being dismissed because of the absence of the material witness? I did have certain medical reports which counsel at one time told me she would stipulate to, medical bills, police reports which I would attempt to introduce. I object to the matter being dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">\u201cThe Court: Okay. Counselor, it is noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">\u201cMrs. Wise: Is it with prejudice?</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Yes. Both dismissals are with prejudice, on the Complaint and on the Counterclaim.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Failure to have a material witness in court at the commencement of the trial is not grounds, in and of itself, for a dismissal of the action. The court\u2019s judgment was not a proper dismissal for failure to prosecute an action with reasonable diligence; Practice Book \u00a7 251; or for failure to make out a prima facie case. Practice Book \u00a7 302. The plaintiff was never allowed to get out of the starting gate.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The court\u2019s action was precipitate and summary in the extreme. The colloquy between the court and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel shows only a minimal offer of proof that counsel was prepared to offer evidence. He did, however, properly object to the matter being dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">The plaintiff claims in its brief that it was \u201cready and prepared to proceed with other evidence [citing the colloquy quoted above], besides the testimony of Mr. Civitello, and had another witness present in the courtroom and ready to testify and others under subpoena.\u201d There is no claim, however, that these matters were brought to the attention of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">This factor is irrelevant, however, since the plaintiff was entitled, under fundamental due process, to be heard. \u201c \u2018[D]ue process of law requires that the rights of no man shall be judicially determined without affording him a day in court and an opportunity to be heard.' <em>State ex rel.

Ct. 652, 94 L.

App. 377, 478 A.2d 1044 (1984); but see <em>State </em>v. <em>Beckenbach, </em>1 Conn. App. 669, 676-77, 476 A.2d 591 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">An examination of the background of each of these cases, however, reveals clear patterns of delay and foot-dragging which can play havoc with urgently needed caseflow management. The straw that broke the camel\u2019s back in <em>Gionfrido </em>involved a plaintiff\u2019s attorney who \u201clost track of time\u201d during a luncheon recess and didn\u2019t show up until 2:26 p.m. for a 2 p.m. starting time. <em>Gionfrido </em>v. <em>Wharf Realty, Inc., </em>supra, 31. In upholding the court\u2019s dismissal under Practice Book \u00a7 251, Chief Justice Speziaie noted that \u201cthe trial court, <em>Higgins, J., </em>was confronted by a history of delay in this case.\u201d Id., 32. In <em>Thode </em>v. <em>Thode, </em>supra, Chief Justice Speziaie spoke for the court in upholding the trial court, <em>Higgins, J., </em>who, as presiding judge, had denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance made on the day of trial so that the defendant went to trial represented by an attorney who was not his attorney of choice. The court carefully pointed out that the defendant\u2019s attorney had inadequate communication with his client who did not find out until 5 p.m. on the day before the trial that this regular attorney would be out of town. <em>Thode </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>v. <em>Thode, </em>supra, 44-45. In the case of <em>In re Mongillo, </em>supra, 690-92, the Supreme Court strongly reiterated, by way of dicta, its firm approach to case flow management questions. That case involved an attorney who had been fined $25 by the trial court for his tardiness at the call of the calender. The Supreme Court found error, but only because the attorney did not have either actual or constructive notice of the presiding judge\u2019s policy in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">In <em>Pereira </em>v. <em>Blau, </em>supra, the Appellate Court upheld a dismissal under Practice Book \u00a7 251 after a repeated pattern of delay culminated in the plaintiff\u2019s attorney not appearing at a final assignment list of which the attorney had proper notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">None of these cases involved a plaintiff\u2019s attorney present in court objecting to the dismissal and indicating that he was ready to proceed with evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">\u201cThe ultimate determination regarding a motion to dismiss for lack of diligence is within the sound discretion of the court. This discretion is properly exercised if the case has been on the docket for an unduly protracted period or if the court is satisfied from the record or otherwise that there is no real intent to prosecute, particularly if the party fails to appear at the time the case was assigned for trial on a dormant list. See <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Calise, </em>174 Conn. 567, 574, 392 A.2d 440 (1978); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Herald Corporation, </em>134 Conn. 198, 202, 56 A.2d 171 (1947); <em>Cocchia </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>33 Conn. Sup. 730, 732, 369 A.2d 257 (1976).\u201d <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Gachim, </em>183 Conn. 413, 415, 439 A.2d 379 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">The trial court in this case acted arbitrarily and abused its discretion in dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to restore the case to the trial docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-12\"> This appeal, originally filed in the Supreme Court, was transferred to this court.
