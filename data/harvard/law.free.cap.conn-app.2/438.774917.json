The trial court permitted the plaintiff to call the arbitrator as a witness and to elicit from him how he arrived at his award of damages. The court vacated the award on the ground that the arbitrator had misapplied the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">Both parties agree that the submission to arbitration was unrestricted. Where the submission is unrestricted, the award is final and binding and cannot be reviewed for errors of law or fact. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>189 Conn. 16, 23, 453 A.2d 1158 (1983); <em>Milford Employees Assn. </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>179 Conn. 678, 683, 427 A.2d 859 (1980); <em>American Motorists Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Brookman, </em>1 Conn. App. 219, 223, 470 A.2d 253 (1984).
