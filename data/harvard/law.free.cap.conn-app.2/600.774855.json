The police chief of the town referred to the police commission a complaint that the plaintiff had been struck unnecessarily by a police officer while in custody. The commission convened a police trial board (hereinafter the board) in order to consider those charges. The officer was informed that the hearing would be in executive session unless he requested otherwise, which he did not. No vote was taken pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-21 through l-21k; which sets forth the requirements for considering a matter in executive session.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff requested admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>to the proceeding which was denied, although he did appear before the trial board as a witness. After the hearing, the board dismissed the charges against the officer. Thereafter, the plaintiff appealed to the freedom of information commission (hereinafter FOIC) seeking a release of the transcript of the hearing and an order compelling a public hearing. FOIC ordered the board to release the transcript to the plaintiff, but denied the request for a public hearing. The plaintiff then requested that the board reopen the proceeding which it refused to do. Subsequently, the plaintiff instituted the present action for mandamus. He did not appeal to the Superior Court from the FOIC\u2019s denial of his request for a public hearing or to the FOIC from the board\u2019s refusal to reopen the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The issuance of mandamus is only proper if three conditions have been met. The plaintiff must show that a clear legal right existed for the performance of a duty owed by the defendant, that the defendant had no discretion regarding the performance of that duty and that the plaintiff had no adequate remedy at law. <em>Vartuli </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>192 Conn. 353, 365, 472 A.2d 336 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">It is the contention of the plaintiff that he is not precluded from seeking a writ of mandamus for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies because to seek such remedies would be futile. In support of the trial court\u2019s ruling, the defendants argue that the plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. They also maintain that the trial court\u2019s conclusion is supported by alternate grounds. Practice Book \u00a7 3012 (a). These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>grounds are that the plaintiff lacks standing, that he seeks to compel the performance of a discretionary duty, and that the board hearing was an executive session, exempt from the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 1-21. In view of this court\u2019s decision, these grounds need not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The question of whether the plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies was brought to the attention of the parties in <em>Meredith </em>v. <em>Police Commission, </em>182 Conn. 138, 141 n.2, 438 A.2d 27 (1980). The Supreme Court in that footnote opined that mandamus might be inappropriate since it \u201cappears that the plaintiff failed to appeal to the freedom of information commission, which in ordinary circumstances is the normal legal remedy for being wrongfully excluded from a public meeting. See General Statutes \u00a7 l-21i (b).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The plaintiff relies on the cases of <em>Bahramian </em>v. <em>Papandrea, </em>184 Conn. 1, 5, 440 A.2d 777 (1981), and <em>State ex rel. Foote </em>v. <em>Bartholomew, </em>103 Conn. 607, 618-19, 132 A. 30 (1925), for the proposition that he need not exhaust administrative remedies when to do so would be to no avail. His primary authority for that proposition, <em>Bahramian </em>v. <em>Papandrea, </em>supra, 5 n.3, considered whether an equitable remedy could be bypassed, rather than a remedy at law. The plaintiff here had a remedy at law. General Statutes \u00a7 l-21i.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>The plaintiffs remedy at law has not been shown to be either inadequate or an exercise in futility. His belief that recourse to an available statutory remedy would be ineffectual is speculative. <em>Harwinton Drilling &amp; Engineering Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Control Authority, </em>188 Conn. 90, 97, 448 A.2d 210 (1982). The plaintiffs claim that an appeal to the FOIC from the board\u2019s refusal to reopen the hearing would be ineffective is based on the testimony of the general counsel for the FOIC that, in his opinion, the FOIC had no authority to order a public hearing. General Statutes \u00a7 l-21i (b), however, provides that the FOIC may order such relief as it deems appropriate to rectify the wrongful denial of the right to attend any meeting of a public agency. An appeal to the Superior Court as provided in General Statutes \u00a7 l-21i (c) was the route to test whether the FOIC acted erroneously in failing to order a public hearing. An appeal to the FOIC from the board\u2019s failure to reopen the proceeding, and then an appeal to the Superior Court, had the FOIC persisted in its denial of an order requiring a public hearing, was an alternate route available to the plaintiff. The discretionary rulings of administrative boards are subject to the scrutiny of the courts for a review of whether an abuse of discretion has occurred. <em>Real Estate Listing Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Real Estate Commission, </em>179 Conn. 128, 138, 425 A.2d 581 (1979); <em>Board of Alderman </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Community Antennae Television Co., </em>168 Conn. 294, 297, 362 A.2d 529 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">It is hornbook law that \u201cit is for courts, and not the administrative agencies, to expound and apply governing principles of law. <em>\u2019\u2019Real Estate Listing Service, Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>v. <em>Real Estate Commission, </em>supra; <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>380 U.S. 278, 291, 85 S. Ct. 980, 13 L. Ed. 2d 839 (1965); <em>International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>487 F.2d 1143, 1170-71 (D.C. Cir. 1973), aff'd sub nom. <em>Florida Power &amp; Light Co. </em>v. <em>International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, </em>417 U.S. 790, 94 S. Ct. 2737, 41 L. Ed. 2d 477 (1974); 73 C.J.S., Public Administrative Law and Procedure \u00a7 69. The question which would have been before the court on appeal from the agency decision is a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">It is well settled that a writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy; <em>McAllister </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>193 Conn. 168, 171, 474 A.2d 792 (1984); and is \u201c \u2018to be applied only under exceptional conditions, and is not to be extended beyond its well-established limits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Light </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>170 Conn. 35, 37, 364 A.2d 229 (1975); <em>Milford Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>167 Conn. 513, 518, 356 A.2d 109 (1975). Mandamus is to issue only where there is no adequate remedy at law. <em>Vartuli </em>v. <em>Sotire, </em>supra; <em>Light </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 37-38; <em>Milford Education Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 519.
