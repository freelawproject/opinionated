The will provided that the residue of the testator\u2019s estate was to be held in trust for the plaintiffs in the event that either or both were under the age of twenty-five at the time of the testator\u2019s death.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When Leon Kron died, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>both of the plaintiffs were under the age of twenty-five.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nearly ten years later, a mutual distribution agreement was signed by the plaintiffs and all interested heirs at law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When the agreement was filed in the Norwalk Probate Court on January 30,1981, both plaintiffs were over the age of twenty-five.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">In their complaint, the plaintiffs allege that during the period from the date of their father\u2019s death to the filing of the distribution, the defendant, as trustee, had a duty to collect and distribute to them all income earned during the administration of the estate. The defendant moved for summary judgment on the grounds that it was not liable as a fiduciary and that the mutual distribution agreement served as full settlement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The trial court rendered summary judgment for the defendant, and the plaintiffs have appealed<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">While the plaintiffs have raised a number of issues on appeal, we view the central question to be whether the trust provided for in the testator\u2019s will ever came into existence. We hold that it did not. Under the terms of the will, the defendant was named as trustee of a residuary trust. As the trial court aptly stated: \u201cBy the terms of Leon Kron\u2019s will the residue of the estate was the portion to be held in trust. The residue of an estate is that portion which remains after the payment of debts, charges and <em>particular legacies. First National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>124 Conn. 577, 587 [1 A.2d 283] (1938). The residue of Leon Kron\u2019s estate could not be ascertained until the time of the mutual distribution agreement. It is at the time of settlement that a trustee is entitled to receive from the administrator the entire residue of an estate. <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Union &amp; New Haven Trust Co., </em>106 Conn. 627, 633 [138 A. 809] (1927). The duties of a trustee are placed upon him after the settlement of the estate is completed. <em>Ryder </em>v. <em>Lyon, </em>85 Conn. 245, 252 [82 A. 573] (1912).\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Until the mutual distribution was filed on January 30,1981, the executrix of Leon Kron\u2019s estate had possession of the estate and full authority to settle any and all claims in favor of or against it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>powerless to act as trustee prior to that time. The mere existence of the trust asset did not and could not give rise to a duty on the defendant\u2019s part to collect and administer that asset. We consequently see no merit in the claim that General Statutes \u00a7 45-277a<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> required the defendant to assume the role of fiduciary prior to the final distribution, when doing so would bypass the executrix and override the express terms of the testator\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Whatever claims the plaintiffs had arising out of \u00a7 45-277a were properly directed to the executrix who controlled the assets of the estate during its administration. We hold that all claims arising out of General Statutes \u00a7 45-277a were resolved when the plaintiffs, then over the age of twenty-five, voluntarily joined the rest of the legatees in filing a mutual distribution pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 45-272a. The plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>cannot now make a claim against the defendant for failing to perform a duty that was not required of it, or for interest earned during the period of administration. Any claim for such interest was relinquished upon their signing of the mutual distribution agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The trial court did not err when it granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. \u201cWhen a motion for summary judgment is filed and supported by affidavits and other documents, an adverse party, by affidavit or as otherwise provided [by the Practice Book], must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial, and if he does not so respond, summary judgment shall be entered against him. <em>Rusco Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hartford Housing Authority, </em>168 Conn. 1, 5, 357 A.2d 484 (1975).\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>182 Conn. 34, 38, 438 A.2d 415 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Here, the defendant supported its motion for summary judgment with two affidavits claiming to show by the nature of its dealings that it never had any control over the assets of the estate. In response, the plaintiff Marsha Kron Warner filed her sworn response to the defendant\u2019s request for admissions and a counteraffidavit, claiming that the defendant\u2019s formal communications with and payment of interest and dividends to the estate indicated an acceptance of the trust. These dealings that the defendant had with the estate were the normal activities performed by a bank in a depositor-bank relationship and do not establish the acceptance of a trust. Clearly, when the trust res could not be ascertained until the estate was distributed, there was no acceptance. \u201cIt is elementary that there can be no trust without a res, that there must be a definite subject matter. <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>City Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>115 Conn. 1, 21, [160 A. 69 (1932)] 81 A.L.R. 1488; <em>Shippee </em>v. <em>Pallotti, Andretta &amp; Co., Inc., </em>117 Conn. 472, 477 [168 A. 880 (1933)].\u201d <em>Danbury National Bank </em>v. <em>Millard, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>14 Conn. Sup. 174, 184 (1946). The court was correct in concluding that the defendant was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-9\"> The other defendants in this action are Tillie Thelen and the law firm of Lepofsky, Lepofsky and Lang. No affirmative claims were made against them.

THE MERCHANTS BANK AND TRUST COMPANY, as Trustee herein, shall, at its sole and own discretion, have the right to use both the corpus and income from whatever trusts as are created herein for the proper education and support of my daughters.

In the event of unequal distribution of income or corpus among my daughters under the circumstances as set forth herein, it is my direction that there be no equalization or adjustment thereof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b747-8\"> Marsha Kron Warner was bom on October 3,1953.
