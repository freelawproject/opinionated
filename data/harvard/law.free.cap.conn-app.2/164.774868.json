The court found that the plaintiff was negligent in failing to yield the right of way when making a left hand turn thereby violating General Statutes \u00a7 14-242 (e). From the judgment, the plaintiff appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">The critical issue at the trial was whether the defendant had proceeded far enough into the intersection to constitute an \u201cimmediate hazard\u201d within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 14-242 (e).
