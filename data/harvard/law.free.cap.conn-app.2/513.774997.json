Ct. 2674, 57 L. Ed. 2d 667 (1978), is without merit. <em>Franks </em>requires, as one of the preconditions to an evidentiary hearing attacking a warrant, that \u201c[ajffidavits or sworn or otherwise reliable statements of witnesses should be furnished, or their absence satisfactorily explained.\u201d Id., 171. The defendant\u2019s oral motion falls far short of those requirements. Moreover, after the court denied his motion without an evidentiary hearing, it permit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>ted him to put on evidence in support of his claim, as a kind of evidentiary offer of proof. Our review of this evidence indicates that the court was correct in denying the motion, because the evidence falls far short of establishing \u201cdeliberate falsehood or . . . reckless disregard for the truth . . .\u201d in the affidavit upon which the warrant for his arrest was based. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The defendant\u2019s claim that he was entitled to a charge on entrapment fails, because his testimony was a denial of an essential element of the crime charged, namely, that he expressly represented that the substance which he sold was cocaine; and because there was no evidence of inducement by the police. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>178 Conn. 704, 707-08, 425 A.2d 108 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>173 Conn. 431, 436, 378 A.2d 534 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b528-9\"> The information simply referred to General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 19-473. That statute, as amended by Public Acts 1981, No. 81-199, also embraces subsection (a) (2), which prohibits such an attempted delivery \u201cunder circumstances which would lead a reasonable person to believe that such substance is a controlled substance . . . .\u2019\u2019The state\u2019s bill of particulars, however, narrowed the charge to the \u201cexpress representation\u201d prohibited by subsection (a) (1), and the court charged the jury accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b528-10\"> At oral argument in this court the defendant abandoned one of his three claims of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
