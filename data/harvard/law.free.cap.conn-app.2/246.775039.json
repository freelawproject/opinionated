The defendants are the record owners of the parcel and are the plaintiffs adjoining neighbors. The trial court found that beginning in 1957 the plaintiffs predecessor in title, McFadden, improved the disputed property, planting on it a lawn with some lilac bushes. It further found that the plaintiff and her predecessors in title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>continued to use the property in a similar manner until 1979, when this controversy arose. That court also found, however, that in 1963 McFadden acknowledged to the defendant\u2019s predecessor in title, Keeler, that the property belonged to Keeler. The court further found that at that time Keeler consented to McFadden\u2019s use of the property, and that McFadden continued this acknowledged and consensual use of the property until 1966. On the basis of these findings, the court concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s claim for adverse possession failed because she had not proven that her possession was without the consent of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s appeal raises a constellation of claims which orbit about these critical findings and conclusions of the trial court. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u201cThe essential elements of adverse possession are that the owner shall be ousted from possession and kept out uninterruptedly for fifteen years under a claim of right by an open, visible and exclusive possession of the claimant without license or consent of the owner.\u201d <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>186 Conn. 490, 498, 442 A.2d 911 (1982); <em>Meshberg </em>v. <em>Bridgeport City Trust Co., </em>1 Conn. App. 10, 13, 467 A.2d 685 (1983). Adverse possession must be proven by clear and positive proof, and is to be taken strictly. <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>supra, 498-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">The plaintiff first claims error in two related evidentiary rulings concerning which Keeler was permitted to testify, over the plaintiff\u2019s objection, as to his intent in giving permission to McFadden to use the property. The plaintiff\u2019s argument that these rulings permitted impermissible opinion and conclusion testimony is without merit. Whether Keeler gave consent or not was a factual issue involving his intent. It has long been our law that \u201c \u2018[w]hen the intention of a witness is a fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>relevant to the issue he may testify directly as to his intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Horowitz </em>v. <em>F. E. Spencer Co., </em>132 Conn. 373, 378, 44 A.2d 702 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The plaintiff also claims error in the court\u2019s conclusion that consent was given by the \u201cowner\u201d of the property, because Keeler was not the record title holder at the time of the pivotal conversation in 1963. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The court found that Keeler was not the record title holder but was a silent 50 percent owner of the property together with the record title owner. McFadden recognized him as an owner of the property. Thus, it was clear that Keeler was an equitable owner of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">One of the elements of adverse possession is that the claimant\u2019s possession be \u201cwithout license or consent of the owner.\u201d <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>supra, 498. \u201c \u2018The word \u201cowner\u201d has no fixed meaning but must be interpreted in its context and according to the circumstances in which it is used.\u2019 \u201d <em>General Realty Improvement Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>133 Conn. 238, 241, 50 A.2d 59 (1946). It is \u201cnot restricted to one who has the legal or rightful title, whether the possessor or not.\u201d <em>Hope </em>v. <em>Cavallo, </em>163 Conn. 576, 582, 316 A.2d 407 (1972). \u201cCourts, when applying equitable principles, \u2018 \u201ccan always look behind the technical legal title if necessary to work out . . . the rights of the parties.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Middlebury </em>v. <em>Steinmann, </em>189 Conn. 710, 716, 458 A.2d 393 (1983). And \u201cone who has actual notice of equitable rights not of record is nevertheless bound to recognize them.\u201d <em>Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation </em>v. <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>123 Conn. 232, 240, 193 A. 769 (1937). We conclude that Keeler\u2019s equitable interest coupled with McFadden\u2019s recognition of it sufficed to make Keeler an \u201cowner\u201d for purposes of adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>This leaves for consideration the plaintiffs claim that the court erred in holding in effect that the consent by Keeler, given subsequent to the presumably nonconsensual entry by McFadden, was sufficient to vitiate the plaintiffs claim of possession without the owner\u2019s consent. There is some authority, on which the plaintiff relies, to the effect that if the claimant\u2019s initial entry is nonconsensual a subsequent grant of consent by the owner, without more, is insufficient to vitiate the element of lack of consent. See, e.g., <em>Naporra </em>v. <em>Weckwerth, </em>178 Minn. 203, 226 N.W. 569 (1929); <em>Macias </em>v. <em>Guymon Ind. Foundation, </em>595 P.2d 430, 433 (Okla. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">We need not decide, however, whether this authority applies here. The court found in effect that in 1963 McFadden acknowledged Keeler\u2019s ownership of the property, and that McFadden\u2019s use from 1963 until January, 1966, was pursuant to this acknowledgment. This finding brings the case squarely within the principle that \u201c[t]he possession of one who recognizes or admits title in another, either by declaration or conduct, is not adverse to the title of such other. . . . Occupation must not only be hostile in its inception, but it must continue hostile, and at all times during the required period of fifteen years challenge the right of the true owner, in order to found title by adverse use upon it.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Paton </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>81 Conn. 547, 551, 71 A. 730 (1909). Such an acknowledgment of the owner\u2019s title terminates the running of the statutory period, and any subsequent adverse use starts the clock anew. 3 American Law of Property \u00a7 15.9, pp. 810-11; 7 Powell, Real Property \u00a7 1014. Thus, while the route we take is somewhat different from that of the trial court, we agree with its ultimate judgment that the plaintiff failed to prove her case. See <em>Caldor\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bedding Barn, Inc., </em>177 Conn. 304, 326, 417 A.2d 343 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>We have considered the other claims of the plaintiff. They either flow from those claims which we have already rejected, or involve factual determinations which are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-13\"> This appeal, originally filed in the Supreme Court, was transferred to this court. Public Acts, Spec. Sess., June, 1983, No. 83-29, \u00a7 2 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b261-14\"> The defendants filed a cross appeal in which they attempt to present certain other factual grounds, none of which was addressed by the trial court. We regard the cross appeal as a statement of alternate grounds upon which the judgment may be affirmed, under Practice Book \u00a7 3012 (a). Our disposition of the appeal makes it unnecessary to reach those grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
