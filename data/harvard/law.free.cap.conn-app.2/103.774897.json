Lucky, a physician. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in limiting her designated expert\u2019s testimony to the subject matter disclosed in her response to interrogatories and that the court\u2019s action, in effect, constituted a dismissal of her cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The circumstances surrounding the diagnosis and treatment of the plaintiff are not relevant to the issues raised on appeal. For the sake of brevity, therefore, those circumstances need not be discussed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">In response to the defendants\u2019 interrogatories concerning expert testimony, the plaintiff informed the defendants on March 5, 1982, that she had neither retained an expert nor consulted any not intended to be called as a witness. The plaintiff first disclosed the identity of her expert, Marvin Garrell, a physician, during the jury selection process, although the expert had been consulted previously. The court ordered the plaintiff to answer the interrogatories concerning the expert testimony and required the plaintiff to allow the defendants an opportunity to depose the expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">In her supplemental answers to the defendants\u2019 interrogatories, the plaintiff stated that the subject matter of Garrell\u2019s proposed testimony was the \u201cstandard of care and departures from the standard of care.\u201d On the basis of this answer, the defendants limited the scope of their inquiry at the deposition to the disclosed subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">During the trial, the plaintiff attempted to establish that the defendant physician\u2019s treatment was improper by posing a hypothetical question to her designated expert. The court sustained the defendants\u2019 objection on the ground that it contained facts which were not in evidence. Rather than reframe the question, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>plaintiff made an offer of proof. At that time, the court informed the parties that the expert would not be able to testify on the issue of causation because causation was not within the scope of the disclosed subject matter of the expert\u2019s proposed testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The plaintiff concedes that without her expert\u2019s testimony on causation the court correctly rendered a directed verdict for the defendants. She claims, however, on appeal, that the court abused its discretion when it excluded her expert's testimony on causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The trial court made the following findings. On March 5,1982, the plaintiff filed answers to interrogatories. The response to interrogatory number sixty-nine, which sought information relating to \u201cany expert consulted by you or on your behalf . . . who is expected to be called as a witness at trial,\u201d indicated that no expert had been retained to testify. To interrogatory number seventy, which related to experts consulted but not intended to be called as a witness, plaintiff also responded in the negative. It was not until after the case was set for trial and the jury selection process had commenced that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel disclosed the identity of her expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The court then ordered that interrogatories number sixty-nine and seventy be answered forthwith and that thereafter her expert be produced to be deposed by defense counsel who maintained that otherwise his position would be prejudiced by his inability to prepare his cross-examination and to consider the possible need for a rebuttal expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Prior to the taking of the expert\u2019s deposition, supplemental answers to interrogatories were filed wherein it was indicated that the subject matter with respect to which he was expected to testify was the \u201cstandard of care and departures from the standard of care.\u201d Defense counsel limited the scope of his inquiry at depo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>sition to the disclosed subject matter of the testimony expected at trial. The plaintiffs counsel asked no questions at the time of the deposition nor indicated that the witness\u2019 testimony would embrace factors other than \u201cstandards of care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s relationship with physician Marvin Garrell deserves a more detailed analysis. During his deposition on June 4,1982, Garrell stated that he had been asked to render an informal opinion in the case a few years previously but that he had not been retained to testify at trial at that juncture. In her brief, the plaintiff claims that Garrell was not consulted in anticipation of litigation or preparation for trial, but only on an <em>informal </em>basis. The plaintiff claims that Garrell was <em>formally retained </em>on May 28,1982, the day after jury selection began. The court\u2019s conclusion that Garrell had been consulted earlier and that the file had been submitted to him for review is dispositive of this argument. The plaintiff\u2019s claim that Garrell wasn\u2019t formally retained as an expert until after the trial started is a tactical subterfuge, which, if left unchallenged by the court, would seriously undermine the salutary effect of the rules of discovery and production concerning expert testimony in malpractice cases. Such a \u201ccat and mouse\u201d game was properly not condoned by the trial court. The rules of discovery are designed to make a \u201c \u2018trial less a game of blindman\u2019s bluff and more a fair contest with the basic issues and facts disclosed to the fullest practical extent.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Proctor &amp; Gamble, </em>356 U.S. 677, 682, 78 S. Ct. 983, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1077 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Although the trial court did not cite Practice Book \u00a7 231, this section lends further support to the trial court\u2019s action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is clear, under the circumstances of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>this case that the plaintiffs failure to include Garrell\u2019s proposed testimony on causation in her answer to interrogatory number sixty-nine was a failure to answer the interrogatory fairly, thereby justifying sanction (d) of Practice Book \u00a7 231 concerning the entry of an order prohibiting the party who has failed to comply from introducing designated matters into evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The court\u2019s decision on whether to impose the sanction of excluding the expert\u2019s testimony concerning causation rests within the sound discretion of the court. See <em>Filisko </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Hydraulic Co., </em>176 Conn. 33, 40, 404 A.2d 889 (1978); see also <em>Pavlinko </em>v. <em>Yale-New Haven Hospital, </em>192 Conn. 138, 144, 470 A.2d 246 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>(1984) (discussing sanctions pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 231). \u201c \u2018The action of the trial court is not to be disturbed unless it abused its legal discretion, and \u201c[i]n determining this the unquestioned rule is that \u2018great weight is due to the action of the trial court and every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of its correctness.\u2019 <em>Dudas </em>v. <em>Ward Baking Co., </em>104 Conn. 516, 518, 133 A. 591 [1926] . . . .\u201d <em>Ardoline </em>v. <em>Keegan, </em>140 Conn. 552, 555, 102 A.2d 352 [1954].\u2019 <em>Camp </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>160 Conn. 10, 13, 273 A.2d 714 [1970]. In determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, the ultimate issue is whether the court could reasonably conclude as it did. <em>E. M. Loew\u2019s Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Surabian, </em>146 Conn. 608, 611, 153 A.2d 463 [1959].\u201d <em>DiPalma </em>v. <em>Wiesen, </em>163 Conn. 293, 298-99, 303 A.2d 709 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The court\u2019s conclusion, that the consequences of the plaintiff\u2019s failure fully and fairly to disclose, despite being given ample opportunity to do so, should fall upon the plaintiff rather than upon the defendants, was not an abuse of discretion. To hold otherwise would unfairly deny, under the circumstances of this case, the defendants the opportunity to prepare for or challenge the proposed testimony concerning causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Above and beyond the specific effects that such a sanction places upon a party, it is also appropriately invoked so as to deter those who might be tempted to enlist such tactics in the absence of a deterrent. See <em>National Hockey League </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Hockey Club, </em>427 U.S. 639, 643, 96 S. Ct. 2778, 49 L. Ed. 2d 747 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-16\"> The appeal, originally filed in the Supreme Court, was transferred to this court.
