We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>On February 20,1980, a jury convicted the plaintiff, Charles DeMartin, on all counts of a five count substitute information charging criminal attempt to commit assault in the first degree, conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree, reckless endangerment in the first degree, possession of weapons in a motor vehicle, and possession of a shotgun in a motor vehicle. The plaintiff was sentenced to imprisonment for an effective term of not less than six nor more than twelve years. His conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court on August 17, 1982. <em>State </em>v. <em>Altrui, </em>188 Conn. 161, 448 A.2d 837 (1982).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, on November 22, 1982, the plaintiff filed two applications for writs of habeas corpus in the Superior Court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant filed a motion to quash the first petition. This motion was granted by the court. The court then held a hearing on the second petition. After the hearing, the plaintiffs petition was denied and the trial judge, N. <em>O\u2019Neill, J., </em>certified the case for appeal to this court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The detailed facts of this case are set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Altrui, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The plaintiff claims on appeal that he was denied his right to due process and the right to confront witnesses against him in violation of the fifth, sixth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution of the United States when the trial court permitted a witness, the victim, Michael Solevo, to invoke the privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>The facts pertinent to this appeal are as follows: Michael Solevo, the victim of the shooting incident in the underlying case, identified DeMartin as one of the perpetrators of the crimes. At trial, Solevo was called as a witness for the state. He gave extensive testimony regarding DeMartin\u2019s involvement in the crimes charged during direct examination on December 6 and 7,1979, and on cross-examination on December 11,12 and 13. On January 17, 1980, Solevo was called as a witness by DeMartin\u2019s codefendant, Frank Altrui. During direct examination, Solevo exercised his fifth amendment privilege in response to twelve specific inquiries by defense counsel.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AQlp\">In the habeas corpus proceedings, the court heard extensive evidence concerning the circumstances surrounding this chain of events. On January 1, 1980, DeMartin\u2019s attorney contacted the state\u2019s attorney and claimed that Solevo wished to talk to the attorneys in the case because of an alleged desire to recant his prior story. The state\u2019s attorney promptly contacted Solevo by telephone in order to discover Solevo\u2019s intentions regarding his testimony. That conversation was recorded. In that telephone conversation, Solevo told the prosecutor, \u201cI gotta live in this town . . . you know I\u2019d like to make amends to everybody and live in this town, and work and run my business without bothering anybody, not have to worry about carrying a gun going home at night . . . OK. There\u2019s nobody that can be with me as many hours of the day that there is.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AG2\">The habeas court also considered testimony concerning a conversation Solevo had on January 2,1980, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>assistant state\u2019s attorney John Durham and inspector Bruce Piggott.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court found that this conversation, as well as the conversation of January 1, indicated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Solevo was extremely upset and was afraid that he and his family would suffer repercussions as a result of his testimony. On January 11,1980, DeMartin moved for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>acquittal. During the hearing on the motion, no mention was made of the possibility that Solevo had recanted or desired to recant. On January 16, DeMartin rested his case, again without any mention of Solevo\u2019s alleged desire to recant earlier testimony. On January 17,1980, Solevo was called as a witness by Altrui, at which time Solevo invoked the privilege against self-incrimination in response to questions concerning his prior testimony and the conversations of January 1 and 2. Solevo was not offered immunity by the state and the trial judge did not order him to testify. DeMartin thereafter moved for a mistrial. Again, he offered no evidence that Solevo wished to recant. Furthermore, DeMartin did not move to strike Solevo\u2019s prior testimony from the record. The motion for a mistrial was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">On January 18, 1980, Altrui called Kent Kelsey as a witness. Kelsey testified that Solevo had indicated to him that he was confused and was not sure about the events which occurred during the shooting incident and that he did not think DeMartin was involved. The habeas court found that Kelsey\u2019s testimony was \u201cunbelievable\u201d and that \u201capparently the jury thought so.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The habeas court concluded that there was no evidence of any bribery of Solevo or that Solevo had recanted or wished to. The court found \u201cthat Solevo was in fear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>before and during the trial and infers coercion from that fear.\u201d The court\u2019s inference was based not only on the fact that Solevo had already been shot at with a shotgun, but also upon what transpired during the two conversations between Solevo and members of the prosecutor\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The Supreme Court stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Altrui, </em>supra, 176, that it could not \u201cconclude that under the peculiar circumstances of this case permitting Solevo to exercise his fifth amendment privilege left the jury with a distorted view of the truth,\u201d but went on to say in footnote four; id., 176 n.4; that this conclusion did not foreclose DeMartin from demonstrating in a habeas corpus proceeding the factual foundation for an application of the remedy which permits a court to find a waiver of the privilege under certain circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The test for determining whether a court may infer a testimonial waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination is set forth in <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>667 F.2d 274, 287 (2d Cir. 1981). A testimonial waiver is not to be inferred lightly. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>United States, 337 </em>U.S. 137, 150, 69 S. Ct. 1000, 93 L. Ed. 2d 1264 (1949); <em>State </em>v. <em>Altrui, </em>supra, 169. It should be inferred only under the most compelling circumstances. <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 288; <em>State </em>v. <em>Altrui, </em>supra. The two-prong test set forth in <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 287, states: \u201c[A] court should only infer a waiver of the fifth amendment\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination from a witness\u2019 prior statements if (1) the witness\u2019 prior statements have created a significant likelihood that the finder of fact will be left with and prone to rely on a distorted view of the truth, and (2) the witness had reason to know that his prior statements would be interpreted as a waiver of the [privilege] . . . The second prong of the <em>Klein </em>test requires a two-fold analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>The requisite \u201creason to know\u201d that a waiver might be inferred should be found <em>only if </em>the witness\u2019 <em>prior </em>statements were (a) testimonial, meaning that they were voluntarily made under oath in the context of the same judicial proceeding, <em>and </em>(b) incriminating, meaning they did not merely deal with matters collateral to the events surrounding the commission of the crime, but directly inculpated the <em>witness </em>on the charges at issue. <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Both prongs of this test must be satisfied in order for the court to be able to infer a testimonial waiver. The habeas court found, as did the Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Altrui, </em>supra, 176, that the first prong of the test was not satisfied because permitting Solevo to invoke the privilege did not leave the jury with a distorted view of the truth. In this regard, the habeas court stated: \u201cIn examining the entire record of the original trial, and all the exhibits and after an exhaustive trial in this court, it cannot be found that Solevo\u2019s statements on direct and cross-examination created a significant likelihood that the jury would be left with and prone to rely on a distorted view of the truth. In particular, in the trial in this court, it became abundantly clear that Solevo\u2019s statements in his original testimony and cross-examination were the truth as they were convincingly supported by his mother\u2019s testimony which the court found accurate and credible. The court neither heard nor saw any believable evidence contradicting Solevo or his mother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">As concerns the second prong of the test, the habeas court found that Solevo\u2019s prior statements were both testimonial and incriminating. The court found that the statements were incriminating because they directly inculpated the witness on the charges at issue and found that the charges at issue were either giving false testimony or committing perjury in the event the statements were untrue. We disagree. The statements were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>not \u201cincriminating\u201d as this term is defined for the purposes of applying the <em>Klein </em>test. We construe \u201cdirectly inculpated the witness on the charges at issue\u201d to mean those charges which stem from and are directly related to the \u201cevents surrounding commission of the crime.\u201d See <em>Klein </em>v. Harris, supra, 288. Solevo\u2019s prior testimony concerned the events surrounding the commission of the crime, but clearly there was nothing self-incriminating to Solevo in that testimony as to his involvement in the crimes charged. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>James, </em>609 F.2d 36, 45 (2d Cir. 1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Valeriano, </em>191 Conn. 659, 667, 468 A.2d 936 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">In any event, the first prong of the test was not found to be satisfied and, therefore, a testimonial waiver could not be inferred. Any erroneous interpretation of the term \u201cincriminating,\u201d therefore, was harmless error. The court correctly found that a testimonial waiver could not be inferred under the circumstances of this case. The factual basis for applying the <em>Klein </em>remedy has been exhaustively explored. The requisite \u201csignificant danger of distortion\u201d; <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 288; and necessary compelling circumstances for finding a testimonial waiver are absent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The plaintiff also claims that he was denied his right to confrontation by virtue of the trial court\u2019s decision to permit Solevo to invoke the privilege. As the Supreme Court succinctly stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Altrui, </em>supra, 176, in the absence of any direct testimony, there is nothing to test through cross-examination. By refusing to answer, there was no direct testimony. The petitioner had ample opportunity to cross-examine the witness at the time of his original testimony and to call Solevo as his own witness at trial. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Calvente, </em>722 F.2d 1019, 1024 (2d Cir. 1983). Furthermore, it is clear that where there is a direct conflict between the accused\u2019s right to compel testimony and a witness\u2019 privilege against self-incrimination, \u201cthe accused\u2019s right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>to compel testimony must give way to the witness\u2019 privilege against self-incrimination . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Simms, </em>170 Conn. 206, 209, 365 A.2d 821 (1976); <em>see Kastigar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>406 U.S. 441, 444-45, 92 S. Ct. 1653, 32 L. Ed. 2d 212 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">There is no error on the plaintiff\u2019s appeal No. 2479.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">As to the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the judgment granting the motion to quash the first petition, the issues, claims and allegations presented in the second petition substantially incorporated and, therefore, duplicated those presented in the first petition. That appeal is now moot in light of the full consideration given to the second petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Appeal No. 2478 is dismissed for mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-6\"> Prank Altrui was a codefendant in the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\"> The plaintiff first sought a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court which dismissed the application, refusing to retain jurisdiction where the petitioner had not exhausted available remedies in state court. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed that decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b512-8\"> The plaintiff also filed an appeal, appeal No. 2478, from the granting of the motion to quash. The motion to join the two appeals was granted by the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\"> A verbatim recitation of the direct examination and the witness\u2019 response is printed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Altrui, </em>188 Conn. 161, 167-69 n.2, 448 A.2d 837 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b513-9\"> The Supreme Court included a detailed account of the recorded telephone conversation of January 1,1980, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Altrui, </em>188 Conn. 161, 172, 448 A.2d 837 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b514-5\"> The text of the conversation as printed in the memorandum of decision is as follows: \u201cJD: Well, the unfortunate part at this point is that there is, you know, there\u2019s no easy way out. I mean, you\u2019re jammed up either way, uh, you know, you gave the police a truthful statement, you testified in court under direct and cross-examination and told the truth. So, you know, to think that now, uh, you\u2019re gonna be able, that DeMartin, Altrui and uh, Taddei and that crew is gonna get off your back and everything is going to be roses if all you [do] is go in and uh, recant and perjure yourself is, that\u2019s not the way it is. Because they can do it, I mean from my perspective, if they can do it to you, they can do it to the next little store owner that they\u2019re trying to shake down, and the next little restaurant owner and anybody else they want to shake down. All they\u2019ve gotta do is put the pressure on and continue to do exactly what they\u2019re doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">\u201cNow, I\u2019d sit down, if I were you, I would sit down with my attorney, tell him what you know, tell him what the truth is, tell him what it is that you suspect they want you to say, tell him you testified to the court and gave the statement to the police and ask him, ask him where you stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">\u201cMS: He said, I uh, I asked him all that and he says you\u2019d probably be arrested for perjury. And perjury\u2019s five years, Right?</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">\u201cJD: Perjury\u2019s a felony in Connecticut, yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">\u201cMS: He said, you know, you\u2019ll end up in court yourself and there\u2019s no way in saying that somebody\u2019s gonna believe you, you\u2019ll probably both end up in jail together.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">\u201cJD: Well, that\u2019s largely a decision for you and your attorney, all I\u2019m saying is that I know that you told the cops the truth, I know you told the jury the truth, and uh\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">\u201cMS: Oh, boy, you know. Who\u2019s gonna be with me in seven, six, seven years when these characters are out on the street. You know what I mean? Now, what if, if there, if it wasn\u2019t meant for me, they were drinking wine all day\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">\u201cJD: I know, you know, I would suspect ....</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">\u201cMS: If I probably didn\u2019t walk out of there, he probably would have got in this car and drove away again.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-14\">\u201c JD: Maybe. But you did walk out and he did shoot at you. That\u2019s against the law and he could have killed you. And then where would your wife and kids and your family be?</p>\n<p id=\"b514-15\">\u201cMS: My mother, I didn't know this until today, my mother had a meeting all set up with Charlie, to straighten this all out, and my brother made her cancel out, he said, No, don\u2019t you dare get involved again.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-16\">\u201cBP: Who\u2019s that?</p>\n<p id=\"b514-17\">\u201cMS: Franny.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-18\">\u201cBP: Franny.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-19\">\u201cMS: [inaudible] My mother had a meeting with, through somebody else, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>she said something [inaudible]. But, I definitely would get arrested for perjury, huh?</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">\u201cJD: I don\u2019t mean, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want to tell you what to do. Talk to your attorney. Tell LaSala what the situation is. I mean, LaSala\u2019s not going to make you testify, if uh, if you tell him that what you testified to before was the truth and now you\u2019re just jammed up on all this stuff. Tell him the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">\u201cMS: Well, he was supposed to come in the restaurant at 12:00 today and talk to me, then he called up and said he couldn\u2019t make it. He wanted me to go to his office at 5:30. I said I can\u2019t come out there. I don\u2019t even have a car. I took my mother\u2019s car down here. I parked in the parking lot, by the way that\u2019s good?</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">\u201cJD: Where\u2019s your attorney\u2019s office?</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">\u201cMS: Temple Street.

He said, you\u2019re opening yourself up for an arrest, and [inaudible]\u2014Can\u2019t get a goddam gun permit. I don\u2019t, you know, I\u2019m gonna be open.

Because they know they\u2019ve got problems. I mean, we\u2019ve got the guns, the Motion to Supress the guns was denied, uh, we went through a full day\u2019s hearing on Chain of Custody on the guns, they know, as a matter of fact, the guns came in today, you know.
