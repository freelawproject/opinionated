Furthermore, our examination of the record indicates that the claims presented to us in the plaintiffs\u2019 brief and argument were totally unrelated to those presented in their preliminary statement of issues on appeal under Practice Book \u00a7 3012 (a). Under these circumstances we decline to consider the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-12\"> This appeal, originally filed in the Supreme Court, was transferred to this court.
