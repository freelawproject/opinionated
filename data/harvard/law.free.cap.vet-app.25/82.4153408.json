On October 6, 2011, the parties filed a joint motion to stay further proceedings, indicating that they were in the final stages of negotiating a joint motion for remand but needed additional time to finalize such a motion. The following day, the parties filed a joint motion for remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-15\">As the parties filed their joint motion for remand prior to the expiration of the Court-ordered deadline for filing their memoranda of law, there is no need to stay proceedings and the Court will therefore deny the parties\u2019 joint motion to stay further proceedings. The Court will also grant their joint motion for remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-16\">Upon consideration of the foregoing, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b98-17\">ORDERED that the parties\u2019 October 6, 2011, joint motion to stay further proceedings is denied. It is further</p>\n<p id=\"b98-18\">ORDERED that the parties\u2019 October 7, 2011, joint motion for remand is GRANTED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
