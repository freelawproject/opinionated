On January 26, 2011, after counsel filed an untimely brief, the Court issued an order ordering the Clerk to \u201cforward the appeal for appropriate action by the screening judge. <em>See, e.g., </em>U.S. Vet.App. R. 81(b).\u201d On April 15, 2011, the appeal was dismissed under Rule 31(b). On May 5, 2011, the appellant filed a motion for reconsideration or, in the alternative, for panel review. A panel was formed and, on June 24, 2011, the panel issued an order to show cause why the case should not be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-15\">While the particular considerations and facts of this appeal militate against its dismissal, this order should serve as a warning to those who disregard or flout this Court\u2019s rules. The timely consideration of veterans\u2019 appeals should not and will not be held hostage to the dilatory practices of attorneys for either party, and dismissal for failure to follow the Court\u2019s rules concerning timely filing remains an option under Rule 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-16\">Upon consideration of the foregoing, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b99-17\">ORDERED that the Court\u2019s orders of January 26, 2011, and April 15, 2011, are revoked; the appeal is reinstated; the appellant\u2019s brief is accepted; and the appeal is returned to the Clerk for continuation of the briefing process.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
