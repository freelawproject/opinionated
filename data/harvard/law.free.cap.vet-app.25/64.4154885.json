Breniser, appeals through counsel a February 5, 2009, Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (Board or BVA) decision in which the Board denied his claim for entitlement to a higher rate of special monthly compensation (SMC) on account of being in need of the aid and attendance of another person or on account of being housebound.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Record of Proceedings (R.) at 3-12. Panel consideration is required to determine whether a veteran who is receiving SMC for the loss of use of both feet under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1) is entitled to a higher rate of SMC under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(o), (p), or (r) based on his need for aid and attendance, when such need arises out of the loss of use of both feet. This appeal is timely, and the Court has jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s decision pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7252(a) and 7266(a). Because section 1114(o) prohibits a \u201ccondition from being considered twice\u201d in subsections <em>(l) </em>through (n) when determining whether a veteran is entitled to a higher rate of SMC under subsection (o), and the Court defers to the Secretary\u2019s reasonable interpretation of subsection (o) as requiring determinations to be based upon separate and distinct disabilities, the Court concludes that a claimant cannot establish entitlement to a higher rate of SMC under section 1114(o) \u2014 unless the claimant\u2019s need for aid and attendance arises from a disability <em>other </em>than that for which the claimant is already in receipt of SMC. Hence, the Court must affirm that part of the Board\u2019s decision that concluded that the appellant did not meet the requirements for a higher rate of SMC on account of the loss of use of both feet <em>mid, </em>being in need of the aid or attendance of another person as a result of the loss of use of both feet. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(0 and (o). However, because the Court concludes that the Board erred by failing to consider whether the appellant is entitled to a higher rate of SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(p), the Court will remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">The appellant served on active duty in the U.S. Army from January 1949 to June 1952. R. at 766. He was receiving compensation for amputation of his left middle finger; a shrapnel wound scar on his chin and a biopsy scar for right gastrocnemius; cold injury to both feet, with plantar fasciitis and Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, evaluated as 30% disabling, from April 1998 to May 2007; and his cold injury for both feet was changed to loss of use of both feet as residuals of cold injury, evaluated as 100% disabling, effective May 2007. R. at 72-73, 194-95, 546-47, 775. In 2003, he was granted a total disability rating based on individual unemployability effective October 15, 2001. R. at 377-81. In July 2008, the regional office (RO) granted entitlement to SMC based on loss of use of both feet pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1), effective May 14, 2007, as well as entitlement to automobile and adaptive equipment and specially adapted housing. R. at 68-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>In its February 5, 2009, decision here on appeal, the Board denied the appellant\u2019s claim for entitlement to a higher rate of SMC based on the need for aid and attendance or on account of being housebound. R. at 3-12. The Board noted the appellant\u2019s argument that \u201chis bilateral leg disabilities, along with ... nonservice-connected residuals of a stroke and decreased vision have rendered him wheelchair bound and requir[e]\u201d aid and assistance of another person such that he is entitled to a higher rate of compensation. R. at 6. The Board noted that \u201cas the veteran is already in receipt of [SMC under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(2) ], what he seeks by this appeal is an additional, higher rate of [SMC] under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 U14(o).\u201d R. at 7. The Board stated that the higher rate of SMC under section 1114(o ) \u201cis payable for, among other things, conditions entitling a veteran to two or more of the rates (no condition being considered twice) provided in 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1114(2) through (n). Determinations for entitlement under 38 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1114(o) must be based upon <em>separate and distinct disabilities.\u201d </em>R. at 8. Thus, although the evidence showed that the appellant was wheelchair bound and required the assistance of another, because SMC was already in effect for the loss of use of both feet under section 1114(0, the Board stated that the question is whether the need for aid and attendance \u201cis based upon a service-connected disability other than the bilateral disability of the feet.\u201d R. at 8-9. The Board discussed the appellant\u2019s service-connected amputated finger and residual scar, and found that the evidence did not demonstrate that these disabilities rendered him \u201cso incapacitated that he requires care or assistance.\u201d R. at 9-10. The Board also discussed the appellant\u2019s non-service-connected conditions and stated that \u201c[w]hile it is likely that these conditions combine to result in the veteran\u2019s need for aid and attendance, because they are not service-connected dis abilities [, ] the assignment of [SMC] is not warranted.\u201d R. at 10. The Board concluded that \u201calthough the veteran technically requires aid and attendance, it is not required for a [service-connected] disability that is separate and distinct from the loss of use of the feet and the veteran is therefore barred from receiving additional benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, the Board found that since the compensation under section 1114(2) was greater than the rate for SMC based on housebound status under section 1114(s), the claim under section 1114(s) was moot. R. at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The pro se appellant appealed to this Court on February 28, 2009, and filed an informal brief in July 2009. After the case was assigned to a panel, the appellant obtained counsel, withdrew his informal brief, and substituted a formal brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">On January 26, 2011, the appellant informed the Court that on January 7, 2011, VA notified him that he had been awarded a 60% disability rating for service-connected hearing loss, a 10% disability rating for tinnitus, and a higher level of SMC based on the 60% rating, effective March 29, 2010. The Court subsequently ordered the appellant to clarify his arguments and identify the subsection of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114 under which was he granted a higher rate of SMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">On February 8, 2011, the appellant responded that he had been awarded a half-step increased rate of SMC under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(p) and 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.350(f)(3) (2010), and asserted that this award did not moot his appeal to the Court. In a February 23, 2011, response, the Secretary agreed that the award of increased SMC under subsection (p) did not moot the appellant\u2019s arguments. The Secretary noted, however, that if the appellant disagrees with the level of SMC assigned in the January 7, 2011, decision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>his remedy would be to file a Notice of Disagreement with the January 7, 2011, decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">II. THE PARTIES\u2019 CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">A. The Appellant\u2019s Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The appellant asks the Court to reverse the Board\u2019s decision because he asserts that he is entitled to a higher rate of SMC under the plain and unambiguous language of 88 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114. Appellant\u2019s Substitute Brief (Br.) at 8-21. The appellant argues, pursuant to section 1114(o), that he is entitled to the maximum rate of SMC because he satisfies the criteria for two rates under section 1114(0- <em>Id. </em>at 20-21. The appellant contends that his first entitling \u201ccondition\u201d is the loss of use of both feet and that his second entitling \u201ccondition\u201d is that \u201chis- service-connected loss of use of both feet[ ] make him so helpless that he requires the regular aid and attendance of another person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. Because he is entitled to two rates of SMC under section 1114(\u00a3), he argues that he is thus entitled to the higher rate of SMC under section 1114(o) and the even higher rate under 1114(r)(l). <em>Id. </em>at 20-21. The appellant also argues that the Secretary\u2019s implementing regulation, 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.350(e)(3) (2011), is legally invalid because it ignores the plain language of section 1114(o) by treating the terms \u201cdisability,\u201d \u201ccondition,\u201d and \u201cconditions\u201d synonymously. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10,13-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">In the alternative, he argues that remand is warranted because the Board failed to consider whether his non-service-connected stroke, which the Board recognized as a condition affecting his need for aid and attendance, is aggravated by his service-connected cold injury and should constitute a second entitling condition under section 1114(o). <em>Id. </em>at 22-26 (citing <em>Allen v. Brown, </em>7 Vet.App. 439 (1995) (en banc)). He states that remand is warranted to enable the Board to \u201cdetermine whether [his] service-connected loss of use of his feet aggravates his non-service-connected disabilities and whether this aggravation qualifies him for an additional [SMC] award under [38 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1114(0, (o) , (r)(1)[,] and [38 C.F.R.] \u00a7 3.352(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">His second argument for remand is that the Board failed to consider whether he is entitled to a higher rate under subsection (p) , which allows for an intermediate or full higher rate where a \u201cveteran\u2019s service-connected disabilities exceed the requirements for any of the rates prescribed in ... section [1114].\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(p); <em>see </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 27-28. As noted above, the appellant asserts that the January 2011 award of a higher rate of SMC under section 1114(p), effective from March 2010, does not moot his argument because he asserts that, on remand, the Board could determine that he is entitled to a full-step higher rate of SMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-13\">B. The Secretary\u2019s Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b83-14\">In a substitute brief, the Secretary argues that the regulations are consistent with both the plain language of the statute, as well as with congressional intent. Secretary\u2019s Br. at 6-18. The Secretary asserts that 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.350(e)(3) correctly interprets 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(o), and that both the regulation and the statute clearly preclude awards for the maximum rate of SMC under subsection (o) based on the same disability. <em>Id. </em>at 9. The Secretary argues that \u201c[i]n the context of [section 1114(o) ] and its history, the word \u2018conditions\u2019 clearly refers to a term such as \u2018circumstances,\u2019 and the latter use of the word \u2018condition,\u2019 in its singular form, refers to the underlying <em>disability or disabilities, </em>such as anatomical loss, loss of use, or blindness, that entitles a [v]eteran to a rate proscribed in paragraph (l) to (n) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15 (emphasis in original). The Secretary maintains that \u201cthe statute, since its inception, awarded the higher (o) rate to an individual who had loss or loss of use of the lower extremities and, in addition, helplessness due to some other service-connected disability or disabilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10. Because the appellant\u2019s need for aid and attendance arises out of the loss of use of his feet, the Secretary argues that he is not entitled to a higher rate of SMC under section 1114(o). <em>Id. </em>at 18. At oral argument, the Secretary conceded that <em>if </em>the appellant is entitled to a higher rate of SMC under section 1114(o), then he would also be entitled to an additional allowance under subsection (r)(l) based on his need for regular aid and attendance.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">With respect to the appellant\u2019s arguments for remand, the Secretary asserts that the appellant has not previously raised a claim for service connection on a secondary basis and has not pointed to evidence in the record of any such claim. <em>Id. </em>at 18-22. The Secretary argues that the record merely establishes that the appellant suffered a stroke, which rendered him unable to propel his wheelchair. <em>Id. </em>at 21. The Secretary contends that the appellant has not demonstrated error in the Board\u2019s decision because the appellant has not previously asserted a belief that his non-service-connected stroke is related to the cold weather residuals that caused the loss of use of his feet and the Board is \u201cnot \u2018require[d] to conduct an exercise in prognostication.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Talbert v. Brown, </em>7 Vet.App. 352, 356 (1995)). Finally, the Secretary refutes the appellant\u2019s assertion that subsection (p) was potentially applicable to the appellant\u2019s claim at the time of the Board\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 22. The Secretary relies on VA\u2019s regulation 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.350(f) (2010), which delineates numerous instances in which the Secretary is authorized to pay SMC at the next higher rate or at an intermediate rate. <em>Id. </em>Because loss of use of both feet, along with the need for regular aid and attendance, is not one of the enumerated circumstances listed in \u00a7 3.350(f), the Secretary asserts that section 1114(p) is not applicable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">III. LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">A. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">SMC is available when, \u201cas the result of service-connected disability,\u201d a veteran suffers additional hardships above and beyond those contemplated by VA\u2019s schedule for rating disabilities. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(k)-(s). The rate of SMC \u201cvaries according to the nature of the veteran\u2019s service-connected disabilities.\u201d <em>Moreira v. Principi, </em>3 Vet.App. 522, 524' (1992). The Board\u2019s determination as to whether a veteran is entitled to SMC is a finding of fact that this Court reviews under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review. <em>See Prejean v. West, </em>13 Vet.App. 444, 447 (2000); <em>Turco v. Brown, </em>9 Vet.App. 222, 224 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">Basic levels of SMC are listed in section 1114(k). Higher levels of SMC are provided in sections 1114(7), (m), (n), and (o), which state, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-10\"><em>(l) </em>if the veteran, as the result of service-connected disability, has suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of both feet, or of one hand and one foot, or is blind in both eyes, with 5/200 visual acuity or less, or is permanently bedridden or with such significant disabilities as to be in need of regular aid and attendance, the monthly compensation shall be $3,075;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-11\">(m) if the veteran, as the result of service-connected disability, has suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of both hands, or of both legs at a level, or with complications, preventing natural knee action with prosthesis in place, or of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>arm and one leg ..., or has suffered blindness in both eyes having only light perception, or has suffered blindness in both eyes, rendering such veteran so significantly disabled as to be in need of regular aid and attendance, the monthly compensation shall be $3,392;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">(n) if the veteran, as the result of service-connected disability, has suffered the anatomical loss or loss of use of both arms at levels, or with complications, preventing natural elbow action with prosthesis in place, has suffered the anatomical loss of both legs so near the hip as to prevent the use of prosthetic appliances, or has suffered the anatomical loss of one arm and one leg ..., or has suffered anatomical loss of both eyes, or has suffered blindness without light perception in both eyes, the monthly compensation shall be $3,860;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">(o) if the veteran, as the result of service-connected disability, has suffered disability under conditions which would entitle such veteran to two or more of the rates provided in one or more subsections (l) through (n) of this section, no condition being considered twice in the determination, ... the monthly compensation shall be $4,313.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(Z) \u2014 (o). Thus, subsections (l) through (n) provide progressively increased rates of SMC based on the severity of the veteran\u2019s disability. Subsection (o) provides for an even higher rate of SMC for veterans who are entitled to two or more of the rates provided under one or more subsections (l) through (n).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Subsection (p) provides for half- or full-step increases to the next higher rate in subsections (l) through (n) for a veteran whose condition exceeds the requirements of his current rate, but does not qualify for the next higher rate. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(p). Finally, if a veteran is entitled to compensation authorized under subsection (o),</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\"><em>and </em>is in need of regular aid and attendance, then in addition to compensation available under subsection (o), he is entitled to receive an <em>additional </em>\u201caid and attendance allowance\u201d under section 1114(r)(l) and (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">B. 38 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3.350, 3.352 (2011)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">VA has promulgated regulations implementing section 1114. 38 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3.350, 3.352 (2011). As relevant to this appeal, the regulation implementing section 1114(o) provides that SMC under the (o) rate is payable for \u201c[c]onditions entitling to two or more of the rates (no condition being considered twice) provided in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(Z) through (n).\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.350(e)(l)(ii). The appellant challenges \u00a7 3.350(e)(3), which provides the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of subsection (o )\u2019s proviso \u201cno condition being considered twice in the determination,\u201d and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGA\"><em>Combinations. </em>Determinations must be based upon separate and distinct disabilities. This requires, for example, that where a veteran who had suffered the loss or loss of use of two extremities is being considered for the maximum rate on account of helplessness requiring regular aid and attendance, the latter must be based on need resulting from pathology other than that of the extremities. If the loss or loss of use of two extremities or being permanently bedridden leaves the person helpless, increase is not in order on account of this helplessness. Under no circumstances will the combination of \u201cbeing permanently bedridden\u201d and \u201cbeing so helpless as to require regular aid and attendance\u201d without separate and distinct anatomical loss, or loss of use, of two extremities, or blindness, be taken as entitling to the maximum benefit. The fact, however, that two separate and distinct entitling disabilities, such as anatomical loss, or loss of use of both hands and both feet, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>result from a common etiological agent, for example, one injury or rheumatoid arthritis, will not preclude maximum entitlement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.350(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The criteria relevant to the determination of whether a veteran \u201cis so helpless as to be in need of regular aid and attendance are contained in \u00a7 3.352(a).\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.350(b)(3). Section 3.352(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">The following will be accorded consideration in determining the need for regular aid and attendance ...: inability of claimant to dress or undress himself (herself), or to keep himself (herself) ordinarily clean and presentable; frequent need of adjustment of any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliances which by reason of the particular disability cannot be done without aid (this will not include the adjustment of appliances which normal persons would be unable to adjust without aid, such as supports, belts, lacing at the back, etc.); inability of claimant to feed himself (herself) through loss of coordination of upper extremities or through extreme weakness; inability to attend to the wants of nature; or incapacity, physical or mental, which requires care or assistance on a regular basis to protect the claimant from hazards or dangers incident to his or her daily environment.... It is not required that all of the disabling conditions enumerated in this paragraph be found to exist before a favorable rating may be made. The particular personal functions which the veteran is unable to perform should be considered in connection with his or her condition as a whole. It is only necessary that the evidence establish that the veteran is so helpless as to need regular aid and attendance, not that there be a constant need.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.352(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b86-14\">The question before the Court is whether a veteran who is in receipt of SMC under section 1114(\u00bf) for the loss of use of both feet qualifies to receive the maximum rate of SMC under section 1114(o) by establishing that he has also suffered disability under conditions that would entitle him to SMC under subsection (O on account of being in need of regular aid and attendance \u2014 when the veteran\u2019s need for aid and attendance is the result of his only qualifying service-connected disability<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 the loss of use of both <em>feet </em>\u2014 and subsection (o) prohibits a \u201ccondition [from] being considered twice in the determination.\u201d Alternatively stated, can the need for aid and attendance, in and of itself, constitute a qualifying condition when that need arises from the veteran\u2019s only service-connected disability that already entitles him to SMC under section 1114(0? This is a matter of statutory interpretation, which the Court determines de novo. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7261(a)(1); <em>Butts v. Brown, </em>5 Vet.App. 532, 539 (1993) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-15\">A. Statutory Interpretation</p>\n<p id=\"b86-16\">\u201cStatutory interpretation begins with the language of the statute, the plain meaning of which we derive from its text <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>and structure.\u201d <em>Myore v.

The \u201cneed of regular aid and attendance\u201d in section 1114(0 must be the result of \u201csuch significant disabilities.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(0-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">Section 1114(o) states that if the veteran, as the result of service-connected disability, has suffered disability under <em>conditions </em>which would entitle such veteran to two or more of the rates provided in one or more subsections (O through (n) of this section, no <em>condition </em>being considered twice in the determination, ... the monthly compensation shall be $4,313.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(o) (emphasis added). The meaning of emphasized terms \u201cconditions\u201d and \u201ccondition,\u201d as well as the phrase \u201cno condition being considered twice in the determination\u201d is essential to the Court\u2019s resolution of the matter on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">Both parties argue that the plain and unambiguous language of subsection (o) supports their respective positions. The appellant posits that each distinct way to receive an award of SMC under subsections (l), (m), and (n), <em>e.g., </em>\u201cthe anatomical loss or loss or use of both hands,\u201d or \u201cblindness in both eyes having only light perception,\u201d is a \u201ccondition\u201d under subsection (o), which may not be considered twice when determining whether an award under (o) is warranted. Thus, he contends that he is entitled to a higher rate of SMC under section 1114(o) because he has two qualifying conditions under subsection (l): loss of use of both feet <em>and </em>need for aid and attendance. Questioned at oral argument how he interprets the phrase \u201cno condition being considered twice,\u201d the appellant stated that a veteran could not receive SMC at the (o) rate because he has loss of use of both feet <em>and </em>loss of use of both feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">The Secretary asserts that entitlement to the higher rate under subsection (o) must be based on separate and distinct disabilities. The Secretary posits that subsection (o )\u2019s use of the term \u201cconditions\u201d refers generally to a term such as \u201ccircumstances,\u201d and the latter use of the word \u201ccondition,\u201d refers to the underlying <em>disability or combination of disabilities, </em>such as anatomical loss, loss of use, or blindness, that entitles a veteran to a rate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>proscribed in subsections (l), (m), and (n) of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114. At oral argument, the Secretary explained that under subsection (o) a veteran may receive the maximum rate if, for example, the veteran has the loss of use of both feet and sustained a separate service-connected disability, e.g., a traumatic brain injury, that requires aid and attendance.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">The Court notes that nowhere in the statute does Congress define the terms \u201ccondition\u201d or \u201cconditions.\u201d Moreover, a review of section 1114, as a whole, reveals that Congress did not use either term in any subsection other than subsection (o). The statute\u2019s silence on the definition of \u201ccondition(s),\u201d may appropriately be understood as Congress\u2019s having delegated this matter to the Secretary. <em>See U.S. v. Mead Corp., </em>533 U.S. 218, 226-27, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001); <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843-44, 104 S.Ct. 2778; <em>see also </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(a) (providing that \u201c[t]he Secretary has authority to prescribe all rules and regulations which are necessary or appropriate to carry out the laws administered by the department\u201d). Therefore, because \u201ccondition\u201d is not defined in the statute <em>and </em>the Secretary interprets that the structure of the statute to imply multiple meanings to the same term, the Court concludes that the language of the statute is ambiguous with respect to the precise issue presented by this appeal. <em>See Haas v.

The Meaning of </em>\u201cCondition\u201d <em>and \u201cNo Condition Being Considered Twice </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">In reviewing the Secretary\u2019s regulation, the Court notes that sections 3.350(e)(%) and <em>(2), </em>expressly use the terms \u201ccondition\u201d and \u201cconditions\u201d in describing when a claimant would be entitled to a higher rate of SMC under section 1114(o). 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.350(e)(1) and (2). The portion of the regulation that the appellant challenges, \u00a7 3.350(e)(3), uses <em>only </em>the term \u201cdisabilities,\u201d and does not use the term \u201ccondition\u201d or \u201cconditions.\u201d Section 3.350(e)(3), entitled \u201cCombinations,\u201d appears to specifically implement the statutory language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>section 1114(o), \u201cno condition being considered twice in the determination,\u201d by-stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-5\">Determinations must be based upon separate and distinct disabilities. This requires, for example, that where a veteran who had suffered the loss or loss of use of two extremities is being considered for the maximum rate on account of helplessness requiring regular aid and attendance, the latter must be based on need resulting from pathology other than that of the extremities. If the loss or loss of use of two extremities or being permanently bedridden leaves the person helpless, increase is not in order on account of this helplessness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.350(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201ccondition\u201d in section 1114(o) to mean \u201cdisability\u201d is implemented by the first sentence of the regulation requiring that \u201c[d]eterminations must be based upon separate and distinct disabilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The remainder of \u00a7 3.350(e)(3) describes when a veteran may and may not be entitled to a higher rate of SMC on account of helplessness requiring regular aid and attendance <em>and </em>has suffered the loss or loss of use of two extremities. The specific question the Court must address is whether the Secretary\u2019s regulation, which interprets the phrase \u201cno condition being considered twice\u201d to mean \u201cno <em>disability </em>being considered twice\u201d is a reasonable construction of the statute. <em>Chevron, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">The purpose of an agency\u2019s regulation is to articulate the agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute, and to provide guidance on how to implement that statute. <em>See Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. 199, 231, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974) (\u201cThe power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created ... program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress.\u201d). Because the primary function of any regulation is to interpret the statute it implements, not mimic it, a regulation need not, and should not, parrot the statute it implements. This Court has held that regulatory language that \u201cmerely parrots the statutory language\u201d has no interpretive value. <em>See Sharp, </em>23 Vet.App. at 274 (finding that 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.4(b)(2) (2009) \u201cdoes not assist in the interpretation of section 1115 because it merely parrots the statutory language\u201d); <em>see also Gonzales v. Oregon, </em>546 U.S. 243, 257, 126 S.Ct. 904, 163 L.Ed.2d 748 (2006) (\u201c[T]he existence of a parroting regulation does not change the fact that the question here is not the meaning of the regulation but the meaning of the statute.\u201d). Therefore, the absence of the word \u201ccondition\u201d or \u201cconditions\u201d in \u00a7 3.350(e)(3) by itself does not render the Secretary\u2019s interpretation invalid. Instead, by explaining that determinations \u201cmust be based upon separate and distinct disabilities\u201d \u00a7 3.350(e)(3) fulfills its primary function by giving instruction and meaning to the phrase \u201cno condition being considered twice in the determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">Thus, the Secretary asserts that \u00a7 3.350(e)(3), which instructs that SMC under section 1114(o) is to be granted to veterans who are in need of aid and attendance for a service-connected disability that is separate and distinct from the anatomical loss or loss of use or blindness that is already the subject of a rate of SMC under subsections (l) through (n), is consistent with the statute\u2019s requirement that \u201cno condition be considered twice in the determination.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(o). The Secretary finds support for his position in the legislative history leading to the 1945 amendments to Veterans\u2019 Regulation No. 1(a), which permitted helplessness, for the first time, to be combined with other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>qualifying conditions for the maximum rate of SMC.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The Secretary points out that in July 1945, the Veterans Administration Administrator, General Frank T. Hines, submitted VA\u2019s legislative proposal to Congress urging that helplessness be included as a basis upon which the maximum rate of SMC could be awarded. <em>See </em>91 Cong. Rec. 7880-81 (1945). In a letter to Congress, the Administrator explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">The maximum rate, as a result of including helplessness as one of the entitling multiple disabilities, is intended to cover, in addition to obvious losses and blindness, transverse myelitis with loss of use of both legs and loss of anal and bladder sphincter control, generally resulting from severance of the spinal cord in action or incident to airplane or motorized military equipment crashes; also the loss of use of two extremities with near blindness and absolute deafness, <em>or </em>with severe multiple injuries <em>outside the useless extremities, </em>these conditions being construed as loss of use of two extremities and helplessness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 7881 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">The same congressional record contains a chart the Administrator submitted to Congress setting forth the then-current and proposed amounts for each level of SMC. The chart specified that the maximum rate of SMC would be awarded for</p>\n<p id=\"AK\">\u201c\u2018[d]ouble total\u2019 disability which was defined as a \u2018total\u2019 disability, along with helplessness \u2018from <em>other pathology, </em>including blind and deaf.\u2019 \u201d Secretary\u2019s Br. at 13-14 (quoting 91 Cong. Rec. at 7884) (emphasis added). It is undisputed that the 1945 amendments intended to broaden the conditions that could be combined to warrant an award of the maximum rate. The Administrator\u2019s explanation to Congress and the chart he submitted reflect that to give effect to the statutory language that \u201cno condition be[ ] considered twice in the determination,\u201d VA envisioned that the maximum rate would be available when the veteran suffered from the loss or loss of use of two extremities, with helplessness arising from an additional service-connected disability, <em>other than </em>the loss or loss of use of two extremities.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">On September 20, 1945, Congress amended the Veterans\u2019 Regulations \u201cto provide additional rates of compensation or pension and remedy inequalities as to specific service-incurred disabilities in excess of total disability.\u201d Pub.L. No. 79-182 (1945). In doing so, Congress adopted what is now subsection (o), as proposed by VA. The lack of a statutory definition for the term \u201ccondition\u201d in subsection (o) left a gap to be filled by the Agency \u2014 and as noted above \u2014 the history provided by the Secretary shows that VA has, since its inception, viewed the inclusion of helpless<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>ness as a qualifying condition for the maximum rate to require that the need for aid and attendance arise from pathology <em>other </em>than that for which the claimant is already in receipt of SMC. While \u201creliance on longstanding agency practice must be tempered with some caution in the veterans context,\u201d <em>see Brown v. Gardner, </em>513 U.S. 115, 120, 115 S.Ct. 552, 130 L.Ed.2d 462 (1994) (refusing <em>Chevron </em>deference to the Agency\u2019s longstanding interpretation that was contrary to the plain language of the statute), it is not prohibited. <em>See Disabled Am.

The regulation\u2019s reference to \u201cseparate and distinct disabilities\u201d resolves any ambiguity in the statutory language \u201cno condition being considered twice\u201d and makes clear that the maximum rate under subsection (o) is available only when the veteran\u2019s entitlement to two or more rates under subsections (l) through (n) is based on separate service-connected disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Additional support for the Secretary\u2019s interpretation can be found in the statute itself. Subsection (m) specifically provides for a higher rate of SMC when \u201cthe veteran, as the result of service-connected disability ... has suffered blindness in both eyes, rendering such veteran significantly disabled as to be in need of regular aid and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>attendance.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(m); <em>cf. </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(k), <em>(l) </em>(providing lower rates of SMC if a veteran, as the result of service-connected disability has suffered \u201cblindness of one eye, having only light perception\u201d or \u201cis blind in both eyes, with 5/200 visual acuity or less\u201d). A comparison of the rates of compensation provided by Congress for veterans who have suffered varying degrees of blindness demonstrates that when Congress intended to provide a higher rate for a condition \u2014 blindness\u2014 when that <em>same </em>condition also resulted in the need for aid and attendance, Congress knew how to do so. At the same time, Congress generally provided in subsection (o) that the maximum rate may be awarded where the veteran establishes entitlement to two or more of the rates provided in subsections (l) through (n), so long as \u201cno condition [is] considered twice in the determination.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(o). Although this distinction may seem somewhat arbitrary that a veteran who suffers blindness in both eyes <em>and </em>is in need of aid and attendance as a result of that blindness is entitled to a higher rate of compensation (although at the \u201c(m)\u201d rate, not the maximum) than a veteran who suffers the loss of use of both feet <em>and </em>is in need of aid and attendance as a result of the loss of use of both feet, Congress expressly devised progressively increasing rates of SMC in subsections (l) through (o) based upon its determination of what conditions were more disabling. Against this backdrop, the Court cannot find the Secretary\u2019s interpretation, which prohibits SMC at the maximum(o) rate when the need for aid and attendance arises from the <em>same </em>pathology that otherwise entitles the veteran to an award of SMC at a rate provided in subsections (l) through (n), unreasonable. 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.350(e)(3). Although the Court is sympathetic to the appellant\u2019s situation, his remedy lies with Congress, not this Court. <em>See Nat\u2019l Cable &amp; Telecomm. Ass\u2019n v.

Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 139, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944))). Thus, in recognition of the fact that \u201cmost words have different shades of meaning\u201d and can be \u201cvariously construed\u201d the Court agrees with the Secretary that the term \u201cconditions\u201d in subsection (o) refers generally to \u201ccircumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Accordingly, the Court holds that a claimant who is in receipt of SMC cannot establish entitlement to a second rate of SMC under section 1114(0 based on the need for aid and attendance \u2014 and, hence, a higher rate of SMC under section 1114(o) \u2014 unless the claimant\u2019s need for aid and attendance arises from a disability <em>other </em>than that for which the claimant is already in receipt of SMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">C. Application To Case</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">The appellant here is in receipt of SMC under section 1114(Z) for loss of use of both feet. He does not dispute that his need for aid and attendance results from his loss of use of both feet. Because section 1114(Z) requires the need for aid and attendance to be the result of \u201csuch significant disabilities,\u201d any second award of SMC under section 1114(Z) for aid and attendance would necessarily be based on the appellant\u2019s loss of use of both feet. <em>See Howell v. Nicholson, </em>19 Vet.App. 535, 538 (2006) (holding that the \u201c[t]he plain and unambiguous language of section 1114(Z) requires that a claimant be in need of regular aid and attendance \u2018as the result of service-connected disability\u2019 \u201d (quoting 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(0))- Since section 1114(o) precludes conditions from \u201cbeing considered twice\u201d in determining entitlement to two or more rates under sections 1114(() through (n), and the Court concluded above that the Secretary\u2019s regulation, requiring determinations to be based on separate and distinct disabilities, is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>valid interpretation of subsection (o), the appellant\u2019s loss of use of both feet cannot satisfy the requirement for SMC under section 1114(i) for both the loss of use of both feet <em>and </em>for being in need of aid and attendance <em>as a result of the loss of use of both feet. </em>Because the appellant is not entitled to a second rate of SMC under section 1114(Z) based on the need for aid and attendance as a result of the loss of use of both feet, the Court must affirm the Board\u2019s February 5, 2009, decision, insofar as the Board denied entitlement to the higher rate of SMC under section 1114(o). In addition, because the appellant is not entitled to a higher rate of SMC under section 1114(o), his argument for an even higher rate of SMC under section 1114(r)(l) is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">D. Secondary Service Connection</p>\n<p id=\"A7\">The appellant raises two alternative arguments for remand. As noted above, the appellant argues that remand is warranted because the Board failed to consider whether his non-service-eonnected stroke, which the Board recognized as a condition affecting his need for aid and attendance, is aggravated by his service-connected cold injury and should constitute a second entitling condition under section 1114(o). <em>Id. </em>at 22-26 (citing <em>Allen, supra). </em>He states that the Court should remand the matter to enable the Board to \u201cdetermine whether [his] service-connected loss of use of his feet aggravates his non-service-connected disabilities and whether this aggravation qualifies him for an additional [SMC] award under \u00a7 1114(\u00a3), (o), (r)(l)[,] and \u00a7 3.352(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26. At oral argument, the appellant identified three pages in the record of proceedings, which, he asserts, reasonably raise a claim that his cold injury aggravated his stroke. <em>See </em>R. at 48, 49, and 151. The Secretary countered that the appellant did not previously raise a claim for service connection on a secondary basis and that the documents relied on by the appellant fail to reasonably raise an allegation that his stroke was caused by or related to his service-connected cold injury. The Court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Although the record reflects that the appellant mentioned \u201cleft sided[d] weakness deteriorating at present, [with] limited use of left hand and arm needed to propel [his] wheelchair\u201d (R. at 151) and that he related his inability to propel his wheelchair to a stroke suffered in 1997 (R. at 49), none of the documents indicate an intent to apply for VA benefits for his stroke, or in any way attribute the stroke to his service-connected cold injury. \u201cAlthough the Board must interpret a claimant\u2019s submissions broadly, \u2018the Board is not required to conjure up issues that were not raised by the claimant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brokowski v. Shinseki, </em>23 Vet.App. 79, 85 (2009) (quoting <em>Brannon v. West, </em>12 Vet.App. 32, 35 (1998)); <em>see also Robinson v. Shinseki </em>557 F.3d 1355, 1361 (Fed.Cir.2009) (\u201c[C]laims which have no support in the record need not be considered by the Board.\u201d); <em>Criswell v. Nicholson, </em>20 Vet.App. 501, 503-04 (2006) (\u201cIt follows logically that where there can be found no intent to apply for VA benefits, a claim for such benefits has not been reasonably raised.\u201d). Accordingly, because the appellant has not identified any documents in the record that reasonably raise a claim that his stroke was aggravated by his service-connected cold injury, the Board did not err by failing to address this theory of entitlement to benefits. <em>See Robinson, Brokowski, </em>and <em>Criswell, </em>all <em>supra. </em>If the appellant believes that the residuals of his cold injury aggravate his stroke condition, he is free to pursue that claim at the RO, and initiate an appeal from any adverse determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">E. Higher Rate of SMC Under Section 1114(p)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">The appellant\u2019s second argument for remand is that he is entitled to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>higher rate under subsection (p), which allows for an intermediate rate or a full higher rate where a veteran\u2019s \u201cservice-connected disabilities exceed the requirements for any of the rates prescribed in this section.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 27-28. The Secretary argues that subsection (p) was not applicable to the appellant\u2019s claim at the time of the Board\u2019s decision because 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.350(f) does not specify the appellant\u2019s condition as one of the instances in which the next higher rate or an intermediate rate may be awarded. Secretary\u2019s Br. at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">In this instance, the Court agrees with the appellant that the Board erred when it failed to consider his entitlement to a higher rate of SMC under subsection (p). <em>See Schafrath v. Derwinski, </em>1 Vet.App. 589, 592-93 (1991) (holding that the Board is required to discuss in its decision all \u201cpotentially applicable\u201d provisions of law and regulation) (citing 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7104(a)). Subsection (p) provides for half- or full-step increases to the next higher rate in subsections (l) through (n) for a veteran whose condition <em>exceeds </em>the requirements of his current rate, but does not qualify for the next higher rate. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(p).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Here, there is no dispute that the Board favorably found that the appellant\u2019s \u201cresiduals of a cold injury ... render [him] wheelchair bound and result in [his] being unable to get around by himself or perform several activities of daily living, including bathing, without aid and attendance of another.\u201d R. at 4. It cannot reasonably be disputed that a veteran who has suffered the loss of use of both feet <em>and </em>is in need of regular aid and attendance of another is more disabled than a veteran who has suffered the loss of use of both feet <em>but </em>does not require the aid and attendance of another. While the appellant\u2019s condition does not warrant the assignment of the maximum (o) rate because of the statutory prohibition that \u201cno condition be[ ] considered twice in the determination,\u201d it appears that the appellant\u2019s overall service-connected condition <em>exceeds </em>the requirements of subsection (l) in that he has suffered <em>both </em>the loss of use of both feet <em>and </em>is with such significant disability that he requires the aid and attendance of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">In its decision, the Board discussed only section 1114(\u00a3) and (o). Therefore, it is not apparent that the Board considered the potential applicability of section 1114(p). This failure to consider the appellant\u2019s eligibility for a higher rate of SMC constitutes remandable error. <em>See AB v. Brown, </em>6 Vet.App. 35, 38 (1993) (holding that claimants on both original claims and claims for increased disability are \u201cpresumed to be seeking the maximum benefit allowed by law and regulation\u201d). The Court is not persuaded by the Secretary\u2019s argument that the appellant is not entitled to a higher rate under subsection (p) solely because his condition is not one of the enumerated instances provided in 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.350(f). Nothing in the statute or the regulation indicates that the list provided in \u00a7 3.350(f) is intended to be exclusive, nor does the Secretary provide any support for that reading of the regulation. <em>See Martin v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>499 U.S. 144, 156, 111 S.Ct. 1171,113 L.Ed.2d 117 (1991) (\u201c \u2018[L]itigation positions\u2019 are not entitled to deference when they are merely appellate counsel\u2019s \u2018post hoc rationalizations\u2019 for agency action advanced for the first time in the reviewing court.\u201d). The Court will therefore remand the matter to the Board to consider in the first instance whether the appellant\u2019s overall service-connected disability picture <em>exceeds </em>the requirements of section 1114(Z) such that he is entitled to an intermediate rate or a full higher rate under section 1114(p).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>On remand, the appellant is free to submit additional evidence and argument on the remanded matters, and the Board is required to consider any such relevant evidence and argument. <em>See Kay v. Principi, </em>16 Vet.App. 529, 584 (2002) (stating that, on remand, the Board must consider additional evidence and argument in assessing entitlement to benefit sought); <em>Kutscherousky v. West, </em>12 Vet.App. 369, 372-73 (1999) (per curiam order). The Court has held that \u201c[a] remand is meant to entail a critical examination of the justification for the decision.\u201d <em>Fletcher v. Derwinski, </em>1 Vet.App. 394, 397 (1991). The Board must proceed expeditiously, in accordance with 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7112 (requiring Secretary to provide for \u201cexpeditious treatment\u201d of claims remanded by the Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">After consideration of the appellant\u2019s and the Secretary\u2019s pleadings, and a review of the record, the Board\u2019s February 5, 2009, decision is AFFIRMED IN PART and VACATED IN PART, and the vacated matter is REMANDED for further proceeding consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">SCHOELEN, Judge, filed the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">KASOLD, Chief Judge, filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-8\">. The appellant does not raise any argument on appeal concerning the denial of SMC on account of being housebound; therefore, the Court will consider the matter to have been abandoned on appeal. <em>See Ford v. Gober, </em>10 Vet.App. 531, 535 (1997) (holding claims not argued on appeal are deemed abandoned); <em>Bucklinger v. Brown, </em>5 Vet.App. 435 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b86-10\">. As noted above, the appellant was granted entitlement to service connection for hearing loss, evaluated as 60% disabling, and tinnitus, evaluated as 10% disabling, effective March 29, 2010. The RO also awarded a higher rate of SMC under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(p), effective March 29, 2010, based on the appellant\u2019s loss of use of both feet <em>and </em>additional service-connected disability (hearing loss) independently ratable at 50% or more. <em>See </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.350(f)(3) (2010). Because these awards were granted after the Board\u2019s February 2009 decision here on appeal, the Court will refer solely to the appellant's loss of use of both feet for the purpose of its discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b90-8\">.

The legislative history of section 1114 shows that in addition to numerous cost-of-living adjustments to the rates prescribed therein, subsection (o) has undergone additional amendment to the statutory language, without change to the pertinent language in dispute. <em>See, e.g. </em>Veterans' Benefits Act of 2010, Pub.L. 111-275, \u00a7 601(a)(3), 124 Stat. 2864.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b96-8\">KASOLD,</author>\n<p id=\"ABx\">Chief Judge, concurring in</p>\n<p id=\"AoI\">part, dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">Congress explicitly authorized in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(o) higher benefits for veterans with two \u201cconditions\u201d listed in subsections (l) through (n) of the same statute, provided no \u201ccondition\u201d is considered twice in the determination. Although the Secretary agreed at oral argument that the loss of both feet does not regularly warrant aid and attendance,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Board found that Mr. Breniser\u2019s service-connected loss of both feet was such that he was in need of regular aid and attendance, two conditions listed in subsection (l) (i.e., loss of both feet and regular aid and attendance). Thus, under the plain reading of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(o ), Mr. Breniser is entitled to higher benefits. Yet, today the majority sanction a longstanding regulation, previously existing in \u201csplendid isolation,\u201d that is in clear contravention of the statute. <em>Brown v. Gardner, </em>513 U.S. 115, 115 S.Ct. 552, 130 L.Ed.2d 462 (1994) (noting the \u201csplendid isolation\u201d in which VA regulations existed for many years). This we should not do for the very same reasons stated in <em>Brown v. Gardner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">The Secretary recognizes his regulation contravenes the statute, and this is most succinctly demonstrated by his need to substitute words for those chosen by Congress. Although Congress uses the word \u201cdisability\u201d throughout section 1114 and only uses the word \u201ccondition\u201d (and its plural) in subsection (o), the Secretary argues that Congress really meant to use \u201cdisability\u201d instead of \u201ccondition.\u201d Such re-drafting of legislation should not be condoned. <em>Bradley v. Peake, </em>22 Vet.App. 280, 291 (2008) (\u201c \u2018 \u201cCongress expresses its intent through the language it chooses\u201d and that the choice of words in a statute is therefore deliberate and reflective.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Shoshone Indian Tribe v. United States, </em>364 F.3d 1339, 1347 (Fed.Cir.2004) (quoting <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 433 n. 12, 436, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987)))); <em>see also United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>States v. LaBonte, </em>520 U.S. 751, 757, 117 S.Ct. 1678, 187 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1997) (\u201c[W]e assume that in drafting this legislation, Congress said what it meant.\u201d); <em>Gardner, supra </em>(rejecting a longstanding regulation that imposed a negligence requirement that was not in the statute); <em>Barrett v.

Had Congress intended to conf\u00edne [the statute], it would have so provided, just as it did in other sections.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The majority find support for the Secretary\u2019s regulation in legislative history, but this support is elusive. First, legislative history cannot trump legislation. <em>See, e.g., Van Wersch v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>197 F.3d 1144, 1152 (Fed.Cir.1999) (holding that congressional intent, as expressed in legislative history, cannot \u201ctrump the irrefutably plain [statutory] language that emerged when Congress actually took pen to paper\u201d). Second, the legislative history here is ambiguous at best, and any ambiguity in the text would be resolved in the veteran\u2019s favor. <em>Cf. Nat\u2019l Org. of Veterans\u2019 Advocates, Inc. v. Sec\u2019y of VA, </em>260 F.3d 1365, 1378 (Fed.Cir.2001) (\u201c[I]t is a well-established rule of statutory construction that when a statute is ambiguous, \u2018interpretive doubt is to be resolved in the veteran\u2019s favor.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Gardner, </em>513 U.S. at 118, 115 S.Ct. 552)). The legislative history provides no clear elaboration on the statute\u2019s use of the word \u201ccondition.\u201d Rather, the legislative history primarily sheds light on Congress\u2019s overarching purposes for implementing subsection (o), which were to (1) provide additional rates of compensation for veterans with \u201cspecific service-incurred disabilities in excess of total disability,\u201d 91 Cong. Rec. at 1780, and (2) make \u201chelplessness\u201d compensable, Memorandum from O.W. Clark, Assistant Adm\u2019r, Veterans Admin., to Frank T. Hines, Adm\u2019r, Veterans Admin. (May 23, 1994). Congress\u2019s intent, if anything, reflects its intent to provide benefits to our veterans based on their disabilities. Succinctly stated, nothing evinces an intent to deny a veteran needing aid and attendance due to a serious service-connected disability such as loss of both feet from receiving a greater benefit than a veteran who had loss of both feet but no need for aid an attendance.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The majority\u2019s concern that the phrase \u201cno condition being considered twice\u201d would have no meaning if not rewritten as the Secretary desires is unfounded. As written by Congress, the phrase is clear and has clear meaning. <em>See Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys. v. Dimension Fin. Corp., </em>474 U.S. 361, 368, 106 S.Ct. 681, 88 L.Ed.2d 691 (1986) (\u201cThe traditional deference courts pay to agency interpretation is not to be applied to alter the clearly expressed intent of Congress.\u201d); <em>see also Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). For example, benefits are provided for the loss of both feet in subsection (l) and for the loss of both legs in subsection (m). The veteran with loss of both legs is not entitled to the higher benefit in subsection (o) because he has loss of both legs, which includes loss of both feet. There are multiple, similar conditions in subsections (l) through (n) that Congress precluded from being considered twice under subsection (o).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">For the reasons stated above, I dissent from the majority\u2019s holding that Mr. Breniser is not entitled to a higher rate of SMC under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(o).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">However, I agree with the majority that the Board, having denied benefits under subsection (o), erred in not considering benefits under subsection (p), which could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>provide an equal or lesser benefit \u2014 although this issue could be mooted if Mr. Breniser were awarded benefits under subsection (o).</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b96-10\">. <em>See </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.352(a) (2011) (listing the criteria for being in need of \"aid and attendance\u201d: such as the inability to dress oneself, inability to keep oneself clean, inability to adjust a prosthetic or orthopedic appliance that a normal person would be able to adjust without aid, inability to feed oneself, inability to attend the wants of nature, and the incapacity to protect oneself).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
