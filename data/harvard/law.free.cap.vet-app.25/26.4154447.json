On May 24, the appellant filed motions (1) to recall the order and mandate, and (2) for reconsideration of the order and, in the alternative, for a panel decision. In support of both motions, the appellant argues that her ability to enforce the terms of the JMR is affected adversely because the Court\u2019s May 3 order does not expressly incorporate those terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-20\">The Court\u2019s Rules of Practice and Procedure (Rules) do not contemplate a motion for reconsideration of the Clerk\u2019s grant of a JMR, or for a panel decision in circumstances where a JMR has been granted by the Clerk. <em>See </em>U.S. Vet.App. R. 35(a) (\u201cA party in a case decided by a single judge may move for reconsideration by the single judge.\u201d) <em>and </em>R. 35(b) (\u201cA party in a case decided by a single judge may move for a decision by a panel of the Court.\u201d). Accordingly, the motion for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>consideration or for a panel decision will be denied. However, for clarification purposes, the motion to recall the order and mandate of May 3 will be granted, and this order will replace the Clerk\u2019s order remanding the matters on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Contrary to the appellant\u2019s argument, her ability to enforce the terms of a JMR is not affected by whether the Court\u2019s order granting the JMR expressly incorporates the JMR\u2019s terms or whether the order remands the matter \u201cfor action consistent with the terms of the joint motion.\u201d The appellant relies on <em>Breeden v. </em>Principi, 17 Vet.App. 475, 479 (2004), for the proposition that if the terms of the JMR are expressly incorporated in the Court\u2019s order, an appellant may seek enforcement of the terms of the JMR without waiting for a final Board decision on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">However, the appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Breeden </em>is misplaced. As noted in <em>Forcier v. Nicholson, </em>19 Vet.App. 414, 424 (2006), Breeden\u2019s holding is that the Court lacked jurisdiction to consider the appeal because the matter was still pending before the Board and the Court\u2019s remand order did not purport to retain jurisdiction over the matter. <em>Breeden </em>involved the appeal of a nonfinal Board decision that the appellant in that case believed was not fulfilling the terms of a JMR granted by the Clerk. Although the Court in <em>Breeden </em>noted that the JMR was not incorporated in the Clerk\u2019s order, the Court explicitly stated that the Clerk\u2019s order granting a JMR is \u201cadministrative rather than adjudicative,\u201d and further stated that the Court lacked jurisdiction over enforcement of the JMR because the Court\u2019s order \u201cdid not purport to retain jurisdiction and \u2018the Court does not have the power to retain general and continuing jurisdiction over a decision remanded to the [Board] for a new adjudication.\u2019 \u201d 17 Vet.App. at 478 (quoting <em>Cleary v. Brown, </em>8 Vet.App. 305, 307 (1995)); <em>see also Forcier, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Moreover, as stated in <em>Forcier, </em>the terms of the JMR granted by the Court are enforceable regardless of whether the Court\u2019s order expressly incorporates them. 19 Vet.App. 414, 425 (2006) (Secretary\u2019s duty to ensure compliance with the terms of a remand \u201cinclude[s] the terms of a joint motion that is granted by the Court but not specifically delineated in the Court\u2019s remand order\u201d). This is true whether the order is issued by the Clerk, a single Judge, a panel, or the en banc Court; all are orders of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">If the Secretary purports to take action in conflict with the JMR, a claimant may seek recourse by appealing to the Board. <em>Forcier, supra; see also Stegall v. West, </em>11 Vet.App. 268, 271 (1998) (a remand order by the Court or the Board imposes upon the Secretary a concomitant duty to ensure compliance with the terms of the remand); <em>see also Dyment v. West, </em>13 Vet.App. 141, 146-47 (1999) (no <em>Stegall </em>violation when the examiner \u201csubstantially complied with the Board\u2019s remand order\u201d). If the Board does not ensure compliance, a claimant may appeal to the Court and, absent a valid reason for not enforcing a requirement in the JMR, the JMR is enforceable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Although the appellant implies that a JMR incorporated into a Court order can be enforced without a final Board decision through a writ of mandamus, she fails to appreciate that mandamus is an extraordinary remedy not to be granted when, inter alia, the veteran possesses adequate alternative means to obtain the desired relief, such as the ability to appeal a decision through the appeals process. <em>Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court D.C., </em>542 U.S. 367, 380-81, 124 S.Ct. 2576, 159 L.Ed.2d 459 (2004) (a writ is not to be used as a substitute for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>the appeals process; the Court may issue a writ of mandamus only when the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to the writ, lacks adequate alternative means to attain the desired relief, and the writ is otherwise warranted). As then-Chief Judge Kramer noted in his concurring statement in <em>Breeden, </em>even if the appellant\u2019s JMR-based appeal of the nonfinal Board decision had been construed as a petition for mandamus, it could not have been granted because it had not been shown that administrative remedies had been exhausted. 17 Vet.App. at 479-80 (citing <em>Steffens v. Brown, 8 </em>Vet.App. 142, 144 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Upon consideration of the foregoing, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">ORDERED that the motion for reconsideration or, in the alternative, panel decision is denied as not contemplated by the Rules. It is further</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">ORDERED that the motion for recall of the May 3, 2011, order and mandate is granted.

It is further</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">ORDERED that the matter on appeal is remanded pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7252(a), for action consistent with the terms of the joint motion for remand. <em>See Border, </em>19 Vet.App. at 425; <em>Stegall, </em>11 Vet.App. at 271. Under Rule 41(b) of the Court\u2019s Rules of Practice and Procedure, this order is the mandate of the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
