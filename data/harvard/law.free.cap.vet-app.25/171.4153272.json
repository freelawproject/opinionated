Quattlebaum, surviving spouse of World War II veteran Cecil L. Quattlebaum, appeals through counsel a June 11, 2009, Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (Board) decision that denied her attempt to reopen a previously denied claim for accrued benefits. Mrs. Quattlebaum argues that the Board\u2019s statement that \u201cfinally denied claims for accrued benefits cannot be reopened once the [one-year] time period [of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5121(c) ] expires\u201d was an incorrect statement of law and not supported by adequate reasons or bases. Record (R.) at 7. The Secretary disputes this argument. For the reasons stated herein, we hold that there is no per se legal bar to reopening a denied accrued benefits claim. Because the Board decision on appeal rests solely on a misunderstanding of the law prejudicial to Mrs. Quattlebaum, it will be set aside and the matter remanded for further adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-21\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b187-22\">Mr. Quattlebaum served on active duty from September 1942 to February 1947. The record of proceedings reflects that, by letter dated August 9, 2000, the Montgomery, Alabama, VA regional office (RO) notified Mr. Quattlebaum that his claim for benefits for, inter alia, tremors of all fingers, twitching in finger, a heart condition, and a total disability rating for individual unemployability (TDIU) had been denied. Nevertheless, on October 20, 2000, and December 19, 2000, the RO continued to send Mr. Quattlebaum letters stating that \u201c[w]e are still processing your application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>for COMPENSATION.\u201d R. at 51, 53. On December 29, 2000, Mr. Quattlebaum died.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Mrs. Quattlebaum\u2019s claim for dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC), death pension, and accrued benefits was received by the RO on February 5, 2001. In a letter dated February 7, 2001, and still addressed to Mr. Quattlebaum, the RO acknowledged that \u201c[w]e have received your application for benefits.\u201d R. at 55. In August 2001, the RO sent a letter to Mrs. Quattlebaum stating, inter alia, that \u201c[a]n accrued benefit is any money VA owed Mr. Quattlebaum at the time of his death. We cannot approve your claim for accrued benefits because VA did not owe him any money.\u201d R. at 318. The RO attached to this letter a rating decision dated August 23, 2001, that denied her DIC claim and determined that eligibility to dependents\u2019 educational assistance was not established, but did not address her accrued benefits claim. Thereafter, Mrs. Quattlebaum filed a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) as to the denial of DIC and perfected an appeal that led to a November 2005 DIC award, effective from December 2000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">In January 2006, Mrs. Quattlebaum notified the RO that she had not received accrued benefits, and asked the RO to review the file, determine whether her husband had a claim pending at the time of his death, and award any benefits due. The record of proceedings does not contain any notice to Mrs. Quattlebaum regarding how to substantiate her claim for accrued benefits or how to reopen her claim. Rather, in August 2006, the RO notified Mrs. Quattlebaum that her husband\u2019s claim had been denied pursuant to the August 9, 2000, letter, and advised her that, if she disagreed, she could file an NOD within one year. Mrs. Quattlebaum filed a timely NOD, identifying the December 2000 and February 2001 letters as evidence that a claim was pending at the time of her husband\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">A September 2007 Statement of the Case (SOC) restated that Mr. Quattlebaum had no pending claim at the time of his death, and also noted that accrued benefits were not warranted because the January 2006 claim had been submitted more than one year after her husband\u2019s death. Following Mrs. Quattlebaum\u2019s Substantive Appeal, the Board decision on appeal denied entitlement to accrued benefits. The Board reasoned that, because Mrs. Quattlebaum previously had been denied entitl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>ment to accrued benefits, \u201cher [January 2006] claim is essentially one to reopen.\u201d R. at 7. It further reasoned that \u201c[t]he language in \u00a7 5121(c) is inconsistent with permitting consideration of a reopened claim received more than one year after death\u201d and that \u201cit is \u00a7 5121(c) which controls here, not \u00a7 5108.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Board determined that, although Mrs. Quattlebaum\u2019s initial application met the section 5121(c) one-year filing requirement, her current claim \u201cwas filed more than five years after the Veteran\u2019s date of death\u201d and therefore \u201cdoes not meet the statutory requirement for paying accrued benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">II. THE PARTIES\u2019 ARGUMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">On appeal, Mrs. Quattlebaum argues that the Board\u2019s statement that a surviving spouse cannot reopen an accrued benefits claim more than one year after the veteran\u2019s death was not supported by adequate reasons or bases and was not in accordance with law. She contends that the statutory scheme does not explicitly or implicitly exclude accrued benefits claims from being reopened, and asserts that 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5121(c) can be read in harmony with 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5108. During oral argument, Mrs. Quattlebaum asserted two counts of prejudice arising from the Board\u2019s misunderstanding of the law, to wit: (1) she was never informed of the evidence necessary to substantiate her claim as required by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> such that she was deprived of a meaningful opportunity to participate in the processing of her claim, and (2) the Board, in rendering its erroneous decision on the law, never evaluated whether she had submitted new and material evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">The Secretary argues that the Board correctly stated the law and that a surviving spouse cannot reopen an accrued benefits claim more than one year after the veteran\u2019s death because the statutory scheme does not permit the reopening of an accrued benefits claim. At oral argument, the Secretary further posited that an attempt to reopen an accrued benefits claim is an exercise in futility because an accrued benefits claim is based on the evidence \u201cin the file at date of death\u201d and such evidence cannot also constitute the \u201cnew and material\u201d evidence required to reopen a claim. When confronted with the possibility that evidence could be both \u201cin the file at date of death\u201d and \u201cnew and material,\u201d the Secretary argued in the alternative that a motion for revision based on clear and unmistakable error (CUE) was the proper avenue for relief in such situations. The Secretary also asserts that Mrs. Quattlebaum has not demonstrated prejudice, because she merely asked for a review of the record and submitted no new and material evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">A. Reopening Accrued Benefits Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">Section 5121 permits a surviving spouse to \u201cstand in the shoes of the veteran and pursue his claim after his death\u201d by filing an accrued benefits claim, <em>Zevalkink v. Brown, </em>6 Vet.App. 483, 490 (1994), <em>aff'd, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>102 F.3d 1236 (Fed.Cir.1996), so long as the surviving spouse files an application for accrued benefits \u201cwithin one year after the [veteran\u2019s] date of death,\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5121(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additionally, if the application is incomplete at the time originally submitted, the Secretary must provide notification of the evidence necessary to complete the application, and an accrued benefits claimant has an additional year after such notification to submit that necessary evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Section 5108 states that \u201c[i]f new and material evidence is presented or secured with respect to a claim which has been disallowed, the Secretary shall reopen the claim and review the former disposition of the claim.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5108; <em>see </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.156 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The Board found the notion of reopening an accrued benefits claim pursuant to section 5108 inconsistent with the one-year requirement of section 5121(c), reasoning that \u201caccrued benefits [claims] cannot be reopened once the [one-year] time period expires.\u201d R. at 7. Succinctly stated, however, we see no such inconsistency.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On its face, section 5121 in no way indicates a preclusion of reopening accrued benefits claims. Similarly, section 5108 on its face allows the reopening of <em>any </em>previously disallowed claim. Read together, an accrued benefits claim must be filed within one year after the veteran\u2019s date of death pursuant to section 5121(c), <em>and </em>an accrued benefits claim can be reopened upon the presenting of new and material evidence pursuant to section 5108.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">The Board also noted that the language of section 5121(c) regarding incomplete applications for accrued benefits \u2014 namely, that the Secretary must notify the claimant if an application is incomplete, and the claimant has one year thereafter to submit evidence completing the application \u2014 \u201cindicates that once the specific time limit elapses, no accrued benefits will be paid if the requested evidence is ultimately submitted in an untimely matter.\u201d R. at 7. However, this discussion of incomplete applications is referring to applications that do not \u201cestablish that the claimant is within the category of persons eligible to receive accrued benefits.\u201d <em>Hyatt v. Shinseki, </em>566 F.3d 1364, 1370 (Fed.Cir.2009); see-Evidence for Accrued Benefits, 67 Fed. Reg. 9638, 9639 (Mar. 4, 2002) (Secretary noting that the \u201cevidence\u201d to be submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>in section 5121(c) is \u201cthat information necessary to establish that the applicant for accrued benefits is the person eligible for and entitled to those benefits\u201d). Once a claim is timely filed and an application is completed (i.e., status as a proper accrued benefits claimant is established), section 5121(c) in no way limits the submission of evidence pertaining to the merits of the accrued benefits claim or bars a claim to reopen.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Further, the Secretary\u2019s contention\u2014 that attempting to reopen an accrued benefits claim is an exercise in futility because an accrued benefits claim is based only on evidence \u201cin the file at date of death,\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5121(a), and therefore any new evidence submitted after death could not be considered and therefore would not be material to the claim \u2014 fails upon examination. This is because the Secretary has defined by regulation the phrase \u201cevidence in the file at date of death,\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5121(a), to include \u201cevidence in VA\u2019s possession on or before the date of the beneficiary\u2019s death, even if such evidence was not physically located in the VA claims folder on or before the date of death.\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1000(d)(4) (2011). Thus, pursuant to this regulation, there may be circumstances \u2014 perhaps rare but certainly possible \u2014 where documents are in the Secretary\u2019s possession at the date of the veteran\u2019s death (and therefore are considered to be in the file at the date of death), yet have never been presented to the Agency decisionmakers. Any such document submitted to the decisionmaker subsequent to a denial of an accrued benefits claim would qualify as \u201cnew\u201d evidence pursuant to 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.156(a) (\u201cNew evidence means existing evidence not previously submitted to agency decisionmakers.\u201d), and might also be material if it (along with evidence previously in the record) \u201crelates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(\u201cMaterial evidence ... relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim.\u201d). For example, if evidence was in the possession of one RO at the date of death, and the surviving spouse\u2019s accrued benefits claim was submitted to and finally denied by another RO without knowledge of the evidence in the possession of the other RO, an accrued benefits claimant may successfully reopen her claim with that evidence, if material.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">At oral argument, when confronted with the above possibility, the Secretary argued that the only proper avenue for obtaining relief in the circumstances described above is a motion for revision based on CUE. However, a CUE motion involves errors \u201cbased on the record ... that existed\u201d at the time of the previous decision, <em>Russell v. Principi, </em>3 Vet.App. 310, 314 (1992) (en banc), while an attempt to reopen involves a supplement to the record that existed before the Agency decisionmaker, <em>see </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.156(a). The situation of a claimant submitting evidence that was in the possession of the Secretary, but not previously in the claims file or before the decisionmaker, more closely aligns with the concept of reopening. Further, the CUE standard requires a claimant to dem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>onstrate that the document \u201cwould manifestly have changed the outcome of the case,\u201d <em>Sondel v. West, </em>18 Vet.App. 213, 221 (1999), imposing a significantly higher burden than that of demonstrating \u201ca reasonable possibility of substantiating the claim,\u201d which is the new-and-material evidence standard. <em>See Shade v. Shinseki, </em>24 Vet.App. 110, 117 (2010); <em>see supra </em>note 6. Thus, while a request for revision based on CUE is potentially one way to obtain accrued benefits when a timely claim for such benefits has been submitted but denied, that option does not preclude the option of seeking to reopen the claim based on new and material evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">We also note that the Board\u2019s view, and the Secretary\u2019s argument, that a timely filed claim for accrued benefits, once denied and final, would not \u2014 as a matter of law \u2014 be subject to reopening, is inconsistent with the Secretary\u2019s position in the past. For example, in <em>Moffitt v. Brown, </em>10 Vet.App. 214, 217 (1997), a surviving spouse filed an accrued benefits claim based on TDIU within one year of her husband\u2019s death, which was finally denied in a 1987 Board decision. The spouse thereafter attempted to reopen the accrued benefits claim in 1991, but a 1994 Board decision found that no new and material evidence had been submitted since the 1987 decision. <em>Id. </em>at 222. On appeal, both the spouse and the Secretary argued that remand was warranted based on a newly service-connected kidney condition that \u201cmay constitute new and material evidence deemed to have been in the file at the date of death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Rather than holding (as the Secretary requests here) that the 1991 attempt to reopen was precluded by statute, the Court agreed that remand was warranted for the Board to readjudicate the accrued benefits claim based on TDIU in light of the kidney condition. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Further, in <em>Wright v. Brown, </em>9 Vet.App. 300, 302-03 (1996), when a surviving spouse \u201csubmitted a document which could be interpreted as a claim alleging CUE ... or, in the alternative, a request to reopen her [accrued benefits] claim\u201d four years after a final Board denial, the Court did not hold (as the Secretary requests here) that such an attempt to reopen was precluded by statute. Rather, the Court stated that, \u201c[t]o the extent that the document submitted ... may be considered as a request to reopen,\u201d the spouse had failed to demonstrate new and material evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">While acknowledging that an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute that it is charged with administering is subject to \u201csome deference,\u201d <em>Cathedral Candle Co., </em>400 F.3d at 1365, we also recognize that \u201c \u2018considerably less deference\u2019 \u201d <em>(Gose v. U.S. Postal Sen., </em>451 F.3d 831, 837-38 (Fed.Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, </em>512 U.S. 504, 515, 114 S.Ct. 2381, 129 L.Ed.2d 405 (1994))) is due to an interpretation that is (1) articulated by appellate counsel, rather than promulgated formally by administrative officials, (2) inconsistent with previous agency positions, or (3) not a reflection of the \u201c \u2018specialized expertise\u2019 \u201d of the agency, <em>Cathedral Candle Co., </em>400 F.3d at 1367 (quoting <em>U.S. v. Mead Corp., </em>533 U.S. 218, 234, 121 S.Ct. 2164, 150 L.Ed.2d 292 (2001)). Here, deference to the Secretary\u2019s current interpretation of the statutory scheme is particularly unjustified, where (1) the Secretary has not identified any regulation, VA Office of General Counsel opinion, or Agency-wide pronouncement positing his current interpretation, (2) this current interpretation is inconsistent with positions previously taken in <em>Moffitt </em>and <em>Wright, </em>both <em>supra, </em>and (3) the Secretary has not articulated \u2014 and the Court cannot discern \u2014 how this interpretation reflects his specialized expertise. <em>See Cathedral Can-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number><em>die Co., </em>400 F.3d at 1367; <em>see also Gose, supra </em>(citing <em>Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., </em>488 U.S. 204, 212, 109 S.Ct. 468, 102 L.Ed.2d 493 (1988), and <em>Inv. Co. Inst, v. Camp, </em>401 U.S. 617, 628, 91 S.Ct. 1091, 28 L.Ed.2d 367 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In sum, as long as an accrued benefits claimant submits a claim within one year of the date of death of the veteran, the claim is timely. Once timely submitted and thereafter denied because accrued benefits are deemed not warranted, it is subject to being reopened if the claimant submits new and material evidence. Accordingly, we hold that the Board\u2019s determination that an accrued benefits claim cannot be reopened more than one year after the veteran\u2019s death is not in accordance with law and will be reversed. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7261(a)(3)(A) (Court shall hold unlawful and set aside decisions and conclusions \u201cnot in accordance with law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">B. Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">As noted above, Mrs. Quattlebaum asserts that she was prejudiced by the Board\u2019s misunderstanding of the law. We agree. By improperly concluding that the statutory scheme prohibited a claim to reopen a prior denial of accrued benefits, the Board did not adjudicate whether she was entitled to accrued benefits, either via the 2001 original claim or the 2006 claim to reopen, and adjudication may lead to a successful outcome for Mrs. Quattlebaum. <em>See Ameson v. Shinseki </em>24 Vet.App. 379, 388-89 (2011) (finding prejudice where error could have made difference in outcome); <em>see also supra </em>note 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">In this regard, we note that the record of proceedings reflects that Mrs. Quattlebaum attached two VA letters in support of her claim. These letters (1) indicate that Mr. Quattlebaum\u2019s claim was still being considered by the Secretary at the time of Mr. Quattlebaum\u2019s death, (2) were not mentioned in the August 2001 RO letter that stated that the RO \u201ccannot approve your claim for accrued benefits because VA did not owe [the veteran] any money\u201d (R. at 318), and (3) appeared in the record of proceedings only once (as submitted by Mrs. Quattlebaum), indicating they may not have been in the record at the time of the August 2001 RO letter. Whether the August 2001 RO letter constituted a denial of the accrued benefits claim and whether these letters constitute new and material evidence are factual determinations to be made by the Secretary or the Board in the first instance. <em>See Prillaman v. Principi, </em>346 F.3d 1362, 1367 (Fed.Cir.2003) (concluding that new-and-material-evidence determinations are factual determinations); <em>Thompson v. Gober, </em>14 Vet.App. 187, 188 (2000) (per curiam) (stating that the Court \u201c \u2018should not simply [make] factual findings on its own\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Hensley v. West, </em>212 F.3d 1255, 1263 (Fed.Cir.2000))). Remand is warranted. <em>See Tucker v. West, </em>11 Vet.App. 369, 374 (1998) (stating that remand is appropriate \u201cwhere the Board has incorrectly applied the law, failed to provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases for its determinations, or where the record is otherwise inadequate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">On remand, Mrs. Quattlebaum may present, and the Board must consider, any evidence to the extent otherwise permitted by law <em>(see, e.g., </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5121 and 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1000(d)(4)), and any additional argument in support of the matter remanded. <em>See Kay, </em>16 Vet.App. at 534. This matter is to be provided expeditious treatment on remand. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7112.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">Upon consideration of the foregoing, the finding of the June 11, 2009, Board that an accrued benefits claim cannot as a matter of law be reopened more than one year after a veteran\u2019s death is REVERSED, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>and the decision of the Board denying Mrs. Quattlebaum\u2019s attempt to reopen her accrued benefits claim is SET ASIDE and the matters REMANDED for further development and readjudication consistent with applicable law and this decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-6\">. At oral argument, Mrs. Quattlebaum argued that her initial February 2001 claim for accrued benefits remains pending because the August 2001 rating decision did not address her claim for accrued benefits. This argument was not raised below or included in the briefing, and was presented by counsel for the first time at oral argument. Counsel attempted to justify this piecemeal litigation by explaining that he took over this case after the initial briefing had been submitted. Substitute counsels are reminded that, if they discover a new argument after the initial briefing, they generally must file a motion for leave to file a supplemental brief positing such argument, in order for the Court to consider it. <em>See </em>U.S. Vet.App. R. 27 (discussing applications for relief); <em>cf. Fugere v. Derwinski, </em>1 Vet.App. 103, 105 (1990) (\"Advancing different arguments at successive stages of the appellate process does not serve the interests of the parties or the Court. Such a practice hinders the decision-making process and raises the undesirable specter of piecemeal litigation.\u201d).
