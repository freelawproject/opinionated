Mason, appeals through counsel a May 22, 2008, Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (Board) decision that determined he was not eligible to receive payment of attorney fees from past-due benefits awarded to veteran Frederick L. Trawick. Record of Proceedings (R.) at 3-9. The veteran and intervenor, Mr. Trawick, filed a brief disputing Mr. Mason\u2019s entitlement to payment of attorney fees from the award of past-due benefits. The Board determined that \u201c[t]he requirements for payment of attorney fees in the amount of 20[%] of past-due benefits payable to the veteran, in the calculated amount of $53,472.53, have not been met\u201d because (1) Mr. Trawick did not retain Mr. Mason until August 3,1998, more than one year after a June 6, 1997, Board decision; and (2) Mr. Mason did not file a copy of the fee agreement with the Board and did not notify the regional office (RO) within 30 days of its execution, as required by 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.609(g), (h)(4) (2007). This appeal is timely, and the Court has jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s decision pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7252(a) and 7266(a). Because Mr. Mason has not demonstrated clear error in the Board\u2019s finding that he was not retained within one year of the June 6, 1997, Board decision, the Court will affirm the Board\u2019s 2008 determination that he is not eligible for payment of attorney fees for services provided in proceedings before VA because his fee agreement did not comply with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5904(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b100-17\">On June 6, 1997, the Board issued a decision in which it found that the veteran, Mr. Trawick, did not present new and material evidence sufficient to reopen a claim for entitlement to VA compensation benefits for a psychiatric disorder. R. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>1148-56. Mr. Trawick filed a motion for reconsideration (R. at 1146), which was denied by the Board Chairman on June 19, 1998. R. at 1129-31. While his motion for reconsideration was pending, Mr. Trawick also initiated an appeal to this Court on September 8,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">After the Board Chairman denied Mr. Trawick\u2019s motion for reconsideration, on August 3, 1998, Mr. Mason entered into <em>two </em>representation agreements with the veteran. The first fee agreement was a pro bono representation agreement, which applied <em>solely </em>to Mr. Trawick\u2019s appeal before the Court under docket number 97-1589.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The pro bono representation agreement states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">I hereby retain you to represent me before the [Court].... This agreement applies only to my appeal before [the Court] and does not apply to any representation before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit [ (Federal Circuit) ] in the event of any appeal or before the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in the event of a remand. Such representation will be covered by other agreements, if any.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The agreement also provided that Mr. Mason would not charge Mr. Trawick \u201ca fee or litigation expenses for representation under this agreement\u201d and Mr. Trawick agreed that Mr. Mason may request an award of attorney fees and expenses pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412. Finally, the agreement stated that Mr. Mason would have \u201cno obligation\u201d to Mr. Trawick \u201cunless and until\u201d Mr. Mason signed and returned a copy of the agreement to Mr. Trawick.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">The second fee agreement, also executed on August 3, 1998, and at issue here, was a contingent fee agreement for representation <em>solely </em>before the Board and the RO. R. at 1111-14. The agreement states: \u201cI hereby retain you to represent me before the Board ... and the [RO] ... to prosecute my claim for disability compensation benefits____ This agreement does not cover representation before [the Court] or the [Federal Circuit,] which will be covered by other agreements.\u201d R. at 1113. In this agreement, Mr. Trawick, the veteran, agreed to pay 20% of the gross amount of any past-due benefits award to attorney Mason as a \u201ccontingency fee\u201d and further agreed that VA may withhold such amount and make payment directly to the attorney. <em>Id. </em>The agreement also permitted the veteran to discharge the attorney \u201cat any time\u201d upon written notice with the following proviso: \u201cIf I discharge you after you have fully or substantially performed or contributed substantially to the results finally obtained by me, I shall be liable for payment of the fee set forth above.\u201d R. at 1113-14. Finally, the agreement contained a paragraph entitled \u201cCOMMENCEMENT OF REPRESENTATION,\u201d which stated: \u201cYour [Mr. Mason\u2019s] responsibility under this agreement will not commence unless or until (1) you receive a copy hereof signed by me [Mr. Trawick] and (2) you date, sign[,] and return the agreement to me.\u201d R. at 1114 (capitalization in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">Pursuant to the Secretary\u2019s unopposed motion to vacate the Board\u2019s June 6, 1997 decision, on October 8, 1998, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>vacated the Board\u2019s decision and remanded the matter for further development. R. at 1124-28. Mr. Mason filed a copy of the August 3, 1998, contingency fee agreement with the Board and the RO on December 18, 1998. R. at 1111-14. In his correspondence, Mr. Mason noted that the agreement was dated August 3, 1998, but that \u201c[r]epresentation began in April[] 1998, when [Mr. Trawick] contacted [him].\u201d R. at 1111. On January 4, 1999, the Board wrote to Mr. Mason to inform him that it received a copy of the fee agreement and that there appeared to be a \u201cpotential problem\u201d in that the fee agreement was executed more than one year after the June 1997 Board decision. R. at 145 \u2014 47 (citing 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5904(c)(1)). The Board acknowledged that Mr. Mason\u2019s December 1998 correspondence indicated that representation began in April 1998 and requested \u201cevidence\u201d to show that Mr. Mason was retained within one year of the June 1997 Board decision. <em>Id. </em>The December 1998 correspondence contains a handwritten note in the margin, which states: \u201c[R]ep[resentation] began on 4/23/98[,] altho[ugh] not reduced to writing.\u201d Id.<footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Following the Court\u2019s October 1998 remand, Mr. Mason is named as the representative of the veteran on three occasions. <em>See </em>R. at 1064-74 (Apr. 28, 2000, Board decision reopening claim for entitlement to benefits for a psychiatric disorder); 1085-88 (Dec. 1, 1999, Board remand); and 1104-07 (Apr. 15, 1999, Board remand). In the April 28, 2000, Board decision, the Board found that new and material evidence had been submitted to reopen Mr. Trawick\u2019s claim for entitlement to benefits for a mental disorder and further found the claim to be well grounded. R. at 1066.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">On May 19, 2000, Mr. Trawick sent Mr. Mason a letter informing him that he no longer needed his services. R. at 206. On the same date, Mr. Trawick also appointed Disabled American Veterans (DAV) as his representative (R. at 1015); in January 2003, he appointed the American Legion (R. at 452); and in August 2004, he reappointed DAV (R. at 459). On March 10, 2005, while Mr. Trawick was represented by DAV, the RO notified him of its decision, which granted entitlement to benefits for schizo-affective disorder, bipolar type, and assigned a 100% disability rating, effective August 12, 1992, the date of Mr. Trawick\u2019s claim to reopen. R. at 502-19. The RO subsequently informed Mr. Mason and Mr. Trawick that it had determined that Mr. Mason was entitled to payment of attorney fees in the amount of $53,472.53 because the requirements of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5904 and 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.609 had been met. R. at 495-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">In April 2005, Mr. Trawick filed a Notice of Disagreement asserting, in relevant part, that \u201cMr. Mason has not represented me since 1999.... I have had DAV represent me since 1999 when Mr. Mason told me he could not represent me anymore.\u201d R. at 482. The RO issued a Statement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the Case in October 2005 stating that \u201c[c]urrent representation by the private attorney is not a statutory or regulatory prerequisite to VA\u2019s payment of attorney fees from past-due benefits.\u201d R. at 220-38, 237. The RO also stated that direct payment could be made provided that \u201call other statutory and regulatory requirements for payment of fees, as well as the terms of the agreement, have been met.\u201d R. at 237. In his Substantive Appeal, Mr. Trawick argued that \u201cMr. Mason did very little work on my case[.] [T]he technical work and the argument that won my claim was performed by the DAV. I request that the money withheld be released as soon as possible.\u201d R. at 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">In the May 22, 2008, decision here on appeal, the Board determined that \u201c[t]he requirements for payment of attorney fees in the amount of 20[%] of past-due benefits payable to the veteran, in the calculated amount of $53,472.53, have not been met.\u201d R. at 5 (citing 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5904 (2002) and 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.609 (2007)). The Board based its conclusion on two findings: (1) Mr. Trawick did not retain Mr. Mason until August 3, 1998, which was more than one year after the Board\u2019s June 6, 1997, decision; and (2) Mr. Mason did not file a copy of the fee agreement with the Board and did not notify the RO within 30 days of its execution, as required by 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.609(g), (h)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">II. THE PARTIES\u2019 CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The Court notes that the parties have provided extensive briefs regarding (1) Mr. Mason\u2019s eligibility to receive attorney fees pursuant to the August 3, 1998, contingency fee agreement and (2) the appropriate remedy assuming that the Court determined Mr. Mason was eligible to receive a fee. Because the Court has determined herein that Mr. Mason\u2019s eligibility to receive a fee rests on whether he satisfied the statutory requirements provided in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5904(c)(1), which we hold he did not, the Court will limit its remaining discussion of the parties\u2019 arguments to this issue. Both the Secretary and Mr. Trawick argue that Mr. Mason is not entitled to receive payment of attorney fees pursuant to the August 3, 1998, contingency fee agreement for services provided before the Board and the RO because Mr. Trawick retained Mr. Mason more than one year after the Board first made a decision in the ease, <em>ie., </em>June 6, 1997. Secretary\u2019s Supplemental Brief (Br.) at 8-12;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Intervenor\u2019s Br. at 6-12. They argue that the contingency fee agreement between Mr. Mason and Mr. Trawick is subject to the one-year requirement set forth in 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5904(c)(1) because the statute only exempts \u201cservices provided with respect to proceedings before a court\u201d and the contingency fee agreement at issue here, executed more than one year after the June 6, 1997, decision, was limited to services provided before the Board and the RO. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">Mr. Mason makes three arguments in response. First, he argues that the Board\u2019s order that denied entitlement to fees was not premised on Mr. Mason\u2019s not having met the statutory requirements to charge a fee. Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. to the Intervenor at 2. Second, he argues that he met the statutory requirements because he was \u201cretained\u201d within one year of the Board\u2019s June 6, 1997, decision. <em>Id. </em>at 3. Mr. Mason asserts that although the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>tingency fee agreement was not executed until August 3, 1998, he \u201ccommenced his representation of Mr. Trawick in April 1998.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Third, he argues that his \u201crepresentation of Mr. Trawick and his entitlement to charge a fee was premised upon his representation of Mr. Trawick before this Court [in docket number] 97-1589.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">III. LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">A. Statutory and Regulatory Provisions The statutory provision that governs an attorney\u2019s entitlement to charge and receive a fee for services provided in connection with a proceeding before VA is 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5904(c)(1). In 1998, when Mr. Mason and Mr. Trawick executed the fee agreement at issue, section 5904(c)(1) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3), in connection with a proceeding before the Department with respect to benefits under laws administered by the Secretary, a fee may not be charged, allowed, or paid for services of agents and attorneys with respect to services provided before the date on which the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals first makes a final decision in the case. Such a fee may be charged, allowed, or paid in the case of services provided after such date only if an agent or attorney is retained with respect to such case before the end of the one-year period beginning on that date. The limitation in the preceding sentence does not apply to services provided with respect to proceedings before a court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5904(c)(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">Section 5904(d) provided that when a claimant and an attorney enter into a fee agreement, under which the total amount of the fee payable to the attorney \u201cis to be paid to the attorney by the Secretary directly from any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim\u201d and \u201cis contingent on whether or not the matter is resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant,\u201d \u201cthe total fee payable to the attorney may not exceed 20 percent of the total amount of any past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5904(d)(1),(2)(A). A claim is considered \u201cto have been resolved in a manner favorable to the claimant if all or any part of the relief sought is granted.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5904(d)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">The Secretary\u2019s implementing regulation, which prescribes when an attorney may charge a fee for services in a proceeding before VA, 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.609 (1998), entitled \u201cPayment of representative\u2019s fees in proceedings before the Department of Veterans Affairs field personnel and before the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals,\u201d provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-12\">(c) <em>Circumstances under which fees may be charged. </em>Except as noted in paragraph (d) of this section, attorneys-at-law and agents may charge claimants or appellants for their services only if all of the following conditions are met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>(1) A final decision has been promulgated by the Board ... with respect to the issue, or issues, involved;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-5\">(2) The Notice of Disagreement which preceded the Board ... decision with respect to the issue, or issues, involved was received by the agency of original jurisdiction on or after November 18, 1988; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">(3) The attorney-at-law or agent was retained not later than one year following the date that the decision by the Board ... with respect to the issue, or issues, involved was promulgated.

The Court held that because the attorney was not retained within one year after the Board issued its first decision in the case, the attorney was ineligible to charge a fee for services provided in a proceeding before the Board or VA. <em>Id. </em>at 84. The appellant-attorney argued that the requirement in section 5904(c)(1) that the attorney be retained within one year after the first Board decision was not applicable in this circumstance because his services provided before the Agency on remand were a continuation of proceedings before the Court. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5904(c)(1) (stating that \u201c[t]he limitation in the preceding sentence does not apply to services provided with respect to proceedings before a court\u201d). The Court rejected this argument stating, \u201cin general, after a remand is issued by this Court, proceedings at the VA level are not a continuation of proceedings before this Court so as to be exempt from the section 5904(c)(1) limitations on charging attorneys fees.\u201d <em>In re Fee Agreement of Mason, </em>13 Vet.App. at 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">The Court stated, however, that \u201can attorney is always entitled to charge a fee for <em>representation on matters before this Court, </em>and may be entitled to direct payment from the Secretary from past-due benefits awarded <em>as a result of such representation.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). The Court held,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-13\">[t]herefore, where an attorney successfully represents a VA claimant before this Court and has filed a qualifying attorney-client fee agreement which directs payment by the Secretary from an award of past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim filed with VA, the Secretary is obligated to pay directly to the attorney 20% of the past-due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim or application for benefits <em>underlying the issues successfully appealed to this Court. </em>That payment could be entirely dependent on the attorney\u2019s services before this Court, depending on the fee agreement, and, under the express terms of section 5904(c)(1), would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>subject to the limitations in section 5904(c)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 86 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The Court recognized, however, that there is no statutory provision that prevents an attorney from providing the claimant legal services on remand. Rather, the restriction provided in section 5904(c)(1) solely limits an attorney\u2019s ability to charge a fee for services provided before VA when he is retained more than one year after the Board first makes a final decision in the case. The Court in <em>In re Fee Agreement of Mason </em>explained that, on remand, \u201cproviding further services before the Board and VA would, of course be in the best interest of the attorney to assist the claimant in securing any award of past-due benefits\u201d but that \u201ccontinued representation\u201d does not generate an additional fee. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">A. Mr. Mason\u2019s Eligibility To Charge a Fee</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">There is no dispute among the parties that the Board rendered its first final decision in the case on June 6, 1997. Thus, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5904(c)(1), to be eligible to charge and receive a fee for services provided in a proceeding before VA, Mr. Mason must demonstrate that he was retained not later than one year after the June 6, 1997, decision. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5904(c)(1) (1998); 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.609(c)(3) (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">To the extent that Mr. Mason argues that the Board\u2019s decision to deny eligibility for payment of attorney fees from the past-due benefits award was not premised on the failure to meet the statutory requirements, he is mistaken. The Board clearly and succinctly stated that the \u201cfee agreement was not compliant with legal requirements\u201d because \u201c[t]he veteran\u2019s former attorney was not retained by the veteran until August 3, 1998, more than one year after the Board decision was issued.\u201d R. at 8. The Board supported its conclusion by stating that \u201c[t]his is evidenced by the attorney fee agreement dated on August 3, 1998, and ... the retaining of an attorney is shown by a qualifying fee agreement within the required time period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8-9. Hence, the Court will proceed to address the parties\u2019 remaining arguments to determine whether Mr. Mason has demonstrated error in the Board\u2019s conclusion that he is not entitled to attorney fees based on the award of past-due benefits. <em>See Hilkert v. West, </em>12 Vet.App. 145, 151 (1999) (en banc) (holding that the appellant bears the burden of demonstrating error on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">As noted above, the first fee agreement executed on August 3, 1998, applied <em>solely </em>to Mr. Mason\u2019s representation of Mr. Trawiek at the Court. Mr. Mason does not contend that he is entitled to payment of a fee pursuant to this agreement, nor should he. Mr. Mason expressly agreed not to charge a fee for his representation of Mr. Trawiek under that agreement. Hence, although section 5904(c)(1) does not limit the period in which an attorney must be retained to be eligible to charge a fee for services provided in proceedings before a court, Mr. Mason agreed not to charge Mr. Trawiek a fee for representation provided at the Court under docket number 97-1589. Thus, to the extent that Mr. Trawick\u2019s award of past-due benefits resulted from Mr. Mason\u2019s representation in matters before the Court, the explicit terms of the \u201cpro bono\u201d fee agreement filed in connection with docket number 97-1589 do not contemplate payment of a fee from Mr. Trawiek.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-14\">Mr. Mason argues that he is entitled to receive a fee pursuant to the contingency fee agreement, also executed on August 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>1998, asserting that he satisfied the requirements of section 5904(c)(1). In this regard, he makes two alternative arguments, which the Court will address in turn. Mr. Mason argues that \u201c[although the fee agreement was not executed until August 1998, [he] commenced his representation of Mr. Trawick in April 1998.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. to the Intervenor at 3 (citing R. at 1111-12). At oral argument, Mr. Mason argued that there is a distinction between being \u201cretained\u201d within the one-year period referenced in section 5904(c)(1) and having an \u201cexecuted fee agreement\u201d within one year after the Board first makes a decision in the case. He argued that the Board\u2019s finding that he was not \u201cretained\u201d until August 3, 1998, was clearly erroneous because it was based on an incorrect interpretation of section 5904(c)(1). The Court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Even assuming that Mr. Mason is correct, <em>ie., </em>that there is a distinction between being \u201cretained\u201d within the one-year period referenced in section 5904(c)(1) and having an \u201cexecuted fee agreement\u201d within the one-year period, the Court is not \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction\u201d that the Board\u2019s determination that Mr. Mason was not retained until August 3, 1998, was clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948); <em>see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, </em>1 Vet.App. 49, 52 (1990). The only evidence before the Board supporting Mr. Mason\u2019s contention that he was retained within one year after the Board\u2019s June 6, 1997, decision was Mr. Mason\u2019s December 18, 1998, correspondence to the Board in which he stated that his \u201c[r]epresentation of Mr. Trawick began in April, 1998, when Mr. Trawick] contacted him\u201d but that the agreement was not reduced to writing until after the Board Chairman denied Mr. Trawiek\u2019s motion for reconsideration. R. at 1111. However, the August 3, 1998, contingency fee agreement at issue here, included the following specific terms, which speak to <em>when </em>Mr. Trawick retained Mr. Mason to represent him: <em>\u201cI hereby retain you </em>to represent me before the Board ... and the [RO] ... to prosecute my claim for disability compensation benefits.... This agreement does not cover representation before [the Court] or the [Federal Circuit] which will be covered by other agreements.\u201d R. at 1113 (emphasis added); <em>see </em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary 631 (3d college ed. 1988) (defining \u201chereby\u201d as \u201cby or through this; by this means\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1317 (7th ed. 1999) (defining \u201cretainer\u201d as \u201c[a] client\u2019s authorization for a lawyer to act in a case\u201d). Moreover, under the \u201cCOMMENCEMENT OF REPRESENTATION\u201d section, Mr. Mason and the veteran agreed that Mr. Mason\u2019s responsibility under the agreement would not commence until each party signed the agreement and received a signed copy from the other party to the agreement. R. at 1114 (capitalization in original). The agreement bears Mr. Mason\u2019s signature and indicates that it was \u201c[accepted and agreed to\u201d on August 3,1998. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">As always, it is the Board\u2019s responsibility, in its role as factfinder, to assess the credibility of, and weight to be given to the evidence of record, and the Court may overturn the Board\u2019s decision only if it is clearly erroneous. <em>Washington v. Nicholson, </em>19 Vet.App. 362, 367-68 (2005); <em>Owens v. Brown, </em>7 Vet.App. 429, 433 (1995). In this case, Mr. Mason has not presented the Court with any basis upon which to find the Board\u2019s determination in this matter clearly erroneous. Mr. Mason\u2019s assertion that his representation of Mr. Trawick began in April 1998 appears to stand in direct conflict with the express terms of the fee agreement, which indicated that (1) Mr. Trawick, by and through the means of the August 3, 1998, representation agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>ment, retained Mr. Mason to represent him before the Board and the RO, and (2) Mr. Mason\u2019s responsibility under the agreement did not commence until at least August 3, 1998, the date Mr. Mason executed the fee agreement noting his \u201cacceptance] and agreement].\u201d R. at 1113-14. Accordingly, because Mr. Mason has not demonstrated clear error in the Board\u2019s determination that he was not retained until August 3, 1998, which is more than one year after June 6, 1997, the undisputed date on which the Board first made a final decision in the case, his argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Mr. Mason\u2019s alternative argument in support of his contention that he satisfied the requirements of section 5904(c)(1) is that his representation of Mr. Trawick and his entitlement to charge a fee was premised upon his representation of Mr. Trawick at the Court. Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. to the Intervenor at 3. In this regard, Mr. Mason appears to rely on the exception noted in section 5904(c)(1), which states that \u201c[t]he limitation in the preceding sentence does not apply to services provided with respect to proceedings before a court.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5904(c)(1). However, this argument is not availing because the Court rejected a similar argument made by Mr. Mason in <em>In re Fee Agreement of Mason, </em>13 Vet.App. at 84-85, when it held, \u201cin general, after a remand is issued by this Court, proceedings at the VA level are not a continuation of proceedings before this Court so as to be exempt from the section 5904(c)(1) limitations on charging attorneys fees.\u201d 13 Vet.App. at 85. Thus, in <em>In re Fee Agreement of Mason, </em>the Court held that \u201c[b]ecause Mr. Mason was not retained within one year after [the Board first made a decision in the case], he [was] not eligible to charge a fee for services provided in a proceeding before the Board or VA, regarding the issues involved in the [Board decision]\u201d even though he represented the veteran in the proceedings before the Court. 13 Vet.App. at 84-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Mr. Mason\u2019s reliance on the Secretary\u2019s implementing regulation, 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.609(c)(3) (1998), is similarly misplaced. Section 20.609(c)(3) essentially reiterated the statutory requirement that an attorney or agent be retained within one year after the Board first made a decision in the case. In addition, the regulation contained a parenthetical, which stated: \u201cThis condition will be considered to have been met with respect to all successor attorneys-at-law or agents acting in the continuous prosecution of the same matter <em>if a predecessor was retained within the required time.\u201d </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.609(c)(3) (emphasis added). Mr. Mason relies on the emphasized language to argue that because Mr. Trawick properly retained Mr. Mason for representation before the Court, that action permitted them to enter into a valid fee agreement for continuous prosecution of the same matter before the Board and the RO. However, Mr. Mason fails to explain how this regulation is applicable in this case, where the language of the regulation addresses continuous prosecution by \u201csuccessor\u201d attorneys or agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Although Mr. Mason and Mr. Trawick executed <em>two </em>fee agreements, the Court finds the facts in this case sufficiently analogous to the facts in <em>In re Fee Agreement of Mason, </em>13 Vet.App. 79, to be informed whether Mr. Mason is entitled to receive a fee for his continual representation of Mr. Trawick on remand, when he was not retained by Mr. Trawick within one year after the Board first made a decision in the case. What is clear from the Court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Fee Agreement of Mason </em>is that continuing representation on remand from this Court does not necessarily entitle an attorney to charge a fee for those services provided in the proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>before the Agency. Rather, entitlement to a fee for services before the Agency is dependent on the terms of the fee agreement and whether the attorney was retained within the one-year period referenced in section 5904(c)(1). <em>Id. </em>at 84 (holding that the attorney was not eligible to receive a fee for services provided before the Agency after a successful appeal to the Court pursuant to a contingency fee agreement, which provided for representation before the Court, the Board, and the RO, because he was not retained within the one-year period referenced in section 5904(c)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Mr. Mason\u2019s arguments ignore the clear distinction drawn in <em>In re Fee Agreement of Mason </em>regarding an attorney\u2019s eligibility to charge a fee for services when he is retained more than one year after the Board first makes a decision in the case. 13 Vet.App. at 83-86. Pursuant to section 5904(c)(1), an attorney may <em>not </em>charge for services provided before the Board or the RO when he is retained more than one year after the Board first makes a final decision in the case. <em>Id. </em>at 83. However, regardless of when the attorney is retained, an attorney <em>may </em>generally charge a fee for services provided at the Court and may receive direct payment from the Secretary pursuant to a qualifying contingency fee agreement on issues successfully appealed to the Court. <em>Id. </em>at 85-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">This case creates an even clearer application of <em>In re Fee Agreement of Mason </em>because, here, (1) Mr. Mason agreed not to charge Mr. Trawick a fee for services provided at the Court, <em>see </em>Fee Agreement filed August 4, 1998, in connection with docket number 97-1589; and (2) as found by the Board, Mr. Mason was not retained within one year of the June 6, 1997, Board decision. Thus, to the extent Mr. Trawick\u2019s past-due benefits award is related to issues successfully appealed to the Court, Mr. Mason agreed not to charge a fee for those services. And, to the extent Mr. Trawick\u2019s past-due benefits award is related to services provided in a proceeding before the Board and the RO pursuant to the separate contingency fee agreement, Mr. Mason\u2019s eligibility to receive a fee for those services is subject to the limitation in section 5904(c)(1) that he be retained within one year after the Board first makes a final decision in the case. Because Mr. Mason has not demonstrated clear error in the Board\u2019s determination that he was not retained until August 3, 1998, more than one year after the June 6, 1997, Board decision, he is not eligible to charge a fee for services provided before the Board and the RO pursuant to the August 3, 1998, contingency fee agreement. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5904(c)(1); <em>In re Fee Agreement of Mason, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">B. Mr. Mason\u2019s Additional Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">The Court notes that Mr. Mason argued in his opening brief that (1) the Board erred when it determined that he was not entitled to charge and receive a fee because he failed to file a copy of the fee agreement with the Board in compliance with 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.609(g) and failed to notify the RO of the fee agreement in compliance with \u00a7 20.609(h)(4); (2) the Board improperly relied on these regulations without affording him notice of its intent to consider provisions of law not relied upon by the RO in violation of 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.903(b); and (3) the Court should admonish the Board for failing to provide him and his representative with a copy of the May 22, 2008, decision here on appeal. The Court will not address the merits of Mr. Mason\u2019s additional arguments, however, because Mr. Mason\u2019s failure to be retained within one year of the June 6, 1997, Board decision is dispositive of the issue before the Court, and therefore, he cannot meet his burden of demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>strating prejudicial error with regard to these arguments. <em>See Shinseki v. Sanders, </em>556 U.S. 396, 129 S.Ct. 1696, 1704, 173 L.Ed.2d 532 (2009) (noting that the statute requiring this Court to \u201ctake due account of prejudicial error [ ] requires the Veterans Court to apply the same kind of \u2018harmless error\u2019 rule that courts ordinarily apply in civil cases\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">C. Issues Not Raised by the Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The Court notes that Mr. Trawick filed with the Board a motion for reconsideration of the June 6, 1997, decision and that the Court\u2019s caselaw provides that the filing of the motion of reconsideration within the 120-day judicial appeal period abates the finality of the Board decision for purposes of filing a timely Notice of Appeal at the Court. <em>See Rosier v. Derwinski, </em>1 Vet.App. 241, 249 (1991); <em>see also May v. Nicholson, </em>19 Vet.App. 310 (2005). However, because the parties do not argue that Mr. Trawick\u2019s motion for reconsideration in any way abated the finality of the June 6, 1997, Board decision for purposes of being \u201cthe date on which the Board ... first makes a final decision in the case,\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5904(c)(1), the Court will take no position on the effect, if any, of Mr. Trawick\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">While our dissenting colleague would like to reach this issue, and in fact opines that Mr. Trawick\u2019s motion for reconsideration abated the finality of the Board\u2019s June 6, 1997, decision, the Court is hesitant to address this issue and refuses to do so, especially given the vast amount of briefing that has been submitted in this matter, which has nonetheless resulted in the absence of any argument, particularly from Mr. Mason, that the June 6, 1997, Board decision was not the <em>first </em>final Board decision in the case. Specifically, neither Mr. Mason, an attorney with more than $53,000 at stake in this litigation, nor his counsel, another experienced attorney, raised this issue to the Court, and none of the 10 pleadings, which were drafted by at least 5 attorneys and totaled 214 pages, contain any such abatement argument. Rather, this novel and interesting argument arose only in the inquisitive mind of our distinguished dissenting colleague, who, perhaps unfortunately for Mr. Mason, was not his representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">It is undisputed that \u201cU.S. courts of appeals have the <em>discretion </em>to raise legal issues not raised by a party.\u201d <em>Patton v. West, </em>12 Vet.App. 272, 283 (1999) (emphasis added); <em>see also Kamen v. Kemper Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>500 U.S. 90, 99, 111 S.Ct. 1711, 114 L.Ed.2d 152 (1991) (\u201cWhen an issue or claim is properly before the court, the court is not limited to the particular legal theories advanced by the parties, but rather <em>retains the independent power </em>to identify and apply the proper construction of governing law.\u201d) (emphasis added). However, we disagree with our dissenting colleague that this case represents one of those rare instances when the Court should exercise that discretion. <em>See Davis v. U.S., </em>512 U.S. 452, 464, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring) (recognizing that, generally, \u201crefusal to consider arguments not raised is a sound prudential practice,\u201d but that \u201cthere are times when prudence dictates the contrary\u201d). Unlike in the Supreme Court cases cited by our dissenting colleague, we do not believe that the effect of Mr. Trawick\u2019s motion for reconsideration at the Board is an issue \u201cantecedent to ... and ultimately dispositive of\u2019 the dispute before the Court that must be decided to avoid committing a legal error. <em>See post </em>at 97 (quoting <em>Arcadia v. Ohio Power Co., </em>498 U.S. 73, 77, 111 S.Ct. 415, 112 L.Ed.2d 374 (1990) and citing <em>U.S. Nat\u2019l Bank of Or. v. Indep. Ins. Agents of Am., Inc., </em>508 U.S. 439, 447, 113 S.Ct. 2173, 124 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>402 (1993) and <em>Kamen, </em>500 U.S. at 99, 111 S.Ct. 1711).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Rather, we view this argument as indistinguishable from any other argument\u2014 novel or otherwise \u2014 that the Court would ordinarily deem abandoned by a party for a failure to raise it on appeal. <em>See Grivois v. Brown, </em>6 Vet.App. 136, 138 (1994) (holding that issues or claims not argued on appeal are considered abandoned). Considering arguments not raised by the parties essentially wrests control of the litigation away from the parties, who, for any number of reasons, may have chosen not to advance such arguments to the Court. In short, the Court will not invent an argument for a represented party who had ample opportunity and resources to make that same argument, but, for whatever reason \u2014 be it strategy, oversight, or something in between \u2014 did not do so. <em>Cf. Forshey v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1335, 1357-58 (Fed.Cir.2002) (noting that a \u201cvariety of considerations may counsel against consideration of an issue not decided or raised below\u201d including whether the case was litigated pro se); <em>Ned Chartering &amp; Trading, Inc. v. Republic of Pak., </em>294 F.3d 148, 155 (D.C.Cir.2002) (\u201c[W]hile a Court <em>may </em>draw upon its own knowledge of applicable precedents in ruling on a motion, it is not <em>required </em>to unearth theories and precedents not cited by a party.... Bringing those precedents and theories to the attention of the district judge is the job of the party\u2019s attorneys.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">It is important to remember that our disagreement with our dissenting colleague amounts to nothing more than a dispute over whether the Court <em>should exercise its discretion </em>to address an issue not raised by the parties, not whether the Court has the authority to do so. As stated above, the Court does not believe that resolution of the issue identified by our dissenting colleague is necessary to the disposition of the case, <em>see </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7261(a) (limiting the Court\u2019s scope of review to decided relevant questions of law \u201cto the extent <em>necessary </em>to its decision and <em>token presented </em>\u201d (emphasis added)), and our dissenting colleague has not convinced us otherwise. Therefore, the Court will decline to address that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b111-13\">After consideration of the pleadings of the appellant, the Secretary, the intervenor, and amicus curiae, and a review of the record, the Board\u2019s May 22, 2008, decision is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-14\">KASOLD, Chief Judge, filed a dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\">. The Court notes that the pro bono representation agreement is not included in the record of proceedings. However, because the agreement was filed with the Court on August 4, 1998, under docket number 97-1589, the Court will take judicial notice of its content. <em>See Cotant v.

The Court notes that the Secretary\u2019s initial brief in this matter posited that Mr. Mason\u2019s retention as counsel more than one year after the Board\u2019s June 6, 1997, decision did not preclude him from receiving direct payment of attorney fees under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5904(d).

However, Congress explicitly provided for prospective application of the amended statute, stating that it \"shall take effect on the date that is 180 days [June 20, 2007] after the date of enactment of this Act [Dec. 22, 2006] and shall apply with respect to services of agents or attorneys that are provided with respect to cases in which [N]otices of [Disagreement are filed on or after that date.\u201d Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006, Pub.L.

This statutory constraint on a veteran\u2019s right to retain paid counsel should not be read broadly. <em>Cf. Brown v. Gardner, </em>513 U.S. 115, 117-18, 115 S.Ct. 552, 130 L.Ed.2d 462 (1994) (noting that interpretative doubt is to be resolved in the veteran\u2019s favor).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-17\">There is no dispute in this case that Mr. Trawiek\u2019s claim was denied by a June 1997 Board decision and that he retained paid counsel in August 1998, more than one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>year after that decision. There also is no dispute, however, that Mr. Trawick sought reconsideration of the June 1997 Board decision in August 1997, and that he retained paid counsel in August 1998, two months after he received notice in June 1998 that his request for reconsideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Because, as discussed below, the request for reconsideration abated finality of the June 1997 Board decision until the request was denied in June 1998, Mr. Trawick had the right to retain attorney Mason for a fee in August 1998. Additionally, Mr. Mason \u2014 who eventually was discharged by Mr. Trawick \u2014 had the right to seek reimbursement for the work he performed on Mr. Trawick\u2019s behalf prior to being discharged. Under such circumstances, the matter should be remanded for the Board to determine the fee that reflects Mr. Trawick\u2019s contribution. <em>See Scales v. Principi, </em>282 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed.Cir.2002) (\u201c[A]n attorney ... discharged by the client before the case is completed [ ] is not automatically entitled to the full twenty percent fee.

Shinseki, </em>23 Vet.App. 243, 256 (2009) (\u201cBecause [the veteran] objected ... to the payment of the supplemental attorney fee ..., VA was obligated to review the fee agreement and reduce the fee to be paid if it was excessive or unreasonable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\u201cThe concept of \u2018finality with respect to judicial decisions does not have a single meaning applicable in all contexts.\u201d <em>Stanley v. Principi, </em>283 F.3d 1350, 1355 (Fed.Cir.2002); <em>see also Clay v. United States, </em>537 U.S. 522, 527, 123 S.Ct. 1072, 155 L.Ed.2d 88 (2003) (\u201cFinality is variously defined ... its precise meaning depends on context.\u201d).

Thus, it is well settled, for example, that when a request for reconsideration is filed within the time permitted to file an appeal with the Court (120 days), finality is abated for purposes of filing an appeal, and a new 120-day period to appeal begins when the Board Chairman renders a decision on the reconsideration request. <em>Rosler v.

Bhd. of Locomotive Eng\u2019rs, </em>482 U.S. 270, 284, 107 S.Ct. 2360, 96 L.Ed.2d 222 (1987) (\u201c[Petitions for reconsideration ... [render] the orders under reconsideration nonfinal.\u201d); <em>Mondero v. Nicholson, </em>129 Fed.Appx. 605, 607 n. 1 (Fed.Cir.2005) (acknowledging the adoption of <em>Rosier </em>in <em>Linville v. West, </em>165 F.3d 1382, 1385-86 (Fed.Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The same rationale applies with regard to the retention of counsel, and application of section 5904(c)(1). When a veteran proceeds on his own and files for reconsideration within one year of an adverse Board decision, finality of that decision is abated for the purposes of section 5904(c)(1), and, if reconsideration is denied, the claimant has one year from the date of the denial of reconsideration to retain paid counsel for further proceedings before the Board and Secretary. To hold otherwise, essentially would be to mandate a claimant to retain paid counsel when seeking reconsideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>of the Board decision, or lose the right to so retain paid counsel if the Board Chairman takes more than one year to render a decision. <em>Cf. </em>Rosler, 1 Vet.App. at 246 (rejecting as an \u201conerous burden\u201d the notion that a claimant filing a motion for reconsideration must also file an appeal to the Court to preserve his right to appeal). No policy supports forcing a veteran to seek counsel while still pursuing a claim within the informal adjudication process below, or the loss of his right to do so when efforts to seek recourse are rejected more than a year later.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">As to the majority\u2019s belief that the issue of finality should not be addressed, I obviously disagree. I understand that there are policy reasons for the Court not to address an argument not explicitly raised, particularly when an appellant is represented by counsel and, as here, is an attorney himself. However, this issue was not \u201cinvent[ed]\u201d solely by myself. <em>Ante </em>at section IV.C. Rather, it reasonably was raised by the statute, caselaw, the record of proceedings (which reflects the Board\u2019s recognition of Mr. Trawiek\u2019s motion for reconsideration), and the well-established fact that finality depends on context. <em>See Clay </em>and <em>Stanley, </em>both <em>supra; see also Forshey v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1335, 1357 n. 20 (Fed.Cir.2002) (an appellate court\u2019s \u201c \u2018duty is to enunciate the law on the record facts\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Empire Life Ins. Co. of Am. v. Valdak Corp., </em>468 F.2d 330, 334 (5th Cir.1972))), <em>overruled on other grounds by Morgan v. Principi, </em>327 F.3d 1357 (Fed.Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">In addition, the dramatically fluctuating litigative posture of this case supports a discussion of the statutory interpretation issue raised by this case. In short, the Secretary initially agreed with Mr. Mason that (1) the Board erred as to Mr. Mason\u2019s eligibility, and (2) reasonableness was the only disputed issue. Amicus entered and likewise agreed. Only after Mr. Trawick intervened with a well-written brief did the Secretary change his position. Although the majority correctly note that 10 briefs were submitted in this case, they fail to recognize that the Secretary reversed his position in this litigation in the <em>tenth and final </em>brief. In this context, it is eminently understandable why Mr. Trawick did not explicitly present an alternative argument on section 5904(c)(1) in his briefs. Such circumstances only add to the propriety of addressing the statutory interpretation issue raised by this case. <em>See Davis v. United States, </em>512 U.S. 452, 464, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring) (generally, \u201crefusal to consider arguments not raised is a sound prudential practice,\u201d but \u201cthere are times when prudence dictates the contrary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Moreover, the issue is dispositive. <em>See U.S. Nat\u2019l Bank of Or. v. Indep. Ins. Agents of Am., </em>508 U.S. 439, 447, 113 S.Ct. 2173, 124 L.Ed.2d 402 (1993) (\u201c[A] court may consider an issue \u2018antecedent to ... and ultimately dispositive of the dispute before it, even an issue the parties fail to identify and brief.\u201d (quoting <em>Arcadia v. Ohio Power Co., </em>498 U.S. 73, 77, 111 S.Ct. 415, 112 L.Ed.2d 374 (1990))). The majority\u2019s application of section 5904(c)(1) \u2014 done without considering the effect of Mr. Trawick\u2019s motion for reconsideration on the finality of the Board decision or the commencement of the one-year period to retain paid counsel \u2014 serves to bar Mr. Mason from receiving any compensation for the work he did at the Board for Mr. Trawick. As shown above, a proper application of caselaw and canons of interpretation render a conclusion that Mr. Trawick\u2019s motion for reconsideration abated the finality of the June 1997 Board decision for the purposes of section 5904(c)(1) until the Chairman rendered a decision on that motion in June 1998, such that the retention agreement in this instance was entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>into within one year of the first final Board decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Further, the purpose of the one-year period to retain paid counsel was to obstruct the retention of attorneys for attempts to reopen claims after a number of years without any action. <em>See </em>134 Cong. Rec. S16,632-01 (Oct. 18,1988) (Sen. Cranston, noting that the purpose of the one-year period was \u201cto address the possibility of a claimant receiving a final B[oard] decision, waiting a number of years without any action, and then retaining an attorney to request a reopening and pursuit of the claim at the [RO] level\u201d). That purpose is in no way fulfilled here, where Mr. Trawick never sat on his laurels with many years of inaction. Rather, he promptly sought reconsideration of his Board decision and promptly retained counsel after having his request for reconsideration denied. The majority\u2019s application of section 5904(c)(1) in this instance contravenes the purpose behind the statute. As shown above, such an application is not mandated by the statute, our caselaw, or the canons of interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Finally, this is a significant issue, involving considerations of due process, a right to adequate legal representation, and a right to contract. <em>See Walters v. Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Radiation Survivors, </em>473 U.S. 305, 312-16,105 S.Ct. 3180, 87 L.Ed.2d 220 (1985); <em>Stanley, </em>283 F.3d at 1355-57. Factors underlying the original enactment of attorney fee limitations, such as concerns about unscrupulous attorneys, and even factors underlying the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Walters </em>to reverse a preliminary injunction on such limitations are now different or no longer present. <em>Compare Walters, </em>473 U.S. at 321-22, 105 S.Ct. 3180, <em>with </em>Veterans Judicial Review Act, Pub.L. No. 100-687 (Nov. 18, 1988) (effective June 1, 1989). Although the one-year period in which a claimant may retain paid counsel for representation before the Secretary or the Board is restrictive of the right to retain paid counsel, the degree of restrictiveness is dependent on the meaning of when a Board decision becomes final for the purposes of section 5904(c)(1). Because the concept of finality is context dependent, <em>Stanley, supra, </em>and an overly restrictive application of section 5904(c)(1) is inconsistent with the purpose behind establishing the one-year period, we should address the meaning of finality as used in section 5904(c)(1) in the context of a motion for reconsideration, find that Mr. Trawick had a right to retain Mr. Mason for a fee in this case, and remand the matter for the Board to award a fee reflecting Mr. Mason\u2019s contribution to Mr. Trawick\u2019s case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b111-7\">.
