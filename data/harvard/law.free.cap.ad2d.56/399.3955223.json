Barone, J., at hearings; Efrain Alvarado, J., at plea, sentence and resentence), rendered April 7, 2004, as amended December 4, 2006, convicting defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second degree, and resentencing him to a term of 6V2 years, unanimously affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae_\">Defendant made a valid waiver of his right to appeal (see <em>People v Lopez, </em>6 NY3d 248, 256-257 [2006]; <em>People v Moissett, </em>76 NY2d 909 [1990]). As an alternative holding (see <em>People v Callahan, </em>80 NY2d 273, 285 [1992]), after reviewing the sealed minutes of the <em>Darden-Castillo </em>hearing <em>{People v Castillo, </em>80 NY2d 578 [1992]) and the evidence presented at the suppression hearing, we also reject defendant\u2019s suppression arguments on the merits. The police had probable cause to search defendant\u2019s car, as well as his valid consent.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq8T\">However, we note that the respondent\u2019s brief should, in addition to addressing the validity of the waiver, have discussed the merits of defendant\u2019s suppression claims. The use of a bifurcated brief pursuant to the rules of this Court (22 NYCRR 600.16 [b]) was \u201cinefficient and highly burdensome on the Court and the parties\u201d <em>{People v Hoover, </em>37 AD3d 298, 299 [2007], <em>Iv denied </em>9 NY3d 845 [2007]). We do not find this to be an \u201cexceptional case\u201d warranting such an approach <em>{id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"Axjg\">We perceive no basis for a further reduction of the sentence beyond the relief already granted pursuant to the Drug Law Reform Act.
