The evidence submitted by the defendants established, prima facie, that the plaintiff was negligent as a matter of law, by violating Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7\u00a7 1143 and 1160 (e), in failing to yield the right of way to Hoffman, who, according to his deposition testimony, was proceeding straight ahead on North Ocean Avenue and traveling within the posted speed limit. A driver is not obligated to anticipate that a vehicle parked on the shoulder of a road will suddenly and unexpectedly move into a travel lane. Such an event constitutes a classic emergency situation, thus implicating the \u201cemergency doctrine\u201d (see <em>Gajjar v Shah, </em>31 AD3d 377, 378 [2006]). Hoffman\u2019s reaction\u2014staying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>in his own lane and applying his brakes\u2014was reasonable as a matter of law under the circumstances, which were not of his own making <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The evidence submitted by the plaintiff in opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion failed to raise a triable issue of fact <em>(id.). </em>The fact that the plaintiff suffered from amnesia does not compel a different result. The plaintiff submitted medical evidence establishing that, as a result of the injuries sustained in the accident, she suffered from retrograde amnesia and had no recollection of the events leading up to the accident. The only passenger in the plaintiffs car likewise stated in an affidavit that he recalled nothing from the time that he entered the motor vehicle until after the collision. Although a plaintiff who suffers amnesia as a result of a defendant\u2019s act is not held to as high a degree of proof in demonstrating his or her right to recover for injury as a plaintiff who can describe the events <em>(see Noseworthy v City of New </em>York, 298 NY 76 [1948]), he or she is not excused from the \u201cburden of demonstrating the existence of a triable issue of fact to avoid summary judgment\u201d <em>(Blanco v Oliveri, </em>304 AD2d 599, 600 [2003]). Here, the plaintiff failed to submit sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue of fact. Accordingly, the Supreme Court properly granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. Skelos, J.E, Ritter, Garni and Dickerson, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
