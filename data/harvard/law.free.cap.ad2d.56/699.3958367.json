Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying his request for such a charge <em>(see People v Butts, </em>72 NY2d 746, 748-750 [1988]; <em>People v Tucker, </em>33 AD3d 635 [2006]; <em>People v Caicedo, </em>234 AD2d 379 [1996]).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">The defendant contends that he was deprived of his right to a fair trial by testimony that improperly suggested he intimidated a prosecution witness and a potential witness. However, any error was harmless, as there was overwhelming evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, and no significant probability that the alleged error contributed to his conviction <em>(see People v Crimmins, </em>36 NY2d 230 [1975]; <em>People v Williams, </em>56 AD3d 700 [2008] [decided herewith]).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>The contention raised in point I of the defendant\u2019s supplemental pro se brief is unpreserved for appellate review and, in any event, is without merit, and the contention raised in point II of the defendant\u2019s supplemental pro se brief is without merit. Mastro, J.E, Rivera, Covello and Leventhal, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
