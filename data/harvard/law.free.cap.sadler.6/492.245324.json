J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-5\">It appears by the answer of the sheriff, that on the 25th day of March last he had in his hands three executions against E. J. Beyer, in pursuance of which he levied upon the personal property of the defendant. Execution No. 5 was issued upon a judgment confessed by the defendant to P. M. Dietrich in trust for the wife of the defendant; No. 6 was upon a judgment confessed to G. P. Dietrich, and No. 7 upon a judgment in favor of Stephen Smith, upon whose application and affidavit this rule was granted. The execution in favor of Mrs. Beyer was placed in the hands of the sheriff at 2 o\u2019clock p. m. of the 20th day of' March. That of Dietrich was placed in his hands one hour later, and that of Stephen Smith five days afterwards. All were levied on the same property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Before sale, which took place on the 31st day of March following the levy, the attorney for Stephen Smith gave a written notice to the sheriff requiring him to pay the proceeds of the sale into court to await the disposition of the same by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-4\">On the second day of April, the court being then in session, this rulo was obtained on application as before stated. The return day of the several writs was the 24th day of May, more than seven weeks after the day of sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-5\">In his answer the sheriff states that he sold the property levied upon for the sum of $2,866.15, and that, after deducting costs, he applied to the execution of Mrs. Beyer the sum of $1,398.98, and paid the same to her attorney; and the balance of the money to wit: $1,228.68, he applied on execution of G. P. Dietrich, taking upon himself the responsibility of making distribution of the proceeds of the sale as he believed he had a right to do; the notice given him not specifying any reason why he should have the money before the court, the questions raised by the facts are:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-6\">First. Whether, under the circumstances, the assumption of the responsibility by the sheriff, and the distribution of the fund as made by him, have placed him beyond the reach of the rule to bring the money before the court; and,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-7\">Second. If not, whether the case as presented is a proper one for the interference of the court by a rule for that purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-8\">The 41st section of the act of June 16, 1836, in regard to \u25a0executions, provides that on sale of personal estate the sheriff shall make return of his proceedings to the court according to the command of the writ. The several writs in the hands of the sheriff commanded him to have the moneys before the court on the fourth Monday of May, 1886.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-9\">\u201cForms of writs,\u201d said Marshall, C. J., in Turner v. Fendal], 1 Cranch, 136, 2 L. ed. 60, \u201cfurnish strong evidence of what was the law when they were devised, and the duty of the officer to whom they are directed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-10\">In McDonald v. Todd, 1 Grant Cas. 18, Gibson, J., said, in reference to payments by the sheriff: \u201cIn order to prevent delay and save the expense of cumbrous forms it has been usual, where the right to the money is not disputed, to pay it immediately to the creditor supposed to be entitled to it, and to retain the exe\u25a0eu tion. In such a case, however, the payment is private, unofficial, and informal; and when the sheriff has departed from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>line prescribed by his writ, he acts on his own responsibility. He discards its authority which consequently gives no further stamp to his act. In regard to acts without the pale of it, he can neither be protected nor prejudiced by it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-4\">The practice of allowing the sheriff to pay over the money directly to the plaintiff is a permissive departure from the command of the writ. The right of the sheriff, therefore, to pay the money to the party, out of court, is not at this day to be questioned; but it by no means follows that the court has lost the-power of compelling its officers to obey the commands of its process. It cannot be doubted that the court has the right, whenever application is made for the purpose and a proper case stated, to compel the sheriff to bring' the money into court. If the court has not this power, executions instead of being the end of the law will, in many cases, be the commencement of a new series of suits and litigation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-5\">. The law upon this subject is pretty fully considered by B ogees, J., in Williams\u2019s Appeal, 9 Pa. 261. He says; \u201cNothing' in the law is surer than that a sheriff who undertakes of his own authority, merely, to distribute money levied under several executions before the return day of the writs, does so at his own risk. . . . The command of his writ is not to pay to the plaintiffs, but to bring the money into court on the return day. I am aware that in practice the sheriff usually assumes the responsibility of disbursing the fund raised by execution, without the intervention of the court; and where there are no conflicting pretensions to it, it is very well. Perhaps it is his duty to do so, and thus avoid the expense and delay incident to a payment into court. But this will not excuse him if he commit a blunder, though ever so unintentional. ... It is the duty of the sheriff to retain the money in his hands, in order to allow parties to apply to Hie court to set aside an execution which may be sued out for fraudulent purposes; and if the sheriff were not bound to retain the money, it might, in many instances, be mischievous.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-7\">If the sheriff lends his aid to one party and withholds it from another, he must stand or fall by the eventual rights of the party he preferred. He is not bound to try the question of fraud or decide which of the two creditors should have the preference, but he ought to stand indifferent between them and not lend himself to either. The junior execution creditor is entitled to time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>until the return day, to contest the right of the senior to the fund, and the sheriff cannot deprive him of it. by preferring another. Where there are several executions the sheriff cannot without peril pay any of the plaintiffs, except upon notice and by consent of the others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-3\">The same general view of the law is expressed by Paxson, J.,. in <em>Be </em>Bast\u00edan, 90 Pa. \u00e9l6, in these words: \u201cWhen parties are not satisfied for the sheriff to make distribution they can always prevent it by proper application to the court in seasonable time. But it comes too late when made long after the return of the writ and after the sheriff has in good faith applied the money to the liens.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-4\">In practice, the sheriff is not permitted to pay the money into the hands of the prothonotary without a special order of the court. If in all cases he might do so, the parties would be delayed and unnecessary expenses would be incurred. The writ does not command him to pay the money to the plaintiff nor to pay it into court, but to have it before the court. After the return day he may safely pay the plaintiff, according to the-priority of the execution, unless he has notice before that time that the right of the prior execution creditor to the fund will be contested. Marble Co. v. Burke, 5 W. N. C. 12d.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-5\">The several cases cited from the Weekly Notes, decided by the court in Philadelphia, refusing permission to the sheriff to pay money into court, do not go the length of holding that this may not be done in a proper ease; \u2014 the court reserving to itself to decide whether the circumstances presented in any case are such as seem to require that distribution should be made by it instead of the sheriff. In order to distribute, the court must have possession of the fund to be distributed; hence, the necessity of the sheriff\u2019s retaining the money until the junior creditor can have an opportunity of presenting the case to the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-6\">It is contended that as the sheriff believed he had the right to take the responsibility of paying out the money, it will be a hardship upon him if he is now required to bring the amount into court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-7\">To this it is a sufficient answer to say, in the language of- the court in Stebbins v. Walker, Id N. J. L. 90, 25 Am. Dec. 503: \u201cIf the conduct of the sheriff is <em>mala fi&amp;es, </em>or if with his eyes open, after notice, he pays over the money, the court will not stop to inquire whether he can get it back.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>In the ease in hand the notice given was in effect not to pay to the senior execution creditors. The writ commanded the sheriff to have the money before the court. The notice requested him not to make distribution; but he at once, on the very day of the sale and weeks before he was required to make return, and 'when he knew that the court would be in session within the next forty-eight hours, made what Judge Gibson calls a private unofficial application of the proceeds of the sale. In so doing he lent his aid to one party, to the prejudice of the other. The judgment against the defendant in favor of his wife may have been for a debt honestly due. Still between her and her husband\u2019s execution creditors the burden of proof would probably rest on her to show the bona fides of the transaction. However that may be, the sheriff should not so conduct the proceedings as to compel a creditor to resort to an action at law, without giving an opportunity to make an application to the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-4\">Whether the sheriff intended to lend his aid to one party, to the exclusion of the other or not, his acts had that effect. His assumption of responsibility cannot shield him in doing an irregular act, out of time, and to the prejudice of the rights of a creditor of the defendant. His hasty act in making the appropriation to the earlier writs in the face of notice not to do so seems to indicate an intention to aid the first execution creditors and prevent the junior execution creditor from invoking the power of the court to compel, in a summary manner, compliance with the mandate of the writ To hold otherwise than as above indicated would be to stultify ourselves, and to yield to our ministerial officers control over the process of court to an extent not contemplated by any statute nor sanctioned by any established practice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-5\">The amount of the execution of Stephen Smith is about $900. Payment into court of a sum equal to that debt and costs is all that need be required. As at present informed, an order to pay into court that sum will protect the rights of the applicant for this rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-6\">And now July 15, 1886, rule made absolute to the amount of $900; and it is ordered that James O. Frazier, sheriff, pay into the office of the prothonotary within twenty days the sum of $900, to abide the order of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-7\">The assignments of error specified the action of the court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>\u25a0making the rule absolute and subsequently issuing an attachment to enforce the decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b516-3\"><em>James Scarlet </em>and IF. <em>J.

The character of notice in this case falls short of every requirement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-6\">In Mathiews v. Webster, 7 W. N.

Disobedience to it is not one of the cases which the court could punish with contempt under the act of June 16, 1836. The court proceeds by motions, rules, and orders, and the practice in this case was for the attorney to obtain a rule. He could have done so by application, to the court in chambers. Tt would not issue, of course, for the court would only interfere upon special grounds shown. Dillon v. Conover, 2 W. N. C. 126; Bamum\u2019s Universal Exposition Co. v. O\u2019Brien, 7 W. N.

No. 18,056.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-10\">It is the duty of the sheriff to retain the money in his hands, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>in order to allow parties to apply to the court to set aside an execution, which may be sued out for fraudulent purposes.; and if the sheriff were not bound to retain the money, it might, in many instances, be mischievous. Warmoll v. Young, 5 Bam. &amp; 0.\" 660.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-3\">Where a sheriff has in his hands at the same time several executions against the same defendant, he cannot, without peril, pay to any of the plaintiffs before the return day, and perhaps some days after, except upon notice to and with the assent of the others. Williams\u2019s Appeal, 9 Pa. 26\u201c7.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-4\">The right of the sheriff to pay the money to the party, out of court, is not at this day to be questioned; but it by no means follows that the court has lost the power of compelling its officers to obey the command of its process. The court has the right, whenever application is made for that purpose, and a proper case stated, to compel the sheriff to bring the money into court. Stebbins v. Walker, 14 N. J. L. 90, 25 Am. Dec. 500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-5\">When parties are not satisfied for the sheriff to make distribution, they can always prevent it by a proper application to the. court in seasonable time. <em>Be </em>Bast\u00edan, 90 Pa. 476.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-6\">A sheriff is not liable to an attachment as for a contempt, in not paying into court the money made upon an execution levied upon real estate, where he has, in good faith, after the return \u25a0day, and without notice of any opposing claim, applied the money to the liens. Franklin Twp. v. Osier, 91 Pa. 162.,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-7\">These are the cases the gentlemen rely upon to decide that the court had no power to order into court money raised by the sheriff upon executions, where the application for such order was made two days after the sale, and more than six weeks before the return day of the writ, and where notice that the court would be asked to interfere was given to the sheriff before the \u2022sale. Neither the cases cited nor any which the gentlemen could cite decided any such thing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-8\">Our position, and the one sustained by all the authorities, is -that until the return day of the writ, the court has full power \u25a0on the presentation of a proper case to direct the distribution \u00abof the proceeds of a sheriff\u2019s sale thereon; but that after the return day, and where tire sheriff has had no previous notice of a contest, he may pay out the money, taking the risk of a wrong \u25a0payment; but in such ease the court has no power to control by attachment. It is in such case only that the court says that \u2022contempt of court is not one of the risks that the sheriff incurs.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Notwithstanding the able argument of the counsel for the appellant, we think the conclusion of the learned judge is well sustained by his opinion filed on making the rule absolute; and \u2022on that opinion the decree is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Decree affirmed, and appeal dismissed, at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
