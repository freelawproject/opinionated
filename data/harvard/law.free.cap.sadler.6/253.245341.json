The ward was then a witness, and testified in behalf of the guardian, expressing a willingness that his guardian should be paid for his care and support. On his deathbed, only twenty-nine days before he would have attained his majority, he expressed to his neighbors and former companions a desire to live only until he could, according to law, settle with his grandfather, and allow him his entire estate for his kindness toward him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-3\">The mother of the boy married in 1869 and left the child wholly with .his grandfather, but now seeks to acquire all of the pension money which was received for the child during his last illness. The entire estate consists of pension money received from 1867 to 1882 at the rate of $10 per month and $100 bounty. When this case was before us in 1882 it presented features entirely different from those presented now. Then the evidence exhibited the ward as a stout, healthy, lazy boy, indulged by his grandparents in idleness and general vagabondage, and we refused to make any allowance for such care and support. Now, however, the evidence clearly shows that the child, although large, was weak and sickly, unable to work and carrying with him inherited and rapidly developing seeds of consumption, of which he died. Under all the circumstances we cannot now say that the guardian did anything but his duty in smoothing the brief pathway of this youth to the grave.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-4\">Perhaps no one who has never had the experience can appreciate the task and burden of nursing the sick, especially with such a disease as this was, and perhaps no one ever desires to use money for any purpose more than to be indulged and favored and watched under such circumstances. The entire fund added up in a column looks large, but when our view of the case is taken $10 per month looks small enough for the care and support of this boy under all the circumstances, during all the years and especially the last two or three of his life.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-5\">We do not balance the legal authorities, for they are all based upon a different state of facts. We can only say that in our judgment justice between the parties can only be done according to law by allowing the guardian the entire fund received by him for his ward for support of the child, his expenses in securing the fund, and his settling the account We, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>enter judgment that there is nothing due either the ward\u2019s estate or the guardian. The guardian must pay the cost of this proceeding, for not keeping an account and for not having the. court adjust the matter of allowance in the start or having some express agreement with the mother.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-4\">The assignments of error specified the action of the court in holding generally as matter of fact that the child, although large, was weak and sickly, unable to work and that the guardian did his duty; in holding as matter of law that the guardian was entitled to the entire fund received by him for his ward for support of the child and his expenses in securing the fund and settling the account; in not sustaining the exceptions filed to the said guardian\u2019s account before confirmation of the same; and in entering judgment that there is nothing due the ward\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b272-5\"><em>John Lynch </em>and <em>L. A. Lynch, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ag9\">\u2014 The guardian stood <em>in loco parentis </em>to his ward, and therefore cannot legally charge for his support.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-6\">The ward earned his support while living with his guardian, who therefore cannot charge for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-7\">In Seibert\u2019s Appeal, 19 Pa. 49, it is held that \u201cif a testator, by benevolent manifestations, may put himself <em>in loco parentis, </em>so as to entitle a stranger to maintenance, much slighter circumstances will bring the case of a grandchild within that rule.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-8\">In Duffey v. Duffey, 44 Pa. 399, a daughter of the plaintiff died leaving children. Three of them, being very young, were taken from the funeral to their grandparent\u2019s home. Their father married again and died four years after. The grandparent presented a bill of $690 for boarding and clothing of the children. The court held that he could not recover; that a grandfather is liable to relieve and maintain his destitute grandchildren when their necessities require it, and that their relationship excludes the implication of a promise to pay him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-9\">In Douglas\u2019s Appeal, 82 Pa. 169, it was held that where a stepfather takes his stepdaughter to live with him as one of his family, he is not entitled to be repaid for expenditures made for her during her minority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-10\">In Brown\u2019s Appeal, 112 Pa. 18, 5 Atl. 13, the guardian received pension money for his ward and paid it, under advice of counsel and a special contract, to the stepfather of his ward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>for support; and it was held that he could not be surcharged with the amount so paid the stepfather. But in the case at bar there was not only no such contract, but such a distinct understanding between the mother aud the grandfather as precludes any presumption of compensation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-4\">In Kuckman\u2019s Appeal, 61 Pa, 251, it was held that to recover for maintenance after the death of the ward, the stepfather must prove a contract with the ward\u2019s guardian.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-5\">In Horton\u2019s Appeal, 94 Pa. 62, the ward was a niece of the wife of guardian and lived with him. She worked for him, and he boarded, clothed, and schooled her as one of his own children. There was no contract, and the court held that the guardian was not entitled to a credit in his account for support,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-6\">In Beam\u2019s Appeal, 96 Pa. 74, the guardian was an undo (by marriage) of two wards, and charged in his account $2 per week for board, in all $557. The court disallowed the claim, because of the relationship and the fact that they were members of his family.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-7\">Suppose the situation were reversed and the mother was a claimant for the services of her boy, against the grandfather, for wages earned as a servant; the court would promptly defeat such a claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-8\">In the case of Lantz v. Prey, 14 Pa. 201, it was held that a female living with her stepfather, while in her minority, is not entitled, after arriving at full age, to recover from him wages for services rendered, without proof of a contract express or implied. Such a contract will not be implied as to one standing <em>in loco parenlisj </em>merely from the fact of such service having been performed. Patton v. Conn, 114 Pa. 183, 6 Atl. 468; Walls\u2019 Appeal, 111 Pa. 460, 56 Am. Hep. 288, 5 Atl. 220; 2 Kent, Com,; Cummings v. Ciunmings, 8 Watts, 3'66; Defrance v. Austin, 9 Pa. 309; Candor\u2019s Appeal, 5 Watts &amp; S. 513; Smith v. Milligan, 43 Pa, 107.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b273-9\">If it was necessary to expend the money for the support and care of the ward, it was the duty of the guardian to follow the act of assembly, particularly when he was aided by counsel from the inception of this trust. It matters little to an orphan child whether his intereste are sacrificed and his prospects blighted, by well-meaning ignorance or by wilful malice. Either is within the definition of misconduct, a v?ord which applies not to the motive but the act. Act March 29, 1832 (P. L. 192) ; Nichol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>son\u2019s Appeal, 20 Pa. 54; Walls\u2019 Appeal, 104 Pa. 15; Pennock\u2019s Estate, 32 Phila. Leg. Ini 169; 2 Phone, Orphans\u2019 Court, Pr. 237, pi. 12, 13, 15.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-4\">The attempt to conclude the mother and heir of the ward\u2019s estate, because of an alleged assignment and will in favor of the guardian, cannot, of course, prevail. They were both executed at the same time, and but a few days before the ward\u2019s death, when he was not of age, and was weak in mind, and destitute of all information about his estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-5\">The fact that the ward was induced to execute the papers in question is a strong circumstance, showing that he did not comprehend the condition of the estate according to the guardian\u2019s account, and that he at least believed there was something due him. Act April 8, 1833, P. L. 249, \u00a7 3; Wills\u2019s Appeal, 22 Pa. 325; Eberts v. Eberts, 55 Pa. 110; Banter\u2019s Appeal, 62 Pa. 318; Milligan\u2019s Appeal, 82 Pa, 389.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-6\">Acquiescence in, or acknowledgment of, the invalid act cannot be invested with greater vigor than the deed itself by which the act was done. The policy of the law which denies the capacity to do the act as clearly denies the capacity to confirm it, except in the legal mode. If, through the administration of equity, we can produce a result which the law denies <em>ab initio </em>on grounds of public policy, then estoppel or compensation, its equitable equivalent, will accomplish what the law and policy have forbidden.

Bedford, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AO-N\">\u2014 Seibert\u2019s Appeal, 19 Pa. 53, only decided that a legacy to a grandchild, payable at twenty-one years, carried interest needed for his support meantime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-8\">Duffey v. Duffey, 44 Pa. 399, was a suit by a grandfather against the father for support of the latter\u2019s children. No contract or even request on the part of the father was shown, and no claim was made until after the father\u2019s death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-9\">In Douglas\u2019s Appeal, 82 Pa. 169, it was shown that the ward performed \u201ca good deal of work,\u201d and it did not appear that the guardian stepfather was of insufficient ability.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-10\">Brown\u2019s Appeal, 112 Pa. 18, 5 Atl. 13, upon its reasoning, as well as the conclusion reached, is an authority in our favor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-11\">In Ruckman\u2019s Appeal, 61 Pa. 251, it did not appear that the stepfather was unable to afford the support.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-12\">In Horton\u2019s Appeal, 94 Pa. 62, it was shown that the guard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>ian frequently declared that he had taken his ward as one of his own children and would treat her as such, and that he did not want anyone to send her to school. It was also shown that the ward was healthy and performed regular services, and it was further found as a fact by the examiner that the ward was eligible to admission to the school for soldiers\u2019 orphans. Added to this the guardian was of sufficient ability.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-4\">In Beam\u2019s Appeal, 96 Pa. 74, it was found as matter of fact that \u201cthe services of the ward were the equivalent of the board charged.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-5\">In Nicholson\u2019s Appeal, 20 Pa. 54, the maternal relatives offered to maintain the minors free of all expense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-6\">Walls\u2019 Appeal, 104 Pa. 15, is not in point. It only held guardian liable to account notwithstanding lapse of time, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-7\">As to the suggestion that \u201cif the situation was reversed and the mother was a claimant for the services of her boy, against the grandfather, the court would promptly defeat such claim,\u201d it is sufficient to. say that the cases cited on the question were all actions at law dependent on contract, and moreover the support and care of the infant in almost every instance, as in the present, were more than equivalent to the services claimed for. On the other hand the authorities are abundant in favor of the decree appealed from.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-8\">In <em>Re </em>Harland, 5 Eawle, 323, it is said: Ohancery will allow even for past maintenance, where the father was not of competent ability.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-9\">In Strawbridge\u2019s Appeal, 5 Whart 568, a mother was allowed in settlement of her account for support of her minor son during sixteen years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-10\">In Dawes v. Howard, 4 Mass. 97, a father was allowed for support of his children, he being of little property, although he made no charge against them and manifested no intention of doing so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-11\">In Brown\u2019s Appeal, 112 Pa. 18, 5 Atl. 13, a stepfather was allowed for support of a minor child in addition to use of real estate, and although the minor did chores, etc. The question was on the reasonableness of the guardian\u2019s agreement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-12\">In Pennock\u2019s Estate, 11 Phila. 75, a mother was allowed for past support, the court saying that it may ratify what it might direct, and will authorize a reimbursement for expenses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-13\">In Longaker\u2019s Appeal, 36 Phila. Leg. Int. 73, it was said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>that when the amount paid for maintenance or education of minors is within such limits as ought to have been decreed upon application, it will be allowed on settlement of the account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-3\">In Simon\u2019s Estate, 42 Phila. Leg. Int. 445, a guardian was allowed on the settlement of his account for support of his ward, although no previous order for maintenance had been made by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-4\">In Selleck\u2019s Appeal, 42 Phila. Leg. Int. 456, 16 W. N. C. 820, it was held: (1) The absence of an order of court making</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-5\">an allowance for the support of a ward will not prevent the court from making a proper allowance upon the settlement of the guardian\u2019s account when the circumstances require it. (2) The pension when granted related to and was paid from the death of the father. There is no legal objection, therefore, to making the allowance extend backward to the beginning of the pension, if the real needs of the ward require or justify it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-6\">From these authorities it is manifest that where one even stands <em>in loco parenlis </em>and is of insufficient means, he will be allowed for the support of his ward, whether or not he manifested any previous intention to charge for it, and whether he applied originally to have an allowance fixed by the court in advance, or claims the same upon the settlement of his account. Indeed, in a case like the present one it would be impossible to fix in advance a proper allowance, for neither the court nor the guardian could anticipate the prolonged illness of the ward, wearying alike to him and to those who had the care of him.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b276-7\">Per Curiam:</author>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">We discover nothing in this record which demands a reversal of the decree.
